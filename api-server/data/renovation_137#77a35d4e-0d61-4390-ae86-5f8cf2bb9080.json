comp night I still have the right to be comfortable my room was located on the second floor and they did not have any other rooms available but the handicap Meaning that I did not have a standard bathtub but a stand up shower I felt guilty because I really thought that I should have waited to receive another room but it was already 4 pm and she told me since it was a holiday she was not sure on how long it was going to take to turn over rooms My room was located on the second floor before you entered the spa Seminole Hard Rock is doing with inflation I was quite surprised to see that the spa was located on a that floor and not in the lobby areas The room was very clean but it had a very loud bleach smell housekeeping was extremely nice she greeted me and made sure that I had everything I need it around 7 pm I noticed that my room thermometer was reading 75 so it was extremely stuffy and uncomfortable I called the front desk to report my issue and maintenance was up within 5 minutes he set the temperature to 65 but it never went any lower than 73 I would have been okay with that because I thought I could have opened the window but since I was on the second floor I did not have access to open a window on top of that the room next to me was arguing and I heard security knock on the door a few times I have plenty of options meaning I could have requested another room or I could have checked out because I am only 15 minutes away from the hotel but since this was a comp stay and the beds are quite comfortable I decided to stay until 1030 If this would have been an out of pocket purchase things would have went quite differently on my end"], ["2018-12-28", "b2c73e71-1931-47c5-b30f-0623ce01950a", "['lot', 'reconstruction', 'go']", "Lots of reconstruction going
