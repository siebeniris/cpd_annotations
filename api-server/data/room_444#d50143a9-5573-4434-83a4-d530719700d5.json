with my family there were six of us including my grandchildren ranging in age from 913and 16 and we all agreed that there was something for everybody the childrens club was outstanding and the pools and sea were fantastic I especially loved the overhanging trees at the beach for shade where we could spot the birds and monkeys and all needs were attended to by the excellent staff so friendly and nothing too much trouble some of the restaurants were good but others disappointing due to long waits for service I found the breakfast and polside Resturant the best apart from two beach buffet evening meals that were superb the rooms were excellent and cold water delivered to the room constantly all the trips out of the Hotel were amazing and well organized and a good way to see other areas of Costa Rica"], ["2015-01-24", "270f8161-e820-4ea4-899a-b61660324fb5", "['veronica', 'room', 'attendant', 'go', 'provide', 'four', 'seasons', 'experience']", "Veronica our room attendant went above
