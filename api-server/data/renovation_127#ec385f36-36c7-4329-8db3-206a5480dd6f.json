the pool ladder is super slippery the floor was dirty nobody washed themselves before going into the pool also no compulsory sign anywhere and the feet cleaning zone pond before entering the pool area was filthy the building itself outside is severely damaged by the proximity of the sea blocks of wall missing and lack of care the window frames are ugly and date back to 30 years ago at least I hated
