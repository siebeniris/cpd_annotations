main roadThe hotel is clean and friendly the rooms are of a good size and found the beds comfortable The housekeeping did a good job every day In the lobby they have 24hr coffee which is handy and the breakfast is of standard hotel fare although they did keep the breakfast area very clean and tidyThe wifi was a good connection but unles you are a hilton honors member i believe you can only have 2 devices connected so it might be worth joining beforehand if this is going to cause any issues All in all a positive experience from start to finish"], ["2015-09-08",
