had been a mistake and it was booked as doubles and they would rectify straight away and I should be able to proceed with online check in When this was not the case I phones back again and was told not to worry Is was a system glitch and when I arrive in the day they would make sure check in was quick and easy The day came and we went to check in only to find there was no twin rooms left I was furious and explained that I had been on the phone 3 times to make sure I had twin rooms the embarrassing conflict happened in front of ques of people at the check in desk and I felt really
