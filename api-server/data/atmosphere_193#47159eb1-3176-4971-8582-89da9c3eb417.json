booked for and it was very clear we had a wheelchair and 5 people then we head down to fix the issue very respectful ask for them to fix it and they could not until the next day so my daughter had to sleep on the floor and keep in mind my daughter is in a wheelchair that will explain why we booked the big room to begin with then the wrong room we had to sleep in for the night was so dirty and keep in mind I am not a crybaby and never have to complain I was a hotel bed and breakfast manager for many years so I know how hard it is but our room was very dirty and did not smell clean when we walked in trash was left on the bottom counter in the bathroom and there was dirt and hair all over the counters and floors then i went to lay down only to find the night stand headboards lamps and all cover with heavy dust I did take video and pictures of all of it the hotel itself is looking very worn down and old dirty"], ["2020-03-02", "572bf2c1-c6bf-44a8-9dba-662e349fcfce", "['room', 'service',
