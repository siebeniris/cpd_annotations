Our last visit to Shangri La was wonderful from start to finish we received an upgraded suite and were treated like royalty. This time we did not expect another upgrade but the room we were allocated was far from perfect. There were renovations going on which is acceptable. but not if I have spent a lot on a luxury room with a view of the swimming pool and received a standard room with a view over rooftops. The charge for breakfast was taken off the bill as a result but all in all I will probably look for a different luxury hotel next time I am in Singapore it was not a great experience.", "offset": [140, 236], "date": "2017-04-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "1c13e80c-b560-4087-a97d-000fecd2651b", "sentence": "Our room was a little smaller than we expected and the bathtub made some loud noice when it was filled with water.

When we checked in our connecting rooms were only set up for 4 people. 4 towels no children sized robes no children sized slippers no kids amenities. And when we first spoke to the hotel about it Shangri La kept insisting that it was our travel agent who made the mistake. They sent me the correspondence. It definitely was not my travel agents fault. Other comments no newspapers in the morning check in took FOREVER and no introduction to kids facilities at all only realised there was an outdoor pirate ship as we were leaving the hotel. I found a crawling insect in my bathroom The clock in my kids room was not working Breakfast buffet on Saturday was a total nightmare. I was looking after 3 kids by myself and the waiter told me to go and get my own food. In the end they got me some water but it took almost 15 minutes. Then I decided to get breakfast in the room for the next two days and on check out was told that breakfast in the room was not included in my package. Really not very happy with Shang. On the plus sides location was great. Amazing play room. Some of the staff were very nice.

Hi must admit. this review would have been a lot lower if it were not for 2 staff the doorman assistant front of house manger the replied to my concerns. My experiences at the Shanghai La in Sydney have always been great but the hotel in Singapore was terrible. So why a 4 star \u201c Very good \u201d rating because of the final two touch points from the hotel were \u201c Very God\u201d. Let me explain the doorman who was fetching our final taxi for us was the only person in the last two days that showed any empathy he apologised provided great service and made the whole family feel a little better thank you. The last touchpoint was from the response from a email complaint I followed up with citing all the issues. This email was also dealt with quickly and sincerely and I thank the duty manager for his response. This shows that the hotel management do want the right thing to happen just all the staff need to embrace the management direction every minute every day.

We have been visiting Singapore for several years and have stayed in various 5 star hotels. This time we stayed at the Shangri La for 7 days. Apart from the facilities which include a great pool gym lovely gardens marvellous breakfasts the highlight for us was the staff. The service was flawless on all fronts despite the fact that the hotel was packed during the National Day weekend. The staff have been well trained and have managed to achieve a balance between being professional and yet warm and friendly. They try their best to help.

Also in general the incidental prices are unreasonably expensive. I consider myself to be financially comfortable but I know when mark up pricing is out of control.
