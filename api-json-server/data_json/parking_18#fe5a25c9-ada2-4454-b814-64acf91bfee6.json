Be sure to get a room that has been r I have stayed here a number of times and really was impressed with the rooms. However during this stay I was booked into room 132. This room had a king size bed that was like sleeping on a ski slope. The tile in the bathroom was disgusting looked filthy. The TV is in an armoire that sits directly in front of the most uncomfortable couch I have ever sat on. I am disabled though not in a wheelchair I asked for a room near the parking lot so that unpacking my car would not be so grueling and punishing on my knee and back. This room was as far away from the parking lot as possible. There is no one to help with luggage and only two luggage cartsLast but not least is the restaurant Whispers. This is not a normal restaurant by any means. The food is barely edible the hours are insane. Closed from 11 6. And the room service prices are horrendous. On one of my last days there the coffee maker in the room stopped working. I called room service to order a pot of coffee and they wanted to charge me 180. Thankfully the staff were very kind and offered to make a cup of coffee for 20 if I would pick it up.", "offset": [410, 575], "date": "2015-08-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "0921defc-8c20-467e-995b-9136dbcd988b", "sentence": "Clean room but do not plan on taking a shower.

My husband has very short hair veteran and he had trouble rinsing his hair.

For that purpose it was great the drive to the airport at 6 am was quick. However the hotel stay was very disturbing. When I arrived in the evening there was a man at the pool that appeared to be passed out after using drugs. In the morning he was still there. I opened the window in my room and then realized there was a sign on the window warning of a health advisory to keep the window closed. Very odd.

The lobby of this Ramada was clean bright and shiny. it was very welcoming. The staff at the front desk throughout my stay were friendly personable and most professional. The grounds of this Ramada were full of lovely flowering plants and trees. The location of this Ramada from the Burbank Airport was ideal and as it turned out just 8 miles from where I needed to be. THE CONDITION OF THE ROOM FRIGHTENING SITUATION IN THE RAMADA PARKING AREAI was quite disappointed with the overall condition of the Ramada room. To begin with the furnishings were disheveled and worn. The curtains sagged terribly. The floor lamp was noticeably bent and the two remaining lamps did not match or have adequate lampshades. There were gaping nail holes flaws with the old wallpaper fixed with yellowing tape and old VISIBLE stains and such on the walls. The bed was worn out. if ya can hear the bed coils creaking and squeaking it is not going to make for a restful sleep. The A C had two settings all or nothing. The water did not flow from the sink faucet but was instead a harsh spray. What appeared to be a new coffee maker did not work. I went to the front desk to report this hoping to secure a cup of coffee in the lobby. There was not any available but for 20 I could get a cup from the adjoining cafe OR wait for a serviceman to bring a new coffee maker to the room. Providing a simple cup of coffee to a guest 20 minutes prior to checking out seems like priceless PR. AND lastly there was an incident with a very drunk and very aggressive man in their parking lot when returning from dinner approximately 9 pm 42417. This man was verbally abusing every individual he encountered including children. When my daughter confronted him about his foul mouth and the children nearby he then turned his attention solely to my adult daughter threatening her verbally and physically. My daughter called the police. I proceeded to the front desk and told them they needed to get security out to the parking lot ASAP. We then proceeded to the room and have no idea if Ramadas security arrived on the scene or not. However 2 officers from the Burbank Police Dept did come to the room for further details of the incident and the individual that had gotten drunk at the Ramada restaurant.", "offset": [1505, 1653], "date": "2017-04-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "4645d656-4b34-4302-a903-96fc842ea5d6", "sentence": "Disappointing.
