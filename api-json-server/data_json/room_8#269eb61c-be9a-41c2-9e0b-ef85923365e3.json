The hotel provides some toiletries and plenty of towels and facecloths often unavailable in European hotels.

My view on the 2nd floor was to \u201c nothing \u201d or rather some tubes of the micro internal courtyard. Not much light could come in. The bathroom was quite big especially the shower albeit with the curtain clean but really large to avoid that it sticks to you or that you flood the floor.

The hotel had a fitness room one of the bigger ones and quite well equiped for those seen in hotels.

We stayed in a business deluxe room which provides extra space with double bed which was a king sized bed. We stayed in room 209.

But do not Expect UK Radison Blu Standards. First Room Offered Was Dreadful. We were spending a week in Reykjavik and I choose Radison Blu hotel because I had such fantastic experiences in the UK and as it was for our Silver Wedding Anniversary I had upgraded to a Double Deluxe room. When we arrived at aprox 100 we were booked into Room 304 that was anything but Deluxe dirty walls grimey surrounds where pictures once hung badly broken and dangerously so toilet seat long narrow room single wardrobe not what I was expecting from a Radison. I complained and initially the young guy on reception said there were no other rooms available. I persisted and showed him pictures of the Double Deluxe rooms that were on the website and mentioned that room 304 bore no resemblance to the pictures. I will talk to the Manager later said he. No you will not said I I want to be moved. My persistence worked and he eventually I got shown around a few other rooms before choosing Room 509. Room 509 was a much bigger room on the top floor with big double wardrobe and just felt and looked cleaner and tidier with the walls obviously having a much fresher lick of paint than Room 304 and we were then settled for a wonderful week in Reykjavik.

We booked this hotel through an agent when planning our trip to Iceland. It was not the first choice but we were assigned this unit after the first choice turned out to be overboked. The Radison Blu 1919 is close to all center city restaurants the city government waterfront and the Harpa Concert Hall. The staff here is very friendly and helpful from the front desk to the restaurant and to the housekeeping team. We only used the restaurant for the daily breakfast which has many choices but lacked enough cereal choices. Oatmeal or a wider variety of cold cereals would be great. The scrambled eggs were made from a powdered or commercial version of egg beaters so if you like an egg pick the hardboiled or ask to have some eggs prepared. They make omelets and fry eggs on request. If you take any of the tour buses be prepared to walk a few blocks to the stops. The same goes for Airport Buses. Even the service vans can not enter the area around the center city hotels. The final comment is the room itself. The twin beds were not that. They were very narrow like a well padded cot or day bed. The room was compact little closet space armchairs were very uncomfortable and flimsy. Although the beds were firm enough the narrow width made it difficult to turn when sleeping. It was labeled a deluxe double when we booked and hardly fit the name. Another issue is the bath. The tub is a deep tub which makes it somewhat difficult to enter for a shower or bath. Only one grab bar could be a problem for someone. The tub also has no anti slip decals texture or a tub mat to keep from slipping.

The hotel is kind of a square doughnut type shape and our room was facing inwards so we had no view apart from rooms facing us. Not a problem for us but if you want one of the outside ones then you get the option of a superior room option which one assumes would include an exterior view. We stayed on a B B basis. The breakfast was great you can help yourself to cooked items fabulous bacon cereals fruit continental juices fish etc loads of choice and as much as you like. Would highly recommend and would stay here again.", "offset": [332, 459], "date": "2020-03-10", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}]}
