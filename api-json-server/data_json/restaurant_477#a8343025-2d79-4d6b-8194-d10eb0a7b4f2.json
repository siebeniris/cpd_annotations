I was really hoping that all the talk of construction and customer service were not true before my visit. However upon arrival I realized how bad this place truly is. First we arrived via taxi and there was not a single person at the drive or door or the steps we lifted our suitcases up to. Great welcome. Second the behind the scenes staff are so delightful and friendly maids maintenance pool cleaners however the customer facing employees are horrible. The hostess at the breakfast is angry and half asleep the front desk staff are impolite and not helpful and the concierge staff are just wrong and should not be part of the customer service profession. Third I tried multiple times to call the property to make reservations for dinners and NOT ONCE did the concierge desk answer the phone. As we arrived there was only 1 restaurant open for us on the night we wanted and the only available time was 930 pm. More on this later. Next at the pool area there is more broken at this hotel than working. No fun no dancing no working whirlpool no people bringing you drinks nothing. The whirlpool hot tub never worked all 4 days and the staff lied to me repeatedly telling me I just needed to turn it on or it will be fixed tomorrow. All untrue and given the chilly temperatures at night this would have been a nice. I never had the chance. Because there are day pass guests the staff is also very strict about towels and you often wait in line at the towel counter while they painstakingly check the roster of your towel usage. Next do not plan to use any of your smart devices around the pool or in your room. There is WiFi in the lobby but the internet for your room is via network cable attached to your phone. For our big dinner our nice night out was at Nikei the Asian Fusion place onsite. We waited 10 minutes for our 930 pm reservation although the place was very empty. Next the drinks we ordered never came until we asked 3 times. And then to cap it all off the tepanyanki items we wanted to order were not available outside of the 630 and 830 seating times. I almost flipped. The staff was not even apologetic or anything. I would have stormed out except for the fact we had waited until 930 to have dinner and were starving by this point. Just rude. just like the concierge person who did not tell me about this. And finally I tweeted the hotel brand and challenged them to \u201c to do anything to make my stay here more memorable \u201d. Nothing. Not even a reply or a kind word. This turned out to be the only memorable thing about my stay. I will say the only 2 nice things about our stay were the view from our room and the friendly maid staff on the 7th floor. My wife and I were able to relax share some good times and enjoy the sun. Apart from that stay clear of this place and island mentality of happy faces but poor customer service. They have forever tarnished the Melia brand as well and I will never reconsider them for any of my corporate events. I mentioned all of this to the front desk manager upon checkout and she apologized and gave me Jacob LeBlanc\u2018s card the hotel general manager. there is nothing like leaving a resort with your blood pressure higher than when you arrived.", "offset": [494, 695], "date": "2015-02-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "528059f0-04c1-4272-8ea6-07605af90df4", "sentence": "Awful from the moment we arrived. I \u2019ve been to the Bahamas several times. Have been to all inclusive resorts there as well as other locations in the Caribbean. So I felt I knew what I should or should n\u2019t expect. This place was just awful. It laterally started the moment we arrived. There were only 2 people on line to check in ahead of us. Great. Well still took over 20 minutes til it was our turn. I was thinking that maybe I was just feeling impatient after traveling. But a few minutes later another guest lost his temper and started yelling for service. He pointed out that there were only 2 people working at the desk that had 5 stations. So it was n\u2019t just me. And we found out why it took so long to check each guest in. Despite all the decisions you \u2019ve already made and that you \u2019ve already determined your budget and paid for everything up front they try to up sell everything they can. We were told we could have a better section for X amount or a better floor for Y amount etc. So if all these are better than what I got what the heck did I get for my thousands of dollars. We made it through all the negotiations and headed to our room. We \u2019ve always taken our own luggage because there \u2019s just no reason not to. It \u2019s quicker and easier. Well the porters insisted on \u201c helping \u201d. It was a week ago and I \u2019m surprised I \u2019m not still waiting for him. He finally arrives same floor as the desk and he had a cart so ca n\u2019t understand why he moved like he was carrying a sofa on his back up 4 flights of stairs. Since he was there we asked him to give us a quick orientation to the room. I was opening doors and had to ask \u201c where \u2019s the fridge \u201d. I was told there was none. But I could have one for an extra cost. Oh thank goodness. It had been nearly 10 mins since the last proposed up sell. So not even a fridge in which we could store leftovers or whatever. But more significantly this is a serious encroachment on the All Inclusivenes. No mini bar. So if we want to have a drink on the balcony we have to go down to the bar get it and come back. My experience has been that an all inclusive resort will have in each room a small fridge with snacks beer soda and mixers. Then have assorted liquor in dispensers. The next question was what was the password for the WiFi. Oh there \u2019s no WiFi in the room. We were told there was. Oh no there is \u201c internet but it is wired \u201d. Huh. Ca n\u2019t plug an Ethernet cable into a phone or tablet. Alright let \u2019s move on. We unpack and head out to check out the resort. We came across a bar at which we could get a drink. There was no one else there so we were able to order right away. And again it \u2019s amazing we \u2019re not still sitting there \u2013 it took that long. I do n\u2019t want to repeat this a thousand times. So let me just say that every single solitary aspect of the service was insanely slow. Several of the restaurants were closed. They only open each one a couple days a week. So what you get is not always your first choice. The first night we had to eat the \u201c The Market Place \u201d the buffet. I hate buffets. If I want to serve myself I can stay home. Buffet food is always of lesser quality. But this was even less than most buffets. The food was often cold. Pans that were empty took forever to be refilled did I mention the service was slow. and most of the food was just awful. I never thought I \u2019d be writing this in a review. But I think it bears mentioning. I \u2019ve got a decent constitution. I ca n\u2019t remember the last time I \u201c got sick \u201d. It has to be over 10 years as I \u2019ve never done during my marriage. But that has now changed. About an hour after dinner at the Market Place. Well you know what I mean. Unfortunately this was the only option for breakfast and lunch each day. Since it was buffet the main thing for the servers to do would be to bring coffee. You could ask for it go to the buffet chat with people and still not have it when you got back to your table. It \u2019s not Starbucks. Everyone gets a pot of the same coffee a little pitcher of milk you had better not want a 2nd cup and some packets of sweetener. What \u2019s the delay. Many of the staff did look as if they did not like their jobs. And when I talk about \u201c slow \u201d I do n\u2019t mean \u201c relaxed island vacation pace \u201d. I mean \u201c tear your hair out slow \u201d. Many other people were having trouble as well. One fellow made eye contact with one of the bar tenders and asked for a bottle of beer. After 10 minutes he was still waiting. Was bottled beer a complicated recipe. Everything about the place just made us uncomfortable. And that \u2019s a shame because it \u2019s a nice \u201c looking \u201d place. But the attitude from top to bottom was to do the least and give you the least. I told me wife at some point that it felt as if they had an accountant consulting an attorney all day and saying \u201c if we do this can we still call it all inclusive. We can. Great. How \u2018 bout this. And this. Oh and \u201d. Of course they \u2019ve got a desk selling excursions. That \u2019s a win win for them. They make money from your excursion and that \u2019s time you will be away and wo n\u2019t be consuming food or drink at the resort. Mind you other places would provide you a box lunch and you could always bring a couple of beers from the fridge in your room. But not this place. Besides no fridge other amenities were lacking as well. When we told them our phone did n\u2019t work they said the only way to address that would be to change rooms. The AC was so weak we had to keep checking to see if it was on. One night I did n\u2019t sleep at all because I was so uncomfortable. We asked for a fan. They did n\u2019t have one. They sent someone to check out the AC. I do have to commend Robert from the engineering dept. He was very nice efficient and not slow. He changed the filter and drained the pipes. But no luck. He then got us another room and again we are grateful for his efficiency. I have to say though that the AC in the new room was only slightly better. In general it the phone system the Internet wired etc are all terribly outdated. The TV looked to be about the size of a 42. But the viewing area was like a 25. Very weird. Food in the \u201c restaurants \u201d was decent. Some servers were pleasant. All very inexperienced though \u2013 easily flustered and often got orders wrong. There \u2019s just nothing to recommend this place. You pay a lot of money for a really unpleasant time. They just seem like they want to cut every corner and hit you for every extra that they can. Oh. Left out 2 important things. The first morning we went down to the beach to take out a boat. There was an attendant there and we asked what was available. kayak peddle boat. He said \u201c It \u2019s kina windy. Maybe you \u2019d rather come out on my friend \u2019s boat. We can take a ride around for 100. If you want to go fishining we can do that for 150 \u201d. How sleazy can ya get. Also on the beach there was some sort of step under the sand. I do n\u2019t know if it was a concrete construct or a stone ledge. But it was covered with sand and my wife who has 2020 vision tripped on it and is still bruised bloody and in pain 6 days later. This place should really be shut down.", "offset": [5109, 5235], "date": "2015-02-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "1fdcfbe1-6e56-4584-b373-7c24c27afd05", "sentence": "Lacking in guest service and food quality.

There was an abundance of staff yet they seemed more concerned with each other than the guests. The food was less than mediocre. The hotel had an all inclusive option which we had chosen paid. There were minimal restaurants open each night for dinner and you must make a reservation well in advance to be able to eat there sometimes there was availability at 930PM. There were 6 restaurants listed on the website some nights all were closed except 2. There was only 1 option for breakfast The Market Place and the food was tasteless service was non existent. The O Grille by the pool was a grill not a restaurant. Nikei was the best restaurant sushi was delicious and service was great. Unfortunately we could only go there one night as they were booked every other night. Cilantro was not good food was bland no seasoning salt in any food. Bar service was well above average. Black Angus not included in All Inclusive Plan was mediocre at best would not recommend. Loved Nikei sushi was excellent. Service in Nikei was great chef personally came to greet all customers.

Just got back from a week at this hotel and had a great time. The beach pool SPECTACULAR beach. I have traveled all over the Caribbean world and this was some of the most clean water of a beautiful blue green color that is calm with white sand and tons of sea life like star fish fish stingrays beautiful shells etc. There are 3 main pools one that is heated with a fun swim up bar and two on the sides that have very pretty waterfalls and twists turns grottoes bridges etc. but they are a little bit colder. I found them refreshing to go into in the middle of the afternoon when the sun is beating down on you but other than that they are difficult to swim in comfortably. The food. breakfast buffet was standard. There are 2 lunch options buffet which was fine and a polside BQ area that had burgers hot dogs paninis served in to go containers with pickles and potato chips which was pretty good. For dinner there is either the buffet or there are 5 a la carte restaurants in total 1. Black Angus Steakhouse not included in the all inclusive 2. Aqua Italian not very good main course was not edible 3. Cilantro Mexican was great 4. Nikei Asian was great and 5 Estavida Tapas was great. Estavida does not require reservations you can drop in at any time. As for Nikei there is a hibachi tapanyaki option that was great. 5 courses including a live cooking show that is part of the all inclusive. For some reason the hotel did not mention this to us and we happened to find out from other guests. Highly recommended. The food was great and the show was so fun. I believe there are 2 seatings 1 at 6 1 at 8. We did not find reservations hard to get at all and appreciated that we could make them all in one shot some other resorts make you wait on line every morning and only allow you to book for the day of. Generally speaking I think all inclusive is the only way to go. I posted pictures of menu prices and they are steep. The food was good but definitely not worth the prices being charged so maybe that is where the negative reviews come in. If I had to pay for some of the food I would be less than satisfied but as part of the all inclusive the food exceeded my expectations. Also note for drinks that the all inclusive does not include top shelf but does include acceptable alternatives. You are not drinking bottom shelf disgusting liquor. For example I drink vodka. Kettle One was not included but Absolut was. Etc etc etc. Also table wine was not badRoms totally fine. Modern decor. Comfortable size. Comfortable bed. No refrigerator. Always cleaned by 1 2pm no problem. A few other random thingsThe Level. I truly do not understand why anyone would spend money on this. I asked what it included. From what I understand it is a personalized check in and check out I checked in and out in under 10 minutes each time and honestly would not want to waste any more precious beach time on that process. access to a business lounge perhaps if you need to do business it is worth it but there is a free computer in the lobby that had fast internet a printer and I was always able to use it when I needed to check in so I do not see why you would need a whole business lounge NOT what you are there for and a VIP area of the beach. The Level area of the beach is the worst part of the beach narrow and behind a wall put up where some construction is taking place plus there are waitresses that came around to serve drinks in the non Level section anyway. In short I have seen some hotels with real perks to VIP butlers shuttles for the larger resorts etc. this one is NOT worth your money The service everyone was super friendly. I think people who wrote bad reviews are just brats and need people to fall all over them. The service is on island time but acceptable and friendly. There was one truly grumpy bartender at the pool bar who was actually mean Frederick other than him EVERYONE else was WONDERFULNightlife the lobby has a very chic feel not very islandy. More like being at a swanky lounge. There are 2 bars in the lobby. One closes at 11 the other at 1 and they are both in the same general area. Not much to choose from by way of nightlife multiple bars theme nights beach parties shows etc. If you are looking to party you might have to leave the resort or look elsewhere. If you are looking for any kind of nightly entertainment you may have to look elsewhere. We enjoyed the lively end of the day pool bar scene followed by a late dinner and going to bed early but had we wanted something a little bit more lively in the evenings this place would have been a little bit of a letdown. Some little kinks could be ironed out and were annoying. At times things were disorganized one person said water sports ended at 3. another said 4 one person said 8 pm hibachi another said 9 etc. I kindof learned to listen to no one. Sometimes there was a big line at the breakfast buffet which was annoying they should just let people sit instead of having to wait for a hostess who had no clue what tables were available. A lot of times they ran out of things no margaritas at Mexican restaurant and almost no tacos no banana rum at the pool no water at the pool no more of one of the main courses at the Italian restaurant. it got a little annoying after awhile and we kindof laughed it off because it became a thing. These kinks added about 5 minutes of unpleasantness but in no ways ruined our trip. The construction. what construction. Seriously if I did not read Tripadvisor I would not even know there was construction. Any active construction is far from the hotel and can not be seen or heard. The only thing happening at the hotel was 1 there was a wall put up around what I imagine would be a polside lunch restaurant. It is so non offensive I probably would not have even noticed it if I was not looking for it. 2. the casino was closed. On March 27 the biggest casino in the Caribbean is opening next door where the Melia casino used to be located. I imagine that beforehand the casino consisted of a few slot machines in a depressing room if you want a lively gambling scene with table games definitely check out the Atlantis the casino was rocking on the night that we went. Overall this is a great option and a great value for the money. Came back tanned relaxed and happy while my friends and family suffered through a cold winter week. If you nit pick there are definitely things that can be fixed. I would not say this place is 5 star. But if you are going for a beach getaway and can let things roll off your back this place will probably be absolutely fine.", "offset": [3821, 4006], "date": "2015-02-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "84f15298-78d4-48fb-80e0-6178ba700942", "sentence": "Not even close to getting your moneys worth. Just got back from Nassau and stayed at the Melia Nassau Beach. My husband and I went for a well deserved holiday and boy were we ever disappointed. The place is a dump.

The walls were cracked the paint falling off the walls the carpets filthy and that was just what I saw before we reached our room. We had a premium ocean view room very small. The room was extremely dirty. The walls had brown streaks all over. The carpet was old worn out and filthy. did not take my shoes off once. My husband walked around in his barefet one night and his feet turned black. We had to call housekeeping when we got there because the water barely drained in the tub so when we took a shower we were standing in a foot of water. Same with the sink would not drain. do not even want to talk about the shape of the beds. Only thing clean about them was the sheets. The workout room was small and very old equipment.

A friend and I spent the week of March 8th at Melia in Nassau. We had a fabulous week. I was impressed with the mix of guests staying here. Older younger vacationers business people North Americans Europeans etc. So nice to be able to connect with a variety of people. This includes the resort staff who always had a hello and a smile for you. The beach is lovely with gorgeous white sand. The water a beautiful blue green. It was a treat to lounge by the ocean each day enjoying the heat of the sun and the soft breeze that came off the water. Finding lounge chairs was never a problem. But a strong suggestion to get your towel early in the day. To eliminate having to go back into the resort there is an outdoor bar just steps from the beach. As well an outdoor grill resto where you can have your lunch each day. The buffet is what you would normally expect. Food is good and plentiful there are some local dishes but most will find something that will satisfy. There are four specialty restos. Three are part of the all inclusive package. The fourth a steak house is not. Standouts are Nikei the Asian resto. Try to get a reservation at the Tapenaki table. Great show and fabulous food. And splurge on yourself and go to Black Angus the steak house. Very posh with excellent food. Best grilled sea bass ever. Special thanks to Robert who took very good care of us that evening. One suggestion would be to make reservations at the specialty restos as soon as you arrive. they book up very quickly. If you are not able to get a reservation with the staff in the lobby go directly to the resto and try. If you are looking to eat off of the resort I highly recommend going to the fish fry. delicious. There is no disco however there is a tapas lounge on the lobby level. It has a large outdoor patio as well as lots of seating inside. There is one large bar and then one smaller one that services the whole lounge area. After 9 pm or so guests stay in order to have a cocktail and socialize. A few nights there is a DJ. The evenings we spent at the resort we had a great time. If this is not enough for you downtown Nassau is a short cab ride away with several bars where you can get more nightlife. The staff work hard at making sure you have a good stay. Yes there are times you may be waiting. But you should be on vacation mode. Their efforts and dedication more than make up for the few moments where things may be going slower than you are accustomed. Special thanks to Gino Vaneli no not the singer and not his real name lol who is a fabulous bartender and made us feel comfortable from the moment we met. Also a big thank you to Giorgio who helped us through a small medical issue. He took our situation very seriously and made sure we were taken care of. Grazie GiorgioOveral I recommend this resort. It is a bit older. But the rooms are very clean. The property is beautiful. And if you have a chance to get an ocean view room do it. It is the best feeling in the world to wake up to that beautiful view each morning.

We just returned last night from one week at the Melia traveling with 3 kids ages 18 15and 10. We pre payed for our trip through Bokitcom for a grande suite on the Level. Check in on the Level was ridiculously slow. The kids were starving and they did have snacks and drinks while we waited but the snacks were limited mini sandwiches gross desserts and some sushi. The room was filled with a group that apparently had been waiting a long time for a room and they were not happy. Only two desks to check in at. Everyone who works in the Level is very pleasant and friendly. An hour later when I checked in there was confusion about the suite I reserved. They tried to give me a suite with one bed and said they could bring in a rolaway bed. When I showed her my receipt from Bokit that clearly stated 5 people were prepaid she had to make several calls. I overheard her having problems finding a room with two beds. She kept mentioning that people were still in the rooms. Seems they have no idea who is checking in out when. May have something to do with all the BaHa Mar workers staying at the hotel and guests displaced from the BaHa Mar not opening when expected. This process literally took over an hour and I was getting very annoyed. A manager came up as we were walking to our room we were told we could not have that room. More waiting but they found us a room first level suite on the beach with two bedrooms and they brought in a rolaway. The one bedroom only had a double bed and it smelt like throw up. We dealt with it as it seemed clean and clearly was an upgrade having two rooms and a living area. We did have a refrigerator. Our view everyday was all windows with a walkout to the beach and that was the most positive thing I can say. The beach is gorgeous. Fod The Tapas bar in the lobby had a nice atmosphere but the food was awful. We are not super picky eaters but we never ate there again. The breakfast buffet was large and had lots to offer but the flies are out of control and took our appetite away most days. Very hard to get any drink service even coffee. They ask if you want coffee but never bring it. There are cats roaming all over even in the breakfast area and they do nothing abut it. They finally opened up the italian restaurant for breakfast our last two days. no flies but cold food and not as many offerings. You had to walk over to the other dining area for most things. getting any drink service at your tableThe lunch buffet changes very little daily and again the flies are everywhere. Dinner reservations have to be made for the whole week the second you get there. Italian was ok. We were just thrilled to be semi waited on with no flies. Mexican was good and the service was the best we had in all the restaurants. We ate at the Asian restaurant twice. The sushi was actually very good and had some nice dinner choices. We did not eat at the steak house as we refused to pay extra since we had the all inclusive. Staf the staff in the level were always friendly and helpful. The staff in the buffet especially breakfast and lunch are so unfriendly. One woman when we checked in for lunch was so rude It took everything I had not to be rude back. The exception for breakfast was a worker at the bread station during breakfast. My daughter asked her for Gluten Free bread and she had it saved and ready for her everyday. The staff in the restaurants were better. One waiter in the mexican restaurant even brought my daughter a big bowl of fruit for dessert since she could not eat any of the offerings. This service was indeed shocking as it was so rare. Bar staff was very good everywhere but have a few singles ready. You get served much faster if they see that they will get tipedHousekeping in the rooms was fine but never consistent. Most days they did not come until after 10. Which is a joke because when you checkin they ask you what time you want housekeeping. Each day and we said 100am. We had turn down service show up only two days of the 7 that we stayed. I had to ask for waters and extra towels despite being on the levelBeach is very nice and spread out and has plenty of chairs. The level area is a joke other than a few tiki huts for shade it offered absolutely nothing. We walked to the bar to get drinks. Water toys area is very frustrating. Every day you have to go to the towel hut and fill out forms to use the free water toys. Only two days did they not tell us to come back that they were full. When we came back they made us wait more. Many guests were complaining about this especially the cruise ship day guests. Motorized water toys are also on the beach but you pay for them. 80 for 30 min of a wave runner for example. The pools were nice and not overly crowded. Hot tub was nice but there s only one open. Weird things that happened A group of men were hanging out on one of more balconies at 100pm. I called security and they chased them away. apparently they are workers from the Baha Mar trying to steal wifi and they have this problem all the time. Why is security not on the beach at nightCats sleeping on my balcony lounge chairsSomeone knocked on my door at 930 at night and wanted to install refrigerators in my two bedrooms.

Very basic and the beds are so hard. There was a refrigerator but no beverages in it. The walk from our room in the west wing is a far walk from the elevator. We stayed on the 8th floor and had a great view of the beach which I liked. Furthermore the food is GROSS in all of the restaurants. They try to have fine dining but that is not something authentic to the island. Even the conch fritters and conch salad at the resort were not good compared to local food spots that make these dishes authentically. So venture off the resort to experience actual good food. The beach is crowded from 12 6pm and finding a beach chair could be a hassle. The sand has a lot of stuff in it stones small rocks sea grass small particles of trash. The water was very clear and clean but still pretty cool in April. This hotel shows signs of age and wear and tear. it is not terrible but I would say it was worth the price right now.", "offset": [982, 1116], "date": "2015-04-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "bd82d5dd-7683-4d0a-8bba-0e4ed7519a03", "sentence": "Paradise.

On every island vacation I have ever been on I was greeted with drinks upon arrival. except here at the Melia. Check in was painless and the room while aged was clean and cool so that was a plus but things took a turn for the worse when we tried to get an umbrella at the beach. With 694 rooms and 32 suites there were approximately 15 umbrellas for the entire hotel. Vendors are not allowed to rent umbrellas to guests and the hotel does not provide any umbrellas above what is out there. So prepare to bake on the beach. Reservations for dinner at 9 pm at Aqua the Italian restaurant were not honored until 10 pm at which time we were informed that the hotel had run out of salmon. After a ten minute berating by my wife to management she miraculously received salmon for her entree. The process of eating at the buffet whether breakfast lunch or dinner was a bit out of sorts. We tried it for breakfast and we were required to stand in line and wait to give our room number and party size to only wait longer to be seated. While you wait you endless amounts of empty tables but yet we were not allowed to just simply sit down. This caused confusion and always resulted in a very long line to get into the buffet. For lunch we dined on the beach at the OGrile which was very good. BQ hot dogs and burgers but good nonetheless. For dinner we were forced again to dine at the Marketplace or buffet because we did not call between 90am and 915am to make reservation Nikei Asian Cuisine restaurant if you can get the hibachi table and Dicenzo the 2nd floor bartender.

Just returned from a 5 day trip to the Melia in Nassau. Took the all inclusive package. We traveled as a family of 5 in a group of 20. it really met our needs for that large a group with varying needs and wants. Overall the service at the hotel is good. Of course if you tip you get better service. The one thing I will say is that they are very strict on the check in time. We arrived at 1 pm and were told our room would not be ready until 3 pm and it was not. The rooms are very spacious. It does take a while for the water to heat up in the shower and the AC could be a bit colder for my liking. The hallways are a bit worn. The lobby and restaurant areas are very beautiful. They look like they have recently been renovated. Overall I found the food pretty good. Our favorite was the Asian restaurant Nikei. They accommodated our large group. They sat the teens at the hibachi table in their own private room providing them with a 5 course meal. The adults also got a private dining room and we were provided with sampling of about 10 dishes served family style. Everything we ate was delicious. We also ate at the Aqua the Italian restaurant. The food here was more varied. The seafood risotto salmon and gnocchi got high praises as did most of the main entrees. The flat bread pizzas were OK. Cilantro provided your typical Mexican food all of it good. The Marketplace for breakfast was very crowded. The wait could be up to 30 45 minutes depending on when you got there. The food for breakfast is typical of buffet style breakfasts. The lunch here provided many options. I did enjoy the salad bar there at lunch. We never ate dinner at the Marketplace. Estavida the tapas restaurant in the lobby is very good. A great place to get some small plates if you are not really that hungry at dinner. This is also a great place for drinks in the evening. We really enjoyed this. The pool is very well kept and clean. The swim up bar in the pool is not very well staffed and you may wait a bit for a drink they have to come from the main pool bar to serve you. There are 2 quick places to get lunch at the pool a grill that makes burgers and grilled chicken sandwiches both were good. Also a quesadilla and panini place which was OK. Cable beach is great beautiful white sand calm clear blue water. The biggest issue at both the pool and the beach is a lack of shade. The pool has a bit of shade under an awning and a pergola but it is snatched up early. The beach has a few palm huts set up for shade but they are taken by 9 am and really only provide shade for 2 people. Basically if you tip the pool attendants they will get you a spot in the shade at either the pool or the beach. If you are going to rent jet skis from the group right off the property make sure they work properly. We rented 5 of them and 3 broke down. They had to go out and get them and give them new jet skis. One group never got one that really worked well and had to go out separately after the rest of the group came back. We did rent another 2 the next day and these were better but we made sure we tried them prior to paying. They are not affiliated with the hotel. Overall I think this was a good value for the money.

I was traveling with a group of 6 3 adults and 3 kids 8 10yrs old. We selected this property because it was one of the few that was all inclusive and allowed children on the island. Beach great beach. there is plenty of room for everyone but if you want an umbrella you have to get there before 9 am. There is a rock formation where you can go snorkeling. Lots of interesting fish to see. Also saw a sting ray late in the afternoon. Good place for shells too but check your shells for hermit crabs we had a few crawl away. Pools 3 pools to chose from only one with bar access. Kids enjoyed the variety. Rooms. room was ok. The beds were not very comfortable but the room was a good size. Even though we were all inclusive we could not get anyone to stock our room frig even after asking the front desk several times. Most of the rooms are far from the 1 elevator so we ended up walking up and down the stairs most days. Food. This is the category that kept my rating at a 4 rather than a 5. There is only 1 restaurant that does not require reservations The Market. The food selection and quality was good but the service and organization is terrible. It would be much better if they just had open seating but they make you wait in line and seat you. The most frustrating was when there were several tables open but they were not seating people there. It was also difficult to get water filled at the table i do not know why. Polside grill is great. The hamburgers and hotdogs are good and fast. highly recommend this for lunch. Now for the reservation restaurants. If you want to eat at any of them you need to book reservations on your first day for your entire trip. We tried Cilantro Mexican and the Asian restaurant. Cilantro was great. guacamole and pico was fresh. Tacos were great but portions are small. I would recommend this spot but be patient Service is slow. I would NOT recommend the asian restaurant but if you go just order sushi rolls. The entrees were terrible I mean really bad and we waited over 2 hours for them. It was so bad we almost walked out before getting our food. Honestly I wish we had because it was not worth the wait. I would not go back to this restaurant. Tips if you want to use the sea kayaks or bikes at the beach book your time slots early. These items are included but they book up fast.

The beach is great the ocean unbelievable thanks for the Caribbean nature the hotel common areas are renovated and nice but rooms require some work. I got the Ocean view room since prices were very competitive. When we got to the hotel the first room they gave us had a damp carpet and mold smell. I immediately requested another room and they gave us promptly. Unfortunately when we got to the new room it was not ready and back to the front desk they offered another room. The room 3rd was ready but again. Had the damp carpet and mold smell. After a long trip I gave up and accepted this one. The beach was great and as weather allowed us to we enjoyed the beach and pool at best. This hotel have 4 restaurants one Mexican one Asian one Italian and a steakhouse this last one is not included on the all inclusive package. Additionally they serve dinner on the buffet. I recommend people to get all the restaurant reservation for dinner as soon as they get to the hotel otherwise you will end up in the buffet that is good for dinner but does not have anything special compared to the other restaurants and gets repetitive after a couple of days. Talking about the buffet this is the place is where they serve breakfast lunch and dinner. it is simple and good food. No special stuff like shrimps etc but they vary the menu so you do not get bored. The big problem there is that they are completely disorganized. You get there. wait to be seated yes on a buffet restaurant. someone trow you on a dirty table and other person takes 10 minutes to show up and clean it and set it up. They ALWAYS miss something. Mugs cups napkins salt and you will probably have to call the person again. Then you have to ask for your drink to a different person and if you are lucky it will probably get to your table in the middle of your meal. it is nothing personal against the ones who work there but management seriously need to rearrange how that restaurant works since they try to get too much organized and end up breaking all the time. Just get there and look at the guests weaving all the time asking for help. Seriously. I celebrated my birthday on the steakhouse and was amazing. Thumbs up for a guy named Robert. Exceptional work. I totally recommend the place. It is a bit expensive though3 days before the end of my trip something very odd happened. 2 big events happened at the hotel and as far as I can understand the people from the event stayed on the hotel for the weekend. I can estimate something around 400 people sharing facilities services and specially the buffet. With the event going on the place became a mess. Even longer lines to be seated to get the food no napkins I saw a server close to a heart attack with so much people to help out. My personal opinion is that event should be catered on a different place but I understand hotel have their reasons to mix everyone together. Once again. Meli\u00e3 management. You have to do something about that buffet since stepping into that place ruins all the experience we have at the hotel in general.

The front desk staff were busy talking to each other and disinterested in checking us in. We were told to leave our bags at the front and enjoy the resort while we waited. We were not given a resort map or told where we could go or eat so we ended up wandering around for a while then waiting in the lobby. Would have been nice to have been given some guidance. There was n\u2019t even a resort map in the room. The RomOur room was standard nothing special about it. We booked an Oceanview but it was not worth the upgrade. It was clean the bed was ok. We called for extra blankets and pillows and they brought them right away. Our room was cleaned well daily no towel swans or anything but there were a few days we did not get essentials like toilet paper and towels. We called and they always brought them right away. The hallway to the rooms is an oven and you can hear every whisper in the hallways doors and walls are paper thin. We ordered room service once and did not get the correct order. Plus room service although all inclusive still charges you a 10 delivery service charge free for level guestsThe BeachThe beach is nice not as nice as I was expecting from the reviews likely due to it being so over crowded you did not see too much of it. There was some seaweed most days likely due to the weather. The wind was insane on the beach. It was so cold by the afternoon everyone was wrapped in their towels. The ocean is the coldest I have ever felt anywhere in the Caribbean. Could be due to it only being March. Same goes for the weather. There was staff serving drinks on the beach but very few and far between. Also did not notice a lot of vacationers tipping which is probably why the servers did not come around often. I did see staff cleaning the beaches regularly. There were also locals selling on the beach if you wanted souvenirs. The worst part about the beach and pool was that everyone got up at the crack of dawn to put their towels down to reserve lounge chairs. Never been to a resort where there were not enough chairs for the guests and I thought this was a nuisance. Vacation is for relaxing and doing things on your own time not getting up first thing to reserve chairs. The PolThere were 3 pools but you could say there was really only 1. The small 2 were uninviting and only had about 15 lounge chairs at them. It seems they were designed only for use of the closest ground floor rooms. The main pool was unbelievably small for a resort this size. It was also unattractive and cold. And you could not get a seat because all chairs were reserved before 8am. The FodThe food was edible you wo n\u2019t starve. The buffet was only good if you were there first for breakfast first means 730am. If you went too late there was not much left. Dinner was lunchs leftovers. The food was very much the same every day no theme nights or anything. The outdoor pool restaurant food was terrible. The service was mediocre for the most part was a challenge to get drinks and refills. The a la cartes were ok the tapinyaki was the best of the three. The service there was good. The reservation process was not great though and again you had to line up first thing to get your reservations booked. There was always a line of people trying to make reservations at any given time of the day. The ResortSpeaking of line ups you pretty much had to line up for everything at this resort. Line up for diner reservations line up to be seated at the buffet even with tons of open tables long line ups at the buffet lineups at the information desk etc. This is the first vacation I have been on and I have been to most of the Caribbean islands and then some that you had to be early for everything and wait for everything. I believe this was due to poor organization at the restaurants not enough staff at the restaurants and overcrowding at the resort. This resort did not seem to have the facilities to take care of as many guests as it booked. This was evident in the line ups at the bathrooms everywhere you went 3 womens stalls only at the pool beach lunch restaurant. Overcrowding was also evident in that there were not enough beach chairs. There were not enough seats at the buffet. The beach and pool were always very crowded and we saw guests asking for chairs and being told there were none left. This resort also did a poor job of entertainment. The pool entertainment was sporadic and uninteresting trivia and pool diving for rings with no prizes. The evening entertainment was poorly advertised on a sheet of paper in the elevator we noticed on day 4 and was held while most people were at dinner likely because it was held in the lobby where there was not room enough for even half of the guests at the resort. The entertainment we saw was n\u2019t worth watching. This resort is missing an outdoor theatre entertainment space. The only entertainment was in the lobby why would guests come to a warm tropical location to spend their vacation indoors. Almost all other resorts have an outdoor theatre for evening shows entertainment bar something. This was extremely disappointing. This resort did not even have a disco. This is not the place for nightlife. It actually is not the place for kids either as I did not see anything fun for kids to do no park or anythingThis resort had a lot of rooms but the grounds were very small. Essentially this is just a hotel on a nice beach. There was a wing of the hotel that is either abandoned under constructions or forgotten about. it used to have a casino down what I like to call the hallway of doom. They need to put some activities here like a game room and re open the casino. ExcursionsEverything was very expensive compared to everywhere else in the Caribbean and there were n\u2019t many options available to pregnant women. We took the bus then a water taxi to Atlantis and went to the casino. We also went to Carmine \u2019s for dinner which was by far the best meal we had all week.

Like others I was very worried about all the negative reviews. With that said. I was VERY happy with this resort. There are some things I recommend see below. however and I think that might be why people are having bad experiences. One I highly recommend doing The Level. once arrived my wife and I got checked in by Owen in The Level check in area. He is ok but I felt the guy on the desk beside us was doing a much more thorough job of explaining everything. Owen did not even offer us the 400 resort credit booklet we were suppose the get and I did not even think about it until after I got back home. I read on here from other reviews it is simply a coupon book that adds up to a total of 400 so hopefully we did not miss out on something we would have used. We got to the hotel around 230pm and our room was not ready which we figured would be the case. Owen told us it is cleaned and just needed a final inspection approval from the head of cleaning before he could allow us in the room. He told us it would be about 15 minutes or so for them to do this however it took them almost 2 hours to simply approve that the room was clean enough. I did not really mind the wait as we went and checked out the property to familiarize ourselves with the entire property and went at ate at the outside grille. The problem with that is he should not have told us it would be 15 minutes and then it takes 2 hours. we kept coming back to The Level check in to ask if it was ready every 15 minutes or so only to be told almost but not quite yet. Just tell us 2 hours and we would have known to not keeping coming back until thenFod lunch the first day at OGrile was good. I had a Cheeseburger and my wife had pasta. You will never leave there thinking. wow this outside grille was amazing but it was much better than we expected we were thinking cafeteria type of food but it was better than that. The room itself was very nice and clean. We were on the 8th floor and as reviewers are mentioning the hotel itself is very old so you need to remember that before booking this place. This is one reason why I recommend getting The Level as these rooms are updated and I do not think the lower level non The Level room are. I think those rooms are the bad ones you are seeing in pics. Aqua was completed closed for the winter renovations to it I think. and that was the one restaurant we really wanted. We choose Cilantro the first night. PRO TIP. reserve your restaurants you want ahead of time. one week prior to arrival. Once again. being a Level guest they will email you ahead and ask for your choose and what times but I am not sure if they will email you and ask if you are not a Level guest. Cilantro was very tasty. My wife is not a big Mexican food fan so I was very nervous about this place but the food while we were not exactly sure what we were ordering due to fancy names on the menu. all turned out to be very good and you can tell the food was fresh. The 2nd night was a much different experience for us. We emailed The Level ahead of time our request to The Hibachi at Nikei for 8 pm. They emailed us back stating they received our restaurant request and all was good. Owen during check in confirmed we were good with all restaurant reservations however upon checking in at Nikei we were told we did not have hibachi seating were were scheduled to eat at the main seating with the main menu. This did not sit well with me since I was told twice our reservations were good. Had we have known this we would have chosen a different restaurant that night as I knew my wife would not find much on the menu she would like. I eat sushi so I was ok with the menu and at this point. I do not know what else could be done so we sat and ate there. My sushi was ok but the entree was really bad I could not even eat it. My wife did not like her main entree either. Had we gotten the Hibachi. I think it would have been better simply because the choices are that menu are more inline with what we prefer. 3rd night was Black Angus. We loved the food here. The price with the 25 off for The Level guest was not as bad as people made it sound to be. I would definitely recommend this place. Of course we are a meat and potatoes type of family so I figured going in. we would enjoy it note. the streaks were very good. Observation while at Melia I think another reason for all the bad reviews was the timing of when the guest were there. I assume the of employees are the same throughout the year but could be wrong. if so. then I can see during the busy season with the hotel the service is much slower simply because the employees are waiting on so many more guest. I bet the employees are working just as hard but just have so many more guest to wait on and it seems they are not working as fast as you like want. With that said. I HIGHLY recommend you pick a time of the year that is not busy. We went the first weekend in November and felt we had to place to ourselves almost. My guess is the hotel was at 50 capacity or so. The service everywhere we went during this time was great. No complaints at all there. We especially loved our server for breakfast at OGrile in the morning by the ocean once again. another reason to have The Level. Sorry I did not get the guys name. but he was amazing. FYI. The late night food was surprisingly really good too. Entertainment basically none. The DJ that plays at night is really good and there were a decent amount of people that danced but overall do not expect to stay on the property at night and be entertained. The magic show was so bad we got up and left half way through. Pools all the pools were great. Ocean chairs space once again going during a down time is important. I understand why people complain about this. There simply is not enough beach chairs for the amount of guest. The Level area during our stay was almost empty at times and we had our choice of any chairs or cabanas we wanted I did notice the regular non Level beach side was packed when we walked up that way. This is just another reason to get Level ServiceBahaMar this place is amazing and the main reason we choose Melia. We wanted an all inclusive place close to the casino. We spent every night in the Casino and it was not crowded at all. This might be been due to the time of the year or might have been due to the Casino just recently opening still technically in its soft opening phase. It definitely reminds me of Vegas with fire shows and water light shows and with how big the casino is. I prefer it over Atlantis mainly because it is not as crowded. Let me break all this down better and make it simply Remember the cost and know you are getting what you pay for. The hotel is old but more than good enough for the price. The service is good as long as you treat the people with respect and make sure you go during a time of the year that is not busy. Make sure to tip the employees. I know it is included and you do not have to. but would not you work harder for someone that just gave you 5 for bringing you a drink to your beach chair. We seemed to get asked before we finished our drink if we were ready for another. I think it is because we tipped them 5 at the beginning of the day note. we did not tip again until the end of the day with another 2 but to me paying 7 total to get GREAT service is worth it. Go into your vacation knowing you are not staying at a 5 star resort but remember you are not paying for a 5 star resort either. Keep an open mind and relax and enjoy your vacation. Know there will be some things that are not perfect just like on our trip. but none of those things were going to put us in a bad mood. We are there for one reason relax and have fun.

I read the reviews before booking the hotel but went ahead and booked three nights starting with Christmas Eve. Overall I was very happy with the property and the hotel exceeded my expectations. This is what we found the staff was pleasant courteous and helpful. No one had an attitude and we were greeted numerous times with a cheerful good morning or happy holidays. The room standard island view was big enough and clean. The bathroom however should be updated and more attention to cleaning is needed there. I usually complain about the AC in hotel rooms this rooms system though old was perfect. I was cool enough without noise. The room was so quiet even when there was a DJ in the lobby at night. The food as others have said. just okay. We had plenty to eat at the breakfast buffet but did not find OGrile very appealing. Do not order the fish at the OGrile. The fish attracts an abundance of flies for some reason. No other food did. There are grills set up by the pool which gave you hot dogs and hamburgers grilled to your taste. Go there if out at the pool. We paid for dinner at Black Angus one night and thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food service and drinks. Though not included in the all inclusive plan well worth it for the one night. Maybe because it was Xmas there was entertainment each night that was enjoyable and fun. Pool we picked up towels early in the morning and found chairs without any problems. By 90 am most pool chairs were taken. We did not care if we sat on the beach but I am sure the chairs were taken early. The pool was great. Very clean and bright. I expected there would be more negatives to this trip but I am happy that the positives outweighed any of them. Also the hotel may be doing better than the 2014 pictures posted here. I recommend going if you are more laid back about your food and drink. Tip Make your dinner reservations a week in advance or at least on the day you arrive. I had no problem doing that.

We stayed a week before Thanksgiving. First of all checking in took forever because they had 2 people working during a holiday. I waited If you book a regular room on the ground floor you will hate it. they are painting in the entire wing of the basic rooms and it stinks. The basic room had busted up old furniture and an old coffee machine. We upgraded to a level room which was basically the same size but on the 9th floor and in another room. IT WAS A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE. Modern furniture modern coffee machine and a view of the ocean. PLUS as a level guest you get to go to the 4th level lounge and use their concierge to book restaurant nights. This level lounge gives you access to a bar with top shelf alcohol and they put out snacks and desserts at meal times. It also has games and books so the kids loved hanging out here. I definitely would tell everyone to upgrade to LEVEL. Level guests also get to hang out in their own dedicated side of the beach with better chairs. But it was filled with people smoking and throwing cigarettes onto the sand. The ocean is a little rocky and has some seaweed but overall is clear and beautiful. We enjoyed the water hammocks the circular floaties. But really had fun because we brought our own floaties. Food in the Marketplace was very poor and limited. Food in the Japanese restaurant was good do not expect Benihana. There are no tricks. Food in the Italian restaurant was very good and had the BEST servers. One thing about the Bahamas and this hotel in particular the people working here are very grumpy. They rarely smiled and seemed like we were bothering them when we asked to sit down or ordered food.

Room service breakfast is far better than the breakfast that you get at the Grille or the Market. So use room service. MUST get a level room. Do not expect a 5 star experience at a 4 star resort.

Alright folks we need to set a few things straight before we proceed with my review for Melia Nassau Beach Resort for all you potential visitors reading this. A You can not compare Melia Nassau Beach to Sandals. that is like comparing apples to broccoli. it is not a fair comparison. Sandals is arguably the worlds 1 luxury All Inclusive. Melia is a budget friendly All Inclusive for those of us who can not afford or do not wish to pay Sandals rates. A better comparison would be between Melia and Breezes. B When you travel in the off season DO NOT have the expectation that things will be like they are during the height of the spring and summer season. there is a reason the rates are lowest in the off season. This is usually around late August through late October. During this period most Caribbean resorts tend to their needed maintenance repairs run on downsized staff due to lower number of visitors and may have to contend with tropical storms andor hurricanes. There may also be changes to schedules and available services I will discuss this further in my reviewOkay. Now that we got that out of the way here begins my review for all you readers out there. We stayed at Melia from October 18th through the 26th. Part 1. The Room. The last time we were here we stayed in a regular room with a King bed. We loved that room. This time around we sprang for the Level Jr Suite upgrade as the rate was not much more and we were NOT disappointed. It was a spacious room that was well kept and clean. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were neither too soft or too firm. The in room AC worked like a champ and the shower water pressure was excellent. The building is undergoing a beautification and remodel process that is slated to be complete by 2021. As a results you will see scaffolding on some parts of the buildings. The lower floor rooms are also being remodeled and it looks like they will eventually tear out that dark and musty smelling hallway carpet for a new floor. The old hallways aside the rooms are updated. There is also construction east of the hotel. This is the new water park that will connect to Melia on one side Baha Mar on the other and feature an entrance for the general public as well. NOTE. Upgrading to the Level rooms or Jr Suites is better done through the Melia website or whatever travel site you use. Orbitz Expedia etc. as it is significantly cheaper than springing for the upgrade at the resort itself. Now You may be asking yourself Is the Level upgrade worth itThat answer is entirely dependent upon your priorities. As a Level guest you have the option to get the Jr Suite which is not available to regular guests. Other than that the difference between the regular room and the Level room is service. Here is what Level guests can look forward to in terms of perks1. A separate check in out concierge above the normal check in out area2. The convenience of booking 5 dinner reservations all at once instead of having to check each night to make reservations for the following evening3. Free room service is available without service charge. Normal guests can also order room service but they are subject to a 100 delivery fe4. Level guests have an added breakfast option at O Grille while all other guests only have the buffet or room service menus serving breakfast5. Level guests have access to certain name brand alcohol that is not available to regular guests Not really a big deal for me6 Level guests have access to the lounge. There is a mini bar there for guests to make their own drinks as well as a daily selection of fruits pastries and other treats along with a coffee espresso tea station7. There is a sectioned off portion of the beach on the west side of the resort for Level guests. It has umbrellas like the rest of the beach but also has a few cabanas. The Level section also has staff that come by to take your food and drink orders. Part 2 The beach. Oh my. Betsy. The most beautiful beach you could want. Turquoise blue water nearby rocks where one can snorkel and just a beautiful scene. The only thing you need to worry about are the local vendors. They walk up and down the beach all day trying to sell you goods or drinks Why you would pay for a drink when the resort gives them to you is beyond me. Part 3 Restaurants There are 7 restaurants on site. Of these 1 is excluded from the All Inclusive package regardless of regular Level guest status. That restaurant is the steakhouse called Black Angus No relation to the US chain lol. The rest of the restaurants are The Market Place Cilantro Nikei Aqua Estavida and O Grille. Some of these restaurants have a Chefs Specials and Signature Drinks section. The items listed there are not part of the all inclusive and cost extra. The Market Place Breakfast Lunch Dinner Buffet. No reservations. The buffet is your standard fare for all 3 services but do not expect a Vegas style opulent setup. They have a decent variety for all to enjoy. Our go to for breakfast is the omelet station for custom order omelets. Cilantro Latin fusion restaurant Dinner by reservations onlyThe Beef Chicken and Pork dishes are all delicious. The Churos and Flan desserts are also greatNikei Asian fusion and Hibachi Dinner by reservations onlyThe sushi here is not spectacular but it is not bad either. It went great with a little soy sauce and ginger. The Golden Chicken Udon is a must have chicken udon noodles veggies and curry sauce as is the beef short rib dish. They also have a good Miso soup and great edamame. They also have a hibachi dinner option which must be reserved separately as it is only done on certain nights. That consists of either steak chicken or seafood Shrimp scallops with veggies and fried rice. It am not no benihana but it was quite delicious. No complaints from meAqua italian Dinner by reservations only. We only got to eat here once but he loved it. The portabelo ravioli is very good as is the roasted chicken dish. They have great gelato too. Estavida Tapas lounge with a bar Dinner only No reservationsPro tip. order multiple of everything that catches your eye. the dishes are indeed small portions. We pretty much tried everything on the menu but the 2 that stood out to us were the wings and the veggie empanadas. The lamb meatballs were good too but a tad overcooked. O Grille Beachside Lunch only with breakfast for Level guestsPrety much your familiar beach side grill Burgers salads nachos quesadilla wraps etc. NOW Remember that you are visiting in the off season. This means that not all the restaurants will be open every day. During this time period there are usually 2 or 3 open each night and they rotate. This was the case with our stay. Normal operations resume towards mid November when all the restaurants are open daily. While the dining experience was positive overall for us I do need to bring something to light that if rectified would make my review of Melia Nassau Beach even better Consistency or the somewhat lack of it to be exact. We did mention this to our concierge and she noted it down. The service seemed to be inconsistent on a daily basis. Examples1st time we dined at Nikei everything was perfect2nd time we dined at Nikei the edamame was bland3rd time we dined at Nikei The miso soup was made with fish broth and tasted heavily of seafood. The desserts at various restaurants that included ice cream will show up soetimes as listed on the menu and with random ice cream flavors at other times. We ordered the same omelet and pancakes via room service on 3 different occasions and each time they were delivered diferent1st time the pancakes had blueberries on the side. The omelet was perfect2nd time the blueberries were inside and no butter was included with the delivery. The omelet only came with mushrooms inside3rd time pancakes showed up plain. The omelet showed up with extra ingredients inside that were not even listed on the menu. If they could iron out these minor details the overall customer satisfaction would greatly improve. Was our stay perfect. No. Would we stay there again. Yes. Why. Because we come here for the beach and Melia offers an affordable alternative to Sandals while also putting in a solid effort to provide it is guests with a fun and friendly experience.", "offset": [4645, 4722], "date": "2019-10-27", "cpt": "3", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "0c566afd-7519-4a24-8961-16206c31ad57", "sentence": "Lovely hotel.

We booked the Melia as part of our honeymoon. We upgraded to the level as well felt the Level was worth it for the beach area and the free room service. Overall the trip was fine nothing overwhelming and nothing horrible. we had both agree the overall rating of 35 is pretty spot on for this hotel. Staff Great can not say enough about them. Everyone at the Level and just in general always willing to help and provide whatever we needed. They were also willing to poke fun at us after a couple days getting to know us. Italia Owen Patrick Fredrick and Maria were all great. Beach Excellent The Level upgrade gave us access to the Level beach area which was totally worth it. We were looking for a quiet relaxing space on the beach for our honeymoon and this was exactly what we were looking for. The beach and the staff are the best parts of this resort. Hotel Upon arrival we were upgrade to a Level junior suite. The room was clean spacious and comfortable. It was right off the beach which was great. The room itself and the surrounding area did feel a bit dated and in need of some TLC. There were a couple areas of ongoing construction during our visit so something they appear to be working on. The other construction items is the Baha Mar was under construction during our stay as well. The added construction noise detracted from our stay. Drinks Drinks were good upgrading to the Level gave us access to the high level of alcohol which was nice. A few of the restaurants had signature drinks that were not included in our all inclusive package which as a bit frustrating. One can only have so many pina coladas and daiquiris before you want something else having those drinks included in the all inclusive package would have been nice. Restaurants. First the with their reservation system you can only book restaurants on the Sunday for the whole week. Overall they were pretty average. We ate at Nikei 3 different times it was okay all three times. The Market Place was very hit or miss. We ate at Cilantro once thought it was okay at best. For breakfast upgrading to the Level gave us access to the o grille for breakfast which was better than the buffet but still pretty average. The only meal either of us thought was outstanding food wise was our twilight dinner which came from Black Angus so clearly they can produce extraordinary food. Similar to the signature drinks it would have been nice to have this level of food included everywhere not just as an extra cost. Activities They provide snorkels kayaks rafts for free which was really nice we made use of the snorkels a couple times there is some fish and sea life within swimming distance of the resort which was great. Upon arrival we both downloaded the Melia ap thinking that would be a great way to book restaurants order room services get a list of activities. After trying to do all those things and failing we were told by multiple employee not to use the ap. Which would have been nice to know before arriving and trying to book restaurants and then missing out on Aqua. They also did not provide any evening outdoor activities which is something we have enjoyed about previous trips to the Caribbean and Mexico. After our week long stay we both agreed we probably will not return to the Melia as a couple. As a family maybe depending upon the price for the kids.", "offset": [1472, 1597], "date": "2019-12-01", "cpt": "3", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 34, "uid": "39e120f7-afc6-4e49-ba50-08982173b491", "sentence": "This resort was a great value for the money.

We did not use the pools at all. There were water activities too and never had any issue getting access. We snorkeled kayaked and did the stand up padleboard. We even saw rays in that area. 4.

We were told that there would be a number of restaurants available to us and that was important because my partner has food allergies.

We made the reservation at the only restaurant in there available sadly the food was terrible and not many options to choose from. We were sat outside at a picnic table next to a very bare bones buffet. I had to stuff myself on bread and my partner on some raw broccoli. The broccoli was meant to be cooked but like the rest of the vegetables they were n\u2019t fully cooked. Again no options and way they did have were not edible. Breakfast was also awful. We were told the buffet was our only option. When we went we were seated in a restaurant called Aqua. The food selection was extremely slim and terrible for example the potatoes were so stale. They tasted as though they had been leftovers and microwaved after sitting out for days. Sadly no one told us that there was another restaurant that had the full breakfast buffet until we were done. Even then when we went to look at it it was not appealing. It was a very expensive stay for nothing. The photos of the place are very deceiving. We told the front desk and all we got was a sorry. The worst hotel experience of my life and I work in the travel industry. The beach was clean but very narrow. Not much room for playing or walking or laying on it.
