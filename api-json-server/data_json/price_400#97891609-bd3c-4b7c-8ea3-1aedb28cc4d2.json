The rooms even the executive suite did n\u2019t have a microwave. TV worked but it only had basic channels. The ventilation in the room was basically non existing so the room felt damp and smelled.

I asked for late check out 12 pm instead of 11 am but the front desk said so. However I was able to get late check out via the website.

Had a good stay recently at the Hyat Regency Schaumburg. Tried to checkin at 430. Room not ready. was not ready until 545. They did offer some water or some candy or snacks from the gift shop. Went to the bar until room was ready. Would have been better to offer to pick up a drink for us when we told them that is where we would be waiting. Front desk staff was great it was not their fault room was not ready but room should be ready when checking in after 40. Had paid for an upgrade to a corner suite do not waste your money on this. The room was only about as big as a regular room with just an extra window on one wall. The bathroom was the smallest I can ever remember seeing in a hotel room. Opening the door into the bathroom and it just clears the toilet. Shower pressure was terrible and the tile really needed to be replaced. Definitely if staying here do not go with the corner suite which I do not really feel is a suite. Nothing better in it than a regular room as far as I could tell.

The door to our room was not sealed well could see into the hallway and hear everything from the hallway like it was in your room. We were on the top floor but there was no view because the window was so disgusting you could hardly see threw it. The worst part of the experience was waking up to a wrongful 70 charge on my card from the hotel when my room was paid for in advance. During checkout I asked about the charge they apologized and said they would refund it. When i got to the car i look at my account and see they charged me 4 more times for the full price of the room.
