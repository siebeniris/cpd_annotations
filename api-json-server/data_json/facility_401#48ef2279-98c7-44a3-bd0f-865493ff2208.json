Who cares if your silverware match when you have a beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean. Bathroom was good sized with tub shower combo plenty of hot water with good water pressure and lots of clean towels. Beds were comfy with nice pillows and clean covers. Window AC and ceiling fan kept the room temperature just right. No heat so we did run out and buy a space heater. Best part was the ocean front balcony. Fully furnished with just the best view of the sunrise and perfect location for just relaxing. They have kayaks available for 4 hours for only 20 I recommend you try it. Water is so clear you can see everything. We were really worried about this hotel based on the reviews of other people that have probably not stayed in the keys before.

Pros. The rooms are all newly refurbished with a contemporary breezy marine theme and colors. The girl who worked the front desk while we were there Emily had a great attitude and demeanor. The mattresses were comfy but the double beds were a bit small for two people. The whole facility felt clean and well maintained. The continental breakfast was basic but a nice option. The recreational equipment was new and free to use. Cons. The kitchenette has no equipment other than a K cup brewer and a microwave no plates mugs glasses or flatware. The balconies tend to trap the road noise acousticaly and amplify it. You must keep the AC unit on high to drown out the street noise and it takes a bit of fooling around with the AC remote to figure out how to turn off the very bright. lighted temperature numbers on the front of the unit. The pool is small and basically adequate but once the kids arrive it gets a bit cramped feeling. Double beds smaller than a queen but clean and comfortable. No elevator.

I spent 5 days here with my husband and 8 month old baby. As the title suggests we were disappointed with this resort motel given the number of very positive reviews. We stayed in one of the motel style rooms for the majority of our stay and one night in a bungalow. The bungalow had less highway noise with a wonderful view though the walls were thin and we could hear people in their rooms on either side. Not all the bungalows have a patio and there was less kitchen equipment a smaller fridge coffee making machine and microwave. No sink in the kitchen area. Here are my thoughts about the hotel. It was n\u2019t all bad Pros1. Large and attractive rooms with patio modern kitchen facilities and rain shower in the bathroom 2. Lovely view facing the sea. Plenty of sun loungers to relax on and take in the view3. Nice pool not huge but good enough for a nice splash about 4. Bikes kayaks and games available on site to use. though we did n\u2019t use them so ca n\u2019t comment any further5. Nice continental breakfast coffee juice cereals yoghurts bagels and pastries But Cons 1. Other people have commented on excellent customer service but we found the lady on check in pretty unfriendly. We also had several problems with our key card not working. After the 4th time being locked out they finally came to look at the door which needed a battery fixing. They fixed this quickly but then the key broke for a 5th time. Again had to go down they gave us another key card and surprise surprise it did n\u2019t work. Eventually they moved us to one of the bungalow rooms for our last night and we finally got an apology. Another occasion my husband asked if they had a corkscrew we could borrow and was just told no. I find it hard to believe a hotel does n\u2019t have a corkscrew they can lend out or at least be more helpful about finding one2. Great kitchen facilities but no cutlery or crockery3. The motel is right off the highway so noisy on the patio and in the bedroom of the motel rom4. No elevator lift for the motel style rooms tricky with a pushchair and would n\u2019t be wheelchair acesible5. Thin walls we could hear the nextdor room partying when we went to bed and returning from their night out in the early hours 6. Housekeping on the first night they replaced coffee but no extra cups. Day 2 they only emptied the bins and had to be reminded to do the rest. Day 3 they had n\u2019t finished cleaning the room until 530 and the hotel definitely was n\u2019t full. 7. It \u2019s not a place to go for a relaxing stay. Maybe it was our bad luck but it \u2019s the sort of place where people feel free to play their own music at breakfast and at the pool which we found pretty rude. The music got so loud round the pool I had to complain to reception call me old fashioned but I did n\u2019t want to hear other people \u2019s explicit gangster rap at top volume. I actually thought the hotel should have said something to them before it got to the stage of me having to complain about them. They took over the pool area all day. On our last day a school load of kids arrived and took over the pool. Screaming bombing and generally disturbing the peace making it feel more like a youth hostel. It \u2019s not a place for a relaxing family holiday. Hopefully this feedback is helpful to others considering going here.
