They kept us waiting for the room more than 2 hours. Although they offered a complementary snack in the lounge. After showing our frustration the manager Francesco escorted us to our room and offered a late checkout to make up for all the trouble. On checkout day we headed from the pool to our room at 1230 and the key did not work because it past the checkout time. We went back and forth the concerige 3 times because each key they gave us did not work. Until we found a housekeeping guy next to our room and asked him to open it for usThey told us they put the late checkout on their system but nevertheless the key keeps disactivated. We were so angry that we had to go back and forth 3 times in our bathing clothes. Bed is uncomfortable. Very clean and spacious room bathroom. Food quality is average. To sum it up the service is poor compared to Four Seasons and other five star hotels in Dubai.

I am staying here for four nights. I checked in yesterday and I must say that the service so far is much lower than expected 5 star resorts. My family and I just spent a 4 night stay in Ritz Carlton JBR and a big difference has been noted. First of all upon checking in yesterday late in the afternoon expecting rooms to be ready the rooms I have requested were not available and instead of being apologized to by the front desk Manager I get no response other than that they have no other alternative option until the next day. What made the experience even worse is the patronizing attitude of that same manager. Other negatives in the room No toothbrush ready in the room unles you request it and it takes long time to get things from housekeeping. No plastic bottled water in the room all is provided in glass bottles which can be be a hazard when having little children around. Of note the front desk promised to show me another alternative room solution later in the evening and no one even bothered to contact me.

I have just read a review of this place headed Do not go there from someone staying at the same time as us and felt compelled to provide an accurate and fair review so here goes. the hotel has the usual design flair that we think epitomises four season properties great decor big open spaces trendy but comfortable restaurants sea fu is excellent and outstanding staff who combine efficiency with a friendly and helpful approach. We particularly liked the pool area as there were two similar sized pools one for adults and one for families. We chose the adult pool and found it peaceful and relaxing. The only criticism was piped music but it was not an issue for us. As far as the beach and view are concerned it is not the best sea view in the world that is true to the far right there are three tower blocks going up but they are quite a way away and we did not hear any noise. On the left hand side there is some sand moving work going on and there are a couple of cranes and an occasional loud thud and small amount of banging but again it did not affect our relaxation at all and we are pretty sensitive to noise. The kids in the family pool would have been more of an issue for us if there had not been an adult pool. We had a deluxe room which was excellent we have had junior suites that are smaller than this one. Overall this is a first class hotel and I am sure 99 guests out of a hundred would agree.", "offset": [718, 930], "date": "2016-04-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "82a98fb2-c05e-46d1-84be-f3ceac5a4b2a", "sentence": "Swayed by tender coconuts and warm smiles. Disclaimer. This is a venue review that does not include rooms. I had organised a large event at the Al Dana Ballroom and as hosts we were among the last to sit down to dinner late after most of the guests had left. When a tray of soft drinks was passed around I spotted a clear coloured drink among the many coloured glasses and asked someone if that was tender coconut water. It was not. It was just SpriteAbout 15 minutes later there was a quaint serenade of sorts as some folks came around to my table in a tiny procession. Held aloft on a tray were a tender coconut with a straw and two glasses of clear drinks clearly the ambrosia contained inside. Then they presented it to me and to my co host with a flourish and a flurry of smiles. Apparently one of the young men in charge had overheard me asking that first question and just figured out my wish all by himself. And he proceeded to fulfill it surprising and delighting me in the process. This in essence is what you should expect at Four Seasons all that you would not think to expect and then some more. Thank you good people and I am certainly coming back for more grand venues mega events tender coconuts smiles and keenly attentive young staff.", "offset": [55, 106], "date": "2016-06-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "788a0c58-642b-43f1-81eb-6ac9092725c4", "sentence": "Excellent hotel very good property and super views and extra ordinary staff and restaurants.

After a long haul from Los Angeles we arrived at this beautiful and serene resort and were greeted with sincere professionalism. While our room was not ready which we anticipated our bags were stored and we were escorted to the outdoor breakfast dining patio shown around and told we could lounge on premises until our room became available. After dining we relaxed at the pool and were happy to find that not only were there 2 pools one family and one adult thankful for this since we were not traveling with our family with plenty of lounge chairs and attentive pool service but also a pristine beach. Never did any children venture into the adult pool area nor could you hear them at the family pool which is a first for us. Both pool areas were beautifully outfitted with plenty of attentive staff and more than enough lounges another first especially over the holidays. We found the beach to be equally staffed with attentive service and lots of lounges. When our room was ready we were fetched and escorted to a beautiful and spacious environment updated with beautiful colored walls rich fabrics patterned carpeting with a soothing color palette and luxe bath suite note hair dryer is in a drawer with a cord that is not long enough and you have to hold down continuously on a button to operate gr plus ample closet space. The room offered an expansive view and spacious balcony. Be prepared however that ongoing island building is still taking place which is in your view line but there is no noise and you still enjoy beautiful ocean and hotel grounds views not really a negative but one should know. After relaxing for 2 days and unwinding in the luxe spa where we had ah mazing massages we finally were ready to venture out and explore Dubai. The concierge staff was very VERY accommodating and helped us pick and choose what tours might appeal to us and what restaurants to try while out and about. We also dined at all onsite restaurants which we found to be top notch one of the reasons we always choose to stay at a Four Seasons all over the world and we are never let down. The only down side is that there is only one restaurant for breakfast and it is a buffet the only other place to have breakfast is in the lobby salon area not really conducive to lounging in your swimwear and relaxing especially in this formal atmosphere meaning Dubai overall is more formal and conservative in their dress than we are in the United States however it is the perfect spot for coffee tea cocktails or a light meal snack. We opted to stay in this resort like location as we did not want to be in a city environment with lots of action and high rise buildings however it is close enough to take a cab being less than 15 minutes away.", "offset": [142, 354], "date": "2017-02-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "f884d5e4-7552-4e83-99ac-3df658471faa", "sentence": "Exceptional.
