The setting. You are 15 20 minutes north of LIH Airport. The property is 5 minutes south of the tourist hub of Kapa\u2019a. There is a large Long \u2019s Pharmacy store just before the parking lot to the hotel with all the conveniences food drinks and beach needs one may want. They had great prices on macadamia nuts and local coffee. The property has a massive parking lot and when we arrived at 11 pm most of the spots were occupied. The spots are ruled very narrow I was afraid that our car would get dinged every time we parked. The main entrance was beautifully lit up at night. The reception area was a small nook in an otherwise large spacious and open air lobby. There was a bell hop station and a tourist desk near reception. The restaurant the serves breakfast is also off the lobby as is the bar and the entrance to the pool. We were upgraded from a garden view room to an ocean front room due to elite status with the hotel chain. However no one acknowledged our honeymoon even though I notified the hotel and even let the reception know after checking in. This was in stark difference to being congratulated at check in at the Courtyard in Kona. On the other hand we were impressed that reception waved the resort fee and gave us two free Mai Tai coupons due to our status. We also opted for the 10 person day food discount due to our status. The room. Our oceanfront room was at the end of the farthest building from the lobby. We had to walk through two wings to get to our room. There was a small lot next to our wing with an entrance to the building which was convenient. However it was impossible to access the beach or the grounds from our building one must walk all the way to the lobby in order to do so which is inconvenient and annoying. The room was huge and had a large king size bed a cabinet housing a flat panel TV the coffee maker and the mini fridge. There was no tea or tea maker in the room so if you bring your own be prepared for the taste of coffee in your tea from the coffee maker. There was a desk and chair as well as a couch with a coffee table. There was a large balcony directly facing the ocean. Watching the sunrise from the balcony was a beautiful moment. There was a yoga class at sunrise just under our balcony. The closet contained a safe. There was also a small bathroom and a second vanity with a sink just outside the bathroom. The water pressure in the shower was strong but the shower head was tiny. The toiletries were cheap Paul Mitchell brand. The d\u00e9cor of the room was dated and could use a refresher. The bathroom and vanity were badly dated and should be remodeled ASAP. The free WiFi worked great in the room and throughout the property and the TV had all the cable channels one would want. The laundry room was convenient but only accepted coins. The grounds. The pool was large and had a fire feature installed at its perimeter. The bar was just off the pool. There was also a large Jacuzi off the pool. The showers were oddly placed in the corner of the pool and were not easily visible from the beach. The pool area was nicely designed with modern touches. This was in stark contrast to the dated d\u00e9cor throughout the rest of the property. The beach here is beautiful but not swimable. There is a concrete wall built five feet from the edge of the water which keeps the surf from pounding onto the beach and eroding the sand. The strip of water from the beach edge to the concrete wall is very rock and one could easily get hurt entering or exiting the water. The narrow channel of water also has a serious undertow as the water which makes it over the breaker wall tries to escape back into the ocean. The landscaping fronting the beach is lovely with trees and green grass but this is not a swimable beach so beware. The food. We tried the 25 person breakfast buffet. This buffet is not worth the price tag it comes with. Selections are limited and you are much better off ordering a la carte. We enjoyed the Loco Moco an egg over a burger patty drowned in gravy with friend onions and mushrooms over rice. One item that annoyed me was labeling the breakfast syrup which is just high fructose corn syrup as maple syrup. This is not a five star hotel so I did n\u2019t expect real maple syrup but mislabeling in such a way is unethical and must be stopped. I complained to the restaurant manager but this was not changed during the three days we were there. All in all we loved our spacious ocean front room and the cheap breakfast thanks to the 10 person day coupons we had. The location tends to get a lot of rain so use it as a base for your beach time on the southern side of the island. Do n\u2019t book this place thinking you can just laze about and enjoy the beach here. It is rainy most of the time and too rocky to swim.", "offset": [1522, 1615], "date": "2019-01-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "d9451aea-85e0-461e-a3ad-9d9802e54e77", "sentence": "Where is the Managment.

The nearby public beach Lydgate was perfect for swimming. We got an updated room but lots of the hotel still under construction. The bathroom was rather small though and no bathtub so trying to bathe baby took some logistical planning. Also toilet is super load when flushing. Loud enough to hear your neighbors flushing. And no air circulater in the bathroom so bring some air fresher. Staff very nice and accommodating. Storage room where the baby cribs are kept definitely had cockroaches so we declined the crib. Did not see any roaches in our room or the hallways. As long as you do not leave any food out you will not attract any bugs. Self service laundry was very expensive. No place to fill up water bottles and coffee only available during early hours unles you order through the restaurant or room service. The pool area was renovated and gorgeous also very slippery. Cellular service was spotty in certain places.", "offset": [683, 735], "date": "2019-12-12", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "d15f3df8-3fb0-4e68-8ba9-ae9995b4e9aa", "sentence": "Inconsistent service windy beach and not so updated refurbished old hotel. Definitely not up to Sheraton standard. I spent a week with my family 2 kids 10 12 at Sheraton Coconut Beach hotel and definitely not enjoyed the hotel on so many levels. To begin with we requested our room to be ready for 3 pm arrival through the mobile ap and the room was not ready. It was not ready even 2 hours later. They welcomed us with the fact that this is not quite Sheraton hotel and we can not use our status privileges. No breakfast included and pretty much we should have been thankful that we had a room there. Very unpleasant and rude welcome to this hotel. We spend over 80 nights a year with Mariot and have never seen anything like that. Next day different crew and the breakfast was included for us. Lobby staff was very unaware and incompetent in their job based on our stay. Breakfast restaurant Overall very inconsistent service as well. Our lattes had different price every day although our order was exactly the same. The kids juices usually were served at the same time with the bill at the end of breakfast. Rooms I can not quite picture where the remodeling part was. The rooms needed a deep cleaning for sure it felt like whatever they have remodeled they just left and forgot to clean up before allowing people in. The beds are very soft and uncomfortable the pillows are extremely soft do not understand the purpose of it. The daily cleaning service included just the fix of our beds and fresh towels. For the 4 of us they were leaving only 2 towels no matter how many times we requested them to make a note that we need four. One or two towels every day had some kind of stain spots indicating they did not clean them properly. The hotel is on the windiest beach on the island. The beach is nice but you can not really enjoy it due to the wind. The wind never stopped for the entire time we were there. This might be a reason to the tree to be so leaning away towards the hotel. The beach is windy the pool side is windy as well you can not find a place to avoid it no matter where you go. The fire pits around the pool are lovely in the evening but again with so much wind is hard to enjoy even a single drink. The tiles around the pool the breakfast restaurant and the lobby was quite slippery. There were a lot of signs about that but that can not prevent slipping. Why they put such a slippery surface tiles when they remodeled the pool yard. Overall very disappointed stay at this hotel. Definitely the service was not up to SPG standards.", "offset": [796, 872], "date": "2020-01-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "d15f3df8-3fb0-4e68-8ba9-ae9995b4e9aa", "sentence": "Inconsistent service windy beach and not so updated refurbished old hotel.
