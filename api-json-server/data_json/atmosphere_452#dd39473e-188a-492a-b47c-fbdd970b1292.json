What can I say about this resort that would do it justice. My cousin and I just came back from a 5 night 6 day stay at the Paradisus Cancun and we could not be more pleased with the hotel the staff the food and the overall experience. I have stayed at a number of all inclusive resorts in the past and consider myself to be very picky when it comes to service cleanliness and food quality. This resort had it all and then some. I highly recommend booking the royal service as it does make a difference in your stay. There is complimentary access to the spa an assigned butler premium drinks in the royal only lounge an exclusive adults only pool and many other added perks. I want to send a HUGE shout out and THANKS to Rosana our butler only female butler who was the kindness sweetest and most pleasant person I have come in contact with during my travels. She did everything to make sure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. She really went above and beyond and deserves all the praise for her hard work. Ask for her if you decide to get the royal service. In terms of food we mainly ate at the restaurants for dinner and they were all fantastic. Excellent service great food quality lots of choices for vegetarian dishes and an extremely accommodating staff. The buffet had a lot of options but mainly greasy oily buffet food which i am not really into so if that is your thing there are tons of options. From the check in process to the constant greetings of the staff to the pool concierge the waiters the food quality and the room comfort. Everything was top notch. Throughout the trip we were treated and felt like royalty. Sandra at the royal concierge was extremely pleasant helpful and attentive. Daniel our pool concierge checked in on us several times throughout the day to make sure we were enjoying our cabana time. He even came by with fruit kabobs popsicles AND brought back my cousins missing hat from the lost and found. Special mention to the manager Daniel and our waiter Gamaliel at Fuego who were extremely customer service oriented and were very much about making sure our dining experience was top notch. Here are a few other bullet points to consider in case you go1. the hotel is dimly lit with mood lighting in the evenings so do not be thrown off by that2. the elevators need a bit of sprucing up but they are working on it3. the Nespreso bar in the main pyramid is an added bonus4. the royal pool concierge has banana boat sun block and tanning lotions in case you forget yours5. If you want something special for your room just ask. They will try to make it hapen6. Room service food was excellent but you have to wait at least 30 45 min for it to arive7. Spa is small but the hydrotherapy was great to end the day with.

Eat at the wonderful Naos restaurant. Travel Tales. Cancun Captivates and Caters to All Family Members AlikeIt Is So Much More than a Just a Spring Break DestinationSubmited by. Trisha WalsheFamily Member Names Trisha Owen and Aiden Walshe and Pat Stenson We traveled to Cancun Mexico. We went the week of December 12th to 19th 2015We were away for eight days and seven nights. Grandparents Jerry and An Schmid my father and stepmother accompanied the four of us on the vacation. We vacationed in Cancun last Spring Break and had a wonderful time. This time we stayed at Paradisus Club Melia and enjoyed amazing accommodations superb service and delicious dishes each day and night. The weather was perfect each day of our stay it was 85 degrees with brilliant sunshine low humidity and a gentle tropical breeze. Although our resort offered nine restaurants from which to choose each evening we dined at Naos Restaurant which was so much more than a standard buffet. Each night the carnivores ate different Mexican dishes ranging from fish like sea bass freshly caught that day from the Sea of Cortez to various cuts of succulent beef and chicken with sauces like habanero and scrumptious side dishes like hearty beans and plantains. Personally I was offered unique delectable Mexican vegetarian rice and pasta dishes with locally grown asparagus mushrooms and peppers. Granted my sons could not resist the aromatic franks and crisp fries at dinner each night but they did try and found that they liked new vegetables like jicama and chayote and fruits like papaya and guava. Further the dessert bar was to die for showcasing an array of exquisitely created decadent confections. Also we really enjoyed the high caliber wine that we were offered and savored its exceptional quality. Additionally there were some excellent rums to sample and a tasty Xtabentum a famous Mayan liqueur made from honey and anise to try. The restaurants manager Juan de Dios was the consummate host and leader of this top notch establishment. He meticulously ensured that all of our culinary and service needs were fulfilled by the head chef Chef Moses and his cooking staff and the doting waitstaf most notably our servers Miguel and Eduardo. Ultimately Juan went above and beyond his role and we know consider him a veritable member of our extended family. See the attached picture of all of us following dinner our last wondrous eveningWhile the boys swam in the pools and frolicked in the waters of the Sea of Cortez with Jerry and An my mother and I leisurely either lounged in the shade of the cushy cabana or basked in the vibrant omnipresent sunlight reading a copious number of books as devoid of electronic devices as possible. The Mexicans who we met were extremely friendly and gracious. They patiently taught us any Spanish words or phrases that we did not know. They embraced us and our stories and shared details of their own families as they got to know ours. We were able to eat dinner at the table as a family for hours each evening uninterrupted engaging in meaningful conversations a feat nearly impossible with the hustle and bustle of our daily hectic lives at home. In fact ultimately this vacation gave us the golden opportunity to spend quality time with each other and bond as a family as we never have done before. There were no disappointing parts of our stay. If pressed I would only say that the one minor disappointment was dealing with the monsoon like rain on the Saturday morning that we were leaving for home. Although it helped ease some of the bittersweet nature of our departure the weather did cause poor visibility on the roads and unceremoniously doused us along with our luggage when we arrived at the airport. But obviously there is no controlling Mother Nature better inclement conditions at the very end of a vacation than during oneBased upon our last stay we would certainly return and plan to do so from April 30th to May 7 2016My recommendations for other travelers would be stay at Paradisus Club Melia and eat at its Naos Restaurant and prepare to experience a magical once in a lifetime unforgettable vacation.", "offset": [2360, 2738], "date": "2016-03-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "56577baf-e863-49de-8f97-c509275e05c3", "sentence": "I can now say I have had a butler and I loved it.

Other favorite spots included Market Grill and Mole for dinner Naos and Blue Agave for lunch and espressos from Nespreso bar. We were impressed with the grand interior of the lobbies the design of the rooms and the beautiful beachfront and sprawling pools. This was my first all inclusive experience and I have never had such a relaxing vacation before. I had high expectations for the trip and they were exceeded.

Asunci\u00f3n was extremely attentive to our needs. Our ice bucket was always filled with beers and water. Asunci\u00f3n was notable for her speedy service and fantastic drink recommendations mango colado banana monkey mudslide among others but we quickly came to appreciate her playful friendly personality. Her English skills are excellent and she is very funny. We looked forward to talking to her throughout the day and even took a picture with her before we left. Of course we have fond memories of Cancun in general and our time at Paradisus specifically but Asunci\u00f3n was the person who most directly contributed to our positive experience.

Our butler Layner went above and beyond to make us feel special by decorating our room with rose petals sending berries and champagne and made sure we were in direct contact with the people we needed to be. Julio at the pool far surpassed any server we have ever encountered. He remembered our faces and the second he saw us came out with our preferred drinks before we even asked.

I do not normally leave reviews however this was a very interesting stay that I had at the Paradisus. we will start with what we loved about the hotel. Staff A large majority of the staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. Most of the staff work multiple zones throughout the day so they get to know you. For breakfast Hosts Vanessa and Noemi and waiters Martin and Pascal were incredibly nice and welcoming. Our bartenders at Avenue bar Luis Luis were fantastic. We would come and grab a few drinks to take to our room and by the second night they already knew what we wanted. Orlando from the Blue Agave restaurant was fantastic as well. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous. You can tell they take pride in keeping the common areas clean and well maintained. Overall the food in the hotel was great. You can not go wrong at the buffet and we went there almost everyday for some meal. Blue Agave Bana the sushi restaurant and Enzo were our favorites. Now for some things we did not love about it. Restaurants Making reservations for the restaurants is rather difficult. If you decide that day what restaurant you want to eat at you have to book before 5 PM. You can walk over but they make it seem like there is going to be a ridiculously long wait even though the hotel was largely unoccupied. Every restaurant we went to was pretty empty and we dined at various times between 7 and 10 PM throughout our stay. We came back from an excursion at 10PM exactly I ran down to let the host know we were going to take ten minutes to change and she said she could not hold the reservation. There were four occupied tables in a restaurant of 40 tables. The room left a lot to be desired. The bedside outlet was ripped out of the wall and a few lights did not work alongside the poorly laid out lights throughout. There were no hooks in the bathroom and the bathtub spout did not work. The balcony had a great view of the ocean but they plant shrubs on the balcony to act as privacy. They directly block your ocean view when you are sitting down. The mini fridge was fully restocked every day which is awesome but the water bottles are glass and they do not provide you with a bottle opener. I get that these are small things but they should be thought about from a guest convenience aspect. The pool bar is only open 11 to 6. So if you want to grab seats early because they filled up quick you had only be able to drink brunch drinks within the breakfast area. Instead of making the pool a dry area until 11 confine it to brunch drinks until then. Finally upon checkin they offer you time the next morning to plan out excursions and get a discount on other facilities in the hotel like the spa. In reality they sit you down for a Timeshare pitch that took up 2 hours of our day.", "offset": [2246, 2345], "date": "2020-02-12", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "5185e8a9-7656-48bf-a341-6f0f4ae6c639", "sentence": "Another Great Stay at Paradisus Cancun.

One improvement we noticed this year was that the beach area was roped off which prevented the countless number of people walking on the beach trying to sell things to tourists from walking through the palapas and annoying guests. It also gave a greater feel of exclusivity. Through the years we \u2019ve always found the staff to be receptive to our requests and needs. One staff member at Club Melia check in Karina has seen us return through the years and always greats us as friends. It \u2019s easy to see why she \u2019s been promoted to a management position which she certainly deserved.

We first went in March 2018 and were so impressed with the service amenities and attention to detail that we decided to come back March 2020. Sadly the resort seems to be suffering financially and started cutting corners making the experience less impressive. The servers are less attentive often you have to get your own coffee and drinks after waiting over 20 mins to be served they no longer offer the barista who would make cappuccinos or other drinks for you the hot crepe station disapeared the room no longer gives you a welcome souvenir to remember your trip. Bottled water was eliminated and you have to settle for refilled cups which is harder to take to the beach with you. The kids club has 1 or maybe 2 staff trying to look after 10 or 12 kids and often the parents have to stay with the kids due to limited supervision. The door lock mechanism in our room broke locking us out and the 5 mins we were told it would take for staff to come fix it turned into 40 mins. We needed a bed for my toddler as we had booked a room for 3 and it took 2 days for them to bring up the extra cot. The fridge did not work in the room. The buffet previously had themed nights even one night was steak and lobster on the last trip. This time the buffet had the same items every night without variation and the a la carte had mostly buffet items they were just brought to you instead. We kept having to exchange the beach towels because they would be given out stained. I realize these things may seem silly to some and of course the beach was lovely. The only outstanding thing was the spa which had incredible service I am guessing maybe because its 215 for a massage so they want to ensure the customer is satisfied. I just wanted to point out some of our concerns because it was all the little things that made this resort stand out in our minds. The servers were so quick and efficient on the last trip the food was amazing and the resort seemed to go all out with the attention to detail.

There are shops an ice cream parlor a coffee shop with amazingly delicious coffee and a waffle cafe. On the second floor there is an excellent bar with amazing view on the sky blue ocean. Also there is a night club for dance lovers If you want to work out the hotel offers a small gym but there you will find everything you need for your workout. Nearby is a spa and treatments. In the middle of the hotel is a Japanese sushi restaurant and a great bar with a divine cocktail menu. Recommend. The hotel has several pools and bars. In the evenings there are shows. On the left is the VIP zone there we stayed 2 nights. Towels are provided for each guest on the beach there are sun loungers and the waiter always walks and offers cocktails and food hotel rooms There are a lot of hotel rooms. Everything is divided into sectors. the hotel guest rooms are not very impressive. The design is the most common. In our room on the second day the sink falled down but after our complaint when we left for breakfast it was quickly repaired. But at the same time the room has everything you need a bathrobe minibar slippers shampoos etc. The rooms in the VIP zone are of course different from the regular zone. Very comfortable design made in blue and white the bathroom is made in the form of a transparent cube aquarium. The view from the room overlooks the ocean. Great start to the day. Breakfast is held in the restaurant with individual service when in the usual area breakfast is held like a self service buffet.

I had a birthday day but hotel personnel bringed some birthday cake to me only for my boyfriend request. The hotel is located on the coastline with a nice and very clean beach. The staff is kind and helpful. A lot of awesome waiters. Unfortunately I do n\u2019t remember everyone by name. But if they can read it i am very thankful for you all for greatest job. At the reception we came across a very angry girl and a displeased girl but we tried not to pay attention From the beginning When the doors to the hotel open you are immediately overcome by a pleasant trail of aroma oils fresh flowers and lots of vibrant blooming greenery are around. The feeling that you really arrived in a Paradise. The hotel has many restaurants for every taste. Mexican was my favorite Spanish grill restaurant and others. There are shops an ice cream parlor a coffee shop with amazingly delicious coffee and a waffle cafe. On the second floor there is an excellent bar with amazing view on the sky blue ocean. Also there is a night club for dance lovers If you want to work out the hotel offers a small gym but there you will find everything you need for your workout. Nearby is a spa and treatments. In the middle of the hotel is a Japanese sushi restaurant and a great bar with a divine cocktail menu. Recommend. The hotel has several pools and bars. In the evenings there are shows. On the left is the VIP zone there we stayed 2 nights. Towels are provided for each guest on the beach there are sun loungers and the waiter always walks and offers cocktails and food hotel rooms There are a lot of hotel rooms. Everything is divided into sectors. the hotel guest rooms are not very impressive. The design is the most common. In our room on the second day the sink falled down but after our complaint when we left for breakfast it was quickly repaired. But at the same time the room has everything you need a bathrobe minibar slippers shampoos etc. The rooms in the VIP zone are of course different from the regular zone. Very comfortable design made in blue and white the bathroom is made in the form of a transparent cube aquarium. The view from the room overlooks the ocean. Great start to the day. Breakfast is held in the restaurant with individual service when in the usual area breakfast is held like a self service buffet. The food is everywhere delicious. we was satisfied. especially the mexican restaurant. After staying at this hotel I gained 3 kg of weight. In general the hotel is really chic but it would be nice to make more interesting rooms and corridors. \u041c\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0432
