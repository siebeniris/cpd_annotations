The resort is wonderful great grounds and pool area. The family room we had was lovely as well large and overlooking the golf course. There are many food options and the food is generally very good. The gym is great as well and I had a fabulous massage at the spa. The resort is walking distance to Aventura mall although I believe there is a shuttle as well. The resort was extremely busy during the holidays and hence seating at the main pool was a challenge. Retrieving cars from valet parking also often required some patience.

The staff extended the rate and stay for our folks who made a vacation out of the weekend. Dinner at the Steakhouse was INCREDIBLE everyone just raved about the food. A few members took advantage of the golf course. Although the course was at the top of their usual level of play the caddy made it so much fun and not a stuffy country club experience at all. Other directors enjoyed the amenities and the spa services WOW they were just thriledIn short the entire event was handled so professionally it made my planning a breeze and over 20 happy guests.

There is a great kids club gym spa tennis courts resort pool with slides and a lazy river separate adult pool private beach access and beautiful golf grounds. The private beach is not on the property but they provide a shuttle which takes about 10 mins to get there. There are two great restaurants on the property. One family oriented and the other is upscale. Supermarkets and pharmacies are also in walking distance from the hotel. The hotel provides a regularly scheduled shuttle to Aventura Mall which is located across the street. The mall has lots of hi end stores a great food court and several restaurants with various cuisines to choose from. Great options for lunch and dinner. In addition the close proximity to the mall provides access to movie theaters Color Me Mine pottery painting and other entertainment options for the family. The hotels scenic location is great for walking running and bike riding. Bike rental is available. The staff has also been very helpful from the front desk clerks especially Ray valets housekeeping and waiters tresses.

We stayed at Turnbery for three nights during a conference. We enjoyed the hotel although I can see why others do not feel that it has a true luxury feel. They do not do evening turndown service and they do not have very many amenities in the room. This was not an issue for us but if people are expecting luxury I can see why they notice this. I loved the outside path around the resort for running and the fitness room was nice and large. The locals use the fitness room and so it is a little awkward because they have their trainers and they take over the area etc. so as long as you are okay getting right in there as a hotel guest you are fine. I did not try the spa because it was very expensive and it was not something that I wanted to try for that price. I liked the pool area by the water slide and the wait staff were excellent there. I had the mahi tacos polside and they were very good and the service was again excellent. We were constantly disappointed that the bar closed at midnight particularly when we were there for a conference and there were so many of us that wanted it to stay open later. The catered food was good at the conference and the lunch boxes that were packed were fineit is a nice older hotel with rooms overlooking the golf course and it does not have a fun kid feel to it so I do not know if I would bring our children here on a family vacation but for our conference it was good.

Nothing crazy but significantly more usage of the pool area on Saturday then the rest of the time I was there. My son 4 years old loved both the water slide and the lazy river. I spent most of the first day I was there running from one to the other with him. We had lunch by the pool once it was just fine the margaritas polside were better than the food. The resort has a free shuttle to both the Aventura mall which is very close and a local beach that was a 10 15 minute ride on the shuttle. They drop you at Sole by the Ocean and you get two beach chairs and an umbrella if you provide your room key at the beach. The restuarant at Sole has bar and food service to the beach. We opted to eat at the picnic tables by Soles pool rather than at the beach chairs. Food was pretty good and the sangria was great. We actually ended up spending more time at the beach then at the pool. The hotel room was spacious and very nicely appointed. I received an upgraded resort view room in one of the newer towers. It had a pull out couch so no need for a double bed room for us. All in all it was a relaxing trip that hit the spot for my family. Plenty of restaurants and shopping easily accessible with the mall nearby and a great beach option available via shuttle. I imagine I will return when I need a quick and easy getaway.
