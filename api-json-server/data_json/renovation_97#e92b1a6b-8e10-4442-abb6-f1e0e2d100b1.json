I booked four rooms for one night for family members driving from out of town for my sons wedding reception. We were upgraded to the 6th floor and received free breakfasts. The rooms are old and needs renovation but the bedding was awesome. The duvets and pillows were comfy. Our rooms had a small fridge and microwave. Bonus was the parking and wifi. They were Free. This is rare nowadays in the OC. Overnight parking runs around 30 to 40 a night in most Newport Beach hotels. This hotel is close to the airport and restaurants. The front desk people are very helpful and friendly. The pool was decent. The bar inside was also nice. The breakfast buffet was okay and you can even order your eggs a la carte if you do not care for the scrambled eggs.

NO HELP FROM SECURITY AFTER WE CALLED FRONT DESK. I had to confront THE SITUATION MY SELF AT MIDNIGHT in the hallway. Also on a separate night DIFFERENT PEOPLE 130 AM A LOUD PARTY in the room next to us. DID GET SOME HELP THIS TIME WITH A PHONE CALL FROM FRONT DESK to that party to shut them down. Then 630 AM after the 130 am party. a MAINTENANCE WORKER was working in the Stairwell attached to our room awakened us out of the brief sleep after the Party Shutdown. the Maintenance worker was going from Floor to Floor ascending to our Top Floor while SLAMMING STAIRWELL DOORS HEAVY BOOT STOMPS all the way up the stairs to our room. I got out of bed into the hallway to see what was this craziness all about. As the worker exited the stairwell into the hallway next to our Room door he SLAMMED THE HEAVY METAL FIRE DOOR and in a GRUFF ANGRY MOOD walked right past me like he was on a Mission. AS I ASKED HIM WHY SO MUCH NOISE. Not a happy camper. Not our Favorite Hotel. Especially when you consider that AFTER CHECK OUT our Paper Receipt CORRECT WAS NOT THE SAME AMOUNT OUR CREDIT CARD WAS CHARGED. We were OVER CHARGED 100. it took 30 min. on the phone with 3 different front desk people before I could get help from anyone who knew HOW TO PUT THROUGH A CREDIT OF 100 TO OUR CR CRD.

I have spent quite a bit of time at this hotel for business. The pool is one of my favorites. it is heated and large enough to get a good work out doing some laps. The whirlpool next to it is also awesome great place to unwind or prepare for the day. The fitness facility is also nicely equipped with multiple treadmills freweights up to 50lbs a few cable machines towels and water. I also really love the location. it is just a short drive down to Newport Beach and easy to get on the 405. And unlike a few other hotels in the area you do not have to pay for parking which you should always factor into the overall cost of the stay. But just a couple of points it is literally right next to the John Wayne airport runway. I do not mind the noise too much. The flights stop around 100PM and start around 630AM. So if you are light sleeper you may want to seriously reconsider. I quite like watching the planes take off and land. The second point is that the hotel is a bit dated though they are currently undergoing updates. so there are some oddities such as the plugs which are too far from the nightstands to plug your phone in sliding doors that do not quite slide anymore decor more fitting 1 or 2 decades ago. The third is that the showerheads in the bathroom do not allow very much adjustment. I am 510 and find it awkward to use. If you are taller you will be bending down to wash your head. Overall for me I think if you can get a good deal here it is not a bad place to stay as long as you can deal with the planes.", "offset": [994, 1089], "date": "2017-01-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "c2a796db-48c3-413e-8d7c-3b61bbe70a80", "sentence": "Tired Hotel planned upgrade can not come soon enough.
