The valet parking is nice but charges you a daily fee. We were never given the option or direction to self park only valet parking and a nice charge on our bill.

I stayed at the Mariot Tampa for a convention. The staff was exceptionally nice from the front desk to the concierge lounge. They were nice and helpful. There was a maintenance issue that kept reocuring but the staffs efforts to accommodate was great. Hazel Williams stayed on top of the issue and eventually had me moved to a nicer room with a porch. She checked on me each time she saw me to make sure everything was good. Also Carl Fuller in the Concierge Lounge was very helpful in providing the services there. He made sure we were aware that they were pulling down the continental breakfast so we would have an opportunity to go back one last time. The gym leaves something to desire with just a few pieces of equipment which was a surprise for a hotel of that size. The hotel is very conveniently located food convention center trolley downtown interstate to name a few. The key for the stay was the the great customer service.

I recently attended a conference and had the choice between the Mariot or Westin. I did not hesitate when I chose the Mariot based on my stays at other Mariot properties. I quickly realized I may have buyers remorse. The room was nice enough however the 2 or 3 elevators would be down all at the same time. This left only 1 remaining elevator working. As a result the line to get into an elevator would be longer than a Disneyland attraction ride. The gym was efficient enough. The staff was also nice.

This was our fifth stay here prior to a Caribbean cruise. We cruise often from Port of Tampa and in the past have stayed at Hyat Embassy Suites Residence Inn among others.

There were more than the usual traffic detours and road closures due to construction. Thankfully our GPS compensated for the many detours and we arrived close to noon. Check in was smooth And we were upgraded to a water view room on the 25th floor. Our room was in excellent condition very clean and attractive. The mattress was very comfortable towels large and fluffy and a large tv with numerous channels. Unlike our most recent stay here all elevators were running without incident. We love to have drinks on the outside patio overlooking the marina river walk and savor Johny Walker with others who enjoy a cigar.

Staff is trained to move quickly to watch and anticipate a guests needs thereby making for a very efficient operation. New elevator system and investments in Pool area make the experience that much better versus previous years. Very early last Sunday morning I was staring out at the rain in an empty rear area of the lobby. An employee came over and asked if there was anything they could do assist.
