My Wife and I stayed at Hotel Penn on the recommendation of a couple of friends due to its location and relative cost in comparison to competition in the area. My parents even stayed here when its was a Hilton in the very early 1980s. With the exception of the very lovely looking lobby I do not think much else had been changed since then even the sheets. Having never been to New York before we never knew the ease off access it is to get around the city and placed ourselves in the center Next time well aim for Brooklyn or Alphabet City. Our room was on a smokers level even though my Wife is asthmatic. The TV had no reception except for 1 channel and the fridge had not been cleaned or maintained since last century. The bathroom had mold all through the cracked and chipped tiles the bed sheets were torn and worn through. We were finally moved out of our room when we woke up on the second morning to water running through our bathroom. After being moved to a room on an upper non smoking floor my wife realised she had left a book behind in our old room and when we asked the desk or any assistance we were met with rudeness and hostility. To be honest the best people we dealt with who gave us the best experience were the old boys downstairs in the baggage hold area. We had a great chuckle with them when collecting our luggage. it is unfortunate that our experience was the exact same as so many people.", "offset": [1360, 1435], "date": "2015-01-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e259cc39-6aae-418c-ba3a-3d3d128cb202", "sentence": "Skip this hotel.

The location was the only good thing The room was very dirty as we checked in during our stay the cleaner was coming in daily as we have noticed the towels were folded. but the cleanliness was still not up to the standard no hovering no dusting. There were no air conditioning in our room and as usual in central Manhattan the windows could not be opened. One evening we had a visit from a mouse it was tiny but be careful not to leave any food. The breakfast included was one coffee juice and pastry daily where you need to queue in the lobby in the morning with almost all the quests very stressful and chaotic experience. While confronting the hotel about the breakfast as it was not stated that it was continental they said that the are not responsible for any information on the bokingcom.

It was a great location. It is easily accessible. Madison square garden is just right opposite you. Penn Station is next you. I do not think you can get any better hotel on location than this. Times square Empire state building are all at walkable distance. Macys is just over the corner. Plenty of eateries street food available outside the hotel. Luggage storage facility is good 5 per piece. Since we had to check out at 11 and our train was at 340 PM we deposited the luggage and did a short walk around and last minute shopping. I liked this facility. We stayed in room 212A The rooms require maintenance. The AC is old and antiquated. The covering plate was hanging. The toilet paper holder had come off and was precariously hanging. The windowpartial in the bathroom is open to the street and we can not do anything about it as AC is not present in the bathroom. So you can not do much if the weather is freezing or chilly outside. The checkin process is extremely laborious. There is a long queue often reaching the entrance of the hotel. It can be frustrating after a long transatlantic flights. I do not like the queues for getting the breakfast. It is again another 30 45 minutes wait in the morning to redeem your breakfast coupons. The coffee that they supply along with the 1 croissant and juice is very cold by the time you actually drink it. I think it appears to me more of a factory setting than a hotel we all come to expect. I am sure that there can be a better way of delivering a comfortable experience. There is no kettle nor in room coffee making facility. This will help immensely for people who need to get a coffee early in the morning to get their daily routine going. Lamp at the working desk will help a lot for people who work on laptops or do some reading. I heard that they are planning to demolish this hotel and build something new.

I have never felt compelled to review any hotel I have stayed at for the general public to read but this one takes the cake. We pretty much experienced every negative comment other reviews have stated. Long lines free \u201c breakfasts \u201d extra charges etc. There was so much dust on the walls previous occupants had written in it. There are as only 3 outlets in the room 2 of which did n\u2019t work. So good luck watching tv having the lights on using an iron or dryer and charging your devices at the same time. It did n\u2019t happen. We ran out of toilet paper on several occasions we had to call each time as housekeeping did not restock. Same with the towels and wash clothes. We had to call almost daily to get washcloths. We got 2 for the entire 5 day stay with 3 people in our room. The bathtubs are just disgusting. On our last night we came back to find an extra king sized pillow we did not request but only had a standard size pillow case on it. Who wants to lay in thatNormaly I am not too picky as we basically use the room to sleep in as we are always gone all day but this was a HUGE disappointment. The worst thing was CONSTANTLY being bombarded by tour bus salesman right outside the front door. There were generally 3 10 red vests coming at you each and every time you walked in or out the door.

We stayed here last year 2019 and our experience was not very good. This was our first time coming down to see a NY Rangers game and stay over night. The staff was not helpful and our room was pretty dismal and not at all nice. We thought we would give them a second chance since we knew that Hotel Penn was renovating and making changes. I am glad we did. My wife and daughter were much happier and enjoyed being in New York and doing some shopping. Our room was clean modern furniture the room had lots of open space the room was much brighter and the bathroom was clean. The staff person was helpful on our express check in and gave us our tickets for continental breakfast and complimentary drink tickets to Feile or Stout. The continental breakfast was at Cafe R outside of the hotel and down the street a little ways. The breakfast consisted of a large fruit cup bagel or muffin danish and a drink water coffee juice. This worked very well for us and it was well stationed to handle the people coming through. The family was happy. We attended the Rangers game at MSG and lost the game in the last 26 seconds of the 3rd period. A real let down. After the game we went to the Irish Bar Stout and used our drink tickets and that put back a positive spin back onto the evening events. Overall my girls were happy with the shopping the Hotel turn around and were a little disappointed in the Rangers loss. The beauty of it for us was that we took Amtrak down from Syracuse to Penn Station you walk across the street to your Hotel and MSG is right there across the street. No hassles and very easy.

On 4th Floor opposite Madison Square Gardens and next to Penn Station therefore noisy but I grew up in the very centre of London so it is nothing new. Room spacious bathroom too. But both were tired needed refreshment. The room must look about the same as it did when Calvin Coolidge was President. TV gave free to air programming only. I could have done with Netflix. I needed the plumbers explanation as to how to get really hot water. The hotel position is fabulous for easy sightseeing and shopping. Smack in the middle of town. Lots and lots of eating shopping tourist amenities within walking distance. Great for first time visitors. I never saw New York just Manhattan. Manhattan is small vibrant wildly diverse like London with terrific energy packed between Park and Fifth Avenue but strangely quiet when you go West past 9th Avenue where it becomes almost traffic free in the middle of the day. But with all its supertal buildings it has no sense of grandeur and only a little of its Anglo Dutch history remains. I would have liked to see some heritage of the 19th Century robber barons with their self advertising philanthropy. Edith Whartons New York. I expected glamour along Broadway the great White Way or 42nd Street theatres I have always loved Busby Berkeley musicals. But it was disappointing. Broadway seems full of second rate retailers selling saris imitation jewellery and wigs. 42nd street is just a wind blown walk to the Hudson. A Londoner I have visited Paris Rome Lisbon Barcelona Vienna. Palaces parade grounds soaring cathedrals and imperial avenues built for Caesars. Berlin of course is satisfying dreary flat and modern courtesy of RAF Bomber Command to 1945.
