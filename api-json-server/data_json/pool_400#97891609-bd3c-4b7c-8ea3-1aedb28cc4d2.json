The response to resolve was outstanding. THANK YOU. I have not had that experience before. The group genuinely cares. Thank you also for the extended pool hours. Nice to have that available. Most hotels do not provide swimming past the time you provide. THANK YOU again. The only negative is the begs are too small for two people. We had signed up for 4 and would have more than likely have chose another place if we had known just how small the begs were. it is gorgeous and peaceful. Great place for a family or business provided a family of 3 or more gets two connecting rooms.

From the outside it did n\u2019t look like much. However the hotel was very large and beautiful on the inside. I loved the large teepee floor lamps in the lobby and the color scheme throughout. It had a very warm feeling. There were also a couple of nice courtyards with seating including one that contained one of the pools. The hotel had a barber a coffee and pastry stand and a full scale restaurant as you would expect for this caliber of hotel. The restaurant provided good service but the quality of the food was just \u201c OK\u201d. The hotel housed several pools both indoor and outdoor. We decided not to use the facilities due to the number of kids in all the pools. Each floor had a large central seating area next to the elevators. There were four hallways to the rooms that radiated out from there. The rooms were very large. I really liked the entry into the room with the table next to the door to lay down keys and wallet. The placement of the table made it appear a little more grand. The room had a significantly large sized sofa. The bed was very comfortable. The tiled and partially glassed in shower stall was a classy touch. No door to close and you just walked into it. Very nice and modern hardware in the shower and vanity. The TV reception was good. They offered a number of channels with a mixture of HD and analog reception. The wifi signal was somewhat weak. We asked for a refrigerator to keep sodas in and were accommodated. The hotel is located adjacent to Expressway 53 major shopping and numerous restaurants representing all price points.", "offset": [559, 614], "date": "2015-07-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "a0e0f75b-d35b-4173-8c11-1e03b5f105a3", "sentence": "Good choice in the Chicago suburbs for business and leisure travelers.

The wait staff at breakfast was terrific. Very attentive and quick to satisfy. The room was clean with just a few exceptions. Check out went smoothly the location was terrific for we were pretty centralized to what we wanted to do and the hotel itself was pretty updated with lots of technology. Right from the beginning we had to kinda fight for what we paid for. At arrival the woman seemed confused by our reservation through Bokingcom. After 15 minutes she gave us our keys and after a little prodding a general idea on where to park for our room. We picked this hotel because it was close to the mall had breakfast that we could pay for as part of our stay offered shuttle service and had a pool. We did not utilize the shuttle service the pool heater had broken and was not told until we got down there and saw the sign and we had to go to the front desk in the morning to once again ask the confused front desk about getting vouchers for the breakfast we paid for. Then after waiting she answered her phone and walkie talkie several times in the middle of our conversation. The breakfast was particularly sad. The eggs were flavorles the pancakes were cold and falling apart the sausage was of a meat I could not distinguish however the bacon and toast were good. The wait staff was exceptional but when we used our vouchers I noticed it would of cost us 20 a person plus tax for this sad breakfast.
