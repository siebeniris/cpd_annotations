There is a desk plenty of drawers and a fridge with small freezer and microwave. The bed is comfortable. There is a safe. Not large enough for a computer. The water pressure is good and water is hot. There are a lot of plugs for charging. The restaurant has a amazing buffet breakfast. Omelette station fish fruit is great and truly a highlight of the hotel. Great indoors outdoor seating. The grounds are lovely a little tired in spots. The black rock is a focal point for viewing snorkeling and swimming. There were lots of fish in the water and some turtles too.

It was brought to the room in about five hours. did not sPend much time in the room. I know that is true but aesthetically pleasing is a must.

Get cabana D it has the best location and room for chairs in front. Cabana b is by the kids pool area but that is a non issue. Quite private. I had to get my own outside chairs for chairs in the sun.

Spg gold does not get any privileges. Example free valet water in the room that was disappointing. We received pukka shells necklaces. Nice touch. The self parking is beside building six so that was perfect. 250 a day seems too much. Should be included in the resort fee. Taxes are crazy high. Be aware. Seems to be a touch of a money grab.

The hotel location is lovely. Beside the golf course walkable to whalers shops. We really enjoyed the monkey pod restaurant. Row of hotels. Lovely walk on beach. Now the most disappointing thing we did not know. There is no sand on the beach. Why. It was explained to me that the tide takes the sand down to the Weston in the winter and then redeposits back on the Sheraton side in the spring. Did not stop anyone from getting in the ocean. Just no where to sit on the beach. Staff are not overaly nice or enthusiastic. Felt like they were going through the motions. Polite and professional. Is that enough. We stayed in Honolulu and kuaui where the staff were so welcoming. Quite a contrast. Except for Gabriel front desk and Donna at the pool service. They were the exceptions very nice and helpful too.

Not a good start. The ocean view room was very nice and I was glad we did not go with a garden view where some of the rooms are very close to the back sidewalk and in the shadows. The room we had was spacious and clean. The lanai comfortable except for the fact that the guard rail has a 4 bar right at eye level so it was annoyingly obstructive of the view. I was disappointed that there was so much resort ground between us and the ocean though. Had asked for an upper floor room because seeing the ocean was important to me but got a 2nd floor and it was not optimal. Mixed review on the beds my roommate loved it. I found it too hard and felt bruised every morning. The sheets however are wonderful. Soft and luxurious. Housekeeping was very friendly but on 4 of the 10 days we were shorted towels coffee or both.

The noise was not too bad except on one day we had planned on resting in and the noise forced us indoors. The brunch at the Black Rock Kitchen was great and we dined there one night as well. I can highly recommend the risotto dish I had and my roommate loved her wedge salad. If you want to eat at the Tepan Yaki Dan get reservations. we could not get in at the time we wanted. Evenings however be aware that there are dueling musical venues which made being outdoors in the early evening hours difficult. From our lanai we could hear lovely Hawaiian style singing by a single male with a wonderful voice playing what I assume is a ukulele.

When we arrived we were put in an ocean view room on the 2nd floor which everyone walking by could look into.

They said the rooms could be released the next day in the afternoon. I called the next morning and asked when they would be ready. They said they would call as soon as possible. A couple hours later I walked to the front desk and was told the room would be finished shortly but it was a smaller room with one king size bed. They said they would accommodate with a rolaway bed. I thought I better look at it. I did and it was way too small. So after waiting all day I asked if they had anything higher they did. so we moved two floors higher. Still not ocean front. The resort is old the bathrooms are small and in desperate need of renovation. The tile grout was dirty the sink smelled like sewage and the beach was washed away. No where to sit on the beach because of erotion and so many locals. The icing on the cake was at checkout. They charged us ocean front for an ocean view room. They insisted it was ocean front because we could see the ocean from our room. I am a seasoned traveler and I have never heard of that before. I would never stay at this property again. I booked through SPG and they were not aware of the renovations. The property failed to notify them. I was also told that we would receive 35 off at the black rock restaurant.

I ca nt express how disappointed we were in this hotel considering its star rating and price. My now husband and I spent from 123 127 there to celebrate our wedding held off grounds at a private beach honeymoon AND babymon. We booked this vacation through AAA who used Pleasant Holidays to complete the booking. Overall the staff was not what I ve come to expect with a hotel having such a high star rating. There were a few staff members who were polite but did not go out of their way to be friendly. In all honesty I ve been to what would be considered lesser hotel chains ie Best Western Super 8 Motel 6 where the service was better. Funny enough when we mentioned being there for our wedding honeymoon and babymon to multiple staff members including front desk and concierge other than offering a quick congratulations before continuing on with what they were doing before there was nothing further done on the part of the Sheraton Maui staff. While at a nearby resort the concierge there not only congratulated us but excitedly asked us for details and when he found out that there were a few areas we still needed covered put us in touch with the right people even knowing that we were staying at Sheraton Maui and not his resort and followed up to make sure everything was going through all right after the fact. Although the itinerary from Pleasant Holidays showed that we d been reserved an ocean view room with a king size bed and noted that it was for a honeymoon couple the front desk attendant told us that we were getting a room with 2 full size beds but that he would upgrade us to a king size. We were taken to our room and just started getting settled in when I went into the bathroom and realized that there were tiny ants crawling all over the bathroom countertop at least 10 I stopped counting after that. I went out to the bedroom area to let my husband know and then saw a few more tiny aunts crawling around on one of the bedside tables. Immediately thinking that if they were there they might also be in the bed I called up the front desk and let them know. They were able to find us another ocean view room with a king size bed although the view was nt as nice because we were moved from floor 6 to floor 3 and told us that a bellhop would come get us and take us to our new room. We waited probably 15 minutes at least before hearing a knock on the door. Imagine our surprise when it was nt the bellhop but someone sent to fumigate the room not only that but he started spraying the chemicals right away WHILE WE WERE STILL IN THE ROOM AND IM PREGNANT. He left us there shortly after while we were still waiting for the bellhop. After waiting like 30 minutes since I initially called the front desk about the problem I called them again because the bellhop still was nt there. I explained that a man had come to fumigate and the front desk staff even commented that it should nt have happened while we were in the room and followed up with the bellhop should be there shortly that he had gotten sidetracked at the front desk and was delayed in letting the bellhop know. While on the phone with him the bellhop showed up and we moved to our new room. So much for being able to enjoy the resort that night after that debacle. To top it off we soon discovered that our new room was right near an elevator which we could hear at all times of the day from inside our room. Sheraton Maui outlines what you re supposed to be getting out of paying the required resort fee of 25 day in addition to the room fees that you re initially charged. The tote bag is a cheap bag that just says Sheraton Maui on it purely more promotion for them and blue grey. Not once during the entire stay was there a person at the photography desk who s supposed to be able to provide you with at least a free 4x8 photo more if you want to pay for them. The other people at the Information Desk and Concierge Desk said that the photographer should be there sometime maybe they were just out photographing someone else but we never saw them and never got our free photo which we were hoping to get to commemorate our wedding. In addition there s a 22 day charge for self parking your car. So if you got a rental car between parking and resort fees you re essentially paying 50 additional per day once you get there on top of your initial reservation. Although the cover charge to Black Rock Lounge Night Club is listed in my Pleasant Holiday itinerary as being complimentary as part of the resort fee. when I asked the front desk staff about this they told me there was an additional charge. I feel like the resort fee is a sneaky way to get more money out of customers. It should included in the room rates and be charged up front when the reservation is made. The front desk staff tried to give us this story about they have to do it separately because of the discounting that companies like Expedia get and that Sheraton Maui has to still ensure that they make some money but that s just nonsense. The first morning we went to a breakfast orientation for Pleasant Holidays so we were covered. However the second morning we attempted to make coffee and spent a full hour trying to get a cup coffee before realizing that the 13 full cup still was nt filling up and the coffee pot was broken. This put us behind schedule as we were planning to do the Road to Hana that day. The front desk attendant kind of rudely informed us that if we were planning on going to Hana that we should have left by 6 or 7 am by this point it was about 830am but she told us that we could each get a small coffee from the nearby Starbucks stand and that Sheraton would pay for it which they did for the coffee but not the 1 tip that I felt obligated to give. The room was basic at best with minimal furnishings in desperate need of being modernized especially for what Sheraton Maui is charging generally around 60night. The first room we were in had 2 bedside stands the second one only had 1 next to my husband meaning that I had to plug in my cell phone across the room. The one upside was that the balcony on floor 6 was nt large enough that you could even put chairs on the balcony the front desk staff explained that the closer you got to the top of the building the narrower the balconies were but on floor 3 there were chairs on the balcony. There was a small fridge but no microwave. I have to say that the Hilton Garden Inn that we stayed at in Honolulu immediately following with a lower star rating and much lower price was much nicer by comparison in addition to a fridge it also had a microwave a Keurig machine with multiple types of coffees and teas to choose from a much larger and newer tv and modern amenities such as a wonderful new shower and USB ports. As for shower and coffee amenities they were higher quality and refilled daily at the Hilton not so at Sheraton Maui. In addition staying at a lesser hotel like the Best Western you get a free hot breakfast buffet every morning you re there Sheraton Maui charges 30 per breakfast buffet and from what I saw it was nt that great. Finally my husband used the in room iron to get the wrinkles out of his white shirt for our wedding and it ended up leaving marks on the shirt which he had to stop ironing so it would nt completely ruin it. I wo nt deny that the ocean view from the room was beautiful and the grounds were very well kept. The disappointing thing for us was that with the wedding planning we were nt able to enjoy much of the resort amenities especially since the pool closed at 8 pm and the hot tub closed at 10 pm. It looked like Sheraton Maui used to be a very nice resort at one point but is now outdated and in need of modernization especially in comparison to other similarly rated resorts in the area. At checkout the front desk attendant was accommodating and friendly although it was nt until I requested something be done about the resort fees charged due to us losing so much time dealing with little things we should nt have had to at a 4star hotel that she removed two days of fees. It was also disappointing that there was no recognition of us being married on honeymoon or on babymon I mean this was a once in a lifetime trip and they were made aware of that by Pleasant Holidays. Nothing done to make the experience even more special which was very odd to me. I m very well traveled and have been all over the world staying in all different types of accommodations from 5stars to ones that do nt even mention ratings as well as on cruise ships with better customer service. This hotel experience has been the biggest disappointment I ve ever had. I am definitely going to go back to AAA and Pleasant Holidays to let them know about this experience so that they do nt continue to recommend the Sheraton Maui to others. I will also make sure to share with anyone I know planning a trip to Maui. It s also disheartening that while I see Hotel Staff is responding to the bad reviews they re just apologizing for the bad experience and telling people that they hope they l come back again instead of trying to do right by them. When I contacted Sheraton Maui and Starwod Hotels Resorts the overseeing company their response was a canned we re sorry that this was your experience we try to do better than that we hope that you l come back again. oh except they agreed that no one should have came into our room to fumigate with us still in there. But that was it. Not trying to right a wrong or compensate us not worth the 60night that they charge to stay there.", "offset": [9163, 9379], "date": "2018-03-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "7b37fdc3-2c91-4ae7-b91b-2758fe6668e4", "sentence": "Beautiful resort.

Impeccably landscaped grounds pleasant and helpful staff and a sense of calm and relaxation. No blasting music or entertainment beyond the quiet acoustic guitar player in the evening with a traditional Hawaiian dance from a beautiful older lady while the younger generation were lighting the numerous torches spread out all over the hotel grounds helping make a wonderful atmosphere and look every evening. We stayed for 6 days and went whale watching visited the dormant crater the road to Hana and great walks to Lahaina the quaint town nearby. I would highly recommend all those activities. So if ur looking for a quiet and relaxing vacation with beautiful views building 3 on the 6 th floor was just perfect.

This is what set my stay off on a bad foot. I am a gold SPG member and was fortunate enough to be in Maui on a business trip. I booked the Sheraton over other hotels because I assumed I would get the special services that I usually do. However and this appears to be SPGs policy not specific to the Sheraton Maui it turned out I get nothing as a Gold member when I book through Expedia. No upgrade no extra points no welcome drink. it is my companys corporate policy to book all hotels through Egencia Expedia. As someone who actually works in the loyalty industry I can say this is a terrible policy and not at all good for maintaining customer loyalty. In fact when I book future hotel stays I will make sure I stay at a hotel that honors my status. Now as for the hotel itself. It is OK. But it is not fantastic. The lobby is open air and very nice but it is a maze to get to it. The pool is nice as is the whirlpool. But any hotel on this stretch of beach will have that. Another personal pet peeve of mine is that you need to exchange a pool card for towels. I think it can be assumed that if I am paying 30night then I am not trying to steal hotel beach towels.

We stayed here for the last leg of our honeymoon. Taxi from airport was 110. If possible take the shuttle. That was 33 per person. And the way we went home. We arrived when hurricane lane was still active so it meant the shuttles were not running and when we arrived the hotel was quite empty. Our room got upgraded due to our original booked room not being cleaned at that point due to lack of staff. But this worked out nice for us because instead of gardens we got to see the ocean slightly in the distance. Unfortunately for us we were n\u2019t greeted with lei like the other guests after us but we put this down to the threat of the hurricane. That night we were told that you could only have food in the hotel due to the weather and power cuts which was a buffet at 35 per person it was very busy but was tasty. After this once deemed safe and the area was back up and running we ate out every day and started to buy some cereal from the ABC to eat on the balcony for breakfast. The water in the room is 5 a bottle but you can easily pick up a bottle double it \u2019s size for 9c in the ABC at Whalers Village. Failing that the hotel shop is open until 11 pm and it \u2019s cheaper in there too. The rooms have fridges which are quite big and there \u2019s an ice machine on each floor. The hotel room was big clean and spacious. The bed was n\u2019t the comfiest but was clean and large. We ran out of the toiletries several times and the maid did not top up the ones that were needed so we had to take them from the gym. The gym was fair in size and had the essentials for a good work out. There was also shower rooms in there which doubled up as late check out shower rooms. We had a message on our answer phone from a thick southern accent lady inviting us to go and collect our free gift and welcome to the island pack. When we went to the desk to meet her she jumped on us to go and watch the talk for timeshare that \u2019s how you get your free gift. After we politely declined she promptly sent us on our way. Without an island pack or help and to be fair she was actually quite rude. We went back another day and spoke to another lady who gave us the same chat but was not so rude about it and she did give us our free Sheraton bag along with a bunch of leaflets and maps. We had a spa treatment when we were there which was a welcome treat but very expensive. The girls who run the spa we \u2019re lovely. It \u2019s difficult to get a sun bed by the pool unles you get in super early to get your towel down before 7308am. But if you want to pay then you can hire a canopy with a couple of sun beds as some of these tended to be empty. Also as for sun beds on the beach forget that too unles you want to pay around 45 per day. We had noticed that lots of people actually brought chairs and umbrellas from local shops to use throughout their stay and this worked out cheaper if you did it early enough. When we were there I got bitten quite extensively. We were unsure of the cause but I had woken up in the morning covered in bites that turned into hard swollen lumps. We asked at reception if they could help and whether they could spray our room in case of mosquitos and the lady on the desk said that they did n\u2019t get mosquitos there so it \u2019s not something they ofer but we could go to the shop if we wanted to buy something to do it. The following day my hands started swelling so we went back to ask to speak to a first aider which they did not appear to have. The girl on reception called security along to assist. a nice chap came to chat to us and said he could n\u2019t be 100 but was pretty sure it was mosquitos after we showed him a photo of one in our room and offered to take us to the doctor. We decided against it as we were about to leave for our flight home. Also another thing to add was although the hotel room was lovely it was the loudest hotel we \u2019ve ever stayed in. Hawaii wakes up early apparently at like 745am the gardeners are out mowing lawns trimming hedges and hoovering up leaves. And if that does n\u2019t wake you up then next doors air con sounds like a grenade vibrating through the wall so that definitely will. The Sheraton hotel is in a great location. Make sure if visiting you take the beach path all the way down past Whalers Village as there \u2019s access to the other hotel restaurants and depending on where you stop the food it can be more reasonably priced. That \u2019s also where you will find surfers surfing lessons and paddle boarders. Whalers village is a walkable distance on the beach path from the Sheraton and has lots to offer as does the free shuttle to Lahaina. We went to the Sheraton luau which was fun and great to get an insight into the Hawaiian history tradition. The Sheraton also offers a daily rock dive to watch at sunset on the beach. We hired a car during our stay from Enterprise. The girl in the enterprise shop at the hotel again not too sure she knows what \u2019s going she was very clueless but a nice chap helped us out the following day. Parking was free at the hotel for one night. At night take some time to sit out side and look up. You can clearly see Mars Saturn Jupiter Venus. Download the free Sky View lite ap to show you exactly what your looking at. Its a real life planetarium It \u2019s pretty special. All in all we had a lovely honeymoon together. We kept busy and ventured out. Generally the staff did seem pretty clueless when you asked for any advice or help. However there was one lovely blonde lady who I think her name was Corrie who was very friendly helpful when booking the shuttle and Luau. One last thing to mention. On two occasions we were unable to access our room due to the key not working. Both times a maid let us in without checking if it was our room. It was handy for us but just a food for thought.", "offset": [3767, 3879], "date": "2018-09-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 30, "uid": "93c75905-60c7-4095-919a-9bf5e6ca581e", "sentence": "A Pleasant Place With A Great Feel.

We stayed in an ocean front room which was well appointed and had a killer view. The location of the Moana wing is remote but that is part of what makes it special. So it make be a little difficult at first to find the way back to the main building but it is worth it and you will eventually get used to it. Perhaps better signage would be helpful.

I was SO looking forward to staying here the last night of our wonderful trip to Maui but this hotel was a big disappointment. When we pulled into the entrance we had to cross a noisy angry picket line. When we checked in we were informed there was no food available on site and given a list of nearby restaurants. OK not the end of the world there a many lovely places a short walk away and they had a free shuttle running in Kanapali. Then they told us that housekeeping was limited still not a big deal it is just one night we do not really need housekeeping. They upgraded our room to get us away from the noise of the picket line and they did waive the resort fee. I guess as we were standing there in the nearly empty lobby looking at the beautiful ocean none of this seemed so off putting I really just wanted to get to the beach and pool we had driven in from Hana that morning and were just glad to be out of the car. There was no one to help us with our bags and they pointed us back to the car down the driveway towards the mob into the parking garage. From the parking garage we had to take an elevator down cross a walkway to another building another elevator up and then about 100 yards to the room schleping all of our stuff. Not my favorite but still doable. Thing were starting to stack up for me about this experience and I was not too happy at this point. But it was the last night of our vacation and I was trying to make the best of it. THEN we went down to the only bar that was open to get a drink because I was excited about the lazy river. I have never been to one and it looks fun to me. The pool was filthy. It was littered with empty cups and beer cans and around the back of the bar floating on the red raft things we could not get one because they were all taken and we were told first come first served there were a bunch of 20somethings who had decided to BYOB and proudly announced they were not staying there. Their beer cans were all over the side of the river and floating in the water. Yuck. I have nothing against 20somethings I have two of themAs we spoke to other guests it was a mixed bag some had been informed about the strike others had not. I understand that maybe if you booked through a third party the hotel might not know how to reach you. But I booked through the SPG website and at check in was told that my SPG was attached to my reservation. I get email promotions almost daily from SPG they know how to reach me. I take offense to the fact that they did not tell us about this strike ahead of time but had the foresight to tell others. I understand that work stoppages happen and I respect the rights of workers to do so. But let me know so that I may make an informed decision if I want to stay in a place with very limited amenities that forced me to cross a picket line. The hotel has no right to make that decision for me. SPG Mariot has at least 3 other properties on Kanapali beach they could have redirected us and still kept our money. We could have stayed where we were had we known. There were plenty of options and better ways to handle this situation. This business practice is not right. Then they had the nerve to send me a survey and I expressed my displeasure at their bait and switch tactics and the manager responded calling this a learning experience. Shame on you Sheraton Maui.

Try relaxing while listening to people chant for an hour it is great. We were initially disappointed to learn about the restaurants being closed but could have gotten over that. The protesting made it absolutely impossible to enjoy your time at the resort. I ended up talking to the protesters at some point and was told that they announced that they would be striking this month to the hotel 6 months ago if negotiations were not held and the company did absolutely nothing to negotiate with them until they started striking. So the hotel knew for 6 months that all of their guests experiences would be ruined this month they did nothing to work with their staff to resolve things did nothing to replace their staff and did nothing to notify their guests that their stay would be impacted by these activities. In addition they were not even extra accommodating to make up for it. We got breakfast at the one restaurant that was open on our wedding day asked if we could take it up to our room because we wanted to start getting ready and were told no this is not room service. Yeah thanks we had planned to order room service on our wedding day if only it was actually available. I am just glad my actual wedding was at a restaurant and not on the property. Some other poor bride did have her wedding at the resort while we were there and had protesters shouting at her wedding. She was sobbing. How absolutely unacceptable is it to know that this will be occurring and not give your guests a heads up. I have traveled quite a bit and have stayed at a lot of hotels ranging from quaint bargain places to nice resorts and I have never in my life been even remotely this dissatisfied.

The Resort is great. What the Resort can not fix is mother nature. The beach is 14 the size it was 5 years ago do to erosion from winter storms eating the coastline the last few years. Very sad. Also on this visit the island was very crowded. I would get 3X the people when we came 5 years ago. Piah was so packed is was like overwhelming. Next time we will be visiting a new destination due to the new rush of the island. Thank you to Heraton Maui for another great stay. The staff and maids were top notch.

We traveled to this hotel as part of a business trip. I will start with the lobby and go from there. The lobby is a large open air space which is great if the weather is nice. However we landed during a stormy rainy week and it was very cold and windy waiting to get through check in. The lobby s quite large. yet they only have two stations to check people in. The rest of the space is taken up by tour companies and the concierge. A re configuration of this space would alleviate people having to wait in rainy and cold conditions to check in and out. We were assigned an ocean view suite which had a really nice view of the front grounds pool and front beach area. I will say that although the room was nice. it felt dated. Maybe its the orange colors or the brown carpet. Carpet in a tropical location feels strange. But that could be just my personal opinion. The balcony was lovely. however we requested a room change the next day because I had preferred ocean front so I could watch the whales from our room. Thankfully they were able to do. We moved to the Moana building which is directly on the ocean not the beach. but the ocean close to black rock. We had a king sized room and although smaller than the suite the colors and decor were much better and the view was fantastic. 5 stars on the room and the view in this location. I will advise those that it is a long walk to get back and forth from main areas. so not for everyone. Pool areas were nice cabana and towels were confusing. There is a hut to get towels and they ask for your room number. yet people left towels everyday on their chairs and never returned so why bother. The guy at the hut were also busy selling sunglasses and other items including cabanas. although there was no information about this anywhere. So I do nt know if taking room number and returning towels is just for show. The beach is public. so sometimes they would give out wrist bands and sometimes not. This needs to be worked on. Onto the restaurants they were all kind of a disappointment. For what they charge for food and drinks which is to be expected in HI no matter where you go. You still expect a level of quality which we did not find in the food. The drinks were good. the Lava drink was quite tasty. Service was not noteworthy at any restaurants with the exception of Micheal at the Rock bar restaurant who makes a great drink and was very friendly. The Rock food was basic bar food you can order off the main menu which we did and it was decent. Nothing awesome. it was quite a surprise the the fresh catch of the day was 48 and price not listed on the menu. Our friends had wings and burgers typical hotel food but not what I would expect from a resort. We ate at the Japanese steak house and it was the one exception and quite good. We also had the breakfast buffet and although it had a wide variety and quality was good. it was 35 p. In this day and age when you get an almost identical spread at any Embassy Suites in the US it felt crazy expensive. Also buffet is somewhat outdated with people trying to be more healthy I think you could get away with those prices for a cooked to order breakfast where people feel like it was made just for them. Or offer options both a menu and a smaller continental buffet option. But that was the only option unles you wanted to go to Starbucks cart. My friend had oatmeal and coffee. he said that s the most expensive bowl of oatmeal I have ever had. The grounds and hotel location were immaculate and people were always working to keep it pristine. Pools were too cold to get into and maybe should consider heating them during winter seasons. Walking distance to the shopping village and also the beach walking path in both directions made this hotel stand out.

She called to get towels for us immediately but guess what no towels for her either. she made 3 different phone calls and still nothing. So what does she do she walks me over to the hotels store and buys us 2 towels and a flower for my bride. I objected but she insisted as she will get reimbursed. So now i feel like a real jackass for complaining and making the poor girl buy it out of her own pocket. I hope she did get reimbursed for the funds as her kind gesture was appreciated but also made us feel bad.

We stayed at the Sheraton Maui Resort Spa in late September early October 2019. We originally had booked the Westin for the pool complex but due to some massive renovations we switched at the last minute\u2022The location of the hotel is really pretty fantastic. It \u2019s right on the beautiful Kanapali Beach and along Black Rock. The beach area is very nice and we swam there every day. Black Rock kind of provides a break to where the water is pretty calm and safe for swimming. We snorkeled here too. No reason to go on a snorkeling excursion. There is good snorkeling right out the door. Rent or buy at a store when there some snorkel gear and head out there when convenient to you. We snorkeled in the early morning say 80 AM when less people were there. We saw plenty of fish and a family of sea turtles every morning. It was fantastic. Also jump off of Black Rock its fun\u2022The resort itself is nice clean and well up kept. Our room 2508 provided some good views of the property beach ocean and Black Rock. The room itself was very nicely renovated clean and spacious. The bed was super comfortable. Our patio was also very large and served us well each morning as we enjoyed our coffee watching the sunrise. We were very happy with our room an Ocean View King\u2022We ate at the two more casual options on property Cliff Dive Grill and Mai Tai Bar. Both met our needs when we wanted a quick casual meal without going off property and changing out of our swimsuits. I reviewed those both separately if interested\u2022The pool complex was also very nice. It too was super clean and never seemed over crowded. We had no problem getting chairs no matter what time we came. The lazy river was enjoyable and they even provide floating bean bags to make your way lazily around. We met lots of good people and had some good conversations on our pool days with other guests. Also they have refilable water stations you can fill scattered among the property. That was nice helpful\u2022The service at the hotel was good. Not amazing. In fact that was the only ding I would give the property and why I do n\u2019t give it five stars. We did not get the aloha spirit from most staff we interacted with. No one greeted us when we pulled up no leis were given and no real Hawaii welcome at all as an example. Again service was not bad but compared to other properties I have stayed at in Hawaii it was for sure lacking in comparison\u2022The hotel is currently undergoing some minor renovations in the lobby and restaurant area. There is a temporary check in lobby area and there was some noise during the day during the week but nothing horrible. And all the pool facilities were fully available which is what we cared about. I believe their nicer restaurant Rock Salt is the one that was under renovations. So if you are interested in that I would just inquire about it\u2022Side note. I have to mention that if you get a message call from vacation services asking you to come down and get your welcome gift be prepared. I had no idea what I was walking into but it was a pitch to get you to do a timeshare presentation. Not what I wanted to deal with after a 10hour flight and just wanting to get a drink and bite to eat. So I would absolutely recommend this hotel if considering it for your stay in Maui.

We had an ocean view room and had a beautiful view of the pool areas and ocean room 3604. while stile being close to an elevator the pool and reception. Still a bit of a walk to the self parking in the parking garage. Speaking of parking I do n\u2019t remember paying the 24 day parking fee in 2015 in addition to the daily resort charge. I think it \u2019s way too expensive. It basically costs an additional 55 day for wi fi access to a shuttle if you use it 2 plastic water bottles and water stations and a parking garage. That \u2019s my only complaint about it but I guess it \u2019s Maui and everything is expensive. We would still consider staying again in the future. Also housekeeping skipped our room one day or was running late we put the do not disturb sign on the door when we came back from the pool at 5 pm to get ready for the evening.
