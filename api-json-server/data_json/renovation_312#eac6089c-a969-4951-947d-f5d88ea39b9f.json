It has been almost 2 years since I last stayed at this hotel and I think it has become a victim to its increasing success. The hotel was overcrowded and it was always difficult to find a seat in the hotel lobby where we used to have the afternoon tea. The refurbishing process did not meet as well our expectations. The new breakfast buffet although continues to be one of the best in Munich was confined to a small room in the restaurant leading to traffic jams during breakfast time even when the restaurant is not crowded. About the newly refurbished superior rooms although they have a lovely decor and are equiped with the latest technology are small and with a low celing. All in all it is a great hotel but it lacks tranquility if you are looking for a peace oasis in the city.", "offset": [277, 340], "date": "2015-05-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "6182f82e-0c7e-4dff-9599-3443d9af1758", "sentence": "Renovations will hopefully include improving reception staff service. Not sure when the renovations are due to finish but when I visited reception was temporarily in a small room off to one side of the smalish lobby where you could also sit and have drinks and cake. Although the space does not suggest comfort as guests arriving with luggage literally walk through the doors and are right in the middle of the seating area. Hotel location is excellent surrounded by luxury shops and minutes from the Hofbrauhaus with the main square just further along. Renovations mean that you have to navigate a warren of corridors to find the lift and then even more to find your room the walls though are covered in amazing blow ups of master paintings. Along the way you will pass an out of bounds bar that looks pleasant but the velvet rope blocking access stayed in place during our entire visit. Once you have found your room gaining access appeared to be another obstacle as you may or may not know where to place your key card. After many attempts it is the small area under the handle and you have to hold the card there for several seconds. The room although acceptable is small with another blow up of a painting covering an entire wall. Wardrobe and three drawers are big enough with a large mini bar no kettle. Desk is large as it forms part of the furniture along the wall. TV is a good size and channel wise is very impressive as apart from the usual news and sport channels there is also numerous free entertainment channels including Sky in various languages. The bed surprisingly is a double and not the usual two singles attached together that appears to be the norm in Europe. On either side of the bed there are also two and not being used for lamps etc. electric sockets. The light switches are touch control and like the similar ones that control the shower either work first time or do not. Bedside storage though is non existent. On one side no drawer and the surface is occupied by a large phone. On the other side a tiny drawer occupied by a bible. Wifi is free and offers a good strong connection. The bathroom has a large shower with a rain head plus a hand held hose a bench to sit and uniquely a control allowing changing coloured lights. The body scrub cloth is a nice extra but it is wasteful to replace it daily. Beware the shower door it is a design flaw and does not close flush so water will escaping will make the marble floor slippy. If you have a courtyard facing room do not bother looking out of your window as it is a view of scaffolding and corrugated sheeting. The spa is a good size and cosy with a large pool surrounded by loungers and there is a sun terrace. In the corner is a small gym. To gain entry though you have to ring the bell. Thankfully the Kempinski signature breakfast is still outstanding if expensive and champagne is also present. Beers were also available. Apart from the multitude of cereals fruit juices cold meats fish cheeses hot food jams breads pastries yogurts the list goes on you can also order at no extra cost freshly cooked omelettes eggs Benedict and other cooked breakfasts. I did not visit the Jahreszeiten bar but from looking in it appeared well frequented with a pianist. So complaints well this only applies if you are a member of the loyalty scheme and in this case a Black member which entitles you to a double upgrade a local amenity and other complimentary items which actually all guests receive water wifi newspaper. I did not receive the double upgrade or amenity and when I enquired on three separate occasions I only received an apology on the third occasion but it was made clear that as I was only staying for the weekend it was not worth upgrading my room. A black member is also entitled to a 6 pm late check out but at 2 pm the key cards had been cancelled and at 3 pm a member of staff was sent to see if we needed help with our lugage. So a wonderfully old building in a great location and hopefully the renovations will make it even more pleasant and that includes the reception staff.", "offset": [0, 69], "date": "2016-11-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "07c20c2e-7639-4b70-b03b-f6864a5b31bb", "sentence": "Good.

The lobby of the hotel is stunning however the rest of the hotel is due for a bit of a remodel.

The View Jahreszeiten is in a great location and the newly renovated rooms are super comfortable and stylish. I stayed in a junior suite and loved the large bathroom and spacious room. The bed was very comfy too. The place is kept up really well loved the pictures of Munich in the hallways and the giraffe. pattern carpet. My checkin was flawless I was treated with genuine interest when I mentioned that my trip was hard train issues in Munich. I felt that the check in agent was actually sorry for my experience. I was escorted to the elevator great experience. On grievance I have is that when my taxi stopped in front of the hotel the bell staff ignored me although they were not busy. Hand luggage only so no big deal but I would have appreciated a greet at least. Breakfast is amazing here. The selection and quality are great service is hit and miss. On my four night stay I had really great service but also ran into my per pieve. Be led to a table that has not been cleared. I really suggest that the host checks and clears the table BEFORE leading the guest to it. The location of breakfast is in the pop up space during renovation which works fine. I also had dinner at the casual dining Schwarzreiter setting. Service was outstanding and the food very good. See my separate fine dining review. I find the reviews of Schwarzreiter confusing on Tripadvisor. The restaurant has different setting casual vs fine maybe there shoulr be separate reviews as well. In any case besides the clearing the table issue the experience was awesome. I used the concierge to confirm bookings and cancel one worked flawlessly. I had room service too and wa really happy with the level of service and the food. My room overlooked Maximilianstrase and it was very quiet. Most important during the insane heat wave we have the room was very comfortable.

We booked a slightly larger room ie deluxe facing the inner courtyard but I think we were upgraded to face the side street. The room one of the newly renovated ones with modern furnishings and a toto toilet. The windows could be opened but it was a little too noisy. A couple of improvements with the service. We checked in early and were asked for our mobile number so they could call us when the room was ready. No one rang and so we came back at checkin time of 3 pm and our room was still not ready. I think they then upgraded us. The nightly turndown service does not provide additional shampoo or bath wash nor clear the empty bottles from our afternoon shower.
