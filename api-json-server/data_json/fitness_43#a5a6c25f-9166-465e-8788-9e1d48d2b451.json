I have stayed at this property quite often but this review will focus on three areas North Tower suite amenities and front office service. I stayed at the Junior suite last time which is located at the North Tower. I am not really a big fan of the design and decor. Seems like there are different variation of the interior furniture as my living room has one big oversized lazy boy chair which makes it awkward to entertain any guests. The bathroom only has a pedestal sink that lacks counter space so I had no place to put my clothes when I took a shower and disappointed by not having shower gel even in the suite. I was given access to the Executive lounge. Nice quiet space and not busy. The continental breakfast in the lounge offered standard fare nothing too exciting. Evening snacks also available but did not look too appetizing. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service levels can be improved especially at the front desk. Some of the staff never showed a smile when interacting with guests. And most of the time they forgot to offer bottled water to guests with Honor status. They used to have a great gym and facilities. But since they consolidated some areas now the gym is a bit crowded and the pool is gone and the changing room shower and sauna is in dire need of renovation.", "offset": [1171, 1329], "date": "2015-04-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "7ed1011b-173e-479d-abf7-732c82bced8a", "sentence": "Overnight stay in Toronto very close to airport. It was just one night and it was convenient location Our flight arrived after 10 pm we were still able to get a snack.

Ok so the hotel is ok enough for one night. Free shuttle bus to and from the airport running every 20 minute I think and the room is nice and new. However a couple of issues here which will probably have me choose another airport hotel when passing through Toronto again. First I requested a late check out at the honors website. I asked when checking in about the status of the late check out but the gentlemen behind the desk had a really hard time understanding what I was asking about. Well if you offer it at your website its pretty clear that its something the staff should know about. They did not2nd the gym is absolutely dreadful. While the room have the new look to it the gym and the area around is lost in the 80s and in major need for an upgrade3rd. Good god there is a lack of sound cancelling walls between the rooms. When you hear your neighbour doing his business at the toilet there is something wrong. So all in all this hotel will always be a 2nd option behind sheraton at Pearson International.", "offset": [693, 815], "date": "2015-06-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "317eb87a-320b-4df0-868e-ffa69c6ec805", "sentence": "Good hotel for a quick or long stay with decent parking.

We decided to bite the bullet and get a nice hotel room for the last leg of our trip. This was the most we have ever paid for a room so we expected something above the ordinary. Unfortunately a stay at a Super8 would of been just as accommodating and much less expensive. Due to renovations none of the extra amenities were available pool gym and our room was as basic and plain as they come. Room service for breakfast cost over 80 for 3 basic meals none of which came with what was advertised on the menu. ex. my 5 freshly squeezed OJ was just a cheap from concentrate 20ml bottle. Oh and the big kicker the room service attendant smashed a coffee mug while delivering our breakfast and instead of cleaning it up he just piled the larger pieces by the door and left the shattered pieces on the floor.

Stayed for one night prior to an early morning flight departure. Checked in online 24 hours before and chose a ground floor room near the pool because we would have a bit of luggage and I could not be bothered dragging it up and down elevators and down long corridors. We would be using the pool too so wanted to be close to that just for convenience and that would also mean we were close to reception and the main entrance. I spent a while picking the room I wanted and then checked in to it using the Hilton ap. When we arrived we checked in and got our room keys and headed to where our room was supposed to be. Found out that for some reason we had been given a room on the 10th floor miles away from where I had picked the original romFrustrating start to say the least. Not sure if we had been upgraded as I was not told if we had been but as we were not there long and the elevators were surprisingly quick decided not to do anything further about it. Room itself ended up having a great view of the airport and the remote gates and threshold of 24R and 24L so managed to get a bit of spotting done despite the rainy weather. Room was nice spacious but lacking in power outlets. Honors wifi was perfectly fine. Pool and fitness area was superb. Very large spacious changing rooms and the pool was outstanding. Sadly dining options were usual hotel prices so we ate off site and there are plenty of options nearby within walking distance. Checked out early next morning and used the hotel shuttle which runs pretty frequently even early morning. Overall this was a good stay. Nothing great but nothing terrible either it was all very average which is not always a bad thing and I certainly would have had more favourable thoughts had the changed room been explained. Perhaps they were doing me a favour I do not knowAs a Hilton fan I would certainly consider this hotel again for an airport stay its in a great location and the airport shuttle had a more frequent timetable than some other hotels in the area.

Really curious for a hotel chain of this size valet parking is really hit and miss I waited for a while and nobody came out. Went around back to self park and it was full. Waited for 30 min for someone to come out and leave and I took their spot. some wear and tear in the room which made it feel a bit dirty I shared my feedback with management and to their credit they did get back to immediately to follow up.
