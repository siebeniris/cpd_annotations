The housekeeping staff is very friendly the room was clean. We called several days in advance letting them know we had be checking in around midnight because you lose your room if you do not let them know you are checking in after 11. When we got there no one was at the front desk to let us in. We stood in the foyer for about 5 minutes with the phone ringing no one came to answer. After about 5 more minutes another guest came in with a key card they let us into the front lobby where we stood around another few minutes until the desk clerk came out of wherever he was to check us in. After working 8 hours driving 10 then standing around for almost 20 minutes trying to get checked in his funny comments that we might be in the wrong place were not funny at all. The curtains did not shut so there was light from a parking lot shining in all night. we had to tie them shut to block it so we could sleep. When we were walking to the room a couple doors down looked like they had flooded there were blowers going 247 in the hall so it was pretty noisy. There is no continental breakfast I was charged 1095 for a half cup yes I measured because I am on a diet of plain yogurt with a spoon of granola on top. My husband had a cup of fruit 2 pieces of bacon 2 eggs a small glass of OJ. Our ticket was 25 none of it was prepared to order it was stuff that was just out like a normal hotel does. Totally ridiculous. Not to mention the issue with logging into the Wi Fi so my husband could finish working the following morning. UGH. I am glad I only make this trip every other year.
