One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was after reading other comments about it \u2019s good location for sightseeing. Just a few moments walk east of the river and a stones throw from St Stephen \u2019s Basilica it did n\u2019t disappoint in that aspect and provided a great base for a city break since it was easy to return to throughout the day. There is a metro station very close by but a taxi from the airport took about 25 minutes in weekday rush hour and cost 100HUF including a tip. Door staff were on hand to take care of the luggage straight away and the check in process was speedy. There was no wait at reception and he was friendly and very welcoming. The lobby area can be seen in many photos of the hotel but there were plenty of staff available there throughout our stay to help with questions and the light airy area with gorgeous smelling lilies is a fantastic introduction to the hotel. There are four modern lifts in the hotel which were fast and never required a wait to catch. The wide corridors were clean and displayed some interesting artwork sculptures as well as a few seating areas should you wish. Our Superior Room was a decent size and it was a delight to find a proper large king size bed rather than two singles placed together. Fans of a firmer mattress would be happy and there was also a range of different pillows available on request. The wardrobe was big with fifteen hangers plus there was plenty of drawer and shelf space for a number of nights. A large desk armchair with foot rest and of course TV safe and mini bar were also present. The TV had a great picture quality but only two UK channels BC News and Sky News. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath along with a toilet divided off from the rest of the room with a glass door. The shower had very good power and remained hot throughout long use. A full range of toiletries were present although it was a bit \u2018 hit and miss \u2019 whether these were replenished during the daily turndown service. It was also a shame that there was only a single dressing gown on the first night however this was then added to on the second day. It is also worth pointing out that the air conditioning in the room was useless no matter what setting it was placed on the room would not cool down so instead we resorted to leaving the windows open to help slightly. The wifi was reliable but selecting the free option required you to log back in every 24 hours. Unfortunately the biggest down side to the room was the lack of any tea coffee making facilities. For a high end five star hotel it is n\u2019t unreasonable to expect a small coffee machine or kettle at the least ordering and paying for room service early in the morning for a single cup of tea seems a little ridiculous and not something I \u2019d associate with perfect service or convenience. The hotel has two main restaurants and the ES Bisztro was fantastic. We chose to dine there on the first evening after arriving relatively late and every member of staff was fantastic friendly and explained the options in a relaxed way making us feel comfortable. There was a slight problem during the wait for our main courses but the situation was handled perfectly and full credit to the waiter that evening. The food was delicious and it would definitely be somewhere we \u2019d return to should we be in the city again. Even if not staying in the hotel this restaurant is somewhere I \u2019d recommend a visit. The two bars of the hotel cater for both a relaxed and more formal feel. The Living Room was great to relax in during an afternoon and the waitresses were attentive and friendly. A couple of English newspapers were available and plenty of books to help wind down. With plenty of sofas and seating available plus accompanied with the fire it really did feel like being relaxed at home. The Blue Fox is more the evening venue with live DJs on the Friday and Saturday night we stayed although it remains more of a bar than \u2018 nightclub \u2019. The range of cocktails each has a unique twist although the range is somewhat limited. I have no doubt that they could make anything to request though since the choice of spirits and liqueurs was massive. It never did quite to manage to have an intimate feel but probably would feel more suitable for groups. Full marks must go to the bar girl Melinda though her attitude and friendly nature kept us entertained and laughing all evening. Her knowledge of the drinks and cocktails and everything Budapest was remarkable and made our evening. Overall the Kempinski Corvinus is a modern and clean five star hotel. During our stay though there was n\u2019t anything which \u2018 blew us away \u2019 and small issues like the lack of an in room coffee machine stop me giving this review a matching five star other hotels at the same level are able to provide such touches and it makes all the difference. For example the room lacked any form of \u2018 hotel directory \u2019 something simple which was just another detail overlooked. Not major but \u201c what time is breakfast served \u201d \u201c are there shoe shining services offered \u201d etc questions unanswered and services desired but unknown about. On that subject it may also be worth pointing out that shoe cleaning machines in the corridors are n\u2019t present in this hotel something which frequently proves useful and often present in other five star hotels. For the convenient location cleanliness and lovely staff I \u2019d recommend the Kempinski Corvinus as long as you \u2019re not looking for a top hotel which ticks absolutely every box and gives a true \u2018 experience \u2019 feel.", "offset": [3540, 3645], "date": "2015-02-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "134f9027-8fbc-4a01-a359-c80f5e14db1a", "sentence": "Pet friendly with Nobu onsite. Our two most abiding memories of this hotel are of a fantastic meal in Nobu one of the best I have had in years and of the various lovely pooches we met during our stay. We were in Budapest to celebrate a significant birthday and had meticulously advised the hotel in advance. Unfortunately it seemed not to have registered with them at all either that or else they make a point of studiously ignoring their guests life events. My wife found corresponding with the hotel in advance a little difficult made no easier by the fact we speak no Hungarian whatsoever. I would recommend to avoid the Breakfast life Tiffanys experience on a Sunday morning. For us this was a choice between that breakfast and a family show at the Opera we are still kicking ourselves that we missed the Opera. With all the negatives out of the way this was really a very slick and efficient hotel and a most pleasant experience. The location is excellent walking distance to shops and with easy access to all of the sights. Our room was comfortable and impeccably clean with nespreso machine hairdryer and in room ironing board we are fastidious about creased clothes of an evening and it is nice to be able to run an iron over a shirt quickly without having to plan ahead or involve housekeeping. We slept well and the bathroom was lovely with high quality toiletries and plenty of them. We upgraded to a suite because we tend to spend quite a bit of time in the room when we are staying abroad. The cost was not insignificant but worth it in our view. Breakfast was ample with plenty of choice and lots of nice touches the honey on the comb was a particular favourite. My daughter and I enjoyed a nice dip in the admittedly small spa pool and I enjoyed a really good massage organised late in the evening and at short notice by the hotel. After I left a bag behind in a taxi who had tried to overcharge me. I thought there was no way I would see it again as I could not remember the name of the taxi company involved. Some quick thinking and a scan of the hotels security video organised by the concierge and I was reunited with my bag less than an hour later. My only disappointment was that I had to suggest to the concierge that they check their security footage. Last but definitely not least Nobu. This was a big factor in our deciding to stay at the Kempinski Budapest. We pushed the boat out and had a really special meal there the night after our arrival. We were not disappointed and the chefs tasting menu was everything we could have asked for. Of particular note was the fact that my wife a vegetarian was just as happy with her meal as I was with mine. The acid test if we were coming back to Budapest would we stay at the Kempinski or try another hotel in the hope of getting better. I think we would most likely be back.", "offset": [1304, 1394], "date": "2015-02-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "7e89e6c8-3332-4895-ac4e-0dbd9aca3cf0", "sentence": "excellent hotel on central location in centre.

Superb hotel in an excellent location just a few minutes walk from the Chain Bridge. We could not possibly have been happier with our stay at this hotel. it is a fraction of the price of a room at the nearby Four Seasons and the level of quality is just as good perhaps a smidge of a step down but considering the huge price difference we did not care. The room we stayed in was very big especially by EU standards and was very well appointed with a living area a bathtub and an freestanding American style shower. It was probably the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in. Service was wonderful both at the front desk and also in ES where we had daily breakfast. And the BREAKFAST. Simply the best we have ever had. A huge EU style buffet with anything you could possibly imagine and more. In addition to the buffet you can order eggs and coffee drinks from a server. Everything is freshly baked and the assortment is astounding. Come for breakfast even if you do not stay here. Our only complaint would be that the switch for the bathroom is located outside of the bathroom so there is no way to turn the light on without flooding the bedroom area with light in the middle of the night.

You can open a window a little for fresh air. The heating air conditioning works well. Pick a room far enough away from the elevator or experience too much traffic past your door. Also the rooms are not that sound proof which is kind of annoying. The hotel offers large umbrellas which have come in handy during our stay. The concierge was most helpful with suggestions and providing a city map. Breakfast was included in our rate and the selection broad. But you have to do a bit of walking around to find all the stations of which I counted five in various parts of the room. Good freshly baked bread and rolls and pretty much all of the usual stuff you would expect at a buffet. The room gets VERY noisy which makes communication difficult. Try to eat early.
