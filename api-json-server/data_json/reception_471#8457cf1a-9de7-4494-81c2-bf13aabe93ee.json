Our room 473 in the garden wing had been recently redone and was perfect.

Room service was extraordinary please give my best wishes to Farida who takes the room service orders in the evening. The large gym was as nice and super clean as my home gym The Bay Club in Marin County California. The pool and polside service were five star all the way. All the restaurants exceeded our expectation but for breakfast The Line is a terrific breakfast experience.

As a chef I understand flavour is subjective but produce that is not fresh and tasted off is not acceptable. I did not eat it and left it aside. I left a note about the chicken and pushed the food trolley out to the corridor as advisedby your staff. I had asked your staff earlier if I should call and inform them to clear the trolley. But I was told that was not necessary as they would come around to pick it up. However in the early morning we were awakened by loud noises of birds chirping. We did not think much of it. It was only when we got ready and left the room we realised that the food trolley was not cleared and the birds had made a mess of the leftover food. The table the corridor was a mess.

There were no such thing as \u2018 STAYCATION \u2019 guests. Now the Valley Wing have guests with kids running around screaming and crying and their parents just allow them or ca n\u2019t control them thus disturbing the peaceful ambience in the VW lounge. I noticed one instance where Raja tried to ask a guest with a crying child of about 4 who have been crying and screaming continuiously for more than 15 mins to calm the child down as he is really disturbing the peace of other guests. The woman just ignored him. Perhaps VW should not encourage Staycation guests with young kids. Valley Wing is unique. No other hotels worldwide can match up to what it has to offer. I am a frequent traveller and have stayed in many TOP hotels around the world. Even Aman resort can not match up to VW. I can only put it to it \u2019s how the Team in VW made the guests feel special. Through my observations To recover Valley Wing to its former glory or better Dress code should be strictly observed. The Reception team should politely informed Guests with kids or babies on checking in that the VW lounge is mainly for adults and the kids or babies can go to Buds in The Tower Wing where they will be happier. Perhaps the reception team can suggest to these guests that VW can provide baby and kids \u2018 nannies \u2019 at a small cost. This service if provided will bring in more revenue to the hotel and the parents can really have their break in the luxury they seek. It will also be helpful if the reception team can gently remind new guests or staycation guests the dress code expected in the VW. There \u2019s a note in the room that mentioned this but how many guests especially the Chinese Guests who ca n\u2019t understand English bother. That being said I am still very happy to return the VW every time I visit Singapore. it \u2019s the Team at the lobby lounge the breakfast room. Staffs with special recommendations Aswani Jagan Wei Long Mitchell the lounge Butlers Edward Hussein. Raja Khalil I call them The 4 Musketeers. They are now friends to me and to many regular guests. Also the door men and bell boy Krishnan with his broad smile white teeth shining through his dark complexion. Chanrai. Benji Hashim to name a few. They made VW so special and regular Guests keep returning because of them. I have to mention the Housekeeping and fruits Team. they remember me every time I return. Sadly I ca n\u2019t remember all the names to recommend them. My famous last words People will forget what you say or what you do but they will never forget how you made them feel. Such is the effect the VW team managed to do so naturally for so Long. PS. It was good to see Nora back from her break. She has a calming effect in VW.", "offset": [1982, 2115], "date": "2018-07-30 00:00:00", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 31, "uid": "2bb5e7a6-9a44-4e12-a9b1-5cf0288415f6", "sentence": "Overall good as always One thing I disliked is the change to the self service coffee machine at breakfast.

The Lodore Swiss Hotel owned and run by a Swiss family called England. The place oozed quality and professionalism and somewhere I would be happy to return to my first Shangri la. A lasting impression of Service was embedded in me from that point. Fast forward to August 2018 and the arrival at the Valley Wing of the Shangri la Hotel Singapore. Following a short hop down from Bangkok Shangri la Krungthep Wing. we arrived for a 2 night stay before our return to the UK. No sooner had we got out of the taxi we were greeted by the resplendently attired doorman eager to take the luggage before showing us into the entrance lobby. the cool lobby a real contrast to the heat of the outside. The delightful Sarah commenced the check in process before whisking us up to the 7th floor with adjoining rooms for our travelling companions. The facilities on offer could not fail to impress and the room itself was a haven of cool pastel coloured calm our young travelling companions were stuck for words although wow was heard quite a few times. The formalities completed we were invited to partake in a glass of champagne prior to afternoon tea service we could not really say no could we. So down to the lobby where we duly enjoyed the champagne followed shortly after with the delicate and delicious afternoon tea. Unbeknown to us prior to arriving in Singapore we had not been aware the 9th August was Singapore National Day during the evening cocktails we established that there was an event at the harbour concluding with fireworks. It was with the expert assistance and knowledge of Sarah that we were able to get to the harbour in time to enjoy the festivities. Our first breakfast in the Summit Room was superb the range of dishes whilst not the same as Next2 Bangkok or no doubt The Line Singapore was none the less extensive and of superb quality. I must give praise to the head waiter unfortunately I did not obtain his name who took our order for his skill and humour in guiding us through menu. Any request was met with a truly warming smile and a willingness to put as at ease which he managed effortlessly. I enquired about the availability of a none standard menu item for my breakfast the following morning this was duly noted and confirmed that it would not be a problem and in fact the item was served as requested the next day. The facilities at the Shangri la are extensive with a large swimming pool gymnasium and beautiful landscaped grounds. If I were to offer any criticism though it would be the apparent lack at times of sun beds for the number of guests. Our departure and return to the UK was scheduled for 2340 hrs. We arranged for a slightly later checkout at 1 pm but were able to avail ourselves of all the facilities in the Valley Wing which allowed us to shower and change in the health club. We enjoyed afternoon tea in the garden where we were briefly entertained by a very cheeky squirrel. All members of the Shangri la Valley Wing staff we had contact with for whatever reason were a credit to the hotel their eagerness to please was evident from the moment we arrived to the sad point of our departure. I must mention in particular Sarah Jada apologies if incorrectly spelt and the Head waiter in the Summit Room. To arrive at a new destination and unfamiliar hotel to be put at ease straight away to be made to feel you are truly valued makes for a desire to return sooner rather than later. So why mention the Lodore Swiss Hotel well it is all about Service Service Service and like the former the Valley Wing provided it in abundance another lasting impression is imprinted in me I look forward to my return.

Seems like all I have to figure myself. Honestly the standard between here and Shangri la Sentosa is way so much different. My experience In Shangri la Sentosa is much more welcoming. Well of course she took effort to ask me if I prefer a cake to be serve for my kid birthday. Other than that I \u2019m lost. Lastly she asked if I need her to show me the way and I said Please. And suddenly she walk out and went inside the office which is located behind the counter. Inside the room. Room was fantastic and thank u for the cake and fruits. Appreciate alot. Then when I called to ask if I can request for late check out the staff who answered my call was talking way too fast and rushing for every answer that I asked her.

The event went very well. My guests were all well looked after and I was most impressed with the services provided by your capable staff. Ms I Lyn Tan. Senior event manager. I Lyn always wore a bright smile on her face and ever so calm and composed with all matters. She was extremely knowledgeable with all the details leading up to the event. She was always approachable and helpful above all extremely efficient. I was totally at ease during the planning of the event as I know I was under the capable hands of I Lyn. I Lyn personally waited for my elderly mother at the hotel entrance with the wheelchair ready. She escorted my mother with my other family members to the event venue. This simple yet professional gesture of hers touched me and my family. I have been organising birthday celebration in Shangri la for the past four years. I Lyn was the only event manager who had done this so well. Mr Laurenz Banquet manager. This stout young man was a smart gentle giant. He was totally attentive and very helpful during the event. He was extremely courteous and able to resolve problem in no time. He paid attention to all details and was very careful when handling all matters. I was particularly impressed when he took the trouble to make sure that the chef cut and preserve the birthday cake according to my instruction consulting me when in doubt. The following are three other capable staff that I have encountered during the event 1. Mr Wen Bin Very polite and capable staff. He frequently checked on my elderly mother making sure that her drinks were warm offering a fresh cup of warm drink readily. Such simple gesture goes a long way reflecting the high hospitality standard of the hotel. 2. Ms Rushia. Another well trained staff. She was very kind and polite making sure that all guests were well looked after. She wore a beautiful smile paying attention to details and never rushed the guests offering her help ever so readily. 3. Ms Syarfikha a young attentive staff who was very kind and helpful to me during the event. As with all events there maybe minor hiccups like the florists got the table flower colours wrong or extra piece of furniture required etc. Nevertheless these were all rectify quickly and competently showing the resilience of the hotel to service excellence. This by itself impressed me too. Overall I would like to congratulate Shangri la Hotel Singapore for the hospitality excellence you have exhibited. As I was walking beside the swimming pool telling my daughter that I need to get to Garden Terrace your ground staff overheard me and immediately directed me the best route to get there. I walked along the walkway getting to Dutch Pavilion your gardener greeted me with a friendly smile and offered me direction without me asking.

The breakfast buffet was the largest we have ever seen. it is just not huge but very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent. Only complaint about the breakfast is the coffee service. You can make much better coffee by yourself using Nespreso machines which are available there. Room and bathroom very nicely renovated. Only complain in that sector comes from the age of the hotel. Almost 50 years ago room height was lower and there is not enough natural light in the room. One thing I suggest is please remove those large writing desks which are totally blocking the windows and takes the last spacious feeling away. The incoming experience was one the best. Whole lobby level staff is so awesome. Every time we were around there someone noticed us and came to talk. There was no difference who was it. Everyone in there behaved the same. Final conclusion was the late checkout until 5 pm combined with afternoon tea service. It was really nice to stay at hotel premises when our flight left just before midnight. Also the lobby atmosphere and design makes blissful feeling. Then the garden or how to describe that paradise around the pool. Funny feeling to be few hundred meters from Orchard street and totally inside a forest. Shuttle was a nice addition though it might go more often and directly to Orchard MRTWhen we wandered around the hotel we thought that this would be a nice place for a family vacation if you have kids. Like a resort but in the middle of the city.", "offset": [895, 981], "date": "2020-02-20 00:00:00", "cpt": "7", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 64, "uid": "014ee7cb-7a24-41a1-8d29-ee6ba79f089e", "sentence": "Having no experience of Japanese dining we were very grateful for the advice we were given by the staff particularly Ericand Krystal.", "offset": [0, 133], "date": "2020-02-22 14:30:49", "cpt": "7", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 65, "uid": "18ef5b4b-b13f-4f2d-b5fb-9834f2f59cd4", "sentence": "One staff insisted that my hubby should change to a covered shoes before entering.

My wife and I have stayed at the Shangri la every two or three years since 1987. For many years it was the hotel of choice for professionals especially when staying in the Horizon Club. For the extra cost one got excellent well appointed rooms and a degree of exclusive service in the breakfast and Club areas On our recent trip we found that the room had been redesigned probably by someone who had never stayed there. The bathroom is smaller with the shower in a so called wet room area with a slippery floor which could be dangerous. A former feature used to be the full size bath tub in which one could relax but this has been replaced by a small steep sided one which is difficult to get out of. For some reason a small induction hob has been added to the entrance area. The kind of people who used to frequent the Shangri la are happy to pay to eat in restaurants and do not want the smell of cooking in their bedrooms. We requested twin beds but were given one enormous double bed. Breakfast is now only served in the Line restaurant next to the pool. This is self service sitting at plastic tables. There is nothing wrong with the food and the choice is enormous but the atmosphere is similar to the concourse at Victoria Station in London but with a few extra screaming kids. Gone are the white linen tablecloths and the smiling service. Similarly the Club lounge no longer has friendly waiters carrying bottles of wine to top up your glass. The wine comes out of a self service dispensing machine. The staff are efficient but impersonal and many of them have poor language skills clearly not Singaporean. The atmosphere remains outstanding at the Italian Waterfall restaurant with well prepared food well served and accompanied by a wide choice of wines.", "offset": [1327, 1388], "date": "2020-03-22 00:00:00", "cpt": "7", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 67, "uid": "fdd2eb33-effd-450a-9b0f-64877016a0a2", "sentence": "Big room with nice balcony with a massive well maintained landscape.
