I was torn between giving this hotel 3 or 4 stars because although it was very average it is a good value for the neighborhood and it is probably about as good as you can expect for this price in central London. It was at least a good 20 30 pounds less per night than many other area hotels. that is quite a bit of extra spending money for your trip. We recently stayed here for a week in a standard room 1 queen bed. I think we would have been more pleased with this hotel room if only staying a few nights but it was not quite comfy enough for an entire week. The bed was my biggest complaint and the main reason I am giving 3 stars instead of 4. The mattress was beaten down sagged on my husbands side and basically was only a step up from sleeping on cardboard. The duvet was the exact size of the mattress meaning it is not large enough for the bed and there was no top sheet. I am pregnant and have a bad back so that obviously makes me a bit more sensitive to these things but my husband also felt the bed was uncomfortable. After a couple of nights we did ask them if there was a room with a newer mattress we might switch to but we were told they were all the same and there was not much they could do. The king rooms may be a different story. I did appreciate that you can get additional pillows of different types at the front desk for no extra charge that helped. As requested we were given a room on a higher floor and on the opposite side of the building from busy Cromwell Rd which I would definitely recommend. The room was small but we had no trouble fitting our 2 large suitcases carry ons with a little floor space to spare. The view of South Kensington from higher floors is lovely the hotel is the tallest building in the area by far. and I appreciated that you could open the windows as many hotels have them sealed. I also appreciated the mini fridge there is a Tesco and Waitrose convenience store supermarket. right around the corner so we were able to stock up on snacks drinks and breakfast items. Our room bathroom were clean although the area around the tub could use a good scrubbing with bleach some mold soap scum on the tile grout etc. but otherwise very clean. The bathroom is small but adequate. The shower was very good nice shower head with adjustable height and good pressure. One warning for people with mobility issues for some reason the tub is up about 2 3 inches higher than a standard tub. You really have to climb in and out of it and it is very easy to trip. The lobby is welcoming and nice and the concierge is helpful. There is a stand of taxis waiting outside at all times which was convenient on the day we left although most of the time we took the nearby tube. There is a Starbucks restaurant and pub. They apparently have a great breakfast buffet we did not choose to include it but at 15 pounds a person you are probably better off visiting one of the MANY nearby cafes for breakfast at half the price. The combo of location price is the main reason to stay here. You are within a 10 15 minute walk or less. of Hyde Park the Natural History Museum VA and science museums Harrods Knightsbridge shopping plenty of restaurants pubs and cafes and a 5minute walk to the Gloucester Rd tube station which has the Circle Picadily and District lines running through. Those lines will take you directly to most of the major areas and main attractions in the city cutting down on the of transfers you will have to make. If I ever do an extended stay in town again I would probably cough up the extra 20 30 pounds night for one of the slightly better hotels in the area. But for a shorter stay at the price we paid I had probably stay again.", "offset": [2541, 2602], "date": "2017-03-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "33432e85-761e-431c-806d-bf4341efe6a4", "sentence": "Nice hotel in a great location.

I parked at Holiday Inn London carpark through RingGo ap. I paid 1750GBP for 7 hours few days before in advance. Their ap works like this you drive to the park open ap press a button to open the barrier park and when you need to leave you just open the barrier by pressing the open barrier button then the parking session should end and you would get charged for any extra hours if you have not left in time. I was leaving the carpark about 30 minutes before my time would expire drove next to the barrier pressed the button on the ap to open it and I got a generic error so nothing happened. Tried again and again with no luck. Then after some time of trying I decided to call the helpline. Long story short the lady on the phone made the barrier to open for me and then I left. After that I checked my RingGo ap and the time was still ticking as if I never left. I was trying to end the session but again no luck. Then I called customer service again that same lady answered and was just trying to help me by asking if I was able to leave the car park even though she already knew that I left it because when she made the barrier open I told her that it work etc. I forgot to mention that this call is charged 15GBP per minute so that is probably why she was trying to waste my time on the phone with her nonsense. After few hours of driving back home I was still unable to stop the session through the ap nor through their website both give me a Sorry an error has occurred. message. Their website shows that the session is automatically ending in 6 days. I was calling the same lady again and she basically told me that she can only open the barrier and nothing more. She said that she will give my details to one of her colleagues and they will sort this out and call me back ASAP. Nothing ever happened after that. I was just reading trustpilot reviews after all this nasty experience and saw that lots of people have all sorts of complaints about this company.

Not a single alternative given not other response just no which left my partner feeling disheveled to say the least once the meal was finished we asked if we could split the bill with our friends as we had two separate cards and was told no I do not know how to do that we asked politely if she could please find out as it would make things difficult for ourselves after the meal to transfer money etc. to finally top of the meal after this awful truly disgusting service we happened to chance glance at the bill to see a \u00a3 10 service charge had been added on without even asking our group.
