We spent 3 days in his hotel for Mother \u2019s day weekend and our experience was not a good one now continue to read why. Our usual hotel nearby was booked and I hesitated to book this Hotel because of all the bad reviews. We needed to stay on Wisconsin Ave because it \u2019s close to the action metro restaurants shopping so we had no choice but to book this hotel. I thought the renovation would win me over. Unfortunately after our first experience staying there we will never book this hotel again and here is why. I blame The Hyat Corporation who has not trained their hotel managers and staff properly. I also blame The Hyat Corporation for not caring about this particular hotel. I do n\u2019t blame the managers or staff because working in the hotel industry is hard enough and it would not be fair to hard working people who are doing their best. This hotel is not on par with other Hyat experiences we had in the past in other states. Managers and employees are trying their best but this is not enough because their best is poor. It feels that this hotel is run by amateurs and this is seriously disturbing. Shame on Hyat. Check in. Poor Experience. Front desk staff never looked at us mumbled her words was typing without saying a word until I asked what she was doing for a good 10 minutes. No welcome no smile no feeling of warmth and acknowledgment of our presence. She barely talked. Worse she forgot to give us our breakfast vouchers for our weekend stay which was clearly indicted on our booking. We got the vouchers a few hours later from a different front desk staff after I asked how does breakfast work. Our Room. I paid a little extra to have a big room with a terrace I thought would be big and comfortable price 175 per night. The terrace was big and had a big table and 4 chairs but we got a very very small corner room with a long and odd triangular shape. Everything was cramped into a very small area of this already small corner room which means that he king size bed 1 desk 2 chairs the TV stand and the TV were all concentrated in a 150 square foot area. Needless to say that this room had the worse \u201c feng shui \u201d possible and we were already turned off by it. Worse our toilet broke after its first use. That was it for me. I immediately asked to switch to another room and I was lucky enough to speak with one of the managers who apologized profusely and fixed the issue. We moved to a regular room on the same floor within 20 minutes. I need to mention that our new room key did not work the first time so I had to go see the manager again so he can fix this too. Again my wife and I were already furious about all of this. Our new room was big and looked like a great standard hotel room so at least we were sort of happy. Room Comfort. Poor. Pillows are so soft that they offer no neck support we slept with 3 pillows each to get some comfort. Our mattress was hard and we could feel the springs. Remember this hotel was renovated and the first thing you are looking for in a hotel is a comfortable bed ours was not. We had horrible 3 nights sleep. Worse we had no blankets on our bed just two layers of thick white sheets. It was a little cold and we asked for some extra blankets. We got a small thin disgusting and old looking blanket that was peeling. Just plain odd. Daily Grill service. Poor. Front Desk hostesses were missing because they were waitressing. During our dinner waiter seemed stressed and complained being understaffed. Our Breakfast server should work at a deli and not in a restaurent with customers. During our 3day stay I \u2019ve only seen the manager once and he was very slow. No energy. Overall experience. Poor. Although this hotel has been renovated and our room was clean you could see that the renovation was half baked and not cared for. We could see that the renovation seemed to have been rushed and not properly done. Our shower stall was transparent and the shower did not have any handles to hold on to or a small stool or even place to sit. This means that a family with kids ca n\u2019t share the bathroom and an elderly person could be in danger using the shower. Our floor hallway had a lot of small trash all the way from our room to the elevators such as q tips paper plastic empty glasses of wines near the elevators. Although one of the managers fixed our room issue immediately and apologized profusely and I praised him for that our overall experience was very unpleasant and uncomfortable for all the reasons I mentioned above. We think it might take years before Hyat cleans up its act with this hotel and makes it a true Hyat Hotel Experience. We can not recommend this hotel.
