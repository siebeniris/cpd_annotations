I was a little surprised with this property. The reviews were pretty good so I was expecting way more during my stay. For starters upon check in I was told all rooms have connecting doors because the property used to be a hospital and they had patient and family rooms connecting. I guess you can not do much about the building history but to be told this when checking just set an odd vibe for the stay. Plus i was coming from a hospital and this was the last thing I ever wanted to hear at the point of check in. The room was ok. Nothing special. Bed was ok. Decor was nice and looked like a recent renovation but it still needed some updating. The desk chair was ripped and my TV did not work. After spending an hour with Angelo great guy by the way who handles maintenance it was finally working after he had to replace the TV. So after checking in and sitting for an hour I was finally able to go about my day. When I returned in the evening I was kept up until 3 am with 20 somethings partying in the room next door. They were not even that loud but the walls must have been paper thin. The staff is friendly and do their best. I just feel the hotel itself just has an odd feeling about it. I walked over to the Hilton down the street and it looked very nice. I was not aware of their pricing though. I will say if priced the same i would check out hilton next time.", "offset": [717, 851], "date": "2015-05-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "890b2b84-a140-4faa-8dd8-27f61c4b4f45", "sentence": "Old and Musty. We stayed here over the 4th of July and I was disappointed with the hotel. We will probably not go back. We have stayed at other hotels in the Dallas area and for a better price much nicer stays at the other hotels. This needs updating and the smell is very musty and mildew smell. They burn candles in the lobby to try to mask the smell. The restaurant is always empty and overpriced. Very dark and gloomy inside. Not a favorite of mine.

I recently stayed two nights at the Renaissance Dallas hotel. Located very close to Dallas Love Field airport and just outside of Downtown Dallas. It is also very close to the Dallas Medical Center. The hotel is HUGE from the outside. My cab driver told me locals call it the Giant Lipstick because of its shape and color. What I found very funny is despite how big it looks from the outside is how small the hotel feels from the inside. I will explain throughout this review. My check in was fast and friendly and the front desk staff is very well trained. The main lobby seems modern and has very high ceilings but due to a giant winding staircase the lobby is actually quite small and cramped. Add to it that the restaurant off the lobby is quite large this also makes the lobby feel small. there is actually no real seating or lounge area in the lobby which is very strange. There is tiny business center tucked off the side of the lobby behind the concierge desk which was hard to access. My room was on the 23rd floor and was modern and comfortable enough. the bathroom had a funny layout and the way the doors opened into the main bathroom made it feel very small and cramped. Overall the room is not huge but big enough for one person and was functional and comfortable. There were plenty of power outlets and a nice workdesk. One thing though is the workdesk has a glass top which is a problem with modern laptop mice as they can not work with glass. So I had to gab a magazine to run my mouse on. The WiFi is very fast which is always a bonus. Lastly I did use the lounge and the concierge lounge was nice for breakfast and snacks and the staff there is super friendly. One other weird note on this hotel is that while the hotel itself is modern and renovated the elevators are straight out of the 80s and in rough shape. The doors are beat up and the cars clunk along when stopping at floors. YikesAl in all this was a pleasant stay but not sure if I would stay here again the next time I am in Dallas.", "offset": [1717, 1868], "date": "2015-10-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "355dc61c-969b-419e-b941-371f7427148b", "sentence": "r breakfast.

First time staying at this hotel and I had a great overall experience. The check in process was smooth with each check in station being utilized I only had to wait for a momentwhich I appreciate since I was in a rush to check in before my next off site meeting. I being P has its benefits and during mid week have a better chance of having an upgraded room. I was given an upgrade upon check in without asking. The lady that checked me in was nice and professional and could tell this would set the stage for the rest of my trip. I got up to my room with a living room and bed room. The bathroom has been recently upgraded renovated as well with a rain style shower. This room is different from other Renaissance properties and has a welcomed fresh look. The room was clean and everything in its place including 2 extra pillows I always ask for. After my meeting I was able to come back and headed to the lounge and they had a light meal for dinner. I had a salad and chicken fried rice. Zak greeted me and was attentive in asking if I needed anything and brought me a drink. It was a welcoming atmosphere. Again the hospitality continued which I loveI went to sleep that night and the beds had a soft top for comfort and were about a 7 out of 10 for firmness. I was able to get a decent nights sleep. For people that are side sleepers it may not be for you. Since I sleep on my back I was able to get the support I need. In the morning it was back to the lounge where I was greeted by Kathy. She was attentive and brought me orange juice and a few refills of it. She has a great personality and was able to connect. I saw her do this with everyone that entered and helping out each person to their needs. This is something that is lost on a lot of other hotels. Maybe it \u2019s just some of that southern charm as well. I really appreciate Kathy and Zak in the lounge and as they elevated my staybeter than my experience I had at another Hotel in Chicago which will go unnamed. I was able to have eggs breakfast potatoes and bacon. They also had egg white frittata breads bagels muffins croissants bananas oranges and apples. In the cooler they had apple juice tomato juice yogurt milk water club soda and other sodas. Thank you again for an awesome stay. I will be back.

The food was good arrived in a timely fashion and cooked to our liking. The biggest drawbacks of this room are its size there is literally only enough room for 2 adults. the lack of a minibar and they have the loudest toilets on the planet.

I visited Dallas this week on a business trip. I not only stayed at the hotel but the hotel was the host for our companys annual conference. The hotel rooms were great. They were spacious updated technology friendly new TV etc and very clean. There were a TON of outlets USB and AC and one conveniently placed on the end of the headboard. No need to move the end table to struggle to plug in your phone at this hotel. I wish I had taken a picture of this cool feature. There was plenty of desk and other surface space to accommodate work time and placement of personal items. Oh and the desk lighting was excellent. I loved the sliding bathroom door which allowed for plenty of personal space. The shower water pressure was excellent and the shower head options were great. Again everything was very clean and well maintained. Perhaps my favorite feature of the hotel were the elevators. They are smart vehicles. You enter your destination floor and the system identifies the correct elevator to take. This technology was extremely helpful during our conference time when large groups of people were moving from floor to floor. For companies interested in a conference destination I would highly recommend this hotel. The conference rooms were great ALL staff excellent helpful and friendly there were plenty of meet up areas with outlets tables and chairs and the food was FANTASTIC creative and healthyFinaly service. The service at this hotel was excellent. The front desk staff were helpful and welcoming. The Navigator staff helped us to find two excellent nearby restaurants. We walked to El Bolero 20 min and ubered to Trinity Grove 10 min 8 and a great offering of options I HIGHLY recommend Beto Son. I want to thank every employee for their smiles and genuinely friendly approach to their customers. The culture of great service was apparent in every encounter of our stay. My service experience was capped off by the exceptional effort by Loretha McCre. Loretha is in charge of lost and found. I lost my night guard mouth guard a 2x2 clear device very difficult to see and about 70 in value. Apparently I placed it on the bed and left it there. Housekeeping changed the sheets and with it swept up my mouth guard no fault of their doing. I called lost and found and spoke with Loretha. She was very professional and helpful. She took my cell phone number and said she would be in touch. At this point I had pretty much lost hope that it would be found. If not for Lorethas efforts including going to the laundry room and sorting through the linens along with Diana Rogers my mouth guard would have been lost and I would have been calling my dentist on Monday but NO. Around 2 pm on the day of my checkout Loretha called as promised and told me the good news. She met me in the lobby handed me my lost item and I hugged her like a long lost relative.
