So we love the grotto pool and the beautiful landscaped courtyard. The swim up bar is a plus for the adults. Well kids can get a non alcoholic smoothie from the bar. Those are good too. The rooms in the tower are small with not much room for a family of four to place belongings. The bathroom did not have much counter space at all. It was clean and the beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Staff was friendly and helpful. They were always smiling and cheerful. No Debie Downers. The onsite restaurants were fantastic. Very reasonably priced and delicious. The hamburgers at the bq shack are delicious. Pizza from room service is really good too. We actually saved money eating most meals at the hotel. We usually spend about 100 on a nice meal at a restaurant in Ft Walton Destin. We spent an average of 40 at the Ramada for a meal. can not beat that. Even the low country boil meal was good and we are cajun so we know a good boiled seafood. Not too spicy for my kids but may be too spicy for those who are not used to any seasoning on food. The fireworks on Wednesday night just added to the fantastic time we had at the Ramada. Would stay here again. The easy access to the beach was the best. We usually stay across the street from the beach which makes beach access difficult. I would rather pay the extra money and stay one less night. Who knew what we were missing. Now if only they had more room for toiletries in the bathroom.

Would stay here again and again. Came here for a weekend getaway. Choose this Ramada Resort based on the pricing and the reviews. Everyone to their own opinion but I can tell you from our experience that we Loved Every Minute of our stay here. We booked online got a great rate of only 153 for the Rock Waterfall View Room. We arrived on Friday 81817 and checked out on 82017. Check in was a breeze and the staff was very friendly. We found our room and a parking spot with no problem. They do have a covered parking lot also for those interested in keeping their vehicles covered. We were in Room 4013 on the 4th floor facing the rock waterfall pool area. I highly recommend these rooms. I normally like an ocean front room but the ocean is a good bit away to see even from the ocean front rooms here. We just had a normal room 2 Queen Beds with the normal stuff TV Microwave Fridge. The room was very comfy. The beds were very soft and we slept great each night. We had plenty of towels in our bathroom and they were fresh and clean. We smelled our sheets on our beds Clean. The water pressure here is awesome. Very Big Plus for me. We did not get any maid service during our stay because we do not like others in our personal space when we are at hotels. But each morning the maids would ask us multiple times if we needed service or anything. We just gave them our dirty towels and got fresh ones without any hassle. They were all very polite and friendly with all smiles. The only thing I had say is the carpet is a little on the dirty side but hey your at the ocean with lots of sand so we understood. The Balcony View was Awesome. We loved sitting out on our balcony and listening to the Waterfall. There are 2 pools here but we only used the Rock Waterfall one. There was a Kidie pool a Hot Tub and also a pretty good sized kid water play area. We Loved hanging by the Rock Waterfall pool everyday. We did get drinks at the swim up bar. The ocean and beach area is just a short walk. There is also a bar area on the beach area of this Ramada. Loved that. And at nights they had a live DJ and people were dancing everywhere. We love the Grounds in general of this Ramada. Very Well Taken Care Of. Very Very Pretty. We did eat breakfast each morning at their buffet. And honestly I highly recommend eating here. Very Well Worth It. Everything on it was Extremely Good. And the pricing was not bad either. Oh and the service superb. We loved that there is an Alvins Island Gift Shop right by the Rock Waterfall pool area it came in handy when we needed things. Oh and there are bathrooms right beside the Alvins Island Gift Shop. Along with the Weight Room Work Out Room. We did eat at the Island Grille on site and it was pretty good foods also. can not complain. On our last day we wanted to still enjoy a little beach and pool time so we went and asked for a late checkout which the staff at the front said no problem. We were excited about that. We loved our extra time here. Honestly we have been to this area before and paid a high dollar amount for a hotel only 2 doors down and this hotel was a lot better than it was. This will for sure be our go to Resort when we go to Fort Walton Beach. I recommend this Resort but just remember it is an older hotel it is not the Ritz and everything is not perfect but it for sure is Clean there is plenty to do here. And the Staff are Very Friendly.

The down side to the remodel was that the large awesome pool with the groto swim up bar waterfall etc was closed for renovations. So only the small pool was open. Its suppose to be ready soon by May At least the small pool was heated then we had the beautiful beach of course. Just a note for the beach. If you have stayed here b4 the chairs umbrellas r not free for guests anymore like they used to be. there is a company renting them out instead. 35 day for 2 chairs w umbrella. 25 for a half day. 10 for just a chair for the day.

So plan on putting your own beach blanket behind all those chairs w umbrellas. That \u2019s my only complaint. But I did spend most of my time in the water anyway. but some people may not be happy about it. Overall happy about our visit. Spring break traffic was terrible on Miracle strip.

We family 2 adults and 2 children stayed in room 1069 double beds which was a bottom level room on the west side of the resort. The room was a little dated but had a microwave and mini fridge. Nothing was wrong with the room but nothing stood out as really great. It was close to the heated pool so that was nice. It was farther way from the beach access on the other side of the resort which was annoying when carrying stuff to the beach. The main or large pool was closed for renovations actually the hotel was having a lot of renovations going on which meant there were not some things readily available like a fitness room a convenience shop etc. They gave us vouchers for free breakfast everyday of our stay because of the renovations. The breakfast was pretty good biscuits and gravy bacon scrambled eggs sausage potatoes toast and some type of fresh fruit fruit varied daily. We did not eat at the grill restaurant so can not say much about it. The prices seemed average for the area. The beach was awesome and the water cold but beautiful the 4 days we were there in late March early April. The hotel rents beach chairs and umbrellas something like 35 a day. Seemed expensive to me so we stopped at a Costco on the way downnear Birmingham AL and purchased a couple Tomy Bahama chairs and an umbrella. The hotel sets up their chairs and umbrellas in prime beach locations so you have to set yours up behind theirs. I found this unfortunate. At one time this resort was probably top notch and very nice today is under renovation and just ok. The location is good and the beach is great. We spent most of our time at the beach or the pool. We drove over to Destin a couple times maybe 20 minutes away. There are several restaurants and a Walmart there. My children 9 year old boy and 4 year old daughter had a great time at the beach and the pool. The hot tub was open but it was dated and could also use some renovation. There are 2 large signs on the gate going into the hot tub area that read No food beyond this point. Both times I went to the hot tub area there were people there eating food. No one from the resort seemed to care or pay any attention. The parking spots in the resort parking lot were limited and filled up quickly. This meant you had to park in the parking garage on the east side of the resort. This was not ideal having a room on the west side of the resort. The height limit for the parking garage is something like 7 feet something I think. One night I watched a guy with a luggage carrier on top of his vehicle having to park in the garage and scraping the top of his carrier on the cement ceiling in multiple locations. Bring sunscreen and use it. Getting burnt on the first day makes the rest of your vacation not as fun I witnessed this. It would have been nice if the hotel provided pool towels for the pool area guessing they do not because people would take them to the beach and the staff does not want to have to deal with asking people not to. There are no restrooms at or close to the beach you have to walk back to your room or to the pool area. They have rooms in a building that they call the Tower. The second level or higher rooms on the gulf side probably have nice views it did not look like the first bottom level rooms would have much of a view because of the sand dune. The hotel has a younger kids splash area park it looked pretty fun and is a decent size but we did not use it much as the beach and the heated pool we found more fun. We had a great time and if the price was right I had stay here again perhaps when they get the renovations done it will be top notch again but they have a long ways to go it seemed.

It was previously a Ramada that we stayed at on a spur of the moment vacation while en route to the Tampa area. Then it was an awesome place but a bit dated. That did not bother us. I stayed here again in 2018 after Hotel RL acquired the property. There was construction in several areas and I could tell it was going to be very nice. This week we stayed ocean side in a 5th floor renovated room. While they are not as large as some again age related the renovations were great. The decor is beachy but also modern and matched the new blue and white theme. The bathrooms now contained crushed glass countertop and a high rain shower head. there is no shower curtain only a half glass partition between you and the bathroom which was very elaborate with the large rectangle tile shower walls and luxury vinyl plank flooring that continues all through the entire hotel. We had two rooms adjoining. The inside the door between the rooms had a little surface mold in the cracks but rarely used that was probably an oversight. The room to room doors were still the previous paint color and likely hardly ever opened. I assume the construction crew missed that. There were a couple of spots here or there that needed a little caulk or better alignment. The Island should hire my wife to inspect things after the construction workers finish an area. As far as location is concerned this is hard to beat. Unobstructed gulf view right on the Miracle Strip. Convenient to Publix. But directly adjoining a large complex with several nice restaurants. You could stay here all week and never drive to find food. The pools are great. This attracted us the first visit due to us having a large family of children. The larger pool with waterfall is cool if not cold and refreshing. You can swim up to a bar in the waterfall but we did not patronize it. The hot tub was great and there is a childrens pool. At night the heated pool featured an outdoors showing of a different childrens movie each night. This new feature was enjoyed by our kids. The beachside bar had a live performer usually a single person with a guitar and small sound system entertaining guests in the evenings. The music was faint at the ocean side but a good level on our balconies. As a musician I can say the singers had very good tone competence. During the day there were several contests at the main pool including an underwater hold your breath contest and a hula hoop contest. My son won the breath contest. The prize was a ring pop. Also there was a facepainting booth my children enjoyed. The golf and cornhole area between the beach and sand was a fun way to spend some evening time. Though we did miss the old splash pad which used to exist east of the facility. Finally my daughter left a stuffed animal at the hotel.
