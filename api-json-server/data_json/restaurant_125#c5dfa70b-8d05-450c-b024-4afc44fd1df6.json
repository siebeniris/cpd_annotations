This place is about 37 minutes away but conveniently off I85 Alot of stores and restaurants nearby. It appears to have recently changed names so the current sign is hard to see. The hotel is pushed back off the road so it is easy to miss. It looks like it was recently renovated and looks real nice. Front staff was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was fulfiling.

I would stay again because it is budget friendly and clean. A bit disappointed in what I would say is unprofessional service but it was OK. As I entered to check in I passed two persons one smoking and was not acknowledge. No one was at the check in desk. Just moments later the two persons I passed came in and the one who worked there went around desk while keeping conversation with the other person. As I waited for conversation to end and to be check in the employee finally acknowledged me and checked me in and was nice enough during the process. This seems to be the way of the staff because next morning for breakfast the hot items were depleted. When I approached the two employees chatting at front desk and asked for hot breakfast items they agreed to get them and the host mentioned that they run through the hot items as if guests were eating to much. But I got some breakfast and checked out. Everything else was just fine. Room was clean. Shower was good. Linens clean and fresh. Refrigerator needed a defrost. Microwave worked. Coffee well it was alright. nothing to brag about. Funny enough the toilet sounded like a bunch of witches melting aliens as if it was possessed when it was flushed and filling. Grocery store restaurants fast food available a block away. The motel is situated behind vacant dealer parking lots nothing fanciful no landscape.

The bed was atrocious though. I think the mattress was broken in some way because the middle sunk way down and you literally had to crawl over the very firm sides that stuck up. It was almost impossible to get comfortable and sleep on it. The ac in the room worked amazingly well. The room was clean albeit very old and musty. I was slightly concerned with the what appeared to be mold on the ceiling above the bed and in the shower but convinced myself it would not be an issue for one night. The major pitfall of the room is that the rooms all have adjoining doors. I thought hotels had done away with those. Apparently not. So we could hear all of the noisy people on the other side and smell the smoke of their room even tho ours was a non smoking room. The toilet was not well installed it wobbled front to back when sat on. Water pressure was good in the shower but the tub did not drain well so you end up standing in a few inches of water during your shower. Breakfast was decent tho it would have been really lovely to have some fresh fruit included. The lady who runs the breakfast bar sat out at a table in the room with us and conducted lots of very loud personal phone calls which was very disruptive to our simple breakfast. All told if you need to stop while road tripping this place is not that bad for a stop over provided you could find it cheap. I would not pay more than the 70 including tax that we paid for it.
