Pluses the staff especially the young lady who works the coffee bar in the morning such a treat to be greeted cheerfully and sincerely. I was there for my Dads funeral and she comped my coffee after she asked why I was staying. Brought tears to my eyes. And the room service servers are very nice. And speaking of room service it was fast served hot and very good. How I am treated by staff goes a long way. The room was clean comfortable and everything worked. A little used but. oh well it is a hotel and you can not expect Grandmas house. The location is perfect and parking is plentiful. Yes there are concerts nearby but the hotel does give a warning notice. not that it changes anything but at least we knew what to expect and got the ear plugs out. Minuses. I have stayed here several times because it is close to family events but the last time I stayed I got a room by the stairs and the door to the stairwell was very loud WHAM. Especially at 2 in the morning. I am guessing it was staff slipping the bill under the door. so please have them be careful shutting the door. And I had appreciate cardboard drinking cups in the rooms because I am always a little nervous about drinking out of maybe not the cleanest glass. And bath drains need to be cleaned out frequently. there is nothing as horrifying as taking a shower and seeing a mass of hair not your own. floating around your ankles.

Very dated and need of an update. Nice size rooms with smaller bathrooms in need of repair. The Executive Lounge is on of the worst I have seen. I was in before 7 am for breakfast and what little they had watermelon and blueberries bad scrambled eggs and I think sausage. The bread was picked over one piece of marbled bread left and two bagels. The eggs were near the bottom and instead of refreshing she scraped the bottom. Evening is not much better two nights of deep fried somethings one I think was pigs in a blanket. Some veggies crowded on a plate and bags of chips no cheese and crackers which is the staple of most lounges. In the room the bed was comfortable but the shower tub combo would not drain standing in ankle deep water and the iron was broke not a shock.

They have done some nice updates to the room since I was here last year and made the rooms much nicer. I will say there are still some things that they did n\u2019t update like the windows along the walkways the doors on the exterior and the HVAC and showers in the rooms. Upon check in the customer service rep notified me that I would need to call engineering to have them come into the room to switch out HVAC from heat to AC. I \u2019ve never had that happen in any hotel I \u2019ve stayed at. He ended up having to open up a panel in the bathroom ceiling to switch it from heat to AC. That system MUST be older. That \u2019s a bit frustrating if you like to toggle between heat and AC throughout the day as they would need to continue coming back to adjust it. It \u2019s also pretty loud once it kicks on. There was some sort of a rattle going on. The shower stall also needed some updating. I found that the water tends to pool in the middle and you can clearly see it \u2019s an older tub. One other thing I noticed is that the hallway to our room was a bit uneven by the ice machine so you have to be careful especially if you are unsteady on your feet. I do wish they had better parking right next to the hotel.
