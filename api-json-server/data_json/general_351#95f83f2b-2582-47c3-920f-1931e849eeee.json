One comes to expect a pleasant stay in Mariot Hotels. The rooms are usually clean and properly maintained and the room amenities are acceptable. The food and hotel staff service is usually very good. Not the case last Saturday evening on April 9 2016. We checked in after a brutal 12 hour day of flying to find the lobby filled with happy well dressed GENTLEMEN from a certain Fraternity. They were the Alumni group that meets there EVERY quarter for the weekend 3 months to gather and have a good time. Okay no problem. that is what Hotels do. Along with providing rest relaxation and dining options they host events ie Weddings family reunions Prom Dances etc. As we exited the elevator onto our floor we saw huge fans blowers and water buckets everywhere. Hm. All was well in my room however I decided NOT to go downstairs to try to get something to eat because there were masses of people in the restaurant. I made do with my own snacks. At around midnight I was awakened by the sound of loud female voices and the odor of cigarette smoke. I figured it was partiers from downstairs coming back to their rooms but no this continued for quite some time. I finally turned on the light put on my clothes and opened my door to see what was going on. In my best judgment I know not to do this but I thought it may possibly be some inconsiderate late arriving airline crewsi know this typeI opened the door to find these two women standing chatting and smoking. I loudly said to them that some people were trying to sleep and to take it someplace else. They retorted that they did not care. I I closed the door soaked a bath towel in water an stuffed it under my door to block out the cigarette smoke and conversation. I waited for 10 mins. but they continue to talk and smoke. I called downstairs for security assistance. The one who answered my telephone call indicated that they were fully aware of the problem and hollered someones name to get to my floor to take care of another problem. After a while my end of the hall became quiet. The following morning on the shuttle back to the airport we were informed by other guests that on Friday night this group had released the fire alarms causing the sprinklers to soak the halls and some of the room thresholds thus the fans blowers and buckets on multiple floors. Also causing an evacuation of the hotel in the middle of the night in frigid temps. At what point or at what cost does THIS Mariot Hotel stop accepting THIS FRATERNITY groups BUSINESS money and turn their bad behavior away.

Very clean and comfortable with all the facilities required for a pleasant stay. The beds were very comfortable and big. However had I not looked out the window I would have sworn our room was on the runway. Pillow over my head made no difference. Would definitely recommend ear plugs. Maybe it was tiredness on my part but I have never experienced anything like it. Given a voucher by Airline to have breakfast lunch at hotel. Restaurant was very chic and comfortable our meals arrived quickly and were delicious. Waiting staff in black uniforms were very attentive and polite. Very pleased UNTIL I met the Restaurant Manager. I know his name but sha n\u2019t name him. I will say pink suit and black shirt. You know who you are GNow I speak English. I speak clearly and slowly. Having just spent a week in New York I never once had a problem with communication. After our meal I went up to the bar to ask for 3 cokes. He was at the bar I saw him laughing and appeared very nice. Until I asked for our drinks when I thought I should explain that we had a voucher from Delta and gave my room number. He looked at me with disregard and abruptly said \u201c did you eat here \u201d. surprised at such a reply I thought I should explain my situation again.

The front desk personnel wait staff and management of the Ditmars Bar and Grill were amazing and went above and beyond to accommodate us. I would like to especially acknowledge Angelique at the front desk. Ciaira bartender and wait staff Louis Pinata Director of Food and Beverage and David Valentin Assistant Restaurant Manager. Both Lou and Dave are a perfect fit for their roles and represent the Mariot brand to the fullest. I can not say enough about the services that they and Ciaira provided to us when we hosted a group for my mother in laws repas at the Ditmars this past Saturday. We will be forever grateful.", "offset": [350, 417], "date": "2019-01-28", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 34, "uid": "b9af88b4-7ce2-444e-b4cd-d2d8e91950ab", "sentence": "Normally it is the hotel I always stay when I am in town. My last stay was not the best. Because of the rain storm it took much longer to get to the hotel from Newark. So I was pretty tired when I checked in at 930pm. First there was not a TV remote in the room. Not a big deal but took 2 calls and 25 minutes to get the remote. Now the other issue. At 530am I heard water dripping in my room. I walk toward the sound and found water was dripping on my entry way floor from the ceiling. Water was all over the entry way and had to grab bath towels to cover the floor. I called the front desk and an engineer came. He said the leak must have came from the workers working above me on the roof that day. Checking out I would have thought they might have ask if they could do anything to compensate me for the inconvenience.

Sadly it was not. I used the internal ap to tell them through chat what my experience was and nothing happened so I ca n\u2019t say the chat ap is a plus. What I did like are he renovated rooms.

This is the first time staying here but I have met people here before heading over to LaGuardia. The hotel was dated and dark and I avoided staying here. They have done a remarkable job updating the hotel. The lobby and bar area are greatly improved and modern. The rooms are nicely done with new floors no carpets. The bathrooms are small but are adequate. The only critique would be hallway noise. I expect noise from the exterior but they could use some soundproofing from the halls. If you are noise sensitive sleep could be an issue if you have noisy neighbors no sound between rooms noticed. The staff members are friendly and courteous especially the front desk. I would stay here again for its proximity to LGA and the fact it has been renovated.", "offset": [504, 614], "date": "2019-05-20", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 37, "uid": "e1e07ba5-cea8-4fbf-8cad-ed6c3c2b1e53", "sentence": "Hvac system needed to be upgraded.

Stayed here as a stopover for one night. Check was okay. Staff helpful. No recognition of Bonvoy status. Told where Lounge was and that was it as far Bonvoy loyalty goes.
