We visited KC to see a Royals game and chose this hotel based on its proximity to Kaufman Stadium. The stadium was right across the street and really easy to walk to.

Luckily the AC unit in our room was really loud and drowned out the outside noises. The decor is modern and appears to have been updated recently.

You get your food in plastic baskets and styrofoam cups. I went to sleep and woke up to ants and flying insects crawling on what was left of the room service food. I went to tend to my business at 830am but on the way out I told the Housekeeping Supervisor about all the issues. And she told me that everything would be taken care of and my room would be cleaned. I returned at 430 and nothing had been done and there was more insects festering and feeding on the left over room service food.

This hotel was close to the highway for a quick on off stop. If you are in town for a Royals Chiefs game it would be hard to beat the location. Fairly standard hotel with a fairly nice pool when not hosting a birthday celebrationThis hotel is an older hotel and even though it has been updated its updates are too showing their age. However for the price it is not unexpected. Our biggest issue was with the in room air conditioning. We arrived at the property on a excessive heat warning day around 5 pm and were assigned to a room facing West getting the full effects of the sun beating on the glass doors. When we walked into the room it was excessively hot and the AC was completely off. We turned on the AC clicked the temp as low as it would go and decided to leave the room to give it time to cool down since it was not pleasant for our family to stay in it and wait. We were gone for several hours and when we returned our room was cooler but not nearly as cool as we expected. The AC was still on but had stopped running even though there was no way our room was as cool as the thermostat was set. We added on continuous fan though that should not have anything to do with the cooling but there were no instructions and left for the pool. The pool was nice. Not too hot or cold. Fine for a toddler. However there was a massive party going on and with wild kids everywhere. There were no more clean dry pool towels so my husband had to go up and ask for towels from the front desk. They only would give us 3 even though there are 4 in our family. We got back into our room after dark and it was thankfully cool enough to tolerate. After showering to find the only hook in the bathroom was directly above the toilet paper so nothing really long or wet and getting the kids ready for a very late bedtime storms started rolling in. They ended up being really bad and knocked the power out for the rest of our stay. Around 11 pm when I went to the front desk to inquire if they knew anything about status of power I found irate customers verbally harassing the staff.", "offset": [676, 758], "date": "2017-06-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "16c83c2f-1fc7-41c8-94a9-67b8604b5635", "sentence": "Phoning it in.
