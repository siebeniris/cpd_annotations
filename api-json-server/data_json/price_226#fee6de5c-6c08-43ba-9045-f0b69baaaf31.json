I booked this hotel for a one night stay in late August. On the day I was supposed to arrive my flight was canceled due Hurricane Harvey wreaking havoc in Houston I was flying to SMF from TX. I called the hotel once I found out my flight was cancelled and told them I was stuck in Texas because of the hurricane. They said they would notate that as my reason for cancelling. A few days later I was surprised to see a charge from the hotel for my room. Although I cancelled outside the cancellation window a ridiculous 48 hrs prior to arrival since it was due to a natural disaster I assumed they would waive the charge as has happened when similar events happened in the past when staying at other properties. I called the hotel to try to talk to someone about this and left a message for the manager to call me back. 2 days later no call back so I called again left a message and waited. Still no response after another day. So I called a third time left a message waited and still no response. At this point I had been trying to get in contact for over a week so I called SPG customer service to see if they could help I am SPG Gold. Over several days various SPG reps tried to contact the hotel requesting the manager to call me with still no luck. Finally this got escalated within SPG to the supervisor level after nearly 25 weeks of getting the hotel to contact me I finally talked to someone on property. I was astonished to find that after all this the property was completely unsympathetic to the fact my flight had been cancelled due to the hurricane and maintained with the room charge. After getting a hold of SPG Customer Service to inform them the hotel is not going to reverse the charge they escalated the case even further but the hotel would not budge. Every SPG rep said they were shocked the hotel was being so greedy and unsympathetic to my situation and tried to get the hotel to change course unfortunately with no avail. Long story short Flight cancelled due to hurricane hotel refused to waive cancellation charge due to natural disaster took nearly 3 weeks to get hotel to call me back needed to get escalation with SPG to get any kind of response from hotel. On average I stay in over 30 different hotels every year. This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever come across with a property. I sympathize with anyone who has an issue with the management onsite as they are completely unresponsive and frankly do not care.

I asked her for a room farthest from the elevator as possible she said she can not tell where the rooms are located. My husband was having surgery and I would be coming and going at all hours. We went upstairs and she could not have given us a closer room to the elevators. I went back downstairs and again asked her for a room farther down the hall so she turned around and grabbed a book that had a diagram of the rooms in it. I do not understand why she could not have done that the first we asked. She said you know check in is not until 30. is was after 230. The room was okay but the toilet ran all night and when you were in the shower the lights auto turned off. An accident waiting to happen. The next day we come back to the hotel bone tired and our room keys do not work. We went down to the front desk and a different clerk said that we must have placed our room keys to close to the phone and it inactivated them. No way my key was in my purse and my husbands key was in his wallet. Obliviously when the Front Desk Clerk checked us in she only activated the card for one night not four. They charged my charge card four different times. The total bill was 546 and they charged a total of 125647 to my card. These were pending charges but if you are close to your credit limit those bogus charges can throw you over your limit. Your interest rate could increase and an extra charge for being over your limit. that is not right.
