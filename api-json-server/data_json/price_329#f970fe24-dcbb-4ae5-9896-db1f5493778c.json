This hotel is supposed to be 4 star and we paid about 250 per night. summer weekend. This is really horrible for this level of the hotel. 1. Our room on non smoking floor was filled with smoke to a point we all developed headaches. 2. Our bathroom was dirty the sink was all cracked I am surprised it was still holding together. 3 The bathroom ceiling was all rusty with paint falling off. 4. we have stayed at way cheaper hotels where we had much better bathrooms bedding and even bathrobes not at this hotel. Last night there was a fight right outside of our room at 2 4am no security showed up even after we called. Not only they would not let us sleep they broke at least 2 light fixtures in the hall and I guess the hotel did not care. 5. Housekeeping was not properly done beds were not completely done is looked like they ran out of the room for some emergency and 4 towels we had were replaced with 3 I can somewhat understand if it were 1 star hotel but not at 4 star hotel. 6. And the last drop The coffer maker the cheapest model you can ever find was not working. They replaced it after 4 calls 105 hours after the first call at 103pm I am glad nobody was sleeping at the time yet though I have kids who could have been sleeping already. Given it is not even on the AC boardwalk no advantages to location I will never stay at this hotel again and will not recommend it to others unles it is free and I am desperate to save on my stay at any cost. Regarding pools the family pool is small and might be ok for very little kids but I am not sure about that. The adult pool club 21 is great but only for ages 21 even during day time.

This trip taught me two things. 1. When you think something is too good to be true it probably is. 2. If you are going to Atlantic City you have to stay in a hotel on the boardwalk. I got this email from Total Rewards giving me a very good rate. It probably would have given me that rate at any of their hotels but I picked Harahs because I had heard it was this great hotel. I think there were three things that made my stay not go very well. First was the check in experience. I had booked my trip through the Total Rewards website with a special code to get a good deal on the room. I got a suite in the Atrium Tower for 120 total for 4 nights. I should have figured something was up when I got that rate. I had read some reviews about the Atrium tower being musty smelling and not the cleanest so I tried ahead of time to call Total Rewards and switch to either the Waterfront or Bayview towers. They told me they could put in a request but only the front desk could actually switch my reservation. So I tried to call and get connected to the front desk about 5 times unsuccessfully. Once I got them they were unable to guarantee me a switch in reservation either. So I figured I would just wait until I got there and then switch it. When I got to the front desk the lady there at first acted like she was trying to help me. She told me after checking that the Bayview tower was under construction so we could not stay there. Then she said she could get me into the Waterfront tower for an additional 120. However what she did not mention was that was a room not a suite. I had to ask questions and get her to finally tell me that. Why should I pay additional money to downgrade from a suite to a room. that is ridiculous. So I told her to forget about it. Second was the room. It smelled musty and smokey. I think the reason for the smoke smell is the smoking floors are on the bottom and non smoking on the top so all the smoke rises through the open atrium to the top floors. Disgusting. There was a spider web on the ceiling and one on the floor that were not cleaned up all week. Housekeeping came at 9 am everyday so we finally resorted to putting the Do Not Disturb sign out and then catching the maid later on in the day to come in and clean. There was a lamp in the living room part of my suite the did not work plus the toilet was leaking. So at this point I was totally frustrated. I went on the Total Rewards website and complained using their feedback form. I can tell that Total Rewards definitely cares about its customers because within 10 minutes I got a call from the Front Desk Supervisor addressing my complaints. She was the first one that finally told me the problem. There was a convention in town that was taking up most of the suites in the Waterfront tower and the other ones were being occupied by their Diamond and Seven Stars guests. So that is the problem. Apparently Harahs only cares about the Diamond and Seven Stars guests. If you are Platinum or Gold they could care less. She did tell me someone would be by to fix the lamp and toilet and she credited me 50 to put towards a charge to my room for room service food etc. The 50 credit was nice. We used it towards our room service bill. The toilet did end up getting fixed. They had to pull the whole thing off and replace the wax seal. The lamp never got fixed. They came up and looked at it and told me it had to be replaced. Then another person left me a note that the General Manager was going to replace it. However that never happened. The bed was hard as a rock and both my husband and I have back problems. We actually came home a day early because both of us were dreading having to sleep on that bed for another night. The third thing I was not crazy about was their casino. I was not crazy about any of the games there and the machines did not pay out at all. I lost 100 the first day there and 300 in the span of about an hour on my last night there. Not a place to go if you want to keep any money in your wallet. Now onto the good part. The room service was excellent. The food was very good and all the servers were very nice. We also went to the buffet there which was awesome. They had every kind of food you could think of. The other nice part of our trip was the spa. So the moral of the story is if you go to Harahs you have to stay either at the Bayview or Waterfront tower. Do not stay at the Atrium tower.", "offset": [3047, 3194], "date": "2016-02-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "f0dce3c9-8867-4f67-9ee7-3f52174ff24d", "sentence": "I stayed there this past weekend for one night.
