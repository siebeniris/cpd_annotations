Short walk from the MARTA station coming in there is a slight hill that will get you especially if you have luggage. super short walk to Piedmont Park. tons of restaurants bars within walking distance especially if you are not opposed to a 10 15 minute walk. The hotel itself is dark dark dark including the rooms. Even with blinds open and all lights on it can be a bit hard to see if you are digging in a bag for something or trying to put on makeup. Our room was clean enough at least from what you can see due to the lighting but we had friends in other rooms who were not as happy with the cleanliness level. Our service was good but again other people in our party had experiences that were not as good extraordinarily long waits for room service and items requested from front desk requests for service to a slow draining sink not addressed etc. Also there were certain days where our rooms were not cleaned though in the hotels defense we did not leave our rooms sometimes until early afternoon. Food and beverage in the hotel was pricey 70 for a 2 person room service breakfast 1215 for specialty cocktails etc though maybe not out of line with what is standard for the area. Overall we got what we thought was a good rate for a Midtown hotel the Ritz. etc. was twice as much so we are not overly dissatisfied but if you are expecting 5 star accommodations you might be slightly disappointed.", "offset": [718, 956], "date": "2015-05-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "1e4d4837-4544-4a6d-83f7-4392164b0104", "sentence": "This hotel needs renovation and elevator repair.

Clean room Negatives Smelled like marijuana on just about every hallway I walked down especially the floor where the pool is. the hotel definitely needs to do something about this because it was very noticeable I could smell pot as I took a shower it was so bad. The parking and room service the food and drinks in the room are way over priced. It cost 5 for a bottle of water so bring your own.

This problem had been there for a while judging by the cracked sheetrock etc but the worst part was that a very loud nightclub was housed in the hotel 3 stories under us which made it impossible to sleep. At 130 am we called to ask when it would be closed at which time they told us another hour. We asked to be moved to another room but the front desk said none were available. Finally the music was over but people continued shouting in the parking lot and hallways for another couple of hours. They actually had bouncers in the elevator lobby to make sure only guests were going up stairs. The front desk did offer us free breakfast as a conciliatory gesture. but after paying almost 2500 dollars for room and valet I really expect more. Maybe the upper stories are better.

Arriving on a Saturday late afternoon to a queue of about 4 groups with only 3 check in desks open not a good start 15 minutes waiting to check in while other members of staff stand by watching. Having been here before I asked for a room as far as possible from the lifts elevators. At night especially at the weekend the guests can be quite noisy late into the morning. Anyway I was given the last room down the hall on the 12th floor by Kate at reception who was very friendly and helpful. The rooms here are modern in style but getting tired and in need of a make over. The desk chair leather was all worn at the back see photo. The room is dark when you enter and finding the light switches is not easy you have to go around to each lamp in turn to switch them on. When all of the lights in the room are on full it is still not bright enough to see to empty your suitcase. The shower is a fixed head so you are washing your hair or wearing a shower cap and not very powerful. The tap in my room only ran cold water and when turned to hot made a terrible noise of vibrating pipes but no water. I needed to have some laundry done during my stay I placed it all in the plastic bag provided completed the paperwork and left the bag just inside the door. When I asked at reception when it would be collected I was told that I needed to bring it down myself in no other hotel where laundry service is provided do you need to bring your own bag of dirty clothes down through the hotel to reception. I would not mind but even with the corporate rate I am still paying over 200 per night. The bar on the Saturday night had a really nice vibe not too loud or busy. The bed is big but there is a thick mattress cover on the bed which is not properly secured and the sheet lifts as you get into the bed as the duvet is tucked in so tightly. Also the first night there was a blood stain on my bed sheet before I got in. I left it visible and the sheet was changed the following day. In the 6 nights and days I stayed at this hotel the mini bar was not refilled once. Also the same tiny bottle of shampoo and shower gel which was in my room on day one was the same and only one I had after 6 days. Not good enough when paying over 200 per night. When I eventually ran out of shampoo I complained and this was replaced. They also apologised for the mini bar and removed the costs of my 2 beers from the bill as well as offering to credit my awards account with some points I do not see these points in my account. When returning to my room after complaining about the lack of shampoo and toiletries replacement I found a plastic bag of toiletries on the table in the entrance not placed in the bathroom but dumped on the side table see attached photo perfectly highlighting the issue with this hotel the people working here are just too cool for the service industry. When I checked out I gave my honest feedback and received and apology plus a promise of some additional spg points. I do not see any additional points on my account however I received 212 for a 6 night stay where I received 202 for 4 nights in the W in Mexico City the week before without any additional.
