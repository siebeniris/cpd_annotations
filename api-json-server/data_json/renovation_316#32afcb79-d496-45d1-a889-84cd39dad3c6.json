Somehow this made our account look like we paid cash. Even though we gave a credit card at check in and were told it was for incidentals it was not explained to us this is not the same as being able to charge to our room. So when we ordered room service we could not charge it to the room and had to make a separate call to give our credit card number again to room service. To make it more frustrating the front desk refused to fix the issue over the phone and told us we had to go in person even though the same card number was already on file for incidentals. The same issue happened again with our pool daybed we were not able to charge it to the room wo a separate phone call even after going to the front desk to supposedly fix this. Our Identity membership was never added to the reservation either so we had to waste time going to the Identity desk to get our room charge and the separate charges added to our account. and you can not actually use the points you get after check out for another 24 hours. A lot of good that does when generally people are leaving for good soon after check out. We were hoping to cash them in for a lunch before leaving but instead we had a credit we could not use yet and unles we come back again within a year it will be worthless. At least we discovered Secret Pizza instead and had a great fast and cheap lunch there before leaving. The room itself was nice but not over the top. We stayed at Palazo earlier this year and it had more wow factor in my mind. The design elements in out Cosmo room were really cool though and the best part was the shower tub area. We had a 1bd Terrace. We were unable to get a room with a view of the Belagio fountains not surprising for 4th of July weekend but we did at least get a view of Marquee. For us it was perfect we are too old to really want to do the club thing. but young enough to enjoy the music and atmosphere via watching from our balcony. Anyone who is bothered by noise should not stay in a room anywhere near Marquee though. Our first morning after the room service credit card issue we discovered the stopper on our tub was broken right as we were about to use it. The maintenance guy was fast and helpful fixing it right away once he arrived but whoever we called did not relay the message until we had called a second time so we wasted about an hour on that. Our room was also missing a robe and the maintenance guy helped get us another one. We also could have used instructions on how the blinds work. We won a free coffee from Lucky Cat but when I tried to use it I was told it was supposed to have a stamp so I had to leave the long morning coffee line to go get help and waste more time. Overall all of the people we told our issues about were very helpful in resolving them but to truly have had a luxurious experience we feel like they never should have happened in the first place. Having had so many issues also let us know it was not just a one time fluke either. It seems like Cosmo is training it is folks on good customer service but is lacking on good communication and efficient systems to make the customer experience truly flawless. These were all small first world problems and did not ruin our stay by any means but we had been looking forward to staying at Cosmo for a while and we expected more. We would probably give them a second chance but with so many other great hotels on the Strip we will not be raving about Cosmo like we thought we would. A welcome package upon check in maybe with discounts for the cabana rental or passes to get into Marquee or a free drink somewhere or anything at all would have been nice. We have always received little perks like this at other hotels in Vegas so we were disappointed to get nothing more than a room key at chek in. Oh and please add coffee makers to the rooms. Palazo had them and it was great. We have stayed at Paris before too and they did not have them so I know Cosmo is not alone but really people a cup of coffee should not require ordering room service or leaving the room.", "offset": [2469, 2552], "date": "2015-07-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "509e72da-e86b-4305-980f-d4ece166862c", "sentence": "Contemporary hotel and amazing view from the room. I stayed at the Cosmopolitan from October 31 to November 7. So I think being able to give informed input from the hotel. To start and as described by others the hotel is beautiful. As soon as we enter we love the smell of perfume in the lobby. The check in was done relatively quickly and even if there is no line a clerk tells us which counter to go. I booked a room overlooking the Belagio fountains. You must choose this room as much of the value of this hotel is based on this type of room. I had to change room after one night because the water flowed from the light from the top of the tub ceiling. I was not very happy to have to redo my luggage to another room but was given a 50 credit in the restaurants and bars as compensation. I would have actually preferred a superior room as compensation but it was better than nothing. The room offers a large living section with sliding doors to the bedroom section so if you want to watch TV in the living room while your partner is sleeping it is very convenient. The bathroom is huge and what about the Japanese bath with shower and window overlooking the Strip. We could hear the water pipes from the adjoining bathroom and I must say it is a bit weird for a new hotel. There was also an elevator noise audible in the living room but nothing major. I recommend you do as I did and ask for a mini fridge in additional cost of 25 to put your drinks as you can not move drinks from the existing packed mini bar in the room. A Walgrens in front of the hotel will allow you to buy cheap drink. I loved the Bamboo pool and yes you have to arrive early to get a good seat with an umbrella but the same principle applies to the resorts in the south. If you are an early bird like me you can arrive at the pool around 10 am and get a good spot. The spa is fairly large but nice. For the food Wicked Spoon buffet is good but not great considering the high price. Only for brunch in the morning it will cost you 2750 per person. If one considers the exchange rate it is pricey. Since we were in Las Vegas for one week we had cheap breakfasts at McDonald few times in front of the hotel. I believe that security should control access to elevators leading to rooms like the Wyn does and other hotels of this category. We have seen a few times prostitutes who went alone upstairs. The hotels clientele is quite young. We have 36 years and I can tell you that we often felt older than average. You can easily get lost during the first hours of your stay and even the first days as the hotel is huge and has 2 towers west and east. The west tower is the most interesting with rooms overlooking the fountains. If I compare with my stay at the Wyn in 201 I would say the view from the room and location of the Cosmopolitan are great benefits. The size of the room with separate rooms are also positive sides. For cons at the opposite of the Wyn good quality customers is not there but we are in a trendy hotel with comtemporary decor so it comes with. I think I would go back because of the positives.", "offset": [656, 790], "date": "2015-11-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "9998fea3-9154-47b7-856b-62d6e97769ec", "sentence": "Love this hotel.

This is about our three days and three nights at the Cosmo. I have broken it down in to sections to make it easier to navigate. Check in check out. We arrived at 9 am and checked in. We were given our card keys and told we would be sent a text when our room was ready. I requested the West tower it is quieter and as high up as possible. We also signed something saying we would pay the resort fee. This was no surprise because every hotel I have stayed at in Vegas has a resort fee plus it is on their website and was mentioned when we booked our package with Southwest. Around 11 my phone went off. We had been out eating breakfast and checking out the shops at Planet Hollywood across the street. We were assigned room 4703 in the west tower. Keys worked great. Check out was at 4 am and went very smothlyRom our room was very clean. The furniture is showing signs of wear and tear. Bed was comfortable and my husband and I slept pretty well. We filled the bar sink up with ice and used it to keep beverages cold. The bottom of the fridge in the room is a freezer. The balcony was awesome and even at over 100 degree temps it was enjoyable as it is always shaded. We had the fountain view side. The patio furniture was a bit rundown but not dirty. The ashtray was closed but we did find a roach on the little balcony table. It was not an insect if you know what I mean. There were no wash cloths or bath mats the first day. When we left our room for breakfast the second day our room was cleaned and they gave us bath mats. On the third day we ran into housekeeping in the hallway and they gave us more towels. We told them we did not need them to clean the room that day. Housekeeping kept our toiletries plentiful. Overall housekeeping seemed to do well with the rooms. The hallways were always messy with sequins and glitter powdery substances dirt. We never saw or heard the hallways get vacuumed. Elevators seemed clean until we left to check out at 4 am. There were bags of chips and spit all over the elevator floor and many drunk young kids coming back to their rooms after a night of partying. The hotel really cool modern and unique sexy and hip. I would not call any of it luxury however. I have stayed several times at Belagio and Encore and they were more luxurious with better fitness areas and they felt more open. The rooms there were classier I guess. Furniture in better condition etc. Most of the main areas at Cosmo were clean and the smoke did not get out of control until later at night. The location is perfect. We walked so many places. The only time we did an Uber was before the LOVE show at Mirage and I was dressed up and did not want to get gross in the heat. It only cost 7. Not bad. No more cabs for me in VegasChandelier bar the bottom level is being renovated which takes a bit away from the whole chandelier bar but it was still gorgeous. Great photo opportunities here. I did try the Verbena cocktail and it was awesome. Drinks here are expensive 1520. but that is normal in Vegas. Restaurants we ate at Holsteins. I LOVED our bamboozled shakes. We split a burger and fries and it was plenty for lunch. The burger was good. The total was around 50. We did the Wicked Spoon for brunch one day. There was a decent variety. I liked that they had small portions so you could try more. Nothing really stood out as being excellent and we were too full for the gelato. A Vegas buffet is a Vegas buffet. It was 27 a piece and we also left a tip when we paid. Typical strip buffet price but still. Wow. So expensive. Pools if you want two seats together by the water you need to get there before 10. Otherwise you can find seats but when you want to get in the water you will not be able to keep an eye on your things because they will be so far away. We went at various times and it gets very busy. The pools are extremely small bamboo pool seemed smaller than blvd pool. I loved the zero entry and shapes of the blvd pol it was my favorite and pretty laid back quiet EDM music earlier then more pop mixed with EDM. Fun people watching there and I loved the loungers that sit in the pool. I just could not believe how small they were. All ages of people were at both pools and I was surprised at the amount of kids there in general. at the whole hotel. This is not a hotel for kids. We did not do the marquee pool party. Helpful tip you can easily go to Walgrens across the street but head in the main doors to the miracle mile shops and hit up the ABC stores instead. Almost as close and their alcohol was MUCH cheaper. Overal we enjoyed ourselves and the location. The view can not be beat. We got a good deal on this hotel but I would not stay here without getting a good deal. There are nicer hotels like Aria Belagio Palazo encore that you can stay at for the same price and sometimes less. My husband and I are in our mid thirties. We partied and had fun but the very obnoxious drunk college aged girls and boys began to get tiresome. This is a Hotel for partiers and they are slowly trashing a gorgeous property. it is too bad.

We stayed in a fountain view room on the 21st floor which gave us good views of the light shows every night. Our friends stayed on the 26th floor in the same style room they had a better view of the strip. If I was going to complain about one thing it would be the prices in the mini bar. I think 10 for a bottle of water is expensive but that was soon resolved with a trip over to CVS or Walgrens to pick up 4 1 litre bottles for the price of one from the mini bar.

I find the lobby casino and restaurants dark and somewhat claustrophobic and the incessantly high energy music a bit much especially during the day when the place is empty.

I do not really write reviews but I had such a bad experience at the Cosmo I want to share. I booked a package thru allegiant that included free breakfast. When I arrived at the Cosmo the man who checked me in by the name of dave was extremely rude he told me they could not find my reservation. I had to call allegiant and get a booking number. once I gave it to him he pulled it up it turned out to be under the secondary guests name. When asked for him to change it. He advised me that I would have to contact allegiant once again I contacted allegiant to have it change since I wanted to receive Identity points for my stay. Allegiant advised they did not know why the Cosmo had booked it under another name as I was primary on my reservation. Allegiant called in to get it updated but the Cosmo advised them since I was in the check in status it could no longer be updated even though I paid for the whole reservation and was using my card to pay for incidentals and resort fees. After he checked me I asked how I could use the buffet passes to which he responded there we no buffet passes included and once again I would have to call allegiant and get them to fix it. I called allegiant for the 3rd time and allegiant confirmed that there was a valid offer once again allegiant called the Cosmo and advised there was a promotion that was ran thru them for two free buffets per day of stay. The Cosmo then said they were not going to honor that since it was not send over originally. Allegiant sent over paper work I was told by allegiant rep showing the offer and that it was applied however the Cosmo refused to honor it. Finally allegiant refunded me what would be the cost of the free buffets for the length of my stay to make things right. I never got any help from the Cosmopolitan staff at all. I would highly recommend you stay at the Encore who in my opinion are much nicer rooms or at a forum suite at Cesars Palace which are just as big. The only good thing about the Cosmo is their brunch Buffet and the waiter I do not remember his name was so very nice.

The short version is is that guest relations here is very good and because of this I do not feel grumpy about losing time by having to change rooms. I loved the balconies the bathrooms the comfy beds and being able to smoke outside on the balcony. This property is well ventilated clean and maintenance issues are generally acted on very quickly. One thing that I did not understand was the fact that these awesome rooms the wrap around terrace rooms have kitchens with absolutely no utensils plates at all. Two glasses is all you get with no tea and coffee making facilities. I eat a lot of yogurt and love my tea and could not for the life of me find a teaspoon. I ended up buying a box of plastic spoons from a local convenience store 10 mins away. There can be very long lines to check in and check out. They do offer an express checkout which I recommend. We looked at a lot of the other hotels albeit not the actual rooms and if I went back I would stay here again.

Checked in right at 4p on a Thursday. With roughly 20 people waiting we completed the check in process in 20 minutes or so. More than acceptable. I did employ the 20 sandwich technique successfully. I was not looking for an upgrade but I asked if we could get one of the newly renovated rooms in the category we booked on a higher floor. The desk clerk was more than willing to accommodate our request. We booked a Terrace One Bedroom Fountain view and were given a freshly renovated room on the 55th floor of the Chelsea Tower. WOW what a view. Absolutely breathtaking. The size of the room was perfect for a couple on travel. Plenty of space large sitting area huge bathroom and a very comfortable king size bed. The terrace was ideal to relax with a drink and enjoy that view. Despite our sleeping in many days we always returned to find our room serviced with plenty of fresh towels. The complementary toiletries were always restocked daily. Since we are not gamblers I can not comment on the Casino but it looked very clean and upscale. We did dine at both the Wicked Spoon and the Henry. The Wicked Spoon buffet was good. I was not blown away by it but it was good. Our breakfast at The Henry was outstanding.
