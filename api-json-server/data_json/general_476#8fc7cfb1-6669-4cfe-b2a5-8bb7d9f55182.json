The hotel is in a wonderful location just walking distance from the 16th Street Mall and other downtown hot spots. My friends and I walked for hours downtown. There is also public transportation not far from the hotel. The hotel itself is one of the more modern Embassy Suites. I am glad to see Embassy updating its decor. The service was mostly excellent at the Front Desk very polite and courteous. I did have a GSR call my room around 9AM to ensure an issue from the previous day was resolved. While I think that is a wonderful touch I would recommend holding off until 1AM or even 12PM for non urgent calls as such especially on the weekends as it did wake me up. I do not get to sleep in often but when I do I really enjoy it. The only major issue I experienced was during my departure. I went downstairs to get a bell cart and was informed by the bellman that it is hotel policy that a bellman must accompany the bell carts. I have never had this response at a hotel before. I asked to have one sent up to my room ASAP as I was on my way to the airport. I waited nearly 20 minutes seriously 20 minutes is way way too long and a bellman never came. I ended up lugging 3 suitcases a backpack and 2 shopping bags downstairs by myself. First it should not be hotel policy that a bellman must accompany the bell carts. That is not an appropriate response and will not win you positive remarks from guests. Second if you must make that the hotel policy the bellman need to be quicker than 20 minutes. I understand the bellman probably just want tips which is why they want to help. but I would not have tipped at that point anyway because I was so frustrated. it is really as simple as that staff more or let guests take bell carts. Fix this ASAP. it really is a silly thing to let a happy guest leave unhappy over something so easy to fix.", "offset": [225, 268], "date": "2015-02-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "23d21349-8988-4bb5-b841-921b2a7aee6c", "sentence": "worst experience ever. i wanted to treat my family to a night in a nice hotel while visiting my son He only had one night off So to start off valet parking takes our car but not our bagswe had to carry suit cases up to 4th floor to check inmy daughter says it smelled like smoke when we first entered room. I have a cold so I did nt notice. Later that night after walking all over 6th street I was looking out the window and noticed the curtains smelled. not freshwel it took 6 days after checking out to get a receipt. they charged us 74 for valet parking. we had one car one night. they also charged me 2500 smoking fee I have called them everyday since coming home just to get my receipt for chargesthey told me the 250 would be refunded so I did not question itthen after finally talking to billing she tells me the 2 valet charges I told her that was not right and she said she would fix itshe did for a 37 creditthen said a 250smoking fee. I was dumbstruck. what. so now I was transfered to housekepng manager who said she would look in to it and call me back. I still have not got a call even with me calling everydaywhich I do nt have time for when working 12 hr days being a general manager. this is the worst customer service I have ever seen. so my one night is costing me 602 for a room that was 279. I will make sure to tell the many travelers I encounter everyday to not stay at this place unles you want to be robbed. YOU HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EMBASSY SUITES DOWNTOWN DENVER.

My husband and I booked a last minute room in Denver for our 5th anniversary and found this hotel online. We originally wanted to stay at the Oxford but they did not have many rooms available and are rather expensive would have stayed if we had 1000 to blow on two nights stay. I will have to say that I was expecting the run of the mill corporate hotel experience which is usually mediocre but was pleasantly surprised instead. The front desk staff got on my request for extra pillows I am pregnant and need them right away and once we got in the room and I saw that the bottles of toiletries are rather small I called the desk to have more sent and they were at our door with in 5 minutes. Later that evening Mark the front desk coordinator sent us a complementary bottle of wine and a cheese and fruit plate which was at least 50 worth of room service and a wonderful card to us. It was a welcome surprise even if I could not really drink the wine but my husband did. The other amenities are great and I do recommend booking a premium room for a few buck more as it comes with wifi and free snacks. The rooms themselves are spacious VERY clean and have a nice view. The hotel itself is easy to access and located centrally so it is convenient. The place was packed with Packers fans in town for the Broncos Packers game that Sunday but the complementary breakfast service which has a wide variety of items hot and cold omelette bar went off with a hitch anyway. It was by far the best free breakfast I have ever had while traveling with the exception of a higher end BB I would stay here again definitely.", "offset": [0, 39], "date": "2015-11-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9d4bc202-db08-4ebb-b3b3-0fb3ffa364df", "sentence": "Disappointed.

The 1st night we walked on 16th street which was a short 2 block walk. This street has clothing stores as well as restaurants.

My husband and I traveled to Denver with another couple for a Broncos game. I am a huge review reader and chose the downtown Embassy Suites for location amenities and of course the large number of positive reviews. We were very happy with our choice. We arrived prior to check in time and were able to store our bags downstairs with the concierge while we grabbed some lunch. Check in was quick and friendly. Our king bed rooms were very large comfortable and clean. We ate the included breakfast buffet one morning and found a very large selection of options which were all very tasty. Our only complaint is the set up was very unorganized. The drinks were first in the line and should have been last. People were moving about in a helter skelter fashion which added to the chaos. The line for the omelet station was long and would have required more patience than we had. With that said that is a very small negative and far outweighed all the positives we encountered. We also took advantage of the included happy hour with snacks. We very much appreciated these included extras.

We were there Friday night. she has no social skills. Thank Goodness Melissa bartender was there because she was Awesome really hard workerThe next night we were there and there was 2 other couples. We were having so much fun. We met them there. Blake another Bar Manager was Amazing. He was fun to talk to yet he was on his toes. Hard WorkerVery Responsible young man. it was probably about 10 1030pm and Blake went on break or something. I asked Aria for another drink and she said I can get you water I said why would I want water she said you have had Enough. It took me all my might not to jump over the counter. lol. So we all left and there was none left in the Bar. We all went to another bar. The next night we were there another great bartender tall skinny kid long hair and beard. he was Awesome to.
