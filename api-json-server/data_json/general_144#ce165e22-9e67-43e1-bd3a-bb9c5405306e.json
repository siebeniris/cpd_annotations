Stayed at the Westin Long Beach with some friends over a weekend. The main positives are the comfortable beds and good location which is walking distance of some of the beach and some bars near more downtown. The area around the establishment is pretty pleasant. There are some problem areas which detracted from our stay. Check in seemed easy and the front desk was friendly. The lobby is an attractive place where you can relax for a bit. I was in a double room and there was a decent amount of space for 4 people. The bed was quite comfortable and the room seemed clean. However there were not many lights in the room and even with all of them on the room was always too dark. The AC worked fine it seems like they usually charge for Wifi according to the log in site. wow who does that these days. but we were able to get it for free on our stay and it was satisfactory. Your room gets 2 free bottles of water a day which was really handy. Even though the door is thick you can still hear people in the hallway fairly well you may want to ask for a room farther away from the elevators. The bathroom was of a decent size and I liked that there was a usable amount of space around the sink. The room door had a problem where it often would not close completely it seemed like the door just barely did not fit. This is a potential security issue that the hotel needs to address in fact the hotels roving security knocked on our door once to tell us the door was not fully closed.

I was excited when I was told we had be staying at the Westin Long Beach because of the heavenly beds. I was there for a work conference and brought my family along to continue our Spring Break holiday that had started in Vegas. Michael checked me in and did not give me an upgrade because I am not at a certain level in my Mariot Reward Status. If I were a Chairman I think he said I had get an automatic upgrade to their penthouse. I told him if no chairmans showed up that night to remember my family and I. He did not think that was funny. Yes the hotel is under renovation and looks like it however they made it for it by giving out complimentary champagne with blueberries daily for a few hours and they had free coffee and muffins croissants as you left the hotel which was nice. The room was tiny for our family of 5. Since my work covered the room I could not complain and thankfully my kids did not even though they had just returned from staying at the all suite Palazo in Vegas. The good news was that they did bring in a big rolaway bed which our teenage daughter liked very much. I expected a little cot like they gave me at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose but this was a full sized bed which was very nice for her but made our room even more cramped. After our 3rd day we opted for maid service and removed the do not disturb sign. I came back from the convention center around 30pm and decided to leave because the housekeeper had not cleaned the room and luckily my family was not back from their outing yet either. On my way back out to the convention center I stopped at the front desk and was going to remind Michael give us the Penthouse that is only reserved for Chairmans since our room was not cleaned. Instead I met a sweet girl named Nayeli and asked her about housekeeping times and as I was leaving I quickly asked if they had a slightly bigger room for our family. With a friendly smile she said absolutely. I thanked her and said I had think about it knowing very well my family would have a fit moving all of our stuff on our last night there. Oh well. I came back at 530pm and to my surprise the room was still not cleaned. I called the front desk and asked what happened and they did not know. They put me on hold and when I spoke to the front desk manager he said that they would be glad to send a housekeeper right away. Instead I asked to change to the upgraded room that Nayeli had offered earlier. He said he had have to call me back. My family arrived and I told them we might be moving and of course they were not happy but I wanted a fresh clean spacious room. Instead of a phone call Sergio arrived to take our luggage which of course was not ready but he graciously left the luggage cart with us and returned to move us a little while later. Needless to say the 16th floor room made all the difference. It was not suite nor the Penthouse but it was clean very high ceilings and just the right space than the little room we were in before. We were right next to the elevator and had a pool view. My kids thought the pool and hot tub were fine. Thank you to Nayeli and Sergio who moved us as well as the other Sergio who poured our champagne along with all the other workers who poured our champagne every afternoon which was my highlight of this trip. I have got to mention that I spent two days on the third floor in the Tokyo conference room and that entire area down there was nice with clean bathrooms and the catered box lunch was good. Other days I was at the convention center which is about a 5 minute walk or so from the Westin. Oh I had a chance to visit the Renaissance which is part of the Mariot. Fancy lobby which I think the Westin will have after their renovation. Overall I would not return not even when I am a Chairman.

I was attending a wedding in Long Beach on a Friday and did n\u2019t want to sit in crazy Friday traffic so I decided to get a hotel for the night. I booked an express deal on priceline and ended up getting The Westin. Just like some others have said they are currently renovating their lobby area so it \u2019s a bit small. They have one restaurant and only had one bartender server and he was great but I felt bad that he had to make the drinks and take orders all by himself. Check in was fairly smooth since I already paid for everything through Priceline but before arriving it was a nightmare. I tried to call and add my boyfriend on the room in case he showed up before me so he can check in and somehow was transferred to the Westin international line. when I called the Westin Long Beach directly and spoke to someone who could n\u2019t find my reservation then somehow was able to find it did n\u2019t listen to anything I told them so I had repeat everything and then she said everything should be done and processed. I had this feeling that I could n\u2019t trust her so I called the Westin Long beach again to make sure and was told nothing was changed and they were n\u2019t able to make changes since I booked it through Priceline. Okay so you \u2019re telling me I wasted my time calling and being transferred to the international line while being told something totally different. Nice. The \u201c business center \u201d is one table in the lobby with two computers. The room I stayed in had a broken A C and had to call and have them fix it after I left. It was fixed but very weak when I got back to the room. They try to make up for the renovation by serving champagne with berries in the afternoon and offered coffee and pastries for breakfast which I did n\u2019t try. So I guess that \u2019s a nice gesture. Parking is 15 day and WiFi is not free. Overall the room was basic. It was clean and a satisfactory hotel but nothing special.

The hotel lobby is undergoing significant renovation which means you enter a side entrance around the corner from the driveway. The lobby has been moved. There is a very narrow hallway the width can not fit 2 person comfortably from the elevators to the lobby which was carpeted but not flat underneath cords etc were perceptible underneath. As a courtesy they offered champagne and berries bubbles and berries in the afternoon.", "offset": [773, 960], "date": "2019-06-07", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 34, "uid": "351dd11e-a275-4202-b608-12fa93609fa7", "sentence": "I think I should start with the positives everything looks good in the room clean bedroom and an ok view.

My poor experience of this hotel started at check in. I was advised that our room would be ready within the hour so rather than go to the pool we waited and had a bite to eat. Two hours later when we returned we were informed they had no rooms ready. When we eventually made it to the VERY SMALL swimming pool not as it looks in the photos. with probably no more than a dozen sun loungers there was nowhere to sit further dissatisfaction. Later in the afternoon we tried the pool for a second time and found one lounger and one chair there was three of us but we made do. Our time at the pool was unpleasant people playing their own music loudly. I \u2019m not sure what they were playing but music with lots of foul bad language. My 8 year old son was present and there were other young children at the pool so I requested the guest playing the music turned it off. There was no presence from the hotel staff at polside so lots of unruly behaviour. As for trying to sleep in this hotel good luck. the noise was like New Years Eve in Times Square I have made a recording and will be forwarding to the management of the hotel. The room could best be described as dated basic and dark. The towel rail in the bathroom collapsed when reaching for a towel. I am writing this review after one night of a two night booking at The Westin and will desperately be trying to find another hotel for our second night in Long Beach.", "offset": [1168, 1225], "date": "2019-07-21", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 36, "uid": "65c84b77-9959-402e-b88d-b72b9252f01f", "sentence": "Great stay at the Westin.

We stayed at the hotel and it was my worst experience in a hotel in the United States. We have never had such a bad welcoming. Yet I used to travel a lot. Indeed I accompanied my husband for his work and he had sent an email to confirm a room with a double bed. Upon arrival at the hotel the front desk woman Leslie she replied that there was no room with a double bed available and that we had to send an email before coming. We replied that the email has been sent but that no one has deigned to reply. Leslie answered us haughtily and did not want to call her manager when we asked her. Then she left in a room she came out and told us that there is a room available on the 5th floor with a double bed. Who are we laughing at. We were exhausted because of the flight and we just wanted what we have asked for. 1 hour later we went back down to the front desk to withdraw money. Leslie was even less agreeable. I have never seen such unacceptable behavior for a hotel and for a hotel staff. When my husband asked her something she did not even bother looking at us not once. I can tell you that this is the first time that we feel so little considered and yet we just wanted a simple efficient and pleasant service worthy of your hotel. Having a travel agency that works mainly with luxury hotels and French palaces it was the first and last time that I come to your hotel. I like to test hotels with my husband in order to come back with my family or talk to our friends about it and why not come back to select it for my travel agency. But we were so disappointed that I will tell everyone around us including my clients to avoid your hotel. Moreover toilet seat was dirty and also the bathrobes.
