We spent two nights at this hotel and found the sleeping quality to be excellent. The front desk was extremely friendly and helpful. The bedding was first rate however the pull out sofa was lacking in linens. This was corrected on our second night. The bathroom was small but adequate. Our room overlooked the freeway but this did not cause any noise problems. My biggest complaint would be the location is not really close to anything except for corporate offices.

Very attractive facility with upscale ambience at a reasonable rate. Some features were missing from the family experience clearly designed to increase your expense account atop the affordable rate. No microwave in the room no Comcast Sports on TV hoping you had head down to the bar and spend a small fortune16 for a domestic beer and a glass of wine without tip is craziness no free breakfast available and I have no recollection of a free WiFi code.

Driving from Chicago to Wisconsin I would always see this nice looking hotel to the right. I finally booked a room last Sunday for 1 night. I was really hoping it had an outdoor pool but they only had indoor with a hot tub but they both turned out to be great because it was overcast anyways. This place is really nice only 15 minute ride from city but its on the North Shore. Huge free parking lot. When we walked into lobby we were impressed. Beautiful huge with plenty of seating. Angel check us in he was very nice. Our room was bigger than I expected almost like a 1 bedroom condo. After hanging at uncrowded pool I wanted to try the great looking lobby bar but I think they close a little early on Sundays no problem I just got a beer from my room and went back to enjoy the lobby they had a few big screen tvs. 1 thing about this hotel they have the best AC I have ever experienced in a lobby and hallways. That s the way I like it but my wife joked she felt like she was in a MEAT LOCKER and she forgot her PARKA. Ca nt please everyone.

I stayed at the Hyat again this Thanksgiving. Maybe the fifth year I have done so at the holiday as family lives nearby. The rates are very reasonable given the quality of the hotel. I guess that since there is no business demand the room prices drop considerably but the hotel and its amenities remain the same. One tip. I made my reservation at least a month before arrival. About a week before check in I chrcked the Hyat site and found the price had gone down something like 10 a night.
