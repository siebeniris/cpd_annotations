The staff continued to show their hospitality through their concierge service and the wait staff at the Terrace restaurant. My high heels needed repair and for less that 10USD the concierge arranged for the shoe maker to pick up fix and return to my room within hours. The waitress at dinner was very lovely and paid great attention to me. The best part of the hotel is that it is away from the busy streets with the most marvelous views of Seoul AND yet you still have easy access to the happenings with their free shuttle service.

The renovation of the rooms at Grand Hyat Seoul has been quite well done. Structure of the great former interior design has been kept and new additions make the room comfortable and good looking. The biggest improvement is the bathroom which looks now very elegant and open though being small for a hotel of that category. Food at the Club Lounge was very nice not a huge choice but all of good quality. For many clients the main frustration would come from the pool and the sauna. If the pool looks great there are far not enough sun beds around it for a hotel that big. The reason is that a big business is done with the pool restaurant and tables are preferred to sun beds for the clients. it is very early 6 pm closing time confirms it. During summer the rule is that you can access the pool only once during your all stay that is insane and will prevent me to book again during that period. But again it is understandable considering that restaurant seems a priority there. Last noticeable thing is that the access at the sauna is charged if you are not booked into a Club room this is totally unfair.

The decor seating lighting and A V equipment were perfect but what grabbed my attention was how at lunchtime the screen I used for my presentation magically disappeared to reveal a separate room for lunch. And lunch was extraordinary. The hotel staff was discreet and efficient.
