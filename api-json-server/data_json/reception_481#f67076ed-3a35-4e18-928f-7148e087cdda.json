I have very mixed feelings about this place. let us start with good points very helpful front desk fast check in very high quality WiFi everywhere including the ocean beach and it is free the quality of the connection and the speed is much better than in the vast majority of places I have ever been to some of the staff are fantastic and very welcoming the rooms are spacious and reasonably clean room furniture is of high quality natural wodthat is all about the good things. Now let us start with everything else. And the overall theme is very obvious the place is very badly managed. As some of the reviewers have already said on numerous occasions the level of service is very uneven and in general terms inadequate for the Mariot brand. Here we go as far as the gruesome details are concerned. Rooms are cleaned daily but the front desk had to be reminded that it was time to change the bed sheets 4th night and on a daily basis at least one minor thing was missing the cleaner either would forget to put in clean towels or the shampoo or tea bags. I remained at this property for 10 nights and I can remember literally two occasions only when all was done properly in terms of regular room cleaning. On one particular morning I had to resist 3 three consecutive attempts to deliver room service several breakfasts to my room which I had never ordered. It took about an hour to sort this out. Even after a conversation with the front desk the servers kept knocking on my door with loaded food trays. I was not surprised at all when on checking out I saw they had still attempted to charge me for it. To give them their credit the charge was promptly removed as soon I pointed it out. Breakfast. In terms of staff Calypso restaurant this is where they serve breakfast is the worst on the property. There are one or two exceptions eg the Indian chap who looks like head of the team and couple of waitresses. but overall the level of service is truly appalling. Tables are not washed properly and are often sticky crockery including plates has fingermarks all over and one struggles to find a clean plate. It takes them 10 15 min to bring you your orange juice and coffee. If you ask for tea it will take them about 20 min. The most efficient manner to serve juice is to make it self service. Surely this is obvious is not it. During my 11 days stay there marked deterioration was happening in terms of speed of service and its quality. When you leave the restaurant you can grab a coffee or tea to go from the self serving dispensers. The tea urn disappeared after the first 4 5 days and never returned. Generally they have some strange problem with tea at this place for example in your room you have only green and camomile tea bags but no regular black tea. Earl Grey is almost unheard of there. Omelet station. The ladies there are most helpful and professional. There was one exception though. Having already breakfasted 4 5 times there and having successfully ordered poached eggs on all these occasions I asked for poached eggs again one morning from a omelet station lady I did not see before. First she pretended she did not understand me. Then she said they did not do poached eggs. On my dismay at this answer after all I have been eating them for almost a week there she said Well I do not do them. That was delivered in a most rude and dismissive manner. That is absolutely unacceptable. Anyone behaving like that should be fired on the spot. Breakfast buffet is very poorly stocked. One tiny plate of undefinable cold cuts equally tiny plate of sliced cheese. and on an odd day some smoked salmon. This is it. The rest will be pastry good quality and made on the premises by the way the pastry chef is good there porridge full English breakfast hot selection omelets and cereals. It took me some time to find any fruit there. It was well hidden behind the omelet station and consisted of two types of melon sliced. In terms of healthy food options and fruit this was a major disappointment. Beach bar. Staff there is second worst on the property but the gap with the leader Calypso is rapidly narrowing. Same staff work at the beach bar and the BQ beach cafe next to it. On one particular afternoon it took them 25 min and after my repeated prompts only to bring me the cafe menu. The service is very slow very sloppy extremely unfriendly and often outright rude. On one occasion a plate of food was banged in front of me without a word and with no cutlery. When I asked for a fork the plea had to be addressed to the slowly retreating back of the waitress. the waitress in question simply shouted to one of her colleagues behind the counter Fork. and pointing to my table without even turning her head to me. They treat their customers at the bar exactly in the same manner. I also discovered that in order to be noticed and served you have to be loud and to drop your British accent. Another observation if you see a name badge with Best associate of the month August 201 or any date at all you should run as these are the worst in terms of rudeness. Blu Restaurant. Staff are welcoming and courteous. Menu is not extensive but still adequate. The level of cooking is also adequate and very average. I wish I could say more but unfortunately there is nothing remarkable about their cuisine. The execution is a bit sloppy the recipes are not particularly inventive. Royal Grille. Staff are well trained and very courteous. Menu is supposed to be of the higher end and there is indeed some positive difference between them and Blu. Unfortunately the difference is not that marked. Execution of the dishes is less sloppy that at Blu but is still below the high end standards. La Cucina. This one is the worst of them all. Ridiculously overpriced mediocre food that pretends to be Italian. I have never seen nor smelled before a lobster that has a full aroma of a dishcloth accidentally boiled in staled coffee. I have now. In terms of portion size La Cucina is truly American as they are truly gargantuan. The quality is so abysmal though that I wonder if quantity is supposed to somehow compensate it. Lobby Bar. The best staff work there. They are truly fantastic genuinely welcoming and impeccable in everything they do. The bar is well stocked the service is fantastic. do not go for food there though food will be coming from La Cucina. They also have a sushi station there with the sushi being made for order on the spot. I have not sampled them but they look reasonably authentic and proved to be very popular with the punters no surprise here though. anyone having a choice between some sushi and anything that comes out of La Cucina will make this decision. One of the great mysteries of the place is why the restaurants are often closed without any notice. You have to enquire if Royal Grille or Blu are open tonight on a daily basis. Why. And by the way never believe any notices that they put on restaurant doors. Eg if you see a notice on Blus doors saying that they are closed tonight double check at the front desk very often they simply forget to remove it. To summarise. The property badly needs a good manager and some shaking up. It is becoming damaging to the brand. In the next 3 4 years there will be at least two more up scale high end properties at St Kits eg Hayat. Mariot will have to decide if they are going to compete for the high end clientele or if they are going to downgrade themselves into a second class mediocre property. So far the signs are not good for them. I have them 3 of 5 here. If I was to rate them on a 1 to 10 scale I would not give them more than a 5.", "offset": [1416, 1522], "date": "2015-04-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "4a0ee4b4-6313-40d7-af62-c7f76f8baf0e", "sentence": "Comfortable Elegance.

For some reason no one offered to assist us so we were very surprised when we discovered we had to haul our luggage all the way up ourselves. The food options ranged from decent to blegh. The Calypso cafe is one of the only eateries that is open all day and the food here was my least favorite to put it kindly. This is also the same food as room service. The pizza shack was ok. We tried it twice and scored the second time when we got the 4chese pizza highly recommend. You can pick up beer or wine at the hotel gift shop to store in your room but the wine options are VERY limited. Pretty much only lower end vintages of Diablo de Casilero and Beringer white zin.

The Mariot in St Kits is a beautiful expansive resort and you instantly feel relaxed as you enter through the winding driveway. Each time we have visited the hotels d\u00e9cor and appearance have remained pleasing and it is far superior in look and style to Mariot hotels in the US for example. However the beauty of the property is instantly ruined when you encounter its incompetent staf1. The bell staff do not assist you they seem to not bother when you are non Caucasian as we watched van after van full of Caucasian tourists being greeted like old friends. My husband is an international celebrity who was born in these parts yet the locals out of their own ignorance do not seem to think anyone non Caucasian is worthy of having their bags assisted with. We travel extensively and nowhere else in the world do bell staff behave like we should be carrying THEIR bags2. I wrote to the General Managers Executive Assistant to advise that it was my husbands birthday and could she assist me in arranging something special for my husband. Granted it was a weekend I understood why she may not have responded however I did not receive an email response any time after that to even check whether anyone else had sorted the request out for me basic client care and certainly what you would least expect from the Executive Assistant to the hotels General Manager. I had attempted to speak to Guest Relations before I emailed the Executive Assistant. The Guest Relations woman advised me that they do not have balloons to go with the birthday cake and asked me to go and buy the cake from the Cafe myself. I mean where else in the world would the Guest Relations Executives make you arrange your own birthday surprise dinner for a guest and a VIP guest at thatI thought writing to the GMs Assistant might ensure better service but I did not even receive a response from her I mean who cares about one of your return guests special occasions. right. 3. The Spa at the hotel has a very scary and extremely unfriendly woman named Tresy who does hair and apparently make up. I am an extremely friendly person unles of course you are rude to me. And that is exactly what she was. The first time I booked into the Spa she put me in a dirty chair full of stains and I had to request that she place a clean towel on the chair as I did not want to stain my clothes at this point I was very friendly when I requested this. She then did the most basic job with my hair and said she did not have time to do my make up. I asked her nicely if she could do just a few touches here and there because I already had some make up on. She then touched up my make up and charged me the full price as if she had done the makeup from scratch. I did not say anything at the time and walked out shaking my head. Unfortunately as this is the only full service Spa in the vicinity I returned a few days ago during a repeat stay at the Mariot. This time this awful woman greeted me with the iciest stare imaginable and made me sit in the same dirty chair when I pointed out it was stained again. and despite insisting that I wanted to sit in another chair. She said this is the chair I work at. She then refused to wash my hair as I had hair extensions in. I had never heard anything more insane and I have had top stylists work on my hair around the world including singer JLos stylist in London. Tresy then proceeded to be extremely rude and ask when I would stop wearing extensions or was I wanting to go bald. Yes you read correctly. that is what she kept saying to me over and over. She said SHE would never add anything to her hair and said she had seen people with even longer hair than mine and even though i may come from a family of people with very long hair it would not stop me going bald etc etc. It became apparent that this was not about hair but that she was attacking me personally especially as I was wearing CLIP IN EXTENSIONS which you do not have to be a hairdresser nor a genius to know how to put in or take out. I was so shocked at the insults she was dishing out that I considered walking out right then. She then proceeded to laugh and joke with her colleagues as if how she had treated me was perfectly normal. When it was time to do my make up Tresy said she did not have an eyebrow pencil and so she could not do my makeup. How can you be a full service Spa and not have an eyebrow pencil. I told her its a good thing you are not doing bridal makeup today because imagine how the bride would have looked. She then proceeded to use my own eyebrow filler and made me look like Frankenstein I promise readers I am not exaggerating here. I had also had my hair done at the Spa by the Spa Supervisor named Tashana who I believe does not specialise in hair but did a far better job than the evil Tresy. Tashana also had the courtesy to cover the stained chair with a towel before I had even walked in. Having Tresy work here is like entering the House of Horrors and there is no excuse for that sort of ugly behaviour at a business hotel. The only redeeming feature of this Spa is its lovely Manager Marguerita who is extremely service orientated and profesional4. The Lobby Bar has a great little worker named Karen. The Hostess at the Lobby Bar on the other hand is absolutely ridiculous. Each evening I have taken my top black sporting VIPs and politician friends there the Hostess will always talk to all other non black guests for the longest time and visit our table last and spend less than a minute with us. Our table are clearly never good enough even though several sporting millionaires and politicians are seated at the table albeit the wrong skin colour quite evidently. It is a disgusting mentality and practice in these islands that needs urgent change especially as a number of sporting franchises my clients play in use this hotel and I am sure we could quite easily take our business elsewhere5. The Front Desk Duty Manager Diane is the rudest woman I have ever encountered at Management level in any hotel and we travel all over the world on international sporting tours and international business regularly. Not only did this Manager say she is not familiar with who my husband is which does not actually matter one iota given 50 million fans around the world know who he is and yet his fellow countrywoman did not. she also insisted that only Mariot Gold and Platinum members receive free wifi. Strange given that I have NEVER paid for wifi at this hotel in 3 years of staying here and given that Mariots own website states that Rewards members not just Gold and Platinum Rewards members receive free wifi if booked directly and given that my own Rewards number has since been accepted and it is not Gold nor Platinum. To deal with a rude Manager is bad enough but to have a rude Manager who does not know their own product is just laughable6. do not even get me started on Room Service. EVERY SINGLE TIME we have ordered Room Service an item is always missing. I mean always. I have complained about this countless times but its like speaking to dummies. Yesterdays order was the WORST and a potential health and safety hazard. Imagine taking a miniature bottle of Mayonnaise into my hand which they delivered with our food only to find out it was UNSEALED and HALF EMPTY. It made me sick to my stomach and very very concerned about the quality of the kitchen if guests were being sent unsealed bottles of half empty Mayonnaise with their food. I would hate to be a fly in that kitchen if staff do not check what they are putting on peoples food trays as someone had clearly helped themselves to most of the Mayonnaise in that botle7. I once caught the Housekeeper cleaning the inside of the toilet bowl with the SAME DIRTY BROWN cloth that she then cleaned the toilet flushing handle and the sink and taps with. I was so horrified that I rang the Housekeeping Manager immediately. I could just imagine how rooms are cleaned when guests are not around. For example we are in an Executive Suite at the moment and although the suite itself is nicely decorated and huge the carpets were full of crumbs when we checked in and there are mosquitoes and bugs in the romAl in all the hotel itself is beautiful. But the staff are just hopeless ignorant and never ever improve their standards or service and although the General Manager keeps responding to reviews with reassurance on TripAdvisor the same mistakes and the same lack of care continue to take place over and over again. Being in the islands is simply no excuse because the island relies on tourism in the first place and we have visited islands such as the Maldives Singapore Sri Lanka and Fiji which are so incredibly efficient and excellent in comparison.", "offset": [6896, 6939], "date": "2016-03-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "debec670-a1b0-43b0-9733-8b4681097254", "sentence": "fabulous hotel facility sensational beaches all service staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

We traveled to St Kits from Tuesday Satrday with a large group as part of a business rewards trip and were part of an all inclusive package with wrist bands. Before I go into the negatives of the experience I will say that there were a few people on staff that were wonderful a manager named Boston who we visited with on the grounds about the group we were with a young lady working at the In the Sun gift shop super bubbly looked you in the eye and seemed genuinely kind a taller gentleman name beginning with D who worked as a doorman helpful and talked my husband and I through the best way to walk up to St Timothy Overlook as well as an older woman who worked in the Pizza shack we were getting waters on Wednesday night before bed and she asked how our trip was going and actually seemed genuine in her question. Considering the length of our stay I think it is sad I can count on one hand the people who were actually good at their jobs at this resort. UNTIDY. Sadly I refused to get in the pool. There was a constant film of oil and dirt that rested on the surface. At night when the water was still it covered the entire pool but as people were in it during the day the oil and dirt was pushed to the edge and there was a darker yellowish ring of about 6 in of water outlining the entire pool. As you walked the grounds you had notice beer caps and trash in the landscaping and almost all the windows were in need of washing. Things appeared nice from afar but were quite unkept. The beach in front of the hotel was scattered with shards of plastic and as we walked the beach we were astonished by the amounts of trash. Things like rusted a oil barrel shoes cups wrappers ect. I know it was not all on Mariot property but it seems there needs to be more effort by the government put into beach maintenance. POOR SERVICE. Most all that we saw of the bartenders were women never smiled rarely said a word basically made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by getting you a drink. One woman at the swim up pool bar even turned to look at me and rolled her eyes when my husband ordered a beer for himself and a pina colada for me she slowly tromped about making the drink apparently she was annoyed she had to go through the hassle of blending my drink as opposed to grabbing a beer from the fridge. Service at the restaurants was also frustrating. I understand we were on island time. and I could handle that as long as the server made me feel like I should be relaxed and not that I had been completely forgotten. One night at the Blu it took three reminders and 45 minutes for our friend to get a single beer. Was there any sort of apology from our server. Of course not. Now I have been a server from diner to family Italian restaurant to fine dining and spent my college years slinging beers and pub food in a brewery next to Wrigley field in Chicago I know what good service looks like. And even when I was most busy my service came with a smile acknowledgment that things were taking longer then usual and genuinely checking to ensure people were enjoying themselves. I think possibly the greatest missing link at the Mariot in St Kits was GENUINE service. There was one lady at the front desk who in fact could use a lesson in common kindness. Thursday we were told there would be an activity for our group in the St Vincent room. I looked on the map we had been provided and did not see any listing for that room so I politely asked the woman working the front desk where I could find it. She looked at me as if I were an idiot and pointed her finger to the corner of the lobby and said All the meeting rooms are clearly marked. We heard from multiple people that St Kits had turned from the sugar industry to tourism in 205 maybe it is taking a while for that new mentality to settle in.

Brenda at the concierge desk always gave us great advice. Tiandra and Yashida were great at Blu and gave us scrumptious meals. Cynde at the lobby bar answered my million questions about St Kits and was always giving us outstanding service. Karen at the steakhouse was outstanding along with the food. It was so good we ate there twice in a row. Livia at the hotel bar was amazing and always serving great drinks fast. Marcus spun up magnificent mojitos at the lobby bar. My wife and I were not bitten by any sharks at the beach. There were bountiful palapas available on the beach each day. There were also a bevy of pool chairs with shaded canopies attached available each day. The cab ride from the airport to hotel was 16 US. Would absolutely come back.", "offset": [132, 189], "date": "2018-04-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "bc3876a3-b0a1-4ae1-9cb4-688e866d13a4", "sentence": "Came for a conference and flew in a couple days early.

I want to start by saying that all of the Vacation Club staff and management are one of the best i have experienced at a resort we have been to Ritz four seasons st Regis. We had a rocky start with our stay and the vacation club staff stepped up to turn our vacation experience around by accommodating us with any requests. Starting from top management down Claudia S Candace W Nicon Nicola Elise and Simeon in security more names i forgot they went above and beyond to make up for some of the shortcomings of the Mariot St Kits property. The vacation club is managed separately from the Mariot resort staff. However the vacation club sits inside the Mariot hotel property and shares the entire Mariot resort amenities. I state this clearly because you should read Mariot resort reviews to get a sense of the property which i feel is a bit dated and in need of some love. 2 Bedroom Villas these are part of the vacation clubWhile advertised as newly renovated keep in mind only the appliances and furniture were updated. The rooms still feels dated with old tiles and vanities. They are however extremely clean and spacious with new washer dryer and full kitchen. RAMS across the street has everything you need to stock fridge. There was a mildew smell in our bedroom we think from the AC vent but we probably were unlucky with our room because we had one of the worst rooms in the vacation club. We are not time share owners we purchased room through a travel agent and there are definitely more private and more ocean view villas then the one we received which had no privacy and no view of the ocean as advertised. Fitness centerDon\u2019t pay attention to pics online. The gym feels more dated and bare then the online pics. In fact do n\u2019t trust any of the pics online. Also it is managed by the hotel poorly. Towels in the gym were all gone one day i visited front desk and called twice over 12 hr. It took 45 min of working out till an attendant showed up with towels. Every machine was taken in the gym due to rain outside and prime morning hours. It was unsanitary to have no towels to wipe sweat when sharing machines. Also they have two very old dirty mats for stretching or floor work. You often have to wait to use a mat. There is no attendant in the gym managing it at any hour. They should at least have an attendant on peak morning hours. It \u2019s a liability to the hotel even. They should have more and newer mats for stretching and floor work. Some weights are rusty too. PolsThis is the most disappointing part of the property. The chairs and the pools are very old and dated probably to the original in 190. After the first day at the main pool we never went back and stayed at the South Pool in front of the vacation club units because it was the only real clean pool. The main pool was old crowded and often dirty. The pool and beach chairs are so old and need to be replaced. Restaurants Only one option for breakfast and lunch and dinner on the property. For this size of resort to not have more than one restaurant open per meal is unacceptable at a 4 star hotel rating. They have a pizza shack opened all day and night but it \u2019s a take out walk up counter so i do n\u2019t count it as a dining option. Plus my son who loves pizza said it was the worst pizza. Coffee Dessert Bar This must be a recent addition renovation. Newest part of the lobby. It feels more modern and is very well run. The staff is nice efficient and it \u2019s clean and the coffee is excellent. They also have pastries desserts and midday snacks. Calypso Breakfast only. Just ok. Service was beyond slow. The buffet was not replenished well no fruit on the buffet when i went. The omelet station had one person working and a line of 8 people. Again this hotel does not care about its dining. It took forever for cooked items off the menu to come out and no attention from the waitress to refill waters. We only went once as a result. Pool Beach Lunch only we ate here three times and ordered the same items. The delivery presentation and quality were different all three times. The later you go the more crowded it gets and the food quality and service go down. Our worst experience is when we got there to eat at 1 not 12. There is another closed restaurant sitting empty right next to the pool. Again for this size property there should be a separate indoor option for lunch to escape the heat. Either calypso in the hotel lobby or the closed empty furnished restaurant next to the pool restaurant. NOTE. go to lunch at sweet savory across the street. Delicious healthy options and AC also a great dessert place. they are wonderful and food was healthier. BeachIt \u2019s very important to note that this resort is on the Atlantic Ocean side. The waters can be much rougher full of seaweed and windy when the weather is n\u2019t smooth. We were only able to go to the Mariot beach on one full day because it was too windy and rough the other days. This is not the Mariot fault of course but be aware the Caribbean beaches on a windy day will be much better. Check out carambola beach club. The Mariot does have a beautiful beach and nice shaded huts spread out all along the beach which is really nice. But many of the huts are set far back from the ocean water unles you are lucky to get one near the vacation club side closer to the water. The beach is great weather permitting but chairs are old again and huts are rusty. Also there is no bar service on the beach. Tennis CourtsDon\u2019t even bother bringing a tennis racquet. They had 4 courts there are only two that you could potentially try to use. They were apparently destroyed in a hurricane 3 yrs ago and never fixed. They are locked and take 45 min to get someone to open them when you get on them you ca n\u2019t even play. I think they are grass. If you are a real tennis player you will not want to play on these. I will attach pictures. The vacation club Mgr complimentary shuttled us to municipal courts 20 min away. These were playable and better but not great or worth going back to play. The property Mariot does a great job on the vacation club side offering activities as a group or individually mimosa mornings cheese wine etc. They have shuffle boards corn hole chess checkers all out on the lawn for families to play. The main hotel offered a couple of things at night like karaoke bonfire on the beach and movie night. Many people were here in large groups and brought wireless speakers and played music in common areas. When walking around the property and lobby you will notice chipping of paint windows not clean rusty roofing. Also there is a high wall blocking the property from the beach so you really can not see the beach at ground level unles you walk onto it or look over the wall at the edge of the property. GolfGreat course and discounted for Mariot vacation club. We played this course twice. They shuttle you five minutes to the course from the hotel they will store your clubs or give you rental clubs. Six or seven of the holes are on the Atlantic Ocean and beautiful. The course is in very good conditionBotom LineThis property was built in 190 and it shows. It needs property improvements and it needs to invest in the dining to keep people at the resort. We spent a day at Carambola Beach resort Where we saw other Mariot families and spent one of our best days on the island. If you are laid back and do n\u2019t mind the resort being dated you can have a great time because the people are wonderful. Our 2 bedroom room was very clean and spacious for a family of five. Keep in mind it is not a luxurious high end four star resort but the people at the vacation club and on st Kits island are amazing people. Friendly educated and speak perfect English. We went to some amazing restaurants on the island too. Final note my daughter turned 12 at the resort and the vacation club team had a large cake and balloons card and tshirt for her in our room. We are always away on school break for her birthday and this place did the best job of making it special for her. Thank you vacation club. I hope the Mariot invests in property improvements. Note. i tried to post all my pics but trip advisor limited me to 5.", "offset": [7815, 7955], "date": "2020-02-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}]}
