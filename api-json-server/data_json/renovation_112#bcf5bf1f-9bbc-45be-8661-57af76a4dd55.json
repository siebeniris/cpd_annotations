We stayed a few nights at this property in October 2016 while attending a conference. The hotel had been freshened since our last visit which was nice to see. However the freshening did not add much punch this remains a very large and very bland convention property with uninspiring decor and generic furnishings in the guest rooms. But everything was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Wifi was free since I am a Mariot Rewards elite member and was functional and reasonably fast. The hotels gym is probably the nicest hotel gym I have seen it is huge clean and has tons of weight and cardio equipment plus studios for yoga etc. Gorgeous and I got in some superb workouts. that is a real plus for this property and was great to see. The hotels lounge for Mariot Rewards elite members was on a lower floor I would prefer that it be on a high floor and a bit cozier. That said the amenities offered in the lounge were very nice a full spread for breakfast with a very nice selection of hot and cold items and a similarly well stocked evening spread that could be a substitute for dinner. Food was refreshed on a regular basis and staff were very helpful in the lounge. Overall the hotel does a nice job with this offering. Service at the front desk was the opposite. our service at check in bordered on incompetent and our service at check out while efficient was hardly polite. This hotel could really stand to work on its arrival and departure experiences. Location is great you are in the Union Square area which is full of shopping restaurants museums etc and you are also close to both BART and MUNY that can take you to other parts or the city andor region.

I have stayed at the Marquis 30 times over the last 5 years. The location is close enough to pretty much anywhere in downtown to be able to walk. The customer service has also been exceptional. They also get a plus for having a wired internet connection in the room. I know most people do not care but I travel with a portable wireless bridge and it makes it way more convenient to plug that in and register once rather than having to register each device. It also makes it possible to use my own chromecast in the room. Their internet both wired and wireless is great. I do not recall specifically but I want to say I was getting 50mbps. I am going to omit the Value rating as the price for this hotel varies widely. Over my 30 stays I think I have paid as little as 19 night and as high as 650 night. At 19 night this hotel is a great value at 649 not so much. This would be a 5star but there are a couple areas for improvement. They are currently undergoing a remodel of their lobby. I understand a hotel has to do this and to be fair it is not that big of an inconvenience being that they have moved the front desk to the 2nd floor. My biggest issue is they have the back door of the hotel closed. This was always a convenient entrance exit. It sounds like the remodel will be done in the next 3 months though. I tend to like it a bit cooler I found the temperature in my room to be a bit warm. Their cooling system is built on some kind of water based system and just does not work well IMO. They were able to fix this by having a fan sent to my room. The rooms are getting a bit dated. It would be nice if they updated the showers to have a walk in style rather than the goofy tub setup. In the concierge lounge they have this really cool wine distribution machine. You swipe your room card and it dispenses wine. Awesome. However a serving of wine seemed kind of stingy and was still like 8. Their wine glasses are oversized and even 2 servings pours from the wine machine did not fill the glass 12 way. 16 for half a glass of wine. I am not impressed. The worst part of my stay was the bed.

This is my second time staying at the Mariot Marquis SF. I visited in 2016 and again in 2019. The rooms lobby and hotel have been renovated. The rooms are comfortable stylish very nice. The beds are extremely comfortable. Staff customer. service is excellent. The hotel is located in the financial district close to everything restaurants shopping Trader Joe \u2019s Target movie theatre etc. My daughter and I had a wonderful time at the Mariot Marquis and SF. I would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel to others.", "offset": [114, 160], "date": "2019-08-31", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}]}
