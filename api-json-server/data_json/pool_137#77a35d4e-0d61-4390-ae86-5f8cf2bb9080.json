It has a Living area A Sitting Area A Bar Coffee Area and the Bathroom offered both a Private Toilet as well as a Large Stall Shower and Jacuzi Tub that could dit two adults the cool part was that the tub had a sliding glass wall into the Living Room. It had a Large Double Sink with all the Shampoo you needed. I was alitle surprised that we did not receive turn down service as this is a usual feature with Suites Even The Beau Rivage gives you that in a standard Room and before you question we did not have the do not disturb sign on.
