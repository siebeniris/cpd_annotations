The room was basic but it did us just fine. We made very good use of the clothesline kindly provided in the bathroom. The fridge was also put to good use. There was ample enough storage also. The bathroom was excellent nicely decorated with lots of shelf space to put your bits and pieces on. It always surprises me when holiday accommodation over look shelf space. But not here in the Memo Baleira. Cleaning staff were excellent also always leaving the room spotless and perfect whenever we wanted it serviced. Friendly too whenever you passed them in the corridor. The pool area is fantastic one of the highlights. Getting to it early helps with nabbing a parasol and sun bed but people always seem to be coming and going to so if you wait a bit you will probably get a sun bed by the pool throughout the day. The view from the pool also gets a special mention. I do not think I would ever get bored of that view the harbour the sea and the blue blue sky. Wonderful And the little public beach at the bottom of the cliff which you can get to from the hotel grounds via a steep set up steps is also worth checking out. Not many people staying at the hotel seemed to though as it was always relatively empty. Probably due to the steps taking some getting used to they are a tad difficult so not for the meek. Next the breakfasts wow really impressive. And a great range on offer so you do not get bored of the food by the end of you stay. It got very busy after 9 am so may be worth getting there early. There are a few downsides mainly in the bar where the food is overpriced for what your get. I got a cous cous salad one lunchtime and I have to say I can make a much nicer one at home myself. This one was just bland boring and tasteless. Our second and last lunch was by the pool. Our advice is go somewhere else for lunch. The other downside was the bar staff. We were more or less ignored one evening when we went in for some cocktails. We left cocktail less. Baffling behaviour. But as I said the poor food and bad service seemed to be confined to the bar. Overall a lovely stay here at Memo Baleira and a recommended hotel in the Sagres area.", "offset": [1647, 1746], "date": "2015-12-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "6b7fd013-4af5-4d64-b68a-f96b3f4f92f9", "sentence": "A bit below its 4 star level design hotel. Location is not bad it is right above the small port of Baleira where there is a small beach for swim accessible through some stairs. There is an common open indoor space for lunch diner bar and another room accessible only for breakfast. There is also a space reserved for TV and seating but the problem is that most of those spaces are not separate therefore one can not sit in a quiet corner bar and have a drink since there always a lot of kids there are a lot of young couples and noise from the restaurant. The rooms are quiet spacious they have a small balcony where hardly 2 small chairs fit. The orientation of the hotel is NE therefore there is not much sun. Bathrooms are good and have a bath tab. Bed linen is very good the beds a bit soft for me. There is a rather small fitness room with ocean views. There is a good choice for breakfast except for the coffee which is undrinkable. The pool is nice apparently there is no pool bar. Several bars and restaurants are at a walking distance beaches as well. Praia Mareta with a restaurant. Praia Martinhal much bigger 2 restaurants. If you feel like walking at the eastern end of the latter beach starts a wonderful trail with stunning views. The first beach you see on your way is a gem the only one with huge white pebbles and almost turquoise water great for swimming and I was all alone. Nearby the hotel worth visiting is Cabo Sao Vicente and the Fortaleza. At about 15 km is Carapateira where you can join the famous Rota Vicentina not to be missed. Overall I enjoyed the hotel but to my opinion it lacks spaces with more intimacy and quiet as awel as a protected open space to sit outdoors.

Although the hotel really does feel like a boutique hotel despite of its size with its minimalist approach and gorgeous views I want to share some suggestions or disappointments we experienced. Plus points RomsBoth suites and double rooms are spacious and we had beautiful views of the water. The beds in the rooms are heavenly. Just like home really. Pillows are lumpy thoughPlenty of towels clean and spacious bathroom. BreakfastThis was probably the biggest minus and more like a three star hotel. You can not order a special coffee drink the bread is plain horrible which is odd because the restaurant upstairs offers really yummy decent bread at breakfast the offer of food does not vary. Basically beside a good and decent offer of fruit and fresh orange juice I barely at anything else. The eggs were runny only scrambled everything else fried and greasy. When we came to breakfast we were told we can not sit together as a family unles we ate around the corner in the dark windowles space. The lady coordinating the table seating at breakfast was trying to have families with children sit in the dark part of the restaurant. We were told we can not move the tables together to sit as a whole family even though the day before the staff moved them together to acomodate us. The lady seating us was resolute and so we sat at separate tables until she changed her mind and allowed us to move them together afteral. This upset my edlerly mother who felt embarrassed by being reprimanded by the staff in front of other guests. RestaurantThe restaurant is just okay. They really ought to offer a greater variety of food. The Pizza was yummy as was the Octopus Risotto but everything else was pretty bad. The Hamburgers were dried up meat and my children did not touch them. There are MANY AMAZING restaurants that are MUCH MUCH better and offer fresh seafood I would try to avoid the pricey restaurant. Ice Cream scoops are 250 Euro even for kids. It would be nice if they offered kids with scoops for less. ReceptionWe stayed at the hotel with a big party several rooms and spent a sizeable amount of money there during our one week stay. Nevertheless the hotel made me transfer five Euros to their account for them to send back something I left in the safe. I just feel like that is really a turn off and possibly will keep me from returning. We had such a huge bar tab. Really. Five EurosBeach TowelsAlthough they kindly give you beach towels one of the receptionists rolled her eyes when my mother asked for another two for her and my father. Then when my mother wanted to return her sandy towel at the end of the day she was told to keep it for the next day so they did not have to wash it. SpaI had an incredible thirty minute massage for a fair price of 30 Euro. Pool BarYumy drinks lovely service. All in all I found inconsistency in the staff mainly with sometimes snipy receptionists it is a four star hotel attitude and eye rolling is a big no no. Upon departure I asked for a bottle of water and she said I had to go to the bar and pay for it. Just the day prior they handed a departing party two mini bottles of water. My parents were also given water on departure. Not sure how I feel about the place. Mixed review. Staff needs a talking to about attitude and generosity water. making me pay for that kind of postage after spending nearly four thousand euros at your hotel. realyBeach needs to be driven to. The one in front of hotel is close to fish harbor and a dog beach. This is not clear from the website. You definitely need a rental car and do not think you can just walk outside to a sandy beach. You need to drive park and walk down glorious once you get there. but not as it looks online.", "offset": [3021, 3117], "date": "2016-07-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "d2cad5fc-0d57-432f-b332-f3f53a9ae4d7", "sentence": "Perfect family holiday.

We had a few issues with a faulty safe and the air conditioning unit failing but both were fixed within an hour or so so absolutely no worries. The breakfasts were great an exceptional choice for even the fussiest of eaters our daughter. and we ate dinner in the hotel one night which was superb. The pool area was fantastic and we never had a problem getting seating. The only recommendation would be that you could serve snacks. maybe just salads or sandwiches at the pool bar. This would have been better for our family with a young child. A final note was the play room. This is a brilliant idea and was perfect to keep our daughter entertained and out of the mid day sun.

This stylish modern hotel fits sympathetically within the beautiful South Western Algarve peninsula in attractive landscaped gardens overlooking the harbour at Sagres.

Liked the clean airy feel of the room and the small balcony overlooking the pool area. Room features include effective air conditioning TV power points by the bed great for phone charging room safe fridge over bath shower and bidet. Twin beds feature quality mattresses a little soft for our liking but with the offer to change for a firmer option. Housekeeping was meticulous with prompt and non intrusive daily cleaning. Fittings starting show their age a bit but overall very happy with the room and particularly enjoyed watching the sun rise through the panoramic windows in the morning. The long hard surfaced through route corridors can be noisy at night with inconsiderate guests. The sea view breakfast room with its panoramic patio doors and contemporary d\u00e9cor is a delight as the morning sunshine streams in. There is a wide variety of buffet breakfast options including traditional cooked and continental menu and whilst the room does get crowded during peak times the buffet is promptly refreshed and navigating around fellow guests in my view added to the appeal. The breakfast coffee is to be avoided. The staff from my experience are typically Portuguese reserved but very friendly and extremely obliging. The wooden decked pool area with around 50 sunbeds is a great sun trap and the pool is well maintained and clean.
