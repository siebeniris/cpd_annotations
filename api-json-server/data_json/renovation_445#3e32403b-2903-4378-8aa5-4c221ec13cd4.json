Let me preface this by stating that I do not have many reviews because I am generally an easy going person. Also the room rate I received was a SPG family member. So much for taking care of family. The hotel itself is very good. ProsIt is in a convenient airport location They are updating. It appears cleanBut they had some major consThe construction is not complete and potentially dangerous. There was a pipe cover on the floor upon walking in to the room. The housekeeping staff actually walked in the room with me as he was dropping off a trundle bed. He just shrugged and said oh. He did not pick it up or offer maintenance. This is not a deal breaker as the room is otherwise clean but that is one star off. The hot and cold water is backwards at the sink. When I brought this up to the front desk they did offer to have maintenance come up but we checked in late and my son was already asleep. They offered no warm apologies or comps or anything at all. The hotel should count their blessings that someone without integrity has not stayed in that room and sued for that safety concern. I can attach a video proving this if needed. Another star off. Popcorn ceiling is different colors. Usually for me this is not a deal breaker as long as it does not look dangerous. But with all the other maintenance problems it makes me worry why it is discolored. 12 star off. The staff is without any notion of friendliness or initiative. They were not overtly rude but they definitely were NOT amiable. This should be 12 stars off. I am very disappointed. So much so that I am not going to finish my weekend long reservation and will leave as soon as the kids wake up. I can not recommend this hotel.

I have a grocery list of items that we disappointing on this trip. first the hotel has done away with their breakfast buffet. I had planned to pay for two adults to have the breakfast buffet for 3 consecutive days but without the buffet. I took our breakfast expenditure money elsewhere. I think they will lose a lot of restaurant s especially from the business traveler with this move. The room upgrades are not good for several reasons. the luggage racks that used to be available in the closets were not there luggage took over the wall unit scratching it over time no doubt and leaving nowhere to put anything else except on the floor which is poor planning by my estimation. The beds being on platforms are nasty for anyone who is either short in stature or physically challenged. You need foot stools to get into them. The work area and ergonomic chairs have been replaced with oval tables which are too high for a computer desk and artsy fartsy lounge chairs that are way too low to function as a computer chair. This will totally kill the business traveler again. But I must say all new decor does not lend itself to a family vacation either. one of my rooms was 2 queen beds with the one artsy fartsy chair that supposedly sleeps 4 people. Where exactly are the other 3 supposed to sitI spent three nights with two rooms and as a result of my most recent stay have cancelled a 2 room 12 night stay that I had planned for September.

I stay here quite often. As a Platinum SPG member it is quick and convenient especially if I have an early morning flight. The lobby and club room renovations are gorgeous. The room renovations were mostly carpets wall coverings furniture. Unfortunately they did not increase the size of the bathrooms. I am guessing their postage stamp size is from the 60s and had I had the chance I would have definitely doubled their size at least in the suites. But they were not touched. I am guessing due to cost. So they have been painted and upgraded but they are still small. VERY small. I used to enjoy the food and beverage presentation on the Club Floor which included cocktails. Now it is beer wine only and the food is well at best minimal. Consistently it is one hot item this last visit was egg rolls a cheese tray and a cold vegetable dish like cucumber slices with a topping. that is it folks. do not get your expectations up in comparison to other Sheraton Club Floors or you might be a tad disappointed. Have low expectations and do not go in there hungry. do not expect anything similar to Seattle or Los Angeles or San Diego because it is not the same. But the room itself is very pretty.
