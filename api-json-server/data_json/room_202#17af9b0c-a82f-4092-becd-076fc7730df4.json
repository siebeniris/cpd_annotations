We drove down to San Francisco in my pick up truck. We paid about 65 a night for oversized vehicle parking. Think about that. For the cost of most Super 8s outside the city per night we were allowed to park out truck. That was not cool. Then they checked my family into room 301. 301 has the distinction of being right next to the elevators AND directly overlooking the swimming pool and the street beyond. You better believe it was noisy and neither my wife or my 6 month old appreciated it very much. And as other reviewers have noted the pillows suck. And our card keys stopped working almost immediately which sucked because not only do you need them to get into your room but you ALSO need them to work the elevator to get TO your room. As a security measure this is a joke because in a busy hotel like this you only need one guest with a working key to operate the elevator while a group of escaped lunatics can simply get in the elevator with them and go wherever they want. What it really does is simply inconvenience the paying guests who have their arms full of shopping bags have children with them or whose key cards simply stop working. And as other reviewers have noted the bathroom is about the size of a box of tic tacs. If you are in town and these things do not matter to you heres the positive about the property. The location is perfect for hitting the fantastic restaurants and tourist shops in the area. there is a Ross and a Safeway really close in case you need to pick up some last minute food for the room or a missing clothing item. The staff is helpful and friendly 95 of the time and a little extra training would probably close the gap in that last 5This property will do if you really lower your expectations.

In terms of d\u00e9cor and style the room was under the expectations for a Sheraton. Breakfast and parking are overpriced. Finally we had a big issue with the person attending room service calls just to get a laundry bag and form to have a pair of pants cleaned.

The Sheraton Fisherman \u2019s Wharf is a large therefore impersonal hotel that is under refurbishment. We stayed in a refurbished King room. The check in process was seamless and friendly.

The room was fine save for the following No kettle in the room but provided on request. The cups for a hot drink were paper cups from Starbucks one each per dayThe windows did not open to allow fresh air in. The window blinds were not part of the refurbishment as they were filthy. There was nothing under them and as we were opposite another hotel we could look into each other \u2019s rooms clearly both day and night. No hot water in the shower or bath. The best was lukewarm but there was hot water in the hand basin so this a choice of the hotel. The walls were wallpapered and had enough air pockets in them to frighten a jumbo jet pilot. The air conditioner was as loud as a jumbo jet engine thus unusable. We stayed four nights and the shampoo was not replaced. The pillows were so frail that by morning they offered no support at all.
