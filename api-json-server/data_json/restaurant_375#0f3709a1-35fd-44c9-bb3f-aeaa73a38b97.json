I just stayed at this hotel for 5 days for a conference. To save a little money and eat a little healthy I brought down food to have for some of my meals. Most of this needed to be refrigerated. So my only complaint about this hotel was the absence of a mini fridge and microwave. I feel like most any hotel has that nowadays. Luckily we had a cooler we could use and we filled some trash cans with ice too but I still lost about half of my food before I could eat it all. And I was able to use the cofemaker for hot water to make oatmeal which ended up working out. But I did think that was a big negative. Now that that is out of the way. Everything else was great. The room was clean initially and the staff did a great job daily with housekeeping. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Great shower. The lobby is very nice. I never met a staff member that was not friendly. The front desk was very accommodating in our request for a late check out. The gym is very nice. I did not eat at the restaurant but it always smelled good. The view from the room was great being able to see water traffic often. Access to waterside is right there which is nice to walk around will be better when the Waterside complex opens in Spring 2017 but the scenery can still certainly be enjoyed. The conference room I was in was nice. We were invited to a hospitality sweet kind of thing where the hotel was serving drinks and food. The drinks were made well and the food was excellent.

I do not do reviews often and I do not recall ever giving a bad review. it is not my style. But the operations of this property was so bad my eperience so bad. that now upon returning home here I am. The property is undergoing a renovation the scope of which is not accurately displayed on its website. The site used to mention that the club level lounge was under construction until April 2017 checked website on May 20 2017. It today shows nothing as if the property is in regular working order. In fact the front desk is non operative they are working off of three computers in the little sundry store the hotel restaurant is in a meeting room with a bar that is long enough for two barstols and has so few tables that breakfast was a 45 minute wait and the club level lounge is still not open more on this later. This is a pet friendly hotel which is nice. We travel with our dog so we booked via a third party bringfidocom owned by expedia. one night on the club level for a room noting that we had be bringing a dog. Then it went downhil1. You should know if you book at this hotel that if you are bringing a pet you do not be up on the club level even if you have already paid for it. The club level is on the propertys 10th and highest floor. you will be on the third or fourth floor do not expect a view of the water. I wish that website would have been clear about that but it is not 2. Apparently my reservation did not get into the Sheraton system noting that I had have a dog. Upon my arrival at 40 propertys check in time I was informed my room was not ready. Just come back in 30 minutes I am told. So the family and dog hang out with our bags in the hallway that now substitutes as the lobby since the front desk got moved. Nothing more fun than waiting in a hallway with an impatient child and hyper dog for half an hour for a room that is not available after posted check in time3. I get back in the longish line a half hour later. When I get to the desk I mention. did you get the note about me having a dog. Oh no we did not. Now we do not have any rooms on the pet level ready. We. did finally clear up a room on the club level though. but that is not for you even though you booked and prepaid for that. Wait a while longer4. Another nearly half hour later we get a room for a room on the pet floor. it is a pretty standard room as far as rooms go. We ask the front desk hey so we paid 100 more for a room on the club level. You just now mention that there is no club level lounge because it is still under renovation even though your website says that it will be done in April. it is the end of May what gives. The reply was that they had have people shuttle snacks and drinks up to our room in lieu of the snacks and drinks in the club lounge being available 247. Here are your coupons for breakfast buffet in our restaurant in lieu of breakfast in the cub lounge5. A couple of hours go by and no snacks. did not know what was going on. I call the operator who confidently assures me that they will surely bring snacks and drinks up to the room. Of course they never come. We go out to dinner come back at 10 still nothing. By then it is the kids bedtime so we completely give up6. We wake having paid for an overnight at the club level having had none of the benefits. Okay let us head on down to the restaurant to have breakfast before heading out. Upon arriving there are people lounging around outside waiting and you know it is bad news. The line represents a small meeting room converted to a restaurant and which can not come close to accommodating demand. At the 55 minute wait point for a htel breakfast we give up. The Sheraton Norfolk Waterside wins no mas. We go upstairs and pack. Try to check out via the system on the TV system of course it is not working. One last final kick on the way out of the hotel. I ended up pre paying for a night in at the club level and got zero out of the upcharge. The property failed at every juncture. Again search my reviews and you will see that I am not a complainer. This property is that bad. Up the street are a fine looking Hilton and Mariot.

We asked what they were apologizing for and were told that they could tell something was wrong. No offer to find out what the problem was or how they could fix it. Note to staff saying your sorry is not the fix. The room was pretty standard. Nice bedding. No refrigerator. One of the picture frames on the wall was broken.
