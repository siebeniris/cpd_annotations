The ac in the general areas seem off or not strong enough so hot. Once on the 5th the staff person at the desk was not very friendly did not tell me about the hotels amenities and did not move me along the process well enough so I just sat there and had to ask how much longer to which she responded you are all set I was so upset and asked her why she did not let me know I was all set until I asked wasted time. The room was fantastic I paid for an upgrade to be on the ocean side and it was worth it. The room was so clean and really modern very quiet. I went to the spa got several services they fit me right in and the technicians were great. I ate at the restaurant closest to the pool it was meh for the price not worth it. I would recommend the restaurants outside of the hotel walking distance Muele 47 was so amazing best seafood ever great service worth the price.
