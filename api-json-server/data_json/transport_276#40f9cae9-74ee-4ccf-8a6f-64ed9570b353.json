I arrived at 1 pm and asked about checking in early and was told king bed rooms were not available but the front desk would call me when one became available. That was ok because I needed lunch so ate a good salad at Champions in the hotel. At 315 I went back to the desk and saw some parties checking in was a little surprised I did not get a call but assumed they were too busy. I was given a room on the 5th floor. The view was of the roof and the HVAC system so I returned to the front desk and said I would be willing to wait a couple of hours for a better view. Kindly Alysia gave me a corner room on the 20th floor which was extremely clean and spacious. The bedding was excellent. My complaints about the room and the hotel are that there is no mini fridge and they charge for wi fi although I was able to get complementary access because I had made reservations directly with the hotel. Granted they want to encourage in hotel dining but given minimal dining options in the area they are not losing restaurant customers by providing fridges and I would have purchased more from their food market. I used the pool area the fitness center the conference rooms common area restrooms and everything was very clean. With the hotel at max occupancy did not have any issue with the speed of the 6 elevators. Anyone who is surprised this hotel is not on the beach has not done the homework to look at the map. The waterside location is excellent for sitting on the lovely patio and watching boats or for walking up down the river walk. A 15 min walk to see the architecture of the 1891 Henry Plant hotel University of Tampa was a highlight. The breakfast buffet was priced too high 24 but there essentially no alternatives in the immediate area.", "offset": [1510, 1635], "date": "2015-01-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3983f40f-4aa3-4c6a-8e75-66a23750d34a", "sentence": "A Great Mariot in Central Tampa.

It had great views of downtown and the channel. The location was great to jump on the highway or catch a game at Amalie Arena it is almost right next door. The front desk staff were awesome very friendly and informative. The bar staff were good as well. There is no self parking at all in this hotel they do have valet for 25 per day. There is a nice little outside bar across the street on the water. I would suggest getting a drink there instead of the lobby bar if it is nice out. The lobby bar is very expensive.

As usual comfy mariot beds. With the music coming from the Sail bar across the street it was like a party in our room every evening. 2. all staff were very friendly. Patricia the bartender was great try the grilled pineapple mojito. Carl in the Concierge lounge was very attentive. Check in out was smooth and no wait. The valets and bellmen were friendly and gave good restaurant recommendations check out miguels for Mexican. 3 had a great massage in the spa and prices are reasonable for a hotel. The spa has shower facilities and a sauna for use post treatments. Also cool hand salts to try 4 pool area is nice and large with always enough chairs. 5 you can walk along waterside on paved paths and the trolley is across the street if you do not want to drive to places like Ybor City. 6 location is near some attractions like Florida Aquarium and a history center. Get a map from concierge desk and it includes coupons for these attractions. Aquarium is not huge but nice. Also they have easy directions to get to nearby beaches like Clearwater Beach and gave us a tip to get there early to stake out a spot. while we did not exactly follow the tip since we did not want to get up too early they were rightCons. 1. every time I tried to call valet to request my car nobody answered. Ended up not being a huge deal as they brought it quickly downstairs but kind of defeats the purpose of saying you can call and have the car be ready when you are ready to go. 2. the pool water was freezing 3.

The positives are proximity to the conference center the view and the pool area which is lovely and comfortable. But as for the rest I was highly unimpressed. I have stayed in conference hotels all over this country and have traveled in the US and abroad for pleasure so I have a wide range of hotels to compare this one to. First of all people at the front desk were often curt and unfriendly. Second the rooms are very small and the beds uncomfortable. There is no microwave and the mini fridge was hidden behind a false set of drawers on the right side of the dresser so we did n\u2019t even discover it for two days. Coffee maker is provided but only two cups were ever left and two coffees. If we wanted a cup later when we came back to our room we had to hunt someone down to ask for it. Creamer was powdered. Even lower cost hotels generally use real creamers these days. It all seemed so chintzy for a hotel that is supposed to offer some level of luxury. Third in the lobby there were two nice containers of cold water infused with fruit every morning. But when we came in from evening events at about 90 pm it was HOT and we were thirsty. the water was already taken down. I guess that is to encourage you to buy the 40 bottles of Fiji water in the room. The Starbucks in the hotel is far more expensive than the one directly across the street at the Embassy Suites 275 for a cup of coffee vs 195. so we took the one minute walk. The service in the restaurant is S L O W And when we asked about our food rather than apologizing the waitress told us we should expect to wait because we were a large party. We were but we were also the only people in the restaurant. Food was good but we were late to our event. Never once were our glasses refilled. Fourth this is a huge more than 25 story hotel across the street from the conference center and there were far too few elevators. Every morning was a long wait to get downstairs and there was no continuous stairway to provide an alternative. Fifth the parking. There is mandatory valet parking. The cost is exorbitant. But the worst is that when this huge group of people is ready to depart as the conference ends there is pandemonium because the little driveway is where everyone must claim their car and load up. There seems to be room for 12 to 15 cars at most at one time all crowded into a small area filled with people luggage carts strollers etc. It took us more than 30 minutes to get our car and get it loaded. And finally when I checked my credit card it appeared we were overcharged. When I called I was told that a charge of 500 per night was applied in case of any incidentals. That extra money would be refunded in a week. A week. Why. Most conference hotels seem to bend over backwards to be helpful and accommodating. That was not our experience at the Mariot.", "offset": [56, 168], "date": "2015-07-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "92f762a7-f467-469f-acf2-8c73f616a7ec", "sentence": "I stayed at this location for a convention over the weekend and had a terrible experience. I am completely turned off from the Mariot brand. In 24 hours the issues listed took place and they want to give me 5k points which is unbelievable. I have tried following up with this location for two days and have even tried calling the general Mariot line but even they can not get someone to pick up the phone 1. Once my room was finally ready after waiting 4 hours I open the room to a dirty bed with messed up sheets that looked like they were slept in 2. Ask for new bedding and once complete their is a gigantic happy stain on top so again I ask for more bedding and house keeping proceeds to put a duvet cover over it right in front of me 3. I go into the bathroom and dirty towels from the previous guest are still hanging on the back of the door and laying of the floor in additional to a garbage can full of trash and no toilet paper so again I call downstairs 4. I turn up the air and head to my first conference session. I return to my room 3 hours later and my room is still well above 70 degrees even though the thermostat says 65. I call a repair guy to come fix the room who tried to assure me that it was 65 degrees as I stand sweating in the room. Once I convince him to increase the airflow the room finally cooled down. 5. Fast forward a few hours. I go to use the restroom in the middle of the night and of course the toilet does not flush at all. I call the front desk AGAIN and ask someone to come fix the toilet. Someone comes up and does something but I assure you fixing the toilet was not it. Again I try to use the restroom and again the toilet does not flush. I call the front desk AGAIN and this time a handy man comes and changes a part and leaves. Now the toilet is flushing over and over again on its own. AGAIN I call the front desk. So now someone comes to fix the toilet successfully at 7 am. I assume in the process the floor was flooded because after he left and I went to take a shower for my 8 am conference session I noticed every single towel in the room was gone so AGAIN I call the front desk. At this point I ask to move to a new room. All of this I mind you took place from 4pm7am. Thanks for a terrible time and terrible service. I am very unhappy and unles someone addresses these issues I will make sure anytime I my family or institution books else where we avoid all chains related to the Mariot.

Get a Balcony w Water View. Great room. 24th floor w balcony facing the water. Gorgeous view. I wanted a balcony partly because I could then be sure of getting some fresh air. Otherwise the windows in other rooms do not open even a crack big mistake I think in modern hotels since you can only get canned air. Particularly since many like this hotel do not have a Fan only setting to draw in outside air the fan is always connected to either heat or air conditioning. it is October it is beautiful the days are hot but the mornings afternoons and evenings are delightful.

I took advantage of the special. 2 30 minute treatments for 100 at the end of a conference I was atendingThere was a problem when I checked in but it was resolved during check in. I had booked months ahead and earlier in the day I checked in with the Mariot mobile ap then called to make sure I had the room I had requested high floor balcony facing the water King bed. They confirmed and gave me the room number on the 18th floor. But when I arrived they gave me 9th floor. I did not think that much about it but wondered what had happened. In the discussion when they gave some story about the people in the room deciding to stay longer sounds odd it is a huge hotel they chose my room to stay longer and after check out and the hotel did not move THEM. it turned out Mariot was giving me a room without a balcony saying they were full and could not give me what I had booked. It took 20 minutes and me insisting on a balcony room before they finally came up with the room that I had ordered and Mariot had confirmed several times. While it is great Mariot finally honored their own commitment I should not have had to get pushy and insist. What about other people who are not so pushy. Does Mariot just hope they will just take the changeAnd if I had not asked about the balcony I would have gotten to the room on the 9th floor only to find out it was not the kind of room I had ordered again that is not a reputable way to operate. Tell me before I go up to the room unles you are trying to hide something like no balcony. Did you think I would not notice. Or is it easier to say too bad over the phone if someone calls to complainWhile we are talking about checking in there is a lighted sign at the edge of the check in desk that says mobile users who have checked in pick up your key here. I bypassed the longer line to stand by the sign. I was ignored until I finally asked a desk clerk and she said oh that does not work we do not do that here. Fine so why leave the sign there. And be a little proactive about what is happening in front of you if you are a professional service personAnyway the annoyances at checking in were more than surpassed by the room view pool spa and otherwise great staff. The food is good too. Of course it is pricey. where do you think you areIf you are a Mariot Rewards member sign up when you make the reservation. you will get free basic wifi in the room 12 per day and 2 small bottles of water per day. it is worth it. particularly if you use a separate email address for these kinds of thingsThe hotel is in an ok location lots of walking along the waterway from the hotel the convenience market is just across the waterway about a 10 minute walk the historic street car to Ybor City is in front of the hotel apparently this used to be a factory and docks area so there is much new development and no real neighborhood around. although there are several new condos on the other side of the waterwayThe city bike share stand is right in front of the hotel.

Pre concert stay to see a famous Beatle so hotel was booked out and rooms were at a premium. When we arrived we were very pleasantly surprised with an unexpected upgrade. We received a suite room on a high floor overlooking the channel and could not have been happier. Just the two of us in this huge suite with two separate balconies and great views. The lobby is clean huge welcoming and fantastic. Walk out the back to the channel and there is a jogging biking walking trail right behind the hotel. This concrete path goes from the hotel to various points take a right and walk along the channel past the Tampa Convention Center and beyond and I bet you will see the local pirate ship. Take a left and walk past Amalie Arena the Aquarium and cruise ship port further on down if you like seeing big cruise ships. The location of this hotel is literally right across the street from the Amalie Arena and the Tampa Convention Center. The public trolley a real one on rails has a covered stop just outside the front door of the hotel as well take this trolley to Ybor City for nightlife or to just eat lunch dinner at the very famous Columbia Restaurant a landmark in the area since 1905 the oldest restaurant in the state. Spanish style as in Spain not Mexico. Get the 1905 salad if you are not afraid of garlic hand made at your table and get a sangria as well. Cool gift shop with cigars and Spanish pottery next door. Make reservations for this restaurant or you will never get inThe suite room we had at the Mariot was beautiful clean spacious and high up. Had a safe coffee maker sofa bed king bed table chairs on each of the balconies for morning coffee very lovely. If you time it just right you may even see a cruise ship enter or leave port across the way. Views you will either have a city view or channel water view. Request the channel view to see boats or a city view if you like to see the pretty lights at night. The outside pool area in this hotel in on the third floor rooftop. You can walk around the pool deck edges and see the Amalie Arena Convention Center or busy people below going to and fro while you relax with a drink. Pool is big and the whole pool area was recently refurbished and it is clean. there is a pool bar as well and you can order food from a limited menu at the pool get the famous Cuban sandwich. will not disapointFod at this hotel is not typical hotel food. it is really good but you are going to pay a high price for the convenience. Do the breakfast buffet or do like we did and order room service and enjoy it on your balcony to order breakfast hang a tag on your room door the night before with your selections and they will deliver it next morning at a time of your choosing. there is a small Starbucks on site as well. there is an American style restaurant in the lobby area typical fare but good a breakfast buffet dining room then there is more formal fare either inside or sit and eat chanelside on the patio restaurant in the back. there is a more formal dining room as well but not sure if it is open at all times or just special occasions. There are boat docks behind the hotel so theoretically you could navigate your boat right up the channel to the hotel and dock. Not sure how that works or how much you have to pay for the boat slip but it is an option. Ok enough about all the good points heres a few areas that may or may not need improvement depending on your point of view. the sofa couch in the suite looked 1970s style burnt orange color a bit worn and probably should be replaced. Some of the threshold floor tiles between rooms were cracked and needed replaced. The pool area is beautiful but they need to put out more umbrellas for shade. In the hot afternoon Florida sun you can burn almost instantly and they only had about 6 or 8 chairs under umbrellas and 4 or 5 clamshell chairs with limited cover. Not aceptable put out more shade umbrellas please. Parking tip if you like to self park there is a parking garage that charges daily just a block or so from front of the hotel right next to Amalie Arena. They have valet parking as well and the use the same garage for valet. There are uncovered lots as well nearby you can pay to use but why do that when you can use the garage. There is no on site parking here but the garage is literally a block away and easily walk able. Wi Fi tip join the Mariot Rewards program for free Wi Fi. Or you will pay. The Wi Fi was not anything to brag about and could have been faster just in my humble opinion. A word on Starbucks the Starbucks in the hotel is small and very limited and they close sometime in the mid afternoon. This is really not a full service Starbucks. If you want the full Starbucks experience there is an Embassy Suites hotel right across the trolley tracks from the Mariot very close and the Embassy Suites downstairs lobby has a full service Starbucks with food and it is open I believe all the time. Walk over there if you are picky about your Starbucks. it is accessible from the outside on the first floor of the Embassy Suites so you do not have to actually go into the lobby and it is very close to the parking garage as well. If your attending an Amalie Arena concert or Convention Center event here and the Mariot is booked out there is an Embassy Suites across the street. I have stayed there as well. it is not nearly as impressive as the Mariot and it is not on the walking jogging path and it is not on the channel. But if the Mariot is booked it is a good second option. hint Embassy Suites has an uncovered walking bridge from their second floor over to the Tampa Convention Center. But I had still prefer the Mariot no question. I hope my review helped the Mariot Tampa Waterside is a great rather upscale place to stay for families couples or business travelers.

My purse had my ID my credit cards my cash and my cell phones personal and work. I was completely stranded without it. The bell staff noticed my action of running outside and immediately asked if I needed help. The bell team Frank W Many G Andre S and Brian E then spent the next 15 hours trying to track down and contact the van driver to get him to return. It took A LOT of sleuthing because even though I had the van receipt and drivers name when they called the company they were told the driver was an independent contractor for airport pickups and without the actual van there was no way to know how to contact him. and the woman working for the shuttle company was very unconcerned and unhelpful. They then thought to look at hotel security camera tapes to see if they could ID the van. It took a lot of work but they were able to find one with the right van and right angle to get the van ID. From there they got a hold of the driver and he returned with my purse. During all the sleuthing and waiting time the bell team was so kind to me doing everything they could to troubleshoot solutions and keeping my spirits up. If it had not been for their genuine care and commitment I do not know what would have happened. They are exceptional people and bring class and true customer service to the Mariot.", "offset": [618, 880], "date": "2019-10-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "494bdcff-c8b2-415b-999e-50d70ad59e53", "sentence": "The room was average.
