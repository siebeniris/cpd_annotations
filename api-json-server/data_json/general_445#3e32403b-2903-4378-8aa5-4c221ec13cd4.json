I have stayed at surrounding hotels and I recall not having issues with them and was pleased with my stay. This business trip was pre arranged for me and thought it was a good opportunity to review it anyways. Let me start by saying the double bed room are literally doubles not accommodating for 2 adults on 1 bed. My family and i stayed 4 it was a bit cramped sleeping. Walking in and looking at the bathroom I immediately thought trouble because of my personal preference of comfort height toilets and The toilet was tiny and round but I said oh well. It will do. Then I brushed my teeth and the sink filled half way up gross. It 1030 pm and I was not calling the front desk to complain knowing nothing could be done and I was tired. So I took a shower the tub filled up with about 5 inches water immediately. GROSS. Other peoples water and what ever I am sure came back up just like I could see in the sink oh and some how the floor was all wet when I got out leak somewhere idk. Next morning I did speak to front desk they addressed the issue while I was gone water only filled up about 3 inches in the tub and I guess I forgot to tell them about the sink. Sink gross. Toilet gross do not even want to shower but I guess i have to. I asked others in my group if they had the same issue and apparently it is just my rom237. House keeping was good breakfast and restaurant were good too. Cleanliness was good. Bedding was good. Pillow were good. I could not find anything else really wrong with the room or hotel except the plumbing for my romBecause of this I am going to rate it an average I guess hotels do not really know when a Trip Advisor reviewer comes on the premises and get a room that is not up to par. May give this facility another chance another time. At the moment I am not completely sure. 3 nights stay standing in gross water or using the sink with gross water I will have to really think it over. I honestly think my room was poor but to be fair it seemed to be just plumbing. I could not have been the only one to complain so shame on the hotel for booking the room without addressing the issue first.

The hotel is sad and dated. I have n\u2019t given it much of a chance having arrived a short while ago so perhaps I \u2019m rushing to judgement. To get the shuttle you have to call the hotel after claiming baggage. It took about a half hour for the shuttle to arrive while standing in the outdoor waiting area.
