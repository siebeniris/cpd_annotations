I have just spent the best Christmas holiday of my life at the Four Seasons Costa Rica with my family there were six of us including my grandchildren ranging in age from 913and 16 and we all agreed that there was something for everybody the childrens club was outstanding and the pools and sea were fantastic I especially loved the overhanging trees at the beach for shade where we could spot the birds and monkeys and all needs were attended to by the excellent staff so friendly and nothing too much trouble some of the restaurants were good but others disappointing due to long waits for service I found the breakfast and polside Resturant the best apart from two beach buffet evening meals that were superb the rooms were excellent and cold water delivered to the room constantly all the trips out of the Hotel were amazing and well organized and a good way to see other areas of Costa Rica.

Several days ago I have written a review putting Peninsula Papagayo close to Hualalai on our preference list. Now at the end of our week long stay I have to unfortunately change my assessment of this property. We were first here in 201 and had a fantastic time. We stayed at a villa with private plunge pool overlooking the Monkey Head and took catamaran rides with new friends we had made at the hotel. The magic is not there anymore unfortunately. The staff is still extremely friendly and attentive but we were unpleasantly surprised by a drop in the food experience and the bad taste of being nickel and dimed. My husband and I have stayed at over half of the Four Seasons properties around the world. Things like having to pay 10 more if you want the buffet WITH eggs vs the buffet without eggs or being charged 7 for a scoop of ice cream by the pool which in all other properties we have seen this is free are just not classy not the FS style. In 201 the breakfast cooked by a fantastic Cordon Bleu graduate named Andres from Chile was amazing. It came very close to the Hualalai experience and had local flavor with small quesadilla and empanada bites. This time around the breakfast was quite disappointing basically featuring fruit cold cuts bakery items and some very heavy meat sauce based local options. Overall I would say that if the quality of the food would have been exceptional similar to a starred guide Michelin restaurant or a Relais and Chateaux rated resort the taste of this stay may not have been bitter but unfortunately it is nowhere close. The location is still beautiful so we recommend coming here. For those who have been to the Punta Mita location and have enjoyed Sufi in Papagayo after tasting the ceviches dine at Marea instead.", "offset": [322, 463], "date": "2015-02-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "ab5322e4-897a-4ea9-8634-6a0cb30259bd", "sentence": "Paradise.

I have read a number of the reviews and concur with many on both the positives and negatives for this property and the positives just absolutely overwhelm the negatives. We were in room 421 for a week starting on 228 so prime hot dry summer season in this part of CR. A view of the water through the woods very private. Our balcony was huge two couches a couple of chairs and a table. Spent a lot of time out there. Nicely shaded so it was not too hot with the slider open. Really neat setup to the room oddly similar to the Mandarin Oriental in Miami with the movable wall between the tub and the bedroom allowing the room to truly be opened up. We loved it. Great shower. My wife loved the LOcitane products especially the lotion. Read a few items to the contrary so will emphasize this point. Every single person employed on this property was pleasant and engaging. They all made every request seem like it was a pleasure. We spent the vast majority of our time at the pool walking around and by the beach. Our favorites were Playa Virador and the Quiet Pool. Lived there for 4 of our 7 days. Grab a snorkel mask and flippers from Playa Blanca also a really neat South African couple runs a surf shop there. my wife thought she was awesome and go back to the quiet side. Spa did not use it so can not comment. Reservations at restaurants confirm them after making them. 3 different experiences 2 for us 1 for a friend where they could not find our reservations but then later had 2 of them for us. Just odd. But the payoff once you get to the restaurants is excellent. Both Cena Social Italian and Sol Y Sombra are excellent. We ate a lot in both and never had a bad meal. Ceviche mahi mahi at Sol and rigatoni ragu salumi platter polpete di carni chicken milanese and definitely add the enhance your pasta shrimp at Cena. Snuck up to the Andaz and had a spectacular dinner at Ostra ceviche was best I have ever had. Food by the pool. awesome. They have a great menu but will also bring you anything you want just ask. 6 Pack of local brew Imperial in an ice bag polside is a must. Also there is a great new employee Alba who does the greatest little things. She walks around and cleans your sunglasses. She brings you little shots of chopped fruit. And best of all she brings you sorbets. Coconut is good but the mango is stupid. What a great touch. And she is the embodiment of Four Seasons. Takes 15 minutes to get to the property from the gate normally but it took us 35 because we kept stopping for the monkeys. Tons of capuchins and howlers. could not hear the howlers in our room but others said on the further out parts of the property that they were a wake up call. Heard them on the golf course it was like Jurassic Park. So cool and a little disconcerting the first time you hear the howl. Loudest mammal for sure. Lots of coatis too. Golf course is great. Wind was up one of my two rounds and was like coastal Scotland 2nd shot at 10 makes it a par 5 seriously like 50 mph winds straight up the fairway. The other day was perfectly calm. Made it a really neat way to play the same course a completely different way. Lots of adventure stuff nearby that you can coordinate through the concierge. We did the floating river it is whitewater in winter but there is not much water in summer so cat 2 is most you will get and zip line experience. did not want to drive the 2 hours to Rio Perdido. it is crazy expensive but we felt like it was still a great value and a truly memorable experience. can not recommend it enough.

We stayed only 5 days with my husband but we did not want to leave this amazing place. We stayed in a suite with our private pool and the view was simply Breathless. I have never been in a place like this and do not know if i will again but i can tell you that we enjoyed our stay very much. We have all our breakfeast in the room and enjoyed the view from the morning. Some comments said that the service was long and maybe it is true but frankly when there is so much rooms you have to be patient and realize that the time that they are making your breakfeast time to wrap it because of the hills it can fall and deliver to your room. 45 min it is more than okay. The first day we had a french waiter Philipe and he explained a lot to us. We were really please that he took time to explain the hotel where to go and being so nice considering the work he has to do. That was funny because everyday after that they sent him over to deliver every items we asked in the room. I thought it was a nice think to do. We also speak to Patric From haiti that was speaking french and sometimes that it is good to know that in the hotel someone can speak French. The general Manager Pascal Forti also came and speak with us. He sent a guy with a machete and some fresh coconut to cut at the pool. awesome. The room was big and again the view was just incredible. The place is really clean and they came 3 times in our room to make beds and clean it. We forgot once to remove our do not disturb sign and they called us at the end of the day to ask when we will be ready to have someone to clean. They are really cautious of their work. Every details counts. You can have delivered in your room everything you want. Just ask. They are quick. I like also very much the woman on the phone who take my order. Her voice was sympathic and she make sure that everything was okay. The hotel has 2 beaches and pools. We were suppose to go out of the resort and at the end except for 1 day of snorkling we stayed in the resort in the pool drinking cocktails or eating or just relaxing. I am highly recommend this place if you want a honeymoon or a romantic place. You can also go with Children but i think it will not be enough fun for them. This place is more for relaxing enjoying the sun the beaches the cocktails. lifeWe have seen racoon and Monkeys and iguanes as they were home. It was amazing.

Stayed here in April and enjoyed almost perfect weather. The resort is really magnificent as it straddles the peninsula giving it a superb natural setting. At it is narrowest point where you can go from beach to beach the peninsula is perhaps around 75 m or less wide. Both beaches had things to offer majestic herons noisy howler monkeys good snorkeling etc. Both beaches felt quite empty during our stay which was just after Easter. Golf course was amazing made me wish I was still playing. We took a golf buggy tour of the course with a few other guests which the hotel arranged free of charge. It was really worth doing and gave some great views and meetings with wild life. You do not need to be a golfer to do itWe ate in all the resorts restaurants and did room service we were there for 7 nights would have been 8 had we not been travelling with United airlines. They were all really good in their own way. The Italian was surprisingly stylish with a pretty avant garde menu very impressed. Bars were great too. Room was excellent. We had a canopy suite which worked great as we were 2 adults with 15 yr old daugter so 2nd bathroom and seperate living room with sofa bed was really useful. Outside we had a plunge pool which given the temperatures sometimes was very nice to have. However mostly being in the canopy we enjoyed good cooling breezes. We were positioned on a hill but if we did not feel like walking buggies were prompt. We overlooked one of the beaches but we were truly in the trees.

So let us start with orientation of this hotel something nobody told us1. This is a hotel for families and couples looking to mainly do activities in the Guanacaste area and most in the hotel property unles they want to drive 2 3 hours in which case I would recommend staying in Arenal. 2. Hotel is amazing for activities planned throughout the day all top notch and most complimentary. These include hikes biking snorkeling paddle boarding star gazing cooking etc3. There are other properties and things to do on the Peninsula and the hotel will take you there. Pierda Beach Club Andaz hotel Marina etc4. Only good restaurant on property is Cena Sociale where the cook Dario is amazing. Now tips1. Rooms. For families looking to do the low cost option recommend a room like 3107 close to the center and book early enough to get two twins2. Activities. book early they all fill up. Paid activities suggest doing through local tour agencies if you want to save hundreds of dolarsa. Palo Verde is the only excursion I would recommend. Would book through local tour rather than hotel to save hundreds of dollars. CostaRicaBestTripsb. Mangrove tour is a must do snorkeling stargazing biking yoga trail of giants mini golf if you have small kidsc. Do not do the coco beach tour. The city is a dump no need to visit Beach is dirty and not worth the 3. Restaurants. We did not see the 4Seasons service at all at the breakfast place. Every morning the service was off. One time they got our order wrong the other time they took plates away with fruit still on them another time they pushed the 10 bottled water. And every time for every meal I had to tell them about kids eat free. I wish somehow they could put that on my room number so I do not have to try to explain it in broken spanish to every waiter. Cena Sociale is amazing. We ate there two nights in a row4. Kids Club is the best we have every been to. Private pool amazing tote bag great staff activities are great5. Transportation. Use CostaRicaBestTrips. 65 vs 200 through the hotel. It is literally a 35 minute safe easy drive. 6. If the dates or price do not work call the hotel to ask for special rates directly. They were awesome helping me work out my dates and very nice7. Pool staff was awesome and activities staff was great as well and friendly8. Male Concierge was average. Did not really give us a map or orient us. Would have liked to have a better orientation before we committed to activities. 9. Location beautiful beaches amazing water. Pools average nothing special. Kids Club pool awesome for small kids. Close to Liberia airport. Remote for groceries etc. Try to stop by before you get there for beers wine if you do not want to pay for mini bar10. Roms loved the balcony and very spacious rooms. Overall a great hotel. Great for families although when we were there we ran into some grumpy couples looking for quiet with great overall location of two beaches pools not really that unique of pools but pretty nice.

So it is hard to find anything wrong with it when just about every person back East would swap places in a heartbeat. The service here is impeccable with friendly staff eager to help. The rooms are clean and were recently refurbished so they look fresh and updated. But unles you are a billionaire or on an expense account The Four Seasons is ridiculously expensive. A latte costs 738 by the time you add 13 tax and 10 service. As a matter of fact anything you purchase on the resort is subject to the same tax including your room. The biggest problem I see with the resort is that once you get here you are stuck using only their restraurants.

There is no doubt that this is a really nice resort however it lacks that extra bit that makes this a true five star hotel. I do not think that you get what you are paying for at this price.

Nice balcony on room with view of water Wildlife on resort monkeys iguanas birds etc Hikes around resort Breakfast was pretty god They will drive you around in golf cart if needed or drop you off at other resorts close by. I would recommend trying the other places for variety we really enjoyed our meal at Marea the most out of all the meals we had. Plenty of water given out around resort. Cons Should have more activities for a resort this size. If you do not book well in advance some activities like sunset kayaking are already taken. Only one yoga class a day with a fairly inexperienced yoga instructor. In my opinion a resort like this should have a ton of classes and activities so that you have multiple things to choose from a day and should not have to wait long. For example there are only 5 6 stand up paddle boards so you have to wait for people to turn it back in before checking it out. Checkout system was terrible. could not get anyone from reception to answer phone call enough to pick up our bags from the room or get our car brought around early. Housekeeping is a little limited. Never felt like they really cleaned our room incredibly well and turn down service was little more than stocking water and towels. Also we also had to call them to schedule a time for them to come clean our room or they did not come. Lots of kids. No escaping them in really any area of the resort. Restaurants were good but not worth the prices they charged. If you stay more than 3 4 days you will definitely be tired of the menus. Not enough variety to stay interesting. It takes 20 minutes to even just to get out of the resort so you are mostly limited to eating at other resorts unles you want to drive further.

It is a Four Seasons so the property is beautiful expected and the location could not be more convenient it is maybe 30 min from Liberia Airport again expected. but what makes this resort so unique is the absolutely amazing staff and customer service. I can not think of a property or hotel that I have stayed at that even gets close to the level of attentiveness friendliness helpfulness and just 100 professionalism as we experienced here. Whoever manages this resort should get a massive raise because every single individual that we encountered from the front desk to bellman to beach personnel to waiter and on and on was engaging happy and sincerely concerned about whether there was anything they could do to help. A great example is that the resort had a water leak on our second night and we had no water in the morning as they needed to shut down the line to do a repair. I called to inquire as to what was going on and the operator sent bottles of water to our room and gave me a pretty good window of when the water repair would be made and offered us alternative areas to shower etc. By the time I got back to my room after we hung out at the beach most of the day the manager had a hand written note apologizing for the inconvenience and left us a special desert plate.

If you have a chance go out on the catamaran it was one of the best things I have done. The food was great I loved the breakfast. I crave eggs rice and beans with Lizano my all time favorite breakfast. The snacks that come around to the beaches and pools every half hour were so good. And the drinks were amazing. Especially the 18th on the green and the Guajito you must try them both. They are very accommodating some in our group went deep sea fishing and the kitchen cooked it up for them to have for lunch. There was also wildlife galore. We had a family of monkeys outside of our room iguanas by the beach and coati on the hiking trail. We stayed in a plunge pool suite we felt like we were staying in a luxurious tree house as it was up in the side of the hill. It was nice and private. It was about a 5 minute walk back to the main building but they provided golf carts 247 to cart you back and forth. To top all of this off the staff was top notch.

Currently staying here 129 16. Booked a Canopy Suite ocean view which had a view of a dirt hill and road. Also was booked in a suite below a family with children that tramped in the early morning and late evening. Moved to a new suite minimal view of water through lots of trees and had two calls in to repair the air conditioning that did not work in the bedroom had to sleep on the couch in the living area which not only does not have a trash bin only one in whole suite in bathroom but also minimal lighting in the new decor so you are left with two side lamps that do not illuminate the space appropriately. Also the toilet had stool under the seat which I cleaned off. Tonight after a hike through the nature trail which boasted not one animal we came back to a room with just one robe and still missing the front of the minibar fridge which we pointed out to the staff. For 120 night and the first time at a Four Seasons resort we expected a lot more care in the property accommodations and customer service. Celebrating a 40th birthday and overwhelmingly disappointed. We stay primarily at 5 star resorts and this is not a 5 star resort.

For our honeymoon we booked 4 nights at Nayara Springs in Fortuna inland Costa Rica in the rainforest and then came here to Papagayo for 3 nights and we both agreed we wished we stayed the whole time at Nayara Springs which was so heavenly. When we checked into our room there at Four Seasons there were at least a hundred little mosquitos. other insects on the ceiling above our bed. We called the front desk and the lady said yes unfortunately we are having a bug problem right now and I asked well why do not you have insect netting around the beds then. They said they could not move us because the hotel was full so they sent maintenance in to fumigate and housekeeping to clean up but when we came back in from dinner there were a bunch of the little dead bugs all over the bed. On top of that the service at the pool main restaurant Bahia was SO slow for breakfast lunch dinner drinks and servers were not that knowledgable about the menus. I asked if the Shrimp Ceviche had anything other than shrimp in it and the server assured me there was no fish in it but then it came out with a big bowl of fish and they did not offer to take it off our bill when I said I do not like fish. We waited up to an hour sometimes more for breakfast ala carte at Bahia FOR EGGS. It should not take that long. They have stand up paddle boards you can take out but we were told we could not all three days there because it was too windy and we were also told not to go in the water because the jelly fish problem was so bad that every single person was getting stung when they went in. It was pretty much un bearable to lay on the beach because the sand was whipping up so violently into your eyes mouth drinks. I realize weather and jellyfish are not something that the resort can control but noting that as something to consider about the location when booking. And finally there were SO many kids at this resort when we were there. We were looking for some quiet and relaxation and there were kids splashing and screaming in all the pools if you lay on the beach you hear their kids camp program where the kids are all screaming playing Marco Polo and crying and blowing those whistles they sell on the beach. Overall just not the Four Seasons experience you are expecting for the Four Seasons price point. And finally I would warn you that if you are hoping to leave property and have anything nearby that is not the case here any taxis into nearby towns would be an hour and hundred bucks each way so hopefully you like the three restaurants on property. If you want to go to Costa Rica I had highly recommend going to a resort inland in the rainforest like Nayara Springs instead which was a total dream and where there is lots to do around that area. And if you are looking for a beach experience I had recommend going to a different beach different resort.", "offset": [278, 377], "date": "2017-12-20", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "309551a3-9adb-4719-9ca5-98e662ed5c18", "sentence": "We are in a large group who came for business plus pleasureit was amazing.

As we are so lucky getting so close to see the baby hump back whale. Aside from that we also saw two big turtles and a school of baby turtles. Actually was not my first time in this resortI was there sometime ago and we stayed in one of the house villas. Although this time we stayed in one of the regular room but still we have a great and enjoyable time during our stay. And we looking forward to come back and we will for sure recommend this resort to our friends. Well done.

There are some fantastic reviews and better writers than I on this site but I have to review this property as when I set out in November to book and go here it has exceded all my expectations1. The Room Simply gorgeous just went through remodeling and the rooms could not be more comfortable. As a Four Seasons you get roomy marble bathrooms super comfortable bed and large TV. Twice a day housekeeping. Immaculate. The picture is an example of the cielo room third floor. This in my opinion is a 2 person rom2. The Hotel Restaurants I have stayed at Four Seasons before and I know they pride themselves on food and no exception here. Went to all 3 restaurants for dinner have to say Bahia was just about as perfect as you can get. Ate the catch of the day. 4 nights and so delicious and fresh. Bahia is where breakfast is served and I do miss my daily Eggs Benedict with salmon the sauce not overpowering and eggs cooked each day to perfection. More on this later3. The amenities Well you just really never have to leave nor will you want to. Service around the pools and on Beaches superb and in the Guanecaste make sure you are near some shade as there are literally no clouds in the Dry Season it is ok. they have three different numbers of sun tan lotion and Love the Glass cleaning spritzers. I did a SPA afternoon had a facial manicure and pedicure. well done and really relaxing. If you go to the Spa which I recommend check out the plunge pools What puts this over the top you might ask as certainly other resorts have this. Well it is the reason I felt at Home The STAFF. Honestly they do everything to ensure your vacation is the best seemingly without effort. Friendly warm and after a few days the staff sort of knows what you want before asking. A special Thank You to Gradey at the Pol kind nice and funA big Thank you to Alvaro Garcia Assistant Manager of pool and Beach who was always around and his Staff at Bahia.

Let me start off by saying the four seasons at peninsula papagayo is breathtakingly beautiful. The four of us two couples in our 20s traveled together and had a four night stay at the the resort. Rom We shared a spacious room with two doubles beds overlooking the bay. The screened in balcony was amazing 3 we also really appreciated the bathroom it was huge we could all get ready at the same timeActivities The water activity center on the bayside is awesome. Jos\u00e8 took us out on a sunrise 5k paddle board tour at 6 am. Totally worth waking up early. He was such a great guide pointing out stingrays beaches and other landmarks. He also brought us snacks and water for the trip. He went above and beyond on the way back to the resort by pulling me through the windiest part of the paddle. Then fresh fruit waited for us as we arrived. JOS\u00c9 IS AWESOMEWe also did a group snorkeling tour with the resort. The water was calm and there were puffer fish sea urchins stingrays and a variety of other fish to see. The guides made sure to point out the fish to the entire group. The day before we left we did a 6 am sunrise kayak tour. This was such a good workout. Our guide I forget his name but he was amazing took us to a sandbar where the water was crystal clear. We found a variety of fish nurse sharks and stingrays. Bryon on the ocean is a great guy to set up a variety of excursions. He got us a rental car which we took to Tamarindo. Very trustworthy. BE SURE TO GO TO TAMIRINDOFod Everything we ate here was amazing and fresh. The staff goes above and beyond to please guests. We celebrated two birthdays on this trip and the staff made dinner feel special. Be warned the food is crazy expensive. My recommendation is to stop at a market on the way to the resort and stock up on snacks and drinks. One of the best things at the resort is the fruit stand. All the fruit is fresh delish and grown in Costa Rica. Gym We worked out twice while on vacation. Two level gym with everything you need to get a good workout in. The best part are the chilled coconuts in the gym. We drank so many. Definitely go in the hot in afterwards. Beach The beach is gorgeous. We swam in the ocean daily and walked from end to end. There are many cabanas and lounge chairs to chose from. The staff is super attentive. Pols the only time we went in the pool was at night and the pools were clean and warm. PROSecludedGorgeousExcelent service Beach and bay options CONS Expensive Far away from other towns and beaches such as Tamarindo.", "offset": [1719, 1819], "date": "2018-03-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "3d840f49-e70c-4d79-9745-6e9c206380f5", "sentence": "Very good hotel. When I review Four Seasons Resorts I review them on a different scale because we are talking the literal best of the best. Compared to other resorts 55 but on a Four Seasons level I would only give this stay a 3 or a 4. The first thing that stands out at the Four Seasons is service and the Costa Rican branch lives up to this. The staff members are friendly and helpful all throughout the resort. One staff member who lived up to the Four Seasons name specifically was Raul at the bar who aided us by providing us fresh coconuts throughout the duration of our stay and even at the end of the trip he snuck me a free coconut even though the hotel was not offering that specific service anymore. The rooms are comfortable and decently spacious even at the most basic level. However I might complain that the fridge was basically unable to be used because there was no space after it was stocked with all of the junk in the minibar. The glasses given to us for water were not abnormal but I was shocked when I found white coated on gunk in one of the glasses more than once. When I pay over a thousand dollars a night for a room at a Four Seasons I expect a lot more than this. Now while the main body of the hotel is small it is serviced well. The beaches are in great condition the pools are manned well there is even an in pool bartender and the facilities are great. The gym is two stories indoor and outdoor and the locker rooms are complete with a steam room and cold and hot plunge pools. The food at this resort was decent but overall disappointing. The breakfast while good was very expensive. For lunch there was a choice between pool food and a cafe both were decent. For dinner three restaurants were open two onsite and one on the golf course to which the Four Seasons provided a shuttle. While Pesce and Nemare were good Bahia was horrible. The chef was rumored to have an angry temper and ruined all our dishes. I recall the same thing happening at Bahia when we came in 2017. Overall I would recommend coming here. Four Seasons great property but there are some kinks that need to be ironed out.", "offset": [790, 947], "date": "2019-12-01", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}]}
