Food in the buffet restaurant was always good quality and cooked fresh and always piping hot. Raven the waiter in the buffet restaurant is an asset to your team as he always made time to speak to us every if we were not in his area. Food at lunchtimes was fabulous and always well looked after in the bar by Nina. Food in the beach restaurant was really good. Beach was immaculately cleaned and well kept and redo and Kamlish ensured we were looked after every day. ICI ice cream was the best I e cream ever and always served with a smile by Michael and marvin. My son who is 13 enjoyed the paddle boards windsurfing and tried his hand at water skiing but failed. Boat house staff always friendly and very alert. As we stayed in a junior suite and had our son with us each night staff called to make up the spare bed and change towels.

From the moment we stepped into Reception to the time we left 10 days later the whole experience was Exceptional. The Hotel Beach and grounds are stunning and the warmth and genuine desire to provide an outstanding level of service shone through. We received a very warm and sincere welcome from Elena who checked us in and showed us around the resort she was on hand throughout our stay to offer help and advice thank you Elena. I have numerous food allergies which can be taxing to cater for. this was not the case for LUX Grand Gaube they took it all in their stride nothing was too much bother. I ate like Royalty the whole time. The food produced despite my restrictions was to an exceptional standard and attention to detail. Normally placing your trust in others is daunting when the slightest mistake can make you unwell I was able to relax throughout our stay and enjoy the fantastic amenities safe in the knowledge that I had no worries regarding food it was so good that I could almost have forgotten that I had food allergies. None of this would have been possible without Diren who personally looked after us and went that extra mile to see that my every need was cater for and Depuck Executive sous Chef who personally made all my meals. I can not thank them enough for all their care and attention you made our holiday really special thank you. We would also like to thank Daniel and Raven for taking great care of us as well. This outstanding resort has something to offer for everyone from water sports to cinema spa golf tennis photography. We stayed in a Superior Ocean View room which was well appointed and well maintained we were not disappointed. The stunning beach is looked after by Redo and his team of assistants. They seemed to appear at just the right time to offer drinks straighten up your bed or simply polish your sunglasses. Well done great job thank you.

We were there for both our birthdays and 40th wedding anniversary and were surprised with birthday cake and champagne in our room nice touchspecial mention must go to Redo beach manager who drew a big loveheart on the sand and decorated it with garland flowers when he found out about our special occasion. The staff in this hotel are all very attentive to many to mention. Breakfast lunch and dinner excellent always plenty choice ice cream is served from a stretch mini with to many flavours to mention delicious. Trips do the desert island one but go with the locals who take you there and serve you the most enjoyable barbecue you will ever eat. Beach plenty sun beds sea warm but cloudy and very squelchy underfoot. Weather bit hit and miss this time of year sunny most days but clouded over some afternoons. We were given a complimentary massage which was so relaxing and a special dinner by the pool for our anniversary which made our night thanks very much.

We have just returned from 12 nights All Inclusive at LUX G. 2 Adults and 1 x 6 Year Old I prefer to give a true reflection of the stay so will include any positives and negatives. ARRIVAL. Nice to be met by David who was very helpful and offered a welcome coffee from the LUX Cafe which is always nice having experienced the same at LUX Maldives. All the staff were very welcoming which is always appreciated. Sadly it went down hill from there. Upon getting to the room 7 pm. we noticed that there was a welcome letter to another family always a concern and no bed for our son which after a 65 hour flight and 1 hour transfer is not ideal however we did not want to cause a fuss as we were reassured that a bed was on its way so we decided to get a bite to eat at the Beach Rouge cafe. On returning to our room to bed 2 hours later still no bed. IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THERE IS A DRESS CODE AT THIS RESORT MEANING YOU CANOT WEAR SHORTS OR SANDALS TO DINNER AFTER 6PM. THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS ONE RESTAURANT. This above dress code I found to be rather ridiculous especially for a family beach resort. In my opinion this needs to change. It is not a formal location so stop trying to be something it is not. There is no need for a dress code in all restaurants so I recommend this is removed to avoid future disappointment for patrons smart shorts and shirt t shirt would be enough unles you are visiting one of the more formal dining options such as the Peruvian restaurant. BEACH ROUGE A beach side restaurant which we know and love from the other Lux locations. We decided that we would order tapas as we were not in the mood for huge amounts of food. The waiter confirmed that only The LUX own brand wine was the only drinks that formed part of the All Inclusive range which differed from other LUX locations. Very disappointing but again we were not going to let this negatively impact our experience. Like other reviews I have since read on TripAdvisor the service was inconsistent and on some occasions downright poor there are a couple of superstars but for the most the staff were not attentive and could not get an order right. The food was often sat there on the serving desk for at least 10 minutes and not once in 12 days did we get any french fries that were hot Beach RougeThe menu is limited and frustratingly anthing beyond a sandwich and some pasta included a supplement which spending over 12k I expect more options and certainly do not expect any supplements. It you happen to be late for dinner and just want drinks and find yourself sat on the sand rather than the decking forget getting a drink. After 3 requests we went to the window and asked for a drink ourselves. Sadly this kind of service was not limited to Bar Rouge with many of the restaurants having the same challenge given our visit is outside of the peak season it was disappointing that the service was lacking. it is also worth noting that the options for lunch around the family pool are limited to Palm Tree Court which is a restricted version of the Beach Rouge menu or Beach Rouge so the food became repetitive very quickly. Buffet. The main buffet breakfast for the most part was good however if you want anything hot from the sweet breakfast section such as pancakes crepes waffles and anything else that should be hot forget it. they were stone cold and rubbery every day. The only chance of anything hot was waiting for the plates to empty completely and wait for the 10 minutes for them to cook again and get at the front of the queue. These are basics that you would expect a 5 hotel to get right. Sadly this was not the case. Fresh fruit egg station etc all available as you had expect from a breakfast buffet. The same restaurant for dinner was very good if slightly repetitive but the asian wok station was exceptionally good fresh pasta and pizza station along with other fresh options available. Again there were some of the waiting staff who were amazing but they were more often than not let down by the vast majority it felt as if they were overwhelmed if they had more than a few tables to co ordinate. Room access There is a new way to open the door using your smart phone. A great initiative especially as the room the cards failed 6 TIMES and no they were not near a phone however cool the smart phone access sounds it does not work either so we had to go to the reception and get new cards. a number of times in the first few days. This is again a basic requirement that you expect a hotel brand like LUX to get right. BEACH. The beach and beach facilities are beautiful and helped this review gain an extra star the water sports were also excellent and well utilised by residents. The beach is narrow but immaculate with really helpful staff. The sand is perfectly manicured and cleaned daily which helps keeps it pristine. GIN BAR Amazing for gin lovers the love and dedication of the barman here is not to be missed. Lovely to see in the hotel where so many of the staff seem disinterested in the residents that someone who truly is passionate about his job and his customers. However be cautious as the gin bar is not part of the all inclusive which is the only disappointment here. On one hand LUX lives up to the 5 Star only to fall short by charging those on an all inclusive. ROOM ATTENDANTS Often we had our room cleaned rather late in the day and had one experience where there was a knock on the door to see if we wanted our room turned down. at 945pm unfortunately we were all in bed at that time and our 6 year old asleep. When I complained the attendants rationale was that they only had 4 people that day which is unfortunate but the resort is not massive so offering turn down to a family at nearly 10 pm simply does not make sense. There was one morning when the room was cleaned at 11 am whilst we were at the gym fantastic. On our return we showered only to find that the cleaner had removed ALL TOWELS except one hand towel which we both had to use to dry following our showers. Again there does not seem to be any logic in removing the old towels but failing to replace them. Other examples included not having the drinking water replenished which for a family of three is a basic necessity. That said a shout out for Lux as a brand who use recycled glass bottles for water on place of plastic great initiative. GYM If you like to go to the gym or to exercise then the gym is top drawer with some of the finest equipment of any hotel that I have been to. The same can be said for the tennis which is also excellent. The staff were also impeccable. Well Done LUX for this. POOL. The family pool is very good with the single pool attendant Avi seemingly managing this himself. A true gentleman who I often felt for given the task in hand. Often vacated beds and towels were left unmoved for the whole day meaning that if you arrived late there were seemingly no beds available so you have to wait to ask if there is anything available or skulk about yourself. More staff needed to help Avi please. HOTEL SHOP Beautiful with some amazing gifts that can be purchased however there did not appear to be much available if you had forgotten run out of nappies sunscreen etc but there are a few supermarkets a short taxi ride away. KIDS CLUB Our little boy loved kids club in Maldives however this one was much smaller which if you had more than 10 kids was very crowded and much of the outside area is not undercover fine in the winter but in the summer could be a bit more of a challenge. They did a great aquarium trip which our little boy loved it was well organised and without charge. All of the kids club attendants were welcoming and very nice but a special thank you to Elodie who is a real credit to the hotel. All in all there were some highlights but we felt that in comparison to our experiences at Lux Maldives some of the staff missed the mark and seemed a little harassed so the service suffered. The location is undeniably beautiful and the refurb has resulted in a stylish fresh looking hotel but some of the basics were missed. We will return to Maldives next year but for the cost we were disappointed in the overall Lux G experience so unlikely to return.", "offset": [830, 889], "date": "2018-08-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "471499f1-c99d-43f8-819f-1d6b239647b4", "sentence": "Exceptional. 1st of all i would like to thank the hotel for giving us a voucher of a Cooking class in the Argentinian Restaurant. by the way the best food you will find it there. very very very very delicious.

Apologies for the length of this review which is very unusual for me but hopefully some will find it useful. We spent a very pleasant 10 days at the LUX. We decided on an Ocean View Junior Suite on a half board basis. Even with the high cost of wine and spirits I estimate we saved a couple of thousand dollars vs the All Inclusive option. Given the large excellent breakfast unles you have an appetite like a horse and can knock back a couple of bottles of wine per day andor copious beers and cocktails the additional cost is hard to justify. We did however hire a car for 7 days from Ebrahim in Grand Baie which allowed us to stock up on wine beer and soft drinks thus avoiding the high cost mini bar. This also allowed us to venture out to explore Mauritius a little more. We also had dinner and drinks at Linda \u2019s place one evening see separate review for less than the cost of a bottle of wine at LUXWe booked early on line where deposit and final payment is in Euros. All other incurred costs at the resort are in Mauritian Rupees. I noticed a few months before our final payment was due that LUX had a promotion with significantly reduced prices. I emailed and asked if I could retrospectively take advantage of this offer. They replied in the negative saying that as I had also booked a flight through them this was not possible. Strangely we had not booked flights with them but rather than enter into dialogue we cancelled our existing booking re booked at the promotional cost and saved quite a few thousand. We were very Surprised by the number of children for the time of year at the resort although the Banyan adults area is an oasis of calm and tranquility as contrasted to the main pool area which was at times a bit of a zoo. Also the restaurants had quite a number of children at dinner so a nice quiet romantic dinner was difficult. We did not try the Inti and this might have been different. If peace and quiet is important I would choose accommodation around the Banyan area or look for a truly adult resort. Our Ocean View Junior Suite was lovely although due to the strange design of the resort and rooms you could often hear lots of echoing noise from outside the room. The terrace area was however quite peaceful. The design and decoration of the rooms is lovely although sadly attention to detail is lacking. I could provide a long list but an example was the lack of a coffee table in the room by the lounge chairs which meant there was nowhere to put your cup glass or anything else. We eventually asked them to provide something which they did but it was not really adequate. All staff are very friendly and helpful at all times. There area lot of themWe had a late flight and unfortunately we were unable to stay in our room past the official check out time of 11 am. However we were told there was a \u201c courtesy room \u201d. we could use which sounded ok and we planned to have a late lunch to while away the time. Unfortunately the courtesy room turned out to be just a block of shower facilities so we decamped to the pleasant library area which had some comfortable chairs and importantly air conditioning. A note for those with transport who might want to stock up. There is a little convenience corner store in Grand Gaube village which would be a couple of minutes away. There is also an Intermart at Calodyne which is about five minutes drive. RESTAURANTS FOOD WINEI will do separate reviews on TA for each restaurant we visited but below are some general comments and specific comments for those locations not reviewed separately. Apart from the Palm Court and to a lesser extend Beach Rouge we were disappointed with both Bodrum Blue and the Creole Smoke House. We did not eat at Inti. Palm Court Breakfast excellent however the concept of salt and pepper on the table seems to have been lost. A waiter will bring loose condiments it if asked for but not exactly very hygenic dipping one \u2019s fingers into it. Also although the buffet selection is excellent and eggs are made to order a lot of the food is stone cold. Dinner buffet was excellent from the various food stations we specifically enjoyed the made to order pasta and noodles and of course the desserts. This was the best place to eat in our view. It is worth noting that they do not open for lunch so for those on AI the options are limited. Palm Court Bar Nice position overlooking the ocean and we were looking forward to the cocktails. I had a Mai Tai which was pretty ordinary and unlike any Mai Tai I have ever had. I was also overcharged for it. The ice cream from the van was very good and excellent value at MUR80Banyan Burger Shack Had a hot dog and fries from them one day which was very good. DINNER DRESS CODEThis policy is a little inconsistent. A flyer in the room states that pants must be worn by all men whereas the LUX mobile ap states shorts are ok in Beach Rouge. WINEAt first glance there is a very extensive wine list with wines from all over the world. As with most hotels of this class wine is expensive so expect to pay around \u00a3 33 or A 60 for a bottle. Unfortunately it is hard to find a nice good value wine at this price even when we paid \u00a3 45 or 80 we were still sometimes disappointed. We actually sent back 2 wines one of which was oxidised and the other had an unpleasant sulphur taste. Although they have a sommelier who will help you choose a wine from a wine list which is physically enormous and difficult to hold at the table they have a strange policy of serving red wine very chilled. The sommelier tried to explain this by saying that \u201c room temperature \u201d in Mauritius was much higher than elsewhere and hence the need to chill. I did n\u2019t have the energy to point out that the definition of room temperature is around 5f for red wine based on the Bordeaux region of France. We did have a couple of wines which were nice one from Languedoc suggested by our waiter which was n\u2019t even on the list. As mentioned above I do have some specific points to raise but I did not want to clutter this review with minutiae. I notice that the LUX General Manager responds to most reviews and he would like to send me a message on TA with contact details I will provide them.", "offset": [4774, 4898], "date": "2019-04-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "be96e71a-befc-4b17-b7a3-a1d802378fea", "sentence": "Pretty hotel pleasant stay. Just returned from staying in this hotel. it is a beautiful hotel and without doubt some of the staff really made it an enjoyable stay. Albeit there were some disappointments too. To start with the positives in the main all the staff are friendly helpful but special mention has to go to Mario in Junk Art who showed us how to make gorgeous photo frames candle holders. Malenia I hope spelling is correct in Beach Rouge who was so friendly and engaging whenever we were there and Avi Charlie in the Banyan area who were so friendly fun always had a joke with us. Charlie makes the best cocktails. Also every morning the ladies in Cafe Lux always greeted us with a warm smilesA couple of improvements the hotel could make we arrived after a 18 hour flights and very little effort was made to accommodate us so we could get to our room before the standard 2 pm check in we arrived at 11 am. I realise the hotel was under no obligation to provide us with an early check in but we were completed exhausted from travel and given that it is meant to be a 5 star resort at the very least I would have hoped that our room could have been bumped higher up the cleaning list so we did not have to wait 3 hours to get some rest. In other hotels that I have stayed in this request was always facilitated. The second negative was that one morning we tried to get some breakfast to takeaway. as we were going on a day trip while the restaurant was open at 7 am the full breakfast range was not available for instance no pastries out. We were met with some rude and unhelpful responses from a supervisor when we asked for a takeaway tub so that we could at least take some fruit with us we had paid for breakfast after all. Eventually we got a tub a dirty one though which we had to clean ourselves. The hotel has a policy of preparing picnic breakfasts for takeaway but you have to inform them the night before. However we were not made aware of this at check in. Nonetheless when we returned from our day trip the issue was addressed by management in a very prompt manner we did receive an apology. Also one of the ladies in Cafe Lux was amazing she sorted us with coffee cookies to keep us going before we headed off on our day trip.", "offset": [917, 1245], "date": "2019-07-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "92231cd5-0f7f-414b-b181-b8006f98d885", "sentence": "ABSOLUTE PARADISE AND DELICIOUS BUFFET.

The breakfast and dinner buffet at the palm court are DELICIOUS honestly who has ever called a buffet delicious. it is amazing how well they do the food.

We even tried to extend our stay at Lux G we were not able to due to having to pay a penalty at the other resort. Honestly there is a reason why this place has 5 stars with over 50 reviews. In terms of how Lux G is on par with others all the 5 star resorts we stayed at seemed to have free water sports turn down service at night etc. some extra free thing for our honeymoon Compared to the other 5star resorts we stayed at the rooms were on the smaller end and of similar price to bigger rooms at other resorts. This did not bother us as we spent more time exploring resort island. The other notable thing is that the beach itself is also a little smaller however it does not have any hawkers so this may be an upside to being a smaller beach we stayed at another resort with a truly stunning beautiful beach with lots of locals and LOTS of hawkers.", "offset": [1634, 1811], "date": "2019-08-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "7461c179-e8b4-4663-9268-0ab336e08fe2", "sentence": "Fantastic kids club excellent service and total relaxation. But the bugs. We spent 1 week here with our 3 young children in between 1 week at each of the other Lux hotels in Mauritius Le Morne and Belle Mare. This was our favorite week and the hotel that the kids want to go back to. The biggest reason for that was the kids club and the staff that works there. Even though the other hotels have bigger and better kids clubs when it comes to the actual space and playground area the staff at Grand Gaube seem to actually enjoy hanging out with the kids. So I would like to say a big thank you to Rebecca and Felicia especially. Since we last visited Lux Grand Gaube the hotel has gone through a transformation which we really liked. The rooms are fantastic and the staff are as friednly and helpful as ever. The food was great we especially liked the pasta station and the Indian food. The burger place towards the adults area was very good too. The beach is still pretty even if the water is not clear and it is very relaxing to have the beach chairs just by the water with some space inbetwen. The property never feels crowded and the pool area is nice. The only downside that I have to point out is the cockroaches. Now I know this is the tropics and so on but there were a couple of days when many roaches dead and alive was just by the edge of the restaurant stage area and in the lobby area. While I never saw any in the actual food areas of the reatuarant it would at least have been nice if they had been cleaned up because they are not nice to look at. At all. This couple with the fact that our terrace had a very large hole at the bottom of the balcony doors was not reassuring and that took about 2 or 3 days before they managed to fix it after we notified them. Anyway that was my one complaint but I never saw even a hint of a cockroach on the other two Lux properties so obviously it can be dealt with. which leads me to another minor complaint. The cleaning could be more thorough. Lux Le Morne has quite dated rooms but it was always kept spotless while on most nights in Lux Grand Gaube the same cobwebs were never touched and a bit dusty on the floor. I have to mention it but do not get me wrong it was still a very nice room.", "offset": [2171, 2246], "date": "2019-08-29", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "cfc88fc9-8127-4515-9d4e-569d909025a4", "sentence": "If your experience was disappointing tell the hotel before you leave to give them a chance to make up for it. The Lux Grand Gaube Hotel is a lovely resort as a whole with lovely staff and great atmosphere. However there were some things that we were disappointed about which I have listed below. We had to move to a second room in the middle of our stay because one day the door mechanism suddenly stopped working we had to get out from the backdoor which did not lock and the staff spent several hours but still could not fix the door. So we were told that we had to move to a new room which was rather inconvenient as we had everything laid out for our stay at the hotel for a total of 8 nights. Anyway we did the move so that was that. The second day in our second room we had no hot water in the evening when we needed to shower. The repairmen were quick to show up and tried to fix the hot water but took over an hour to do so. It was after 11 pm and we were given the option to move to another room that was not affected by the hot water outage. We did not take up the option because it was stressful to have to move rooms again. So we asked for a vacant room that had working hot showers just to use the showers and then went back to our occupied room. The staff apologised for the inconvenience but the experience was really not pleasant to have to worry and move around just to get a shower near midnightWhen we contacted the hotel about our experience a manager immediately spoke to us to try to understand and apologise for putting us through the trouble. We were offered a free massage session each late checkout for our room on our last day and part of our final bill was reduced as well. Although the experience was not 100 seeing that the staff there helping as much as they can to make up for the disappointment made our stay at the Grand Gaube near 5 starOther notes There is a wide coverage of wifi which we could even get signal while kayaking near the beach. but the speed and connection was very average as the connection was cut from time to time and one had to forget and reconect.", "offset": [1567, 1701], "date": "2019-11-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "2ba0533d-77ba-4764-b89b-8152618bbd45", "sentence": "Paradise. This resort really is excellent. Relatively recently refurbished it will suit a variety of different tastes. The grounds are immaculate it is quite a boutique resort rather than a huge resort which suited us. It is also quite sleepy. The adults only area of the beach is lovely and a nice touch is when the waiters on the beach bring you a cool box filled with whatever you will need for the day rather than having to continually wait for drinks to be brought over. The two pools are also lovely. Wifi is excellent and the LUX ap is genius. We stayed in their entry level room and it was everything we could need overlooking the sea at the side of the resort with the biggest bed I have ever seen. I would suggest that the mini bar could be colder for the drinks stored within it. Also the drain away in the shower did not go down very quickly after a long shower so you may have to wait for a bit to stop the bathroom getting flooded but as it is basically a wet room these are minor issues and in no way detracted from our experience. The decoration is amazing neutral and tranquil. Take an amazon Firestick if you want access to things like Netflix etc. We were all inclusive and the food and drink is plentiful on that basis. This includes everything from the coffee bar the ice cream van and all the restaurants excluding INTI. There is the Buffet and then 5 other restaurants serving food to a standard that is above any other 5 that we have ever visited in terms of service ambiance and taste. On each menu there are also items with an which indicated that these are a supplement. A lot of alcoholic beverages were included on all inclusive too I found it odd that the only Gin included on all inclusive was Gintys a hotel of this standard should have something like Bombay Sapphire included as their entry level gin. We were surprised by some of the menu items that were a supplement why is Baklava a supplement. Why are the side dishes in Bodrum blue a supplement. You can understand a supplement for expensive items such as Lobster Steak Tiger Prawns but a lot of items did not make sense why they were an extra charge. If we went again we would probably go room only as we like to eat and drink whatever we want and so often chose items that were at a supplement I believe it would have been better value for us to go room only. However if you are the type of people who like to know exactly how much they are spending on a holiday the all inclusive is a good option. The food was EPIC. Everything was fresh and beautiful. The best were Beach Rouge and Creole Smokehouse. The burgers at BBs are also amazing. Milkshakes and coffee from the coffee bar were fantastic. If you are a foodie and worry that you are going to spend a tonne of money and be disappointed by yet another all inclusive that says their food is amazing and are sick of buffet all inclusives. do not hesitate book this hotel. We are divers so did 6 dives with Divesail from the resort shout out to Keny and Pascal who led all our dives and were fantastic. I had suggest water and cokies snacks on board to give to guests between dives. Apart from that we had a great time. We also hired a car whilst we were there and were able to drive to a nearby dive center Emperator where we did a Shark dive safari which was also incredible. The water on the beach at Grande Gaube is not clear but the diving on the islands to the North is exceptional with incredible visibility. We also went on a private speedboat organised by Logen the concierge. We drove for about an hour to get to the East of the island where we got on the speedboat just the two of us and the Captain who served rum and cokes through the trip. Here the water is absolutely crystal clear we explored the coast and went to some incredible snorkling spots a lighthouse and stopped for BQ lunch at Il aux cerfs. It was the perfect day and we were surprised by how inexpensive it was. it is worth the trip if you love the water and do not want to be crammed with 15 other people on a speedboat. There is not much locally around the hotel so if you want to explore i suggest hiring a car which was cheap and can be arranged through the hotel. We also really enjoyed spending time with Vishnu at the Gin 100 bar. The gin here is at additional cost but he makes the most incredible gin cocktails I have ever tasted. His knowledge of Gin is incredible. We were surprised that not more people used the gin bar. Entry level Gin there worked out about \u00a3 12 for a huge goblet of gin which was always a double so exactly like or cheaper than city prices in the UK. Vishnu also infuses his own Gins his purple gin that turns pink when mixed with tonic is the most delightful gin i have ever had. Also his strawberry gin is incredible. All presented perfectly and with some theater of Vishnu often preparing it for you at your table at Beach Rougue PERFECT. Strangely the signage to the Gin bar points in the wrong direction also a sign above the bar might make people aware that the Gin Bar is actually there. All staff were incredibly lovely and friendly. You could tell that they really enjoyed their jobs I am sorry if I have missed anyone the waiters who serves us at Beach Rouge were brilliant Logen the Concierge Vishnu and his gin Nevash at Creole Smoke House Yaser at Beach Rouge Jef the security guard who helped us spot bats one night in the Banyan area and Karuna at Cafe Lux. All were exceptional. Thank you for a great holiday we are converted to the LUX brand and can not wait to try another LUX resort or return to LUX Grand Gaube again.", "offset": [791, 1046], "date": "2020-01-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "3d156847-839f-4f74-9028-e45d85568694", "sentence": "Wonderful hotel and service despite the virus. My wife son and I stayed here in March making it from the UK into Mauritius before the lockdown. The first couple of days were especially great with all facilities available including snorkeling PLAY spa and tennis courts. However within a couple of days these services closed in view of the escalating virus crisis. Despite this the staff maintained a tremendous level of professionalism. Many were staying on site to ensure the guests were well looked after. The restaurants too mainly remained open and provided a very good selection. At all times the service was exemplary and staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable with difficult constraints particular mentions to Ashwin Purgun and Thanen.
