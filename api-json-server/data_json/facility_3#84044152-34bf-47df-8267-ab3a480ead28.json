I recently attended the Army Navy football game in Philadelphia and stayed at the Sheraton Downtown which is where the Navy Football team was also staying I am family of the coaches staff. Needless to say the event is very large and all of Philadelphia not just this Sheraton was very busy. We got up to the hotel from Annapolis MD around 7 pm and when we went to check in the front desk agent told us that the room we were supposed to be staying in was blocked off. I let her know that my girlfriend and I were with the coaches staff and family and she proceeded to simply give us another room on a different floor. It was the same kind of room King bed suite that we were supposed to have and I did not want to complicate the situation anymore than it already had been so I agreed to take the different room not a big deal or so I thought. My girlfriend and I get up to our room and begin unpacking and settling in. Then about 30 minutes after we walk in and are getting comfortable ANOTHER GUEST WALKS IN USING A ROOM KEY. I have been around and stayed at many hotels inside and outside the US and I have NEVER had this happen to me. My girlfriend was mortified and I was completely taken aback. The person a young college aged male looked stunned as well muttered a few curse words and ran off back down the hall I am assuming to Guest Services. After calming down my girlfriend I immediately called the Front Desk to let them know of the situation. They apologized profusely and told me they would take care of it right away and that they would call me back momentarily. Well I waited for that call for about 25 30 minutes before it finally came through at which time they proceeded to tell me that they had taken care of the discrepancy and that it would not happen again and they were very sorry. No mention of any compensation no question as to if we wanted to switch rooms or if we needed anything else. They simply said they have taken care of it. After I asked them what they meant by taken care of they just said no one else would walk into my room. Now I have had much less negative things happen to me while staying at a hotel and much more offered to me as a guest to make things right ie comped drinks food one night stay etc. but these folks did nothing of the sort. So I finally had to tell them awkward situation that I expected some sort of compensation for what had happened. My girlfriend did not feel safe I felt as though our privacy had been violated and it gives you the feeling of looking over your shoulder just waiting for the next person to walk into your room unexpectedly. The front desk agent then said she would call a manager and call us back. After about another 10 15 minute wait I get a call back at the room and they offer to cover one half of one night of our whole weekend stay. I explained that I expected a little more than that and she told me there was not anything else they could do. So now after dealing with this whole situation for over an hour I gave up speaking to this lady over the phone and decided to go downstairs. We met some friends and family for drinks at the bar which was great and I finally was able to speak to a manager face to face. The concierge desk John I think was super friendly and helpful in getting the manager to come down. When I explained to the manager what had happened he let me know that it was a glitch in the system that allowed the front desk agent to check two different parties into the same room and that it had happened to 6 other people me included. He then offered a couple of complimentary buffet breakfast cards which were appreciated and then set me up with an SPG Loyalty Account pre loaded with 90 points which is like 90 of one night stay at a Sheraton in the US. Situation finally settled but still a very bad taste in my mouth. And yes there is more. The next night Saturday night after the Army Navy game concluded we were driving back to the hotel in a coachs vehicle which was covered for valet for the entire weekend at a team rate. When we got to the hotel it was packed and the valet door attendant said nobody could valet and that we had to park across the street. We told him several times that we were with the team and that valet was covered for the entire weekend which is when he told us that they over booked themselves and that a holiday party in progress at the hotel had taken all of the teams parking spots. Again just adding to the incompetence that went into the planning of this weekend the team had a contract for quite some time before the weekend. So we hop back into the car to go park across the street as the gentleman at the front instructed only to find out that that parking lot was full as well. And the one next to that. And the one next to that. So here we are supposed to meet up with coaches friends staff and players in the lobby of the hotel after the Navy win and we are stuck driving around a city we are not familiar with after our guaranteed parking is taken away from us because they over booked. We finally found another hotel Embassy Suites who was full but was kind enough to park us up front after we told him the situation Towne Park was the valet operator for both hotels for 10 on the premise that we retrieved the car before midnight. We then walked back several city blocks to our hotel to meet friends and family an hour late. Again I spoke to a manager possibly the valet manager at this point and told him he could send a person to go get the car because we were livid at this point and not dealing with it. They kindly agreed and apologized for the inconvenience and ultimately retrieved our car from the other hotel parked it and had it ready in the morning when we called. And they also gave us another 4 complimentary breakfast buffet passes. All in all I am appalled at how they over booked themselves and mostly mishandled the situation except for a few key people like the valet manager at Sheraton and the Concierge and manager I spoke with. In two years when the Army Navy game returns to Philadelphia I sincerely hope that the Sheraton Downtown is OUT of the equation.", "offset": [1234, 1384], "date": "2015-12-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "53c303bf-595d-44b8-b5de-2ba62b8b75c7", "sentence": "Worst Sheraton.

Both nights I asked to be moved due to the poor conditions of the rooms and both times was put on the 22nd floor which was better obviously had been remodeled and had a Sweet Sleeper bed.

Up the elevators we went which take a while to get to 26th floor. After settling it we tried the club lounge or at least tried to. Our keys were not set to open that lounge even though i specifically asked. I called down and they said i would need to come down and get new keys. The problem was that the elevator wait was too long. I asked is they could bring up new keys. No was the answer. So a yes your key will work followed by a no we can not bring up a new key when it did nt. The hotel was filled with groups and one or maybe more of the lifts was out of order. Rather than waiting we stopped down the next morning. They did reprogram our key with no apology. Once we got into the lounge it was a huge disappointment. Food was minimal and limited. It was very crowded there were many more guests that rooms on the club floor. I overhead the staff making the same complaint saying that the front desks offered access to the club room to solve guests complains. Not fair to me who paid. Also there were large groups where one guest had access and the entire group. 20 people took over the lounge. Not fair. The parking garage is a disaster creepy and crowded and way too expensive.

This was the worst hotel stay I have had in my entire life please read until the very end and you will see why. In the past year I have easily stayed over 100 nights in different hotels because I travel so much for work. I rented a club level suite to celebrate my birthday and was checked in by a younger woman who encouraged me to turn up to which I laughed and agreed and was excited to hear since it was going to be my birthday. My gf and I were placed on the 25th floor. The stay was Friday Sunday and my birthday fell on Saturday which I planned to have a 12 person group all go out to Down Night Club and get bottle service to celebrate. Friday night my gf and I took it easy and watched a movie falling asleep around 130 AM. I woke up Saturday morning to find my pants in a pile near the bathroom with my wallet on top of them. My gf was in the doorway to the bathroom right next to them and I thought surely she would have an explanation as to why my pants were there with wallet on top maybe she forgot her key needed to borrow a dollar for the vending machine. but she said nothing shut the door and turned the shower on. Puzzled I picked up my pants and opened the wallet and the 500 cash I had on me because that is about how much a bottle costs at Down when you get bottle service was gone. My heart sank. How could this have happened. Then I remembered our door did not shut. that is correct if you let the door shut it would not close all the way. It looked like it was shut but in reality the door would not click shut and lock. The house keeping lady called security who did not answer the first 10 calls or so but then finally 2 gentleman arrived and did their investigation. I say in quotes because neither made me feel any better about the incident and while I was still explaining myself one had already walked all the way down the hallway to the elevators and was on his phone. my door was the only door without a pry guardis this how the hotel conspirators mark the rooms that do not shut. They brought handyman up soon after to install another guard and asked if we had like to change rooms to feel more secure and at first I thought no now that I know the door is broken I will be positive to shut it I have never in my life EVER not ONCE had a door that did not shut itself. but that s besides the point. but on second thought I said yes please we will move rooms. By changing rooms though the hotel separated my stay into 2 individual nights increasing the cost by over 100 which was another headache to reconcile. The head of security was very adamant about us coming to him and no one else if we remembered anything. We even asked to speak to a manager and when she came over he quietly told her to go away shooed her away and seemed like he did not want us to speak with her. weird. no cameras on the floor of course. also weird. no pry guard on the door that looks like its shut but its not ACTUALLY shut locked. weird. and the room is on the club level and it was my birthday so probability of me having cash on me is higher than an average night and the first night we are there it happens. so you are telling me some random person stumbling down the hallway happened to fall into our door because it literally looks shut when you just let it go like an inch away from clicking and locking itself but just not quite. THEN after realizing oh wow this door is open has the kahunas to walk into that room while the tenants are inside sleeping and not take 1 single thing besides the cash in my wallet. Now I know you are probably thinking oh could be any bum off the street. okay very true that is definitely a possibility. If it were a bum off the street do not you think they would have taken the 200 worth of sunglasses the Ipad in the room the laptops the nice watches my WHOLE wallet in general credit cards gift cards take the whole thing. This person just took the cash specifically. even left the Regal movie ticket vouchers and receipts I had that were in the same column as the cash so they were being meticulous about it. Idk maybe its just me and the 10 people I asked their opinion from but. all of them said sounds like an inside job or something to that sort. Regardless I submit my claim talk to the security people and insurance people etc etc weeks go by and then finally hear back from the insurance company. Excited I get the mail and think. alright well even though its weeks later and the incident pretty much ruined the birthday weekend. I still will never stay there again at least Sheraton found it in their heart to replenish the 500. Much to my dismay though I open the letter and the insurance company that represents Sheraton Galagher Basset Services writes Our investigation revealed that our client is not responsible for your missing money. There is a lock safe box located in the room and is posted on the Innkeepers statue within the room. Per the report you choose not to utilize the lock safe box. So even though someone was in our room while we were sleeping because the faulty door as one security guard described it which is already creepy enough since I did not utilize the lock box they are not liable. So say I did use the lock box cash is all safe and sound. still someone came into our room while we were sleeping because your door does not shut which is actually a fire safety violation according to the head of security Max and could have stolen anything. Who knows what that person did or did not do am I supposed to put every item I own in there. Will it hold all of our work itemsIpads laptops documents expensive watches expensive shoes cellphones sunglasses etc. No it will not so if I would have locked away the cash in the safe box who is to say they would not have stolen other itemsSO in conclusion I woke up on my birthday to the 500 cash I had in my wallet to celebrate with. gone the staff did not make me feel better at all the day and birthday weekend ruined charged an extra 100 for accepting the free room change that the staff suggested 4 weeks later still straightening that out and nothing at all has been done to remedy any of the headaches caused.
