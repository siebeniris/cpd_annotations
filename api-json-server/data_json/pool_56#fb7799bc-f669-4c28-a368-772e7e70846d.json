This was superb because it allowed us to start our adventures early. A short walk from Cafe Du Monde go here in the AM when the line is short and Jackson Square which hosts local artists and entertainers. The hotel checked us in a bit early so that we could snooze. Beds are super comfortable. Our room has a great big window with a view of the river and French Quarter. The noise of the ships did not bother us since its part of being next to the river. The hotel has a pool on the roof. You have to take two separate elevators to get there but worth the ride. Take a drink and watch the sunset romantic. Staff was really friendly and this made up for the short comings of the building. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again. Tips Walk through the French Quarter once and stay out. There is so much to see outside of it. If you want music head to Frenchmen St where all the music is and the locals hang out. If you are there on a nice sunny day head to the Garden District and walk through the beautiful homes lots of famous people live there. Make sure you visit a cemetery as they are unlike most cementers in the US and have historic traditions. If you are going to try a Sazerac go to the Roosevelt Hotel and order one at the Sazerac Bar. Overall great adventure. The location. Right next door to Canal Street which is downtown and a step way from the River Walk that borders the French Quarter. Next to the night life of the french quarter without the noise. Close to the Street Cars and river ferries that can take you to explore. The room walls look to have a little wear. Overall seems like little finishing touches are needed to modernize the hotel up to its price.", "offset": [530, 563], "date": "2015-04-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "6da487ab-da71-4d6d-9d36-1e88929116e0", "sentence": "Close location to French Quarter.

Excellent location good rates comfortable beds free wifi rooftop swimming pool are all things that I really like about this hotel. It is cool but also a little odd that the hotel lobby is on the 11th floor. The lobby area has an excellent setup that is very inviting to stay and hangout. Decor in the rooms is pretty bland. Only real complaint is that rooms can use some soundproofing around the guest room doors so you do not have to hear people out in the halls all hours of the night.

This was originally the Ibervile Hotel built for the 1984 Worlds Exposition in New Orleans. The Hotel is adjacent to Canal Place Shopping Center and located in the top half of a high rise building.

The room we had was a wonderful suite with about 160 sq. ft 1 12 baths a huge bedroom with views to the SE and NE. giving you magnificent overviews of the river and French Quarter. The living room dinning room is huge and gives another great view of the river. Yes the room is not cheap but its worth it in the views. Treat yourself at least once and try it. We spent two nights and could barely break ourselves away to tour or eat at one of the many great restaurants in the area. The decorator of this room must be a bit off because it was decorated oddly.

We are SPG members and have stayed at numerous Westin properties so we have a decent sense of the average quality. We were in a disabled accessible room on the 24th floor. On the plus side the view of the river and riverfront were spectacular and the soundproofing which worked for everything except the train and riverboat whistles which we liked anyway made for quality sleeping. The linens were nice cotton as were the duvet covers which we much prefer as it means they wash them unlike the disgusting poly ones you find at some properties. Both the shrimp and grits and the short ribs and grits that we ordered at the cafe downstairs were excellent \u2014 good flavor generous portions. The location is quite convenient just on the edge of the French Quarter and near the stops of the red trolley and Hop On Hop Off red bus. On the negative side apparently the larger accessible bathroom required some design adjustments to the space but the solutions were poor quality. The closet was too small. It looked like a DIY construction job. The hangers must hang askew in order to fit. The closet bar is simply resting on a rail and is not even fixed to wall which is a safety hazard. The disabled bathroom has what seems to be an accessible toilet but instead of a roll in shower there is a regular tub with extra grab bars. I \u2019m not clear how that qualifies as accessible. There was no directory of services. When we phoned to request one assuming it was missing by accident we were told that new ones were supposed to have been printed a year ago. The refrigerator requires a key \u2026 but apparently they do n\u2019t provide the keys anymore because it does n\u2019t cool properly but rather can be used to store at room temperature. WhatThe rooftop pool is a good size and is apparently recently newly renovated. Unfortunately it looks as if the stairs leading to the pool were n\u2019t ever cleaned after renovation filthy. Kind of a buzz kill when you \u2019re going somewhere to relax while pretending you \u2019re at the Ritz. Let \u2019s discuss breakfast. It \u2019s fine to have a pricey buffet 23 and some pricey breakfast dishes like eggs benedict all entrees were 17. But at least give an economical offering for those who are n\u2019t big breakfast eaters and wish to economize. There \u2019s still plenty of profit margin if you charge 10 for 2 eggs and toast. But you do n\u2019t offer that. It \u2019s like you are holding your guests hostage. Never mind that you charge 3 for a small bottle of water in the room. Absurd in a city where I can get 25 cent martinis.

Stayed here over the Christmas weekend. Hotel location is excellent views from the rooms are great but there is a lot of work needed to live up to a Westin.

Were told that we are welcome to buy a drink at the bar or wait around the lobby. Granted the wait was maybe a half hour or so but should not have happened. Room itself had a great view beds and bathroom were clean thankfully. however there were some suspicious patches on the carpet which I steered clear of. On the second day noticed that the glasses were not clean did not use them since check in which should not happen especially if you make customers wait to have the room cleaned. We just used the hotel to sleep at night while exploring throughout the day so it was not a huge issue for us but would have expected better quality from a Westin.
