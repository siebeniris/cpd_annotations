This Ritz somehow feels less slightly ritzier than the others including Four Seasons which owns the Ritz brand that I \u2019ve stay at. Perhaps it \u2019s the street garage level entry to the hotel which entails taking an elevator to the 12th floor receptionist. Once there the system for getting to other floors both down and up left more than a few guests confused as to how to get around. The conference facilities were also a touch drabier than for instance the one in DC. The lobby by contrast is nice and bright being that it is in a glass enclosed atrium. Those comfortable looking chairs alas not so comfortable with their upright backs. That said the service is largely up to par. The concierge was very helpful and the bellmen even more so. Despite the receptionist \u2019s own offer they did neglect to inform me when the room was ready necessitating me checking in again rather than being able to focus on what I had to get done. Let \u2019s be real. that \u2019s a nit that would n\u2019t merit a second thought at most any other hotel but since the Ritz prides itself on and I have felt impeccable service it \u2019s worth them having the feedback. The room was up to their usual modern posh standards with super comfortable beds and pillows. The bathrooms are starting to look dated with standard beige marble but more importantly my wife and I both noticed that the water pressure in the shower was lacking. I might suggest they make a virtue out of reality by installing a wide rain showerhead. That way the slow flow would at least cover more body space than the limp flow from the narrower standard showerhead. And we were on one of the lower florsWe were lucky enough to get a partial view of the lake which was nice. Even then because of all the high rises right around the hotel we had to pull the dark shades because of bright light pollution into the room. For those few of us who prefer to wake up with sunlight I tend to leave my shades open that was largely out of the question. They ca n\u2019t control that it \u2019s just a fact of location. Speaking of location the hotel is just a half block off the northern end of the Magnificent Mile. Right across from the hotel through the not so attractive garage street entry is a nice mall. For serious shoppers and or people watchers a nice stroll up and down this stretch of Michigan Ave will bring many delights. The river is only a 1520 minute walk away a boat architecture tour is a must if you \u2019ve never done one.

I can not express how disappointed we are with our stay. World travelers who have stayed in the best hotels worldwide expect Ritz properties to exceed luxury standards every visit. This hotel not only did not exceed it did not even meet basic standards for hospitality. We flew in from Miami on a flight that was delayed arriving at the hotel at 3 am. The front desk staff member who checked us in was clearly exhausted and went through the check in process on auto pilot. Our first morning in the room we ordered room service for the three of us. The room service kitchen forgot one of the entrees. Instead of eating breakfast together as a family I waited for my eggs Benedict while my husband and son ate their breakfasts at my urging. When the eggs Benedict arrived the English muffin was burned to a crisp and the eggs were cold. Not a nice way to kick off the first morning of our stay. This property has one restaurant adjacent to the main lobby. There is also an atrium area adjacent to the lobby. The atrium area called deca is the preferred place for seating because the ambient lighting is gorgeous and you can literally look up the length of the John Hancock tower. We were told you could order off the bar menu or the restaurant menu in the atrium area. The service was so bad we could not get the attention of the waiter. There was a group near us who was also trying to get his attention. When he finally went over to them he told them he was doing his best and he was sorry if his best was not good enough. My jaw dropped to the floor. Who says that to a customer anywhere. We expressed our frustration to an official looking staff member with a walkie talkie. He seemed appalled and had a bottle of wine and dessert sent our room later which was nice but it all could have been avoided with the right staffing and customer service. Our 3day reservation was actually two reservations because we added an additional night prior to our arrival at a slightly higher rate due to the fact we added it later. We alerted the front desk guy when we checked in to please combine the reservations so the transition to the 3rd night would be seamless. We assumed that any logistics associated with the arrangement would be handled. After several hours at the Field Museum we came back to our room on the second day to discover our room keys no longer worked. We had to trudge all the way back down to the front desk to be met by front desk staff who sort of shrugged her shoulders and apologized stating it should have been handled by someone else. The lobby and rooms in the hotel are dated and a bit threadbare. It was notable that there is a charger to the very first iPhone model attached to the television stand. Ugh. The one experience we had that was typical Ritz level of service was from the concierge named John D He made a dinner reservation for us and then texted me confirmation of the reservation and also slipped a confirmation card under the door of our room with a map to the restaurant attached. Bravo John D for being the one last vestige of excellent customer service at this property.

My initial impression was the valet parking. I parked right in front of the valet entrance. Two valets watched me park my car take my luggage out of my trunk and start wheeling my luggage towards the entrance. Finally one of the valets approached me and asked if I was valeting my car. Yes I am checking in for 3 nights I replied. For 68 night this was a very poor first impression. Check in was better. The clerk was pleasant and accommodated my request for a quiet room away from the elevators. The room looked and smelled clean. The bathroom was nice but no better than a typical 4 star hotel and definitely lacked the wow factor of a 5 star hotel like the Four Seasons. There was a glass half door for the combined shower tub and I nearly severed a toe the first time I tried to figure out how the half door worked. This is a definite safety concern. The shower controls were obtuse and not intuitive esp. for temperature adjustment. The water pressure was good. The king bed had two valleys on the sides and a raised plateau in the middle strongly suggesting where previous guests had slept repetitively. The room AC kept cycling on and off throughout the night and consequently I woke up multiple times feeling either too hot or too cold. Room service was good 2 out of the 3 mornings but on the second morning the server spilled my water all over my breakfast as he was taking the plates out of the warmer beneath the table.

I recently spent three nights at The Ritz Carlton Chicago. This visit was my first to this property and over all everything was what one would expect from the brand. While at the property I experienced the hotels restaurant the Club Lounge and the spa. Details are available below. The Hotel and its Location. The hotel is part of Water Tower Place a mixed use development that was built in the 1970s. The location is great for being in the middle of world class shopping and tourist attractions. The John Hancock tower is on one side of the building and the historic water tower is on the other. Within a few blocks of the hotel are Neiman Marcus Saks Fifth Avenue Blomingdales and Barneys New York. Along the way you will also find Walgrens Best Buy Macys and boutiques from the likes of Burberry Louis Vuiton Hermes Tom Ford Prada etc. Naturally this location comes with lots of tourists and foot traffic but the crowds are manageable. The building itself presents one issue that a traveler visiting the hotel should know about the floors are uneven. For whatever reason this building has settled in a way that leaves floors and ceilings with noticeable slopes. When we entered our suite we could feel gravity leading us to the low corner of the room. The effect is like when one enters an old house that has shifted over the years. But when one considers that this building is a 74story skyscraper the sloping floors can be a bit disconcerting. I got used to it but I think people should know. My only real issue with the hotel was its elevators which are small and frequently full. On more than one occasion when trying to leave our floor we would have to wait for 2 or 3 elevators before one stopped that had any room. Those who had spent time in the hotel quickly learned to squeeze in whenever an elevator looked like it had any room at all because the wait for an empty car usually lasted several minutes. If I were staying in the hotel and trying to make meetings on time I would allow an additional 5\u201310 minutes just to get on an elevator. The RomWe booked a Water Tower Suite because it was advertised as having two full bathrooms. Though this suite does not offer one of the larger floor plans among the other suites it does have two full bathrooms a necessity for some travelers. The suites at this property were recently renovated \u2014 as were the hallways and exterior doors. Carpets were new and in good condition as were wall coverings and art pieces. Some of the furniture seemed to be from the rooms previous design older and worn but everything was thoughtfully arranged and in working order. Likewise some light switches were modern new and others were from years past. And the exterior doors which were modern and quite pleasing to see and touch on the outside were old and looked like something from a 1980s motel on the inside see image. I was not particularly bothered by this Jekyl and Hyde design but it did seem odd to update a suite and one side of its door but not the other. I am sure that renovations happen in phases so maybe the doors will be updated soon. Our suite was on the 22nd floor and offered views of the historic water tower John Hancock Tower and high rises across the street. The master bathroom was completely new and the second bathroom was mostly renovated it still had the old floor wall tile bath tub and toilet but new countertop sink and fixtures. Some fixtures in the master bathroom were loose the shower knob came off in my hand but a quick call to the front desk got those items tightened back the way they should be. Both bathrooms were spotlessly clean and well maintained throughout our stay. The room featured a cozy living room off the main entry and a bedroom which could be closed off via frosted glass doors. Each room had a large window and marble ledge. The bedroom had a desk and chair and each room had a TV. Storage in the suite was above average when both closets and all the shelves and drawers were considered. As with the bathrooms the living spaces were well maintained and clean. Housekeeping did a great job and interactions with the people working in the room were friendly. The beds and linens were typical of The Ritz Carlton and the room was quiet and comfortable. We slept well without disruption or excessive noise from the streets below. The Club LoungeThis property recently opened a new Club Lounge which is on the 15th floor. The lounge is large and has a pleasing layout that features various alcoves and rooms. The general design is reminiscent of a 1960s mod style. Cookies and candies are available in jars and an electric wine station allows guests to sample various bottles before committing to larger pours. Food presentations happened as with other properties lounges and the quality of everything was very good. Traffic in the Lounge was light so we never felt crowded. The staff of the Club Lounge definitely excelled in providing an inviting hospitable experience. The manager Joseph was frequently on hand and was happy to help with requests for dining spa treatments etc. Kyle Ricardo Anna Sarah and Bill were extremely friendly and went out of their ways to converse with guests refill drinks and make sure that the room was neat and tidy. They greeted us by name and they were quick to offer us the things that they \u2019d seen us eating and drinking before. These people are doing a great job and I hope they are recognized by the hotel for their unwavering service. The SpaIn desperate need of a massage I decided to have Joseph help me book an 80minute session in the hotels spa. Joseph explained that the spa was undergoing some renovations so the mens side of the facility did not have a steam room or sauna. I really just wanted a massage and place to relax so I was fine with this arrangement. The entrance to the spa seemed typical of other properties spas but the rest was a little hit and miss. The mens area is shared by residents who live above the hotel so the experience was less like a spa and more like \u2014 a locker room. The tops of the lockers were lined with old pairs of tennis shoes presumably belonging to those who maintain lockers there and most of the lockers had personalized name plates on them. Three shower stalls were available \u2014 and under heavy use with all the tenants coming and going. Though clean the stalls were not what one experiences at a typical spa. These were showers of utility not luxury. Aside from the stray dressing bench there were no seats and no relaxation area in which to wait for a massage. Once I was showered and in my robe I stuck my out of the locker room and asked someone where I should wait. She invited me to have a seat in the main hallway which leads from the spa entrance to the locker rooms to the nail salon. So while I waited in a bathrobe for a massage two people sat next to me in their street clothes while waiting for manicures and hair appointments. Treatments at a property like this one come at a premium because of the amenities for waiting relaxing so charging resort prices for an everyday experience is a bit of a problem that the hotel needs to resolve. Within a few minutes my therapist Amy came to get me. She led me to the therapy room which was right across from where I had been sitting. I was worried about noise coming in from the hallway but the room was well insulated and reasonably serene. Inside the room was spacious and similar to those from other Ritz Carlton spas. For those who need an intuitive therapist with strong pressure I can not recommend Amy highly enough. She asked me about my problems and quickly got to work. She checked in with me several times about her pressure and she was efficient and \u2014. it bears repeating \u2014 intuitive. Some therapists have a standard routine that they perform so when they have spent a few minutes in one area they move on regardless of how many knots might have been there. Amy worked her way around and came back to problem areas multiple times. She worked everywhere but still gave special attention to my aching back. I did not have to explain to her where tight sore spots were she found them on her own and did a great job working on them. Amy is gifted and I recommend her highly. If you \u2019re looking for a tranquil spa experience that allows you to rest between treatments or have a steam soak this spa is n\u2019t the place for you. But if you just need an excellent massage you \u2019l be fine. The RestaurantThe hotel \u2019s restaurant is right off the main lobby and offers good people watching. The hotel \u2019s bar is in the same area and offers light bites and drinks. I was going to sit in the bar area for a snack but the room had TVs everywhere so I ran back to the restaurant. Service in the restaurant was exceptional. Tomas took great care of my orders and Michael kept my water glass full and seemed genuinely interested in my dining experience. The food was good and everyone around me seemed to be enjoying a nice meal. I mentioned several times that hotel has been undergoing renovations and I believe those will continue. I was told that the property will be closing for the month of January to make significant changes to the lobby and check in area not sure if this is really the case. These areas are certainly nice as they are but they do feel a bit dated \u2014 especially compared to the newly designed Club Lounge. I \u2019m sure that all of the amenities will gain a similar look and feel and that this hotel will continue to serve discerning travelers well. On the whole this property offers convenience luxurious accommodations and gracious staff.

I just can not say enough about how impressed I was. oh I forgot to mention how well situated it was for restaurants and shops along and near to Michigan Avenue the Magnificent Mile. with the hotel the service of all members of the staff and especially that of Josephine. we have never had such wonderful care and service in a hotel in any part of the world we have traveled to.

You do not need to go outside. this hotel is in a great location Right on Michigan Ave. Right in the middle of everything. Seriously can not ask for a better locationThe service is impeccable. The front desk receptionist the concierge and the club lounge personnel were FANTASTIC.

I managed to book this hotel as part of a flight package for work which was nice since we were meeting at the hotel for drinks and having never stayed at a Ritz Carlton before I was excited for the opportunity. I found it quite strange that upon arriving through the revolving doors from my UBER ride I had to take the elevator up to the 12th floor to get to the lobby. I found this strange because everything on the ground floor indicated that I was walking up to and into a Ritz Carlton hotel. This was a little disappointing and much less grand than I was hoping for. Anyway up to the 12th floor and the doors open to a very open and luxuriant lobby. Finding the check in desk was a tiny bit confusing since it was at the complete opposite end of the room to the elevators and there were directions to multiple other places like the room elevators the bar gym restaurant etc. Either way I \u2019m not wholly bothered by any of this it was just a bit fidly from entrance to check in. Check in 610Once at the check in area I waited for a brief moment while the person in front checked out. A lovely lady whose name I forget at this time sorry helped me out and turns out after looking at my driving license address that she was new to Chicago and came from where I had departed that day. It was quieter so we chatted for a little while about old home and new home but eventually we ended our conversation and she showed me to the room elevators although I had already seen where these were en route to checking in. One thing I would say is that the communication from the staff was perhaps a little casual for a 5 check in but I was fine with this. Room 810Having arrived at about 4 pm I wanted to make the most of what was going to be a very comfortable room an executive suite. My reservation showed a Michigan Avenue view but as it turned out I walked into a big corner room with views of Michigan Avenue and the John Hancock Building. I always do a quick walkthrough when I get to my room and everything was in place and well appointed. I did n\u2019t see any personalisation on the tv which is sometimes quite nice to have but I was n\u2019t here to watch tv. I was overwhelmed by the views there were 3 large windows 1 in the sitting room and 2 in the corner bedroom. The seats in the sitting room were comfortable but the bed itself was the most comfortable I \u2019ve ever laid in so I was excited for a good nights sleep. There was however a large flat screen tv atop a chest of drawers awkwardly positioned in the corner somewhat overlapping one of the windows. The room itself was a little basic and outdated but nicely appointed and comfortable. The bathroom though that was top notch top notch looking at least. Bathroom 710Everything was laid out nicely I had 1 dressing gown since it was just me staying multiple towels hanging in lots of convenient places and there was also a nice selection of bathroom supplies. The lighting in the bathroom was nice too especially in the walk in shower. The toilet was clean and operated well it was a basic toilet though. I tried the shower out and the switch changing the flow of water to from the tap shower was fidly and would n\u2019t say out for the shower to work so I jimmy rigged a wedge to keep it out. This was frustrating because I \u2019m no inspector gadget I could n\u2019t quite fix it with what I had. Eventually I kept pulling it out and held it out long enough that I could enjoy the very large shower head. Temperature control was easy and water flow was perfect. This shower was lovely to be in it was big enough and high quality enough that I could just stand in it staring out the bedroom window through the open bathroom door. Do n\u2019t worry I \u2019m quite sure that no one could see inIn room dining 710I wanted to enjoy a nice morning sunrise looking out to the huge lake next door but it appears that I was quite turned around and could n\u2019t tell north from east. Oh well I still had my breakfast ordered for 615 which eventually arrived at 620 so pretty darn close well within the normal 15minute window. Since I was up already I managed to get to the door after he had rung the doorbell a feature I loved about this room. Esteban took over the door holding duties and pulled in the cart with my breakfast. It smelled very good. He asked where I wanted to eat but correctly assumed that I would eat in the sitting room facing the John Hancock Building and a large part of the lake. The food was good albeit the bacon was a little overdone and crispy. I had the poached eggs with hollandaise hash browns and corn cakes which was all delicious along with a glass of iced water and a small carafe of coffee. I took my time as the sun was slowly rising to the east of me. I had figured where I was facing by this time. To be expected it was expensive. 40 all in but it had to be done since I was without my wife and kids this time. Ordering food for 4 hungry mouths in the morning with in room dining is never cheap so we do n\u2019t usually do it. Conclusion 2840I was just here for the night so I did n\u2019t get to fully experience the hotel amenities rooftop bar gym pool massages etc. so I ca n\u2019t comment on them but I \u2019m sure they were of a high standard. I did however manage to leave my credit card at the bar after signing off the night before having enjoyed a Lagavulin 16year Menu price 20 billed price 22 so a is match here which should be addressed by management. Needless to say the staff were great and as I was checking out they asked if I had received my card back to which I replied \u201c no \u201d. They called security and arranged for them to bring it up to me. After checking out I sat in the comfy looking chairs in the lobby thinking about what I was going to do next. After the security guy came up and handed over my card after checking I was who I was suggesting I was I walked over the elevators and went down 12 floors to go out for the day. In the meantime I had left my bag at check in and was handed a ticket and told that upon my return the bag would be downstairs with the bellhop. All in all this was a very pleasant stay and I \u2019m betwixt between 3 or 4 for this place but upon my experience with the staff and general quality of the furnishings and food I am leaning towards 4. There were a few niggling details but these did n\u2019t affect my stay. I would certainly come here again and I \u2019m sure that my wife and kids would love to next time as well.", "offset": [5012, 5148], "date": "2019-09-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "d47d1944-b312-41e3-a7ed-d5b69e5accc9", "sentence": "A Nice Spot.

We had two rooms and the hotel is in an excellent location and is truly walkable to all dining and restaurants needed. We ate at Wildbery right out front of the entrance for breakfast so that was nice and convenient. The staff was accommodating and friendly and they were quick to address and apologize for a cleanliness issue. They surprised my dad with a small birthday cake and card which was really thoughtful. The lobby is on the 12th floor which is different but it \u2019s really nice and well decorated. The views from the rooms are amazing.
