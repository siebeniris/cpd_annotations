Check in process was smooth and quick. Was upgraded to the next level room being a Taj Inner Circle Member. However was not impressed with the room even though it is quite big. The carpet was smelling and we requested the housekeeping to remove it from the room. The linen had blood stains and had to get that changed too. The towels in the bathroom too had stains and had to get them replaced too. The bathroom was big too however the fittings were all very old and seriously need to be upgraded. Or maybe the room is kept in this way to cater to the people who like the old lokThe hotel restaurant is quite good though breakfast. Lunch dinner wal all nice. The hotel location gives it an advantage being close to Express Avenue mall. However would have second thoughts about staying here again unles there is some good renovation done.", "offset": [154, 222], "date": "2015-06-26 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "9bfcf17e-d1cd-4504-a737-da0891ea840e", "sentence": "Gr8 Ambience Huge Well Maintained Heritage Property.

The Taj Conemara is a palace of white marble awaiting the weary traveler in the hot and dusty city of Chennai. Service was exemplary staff were extremely attentive. I do n\u2019t know if I was luckily given a suite or if rooms are just large but the room I had was sumptuous. The bed was a California king with the finest linens. Downsides were the room had so many switches it was ridiculous. Over 15 light switches. In my haste to get to bed I inadvertently switched a switch with tiny writing that said \u201c do not disturb \u201d the next evening I returned to my room to find my bed unmade. My fault I guess I did n\u2019t read the small print. There were two 50 inch flat screens but getting them to work was something between a divine art and an enormous waste of time. Breakfast was very good although I suspect the dinner restaurant that is part of the hotel but next door gave me a bad stomach upset. Food was spicy and good just wish it had been hygienic its the only place I ate before the stomach issues hit. I did not suffer such issues at other 5 star hotels. Rooms were quiet.

This is a colonial era hotel in central chennai that has recently gone through a renovation and rebranding from a business hotel to the more appropriate heritage and hospitality forcus it has now. The staff is great and really welcome you. The heritage wing is really that. The wooden staircase and the hallways feel from a different era. And the rooms are charming with antique furniture but also modern amenities. One reviewer found the renovation to be incomplete in his room but I \u2019ve stayed there twice since the renovation once in what they call the luxury wing and once in the heritage. Both were renovated though with a different focus. The heritage rooms they are preserving the charm and antique furniture. The rooms in the \u201d luxury \u201d wing are larger and that part of the building dates from the 1970s and have modern furnishings. I prefer the heritage rooms for their charm and quiet isolation from the road. The luxury room did get a lot more sunlight due to larger outside facing windows but that also seemed to tax the a c a bit as far as I was concerned. The heritage room I stayed in did have a smaller window looking out to a shaded garden area on the side of the hotel but that was fine for me.", "offset": [374, 450], "date": "2019-06-30 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "1800688c-d227-4e16-a6b1-087897063d72", "sentence": "The musty room smell was very overwhelming.

Due to work we checked into hotel only at around 7 PM Out of the two rooms one was emanating heavy smoke smell although it was a non smoking room. Immediately we informed the same after one of Your representative personally visited and sensed the same told she would arrange another room. But after around 45 mins asked us to check the room again they sprayed room refresher and that smell was too much dominant I had a 3 years old infant so I disagreed to take the room and requested for another room. She tried to convince us to take the same room repeatedly but I refused. Then we went out for dinner and got another room in another floor upon return around 10 pm. Before giving rooms please check it thoroughly if is good enough for Your patrons to stay2. While booking the heritage room it showed the area as 64 Sq. Mt but in person I saw it is hardly around 250 sq. feet. It is the worst form of advertising did not expect from the reputed concern like TAJ3. We have ordered for a 1 KG cake one day in advance in person at the restaurant and Informed them we would pick it up by 120 noon on 21st July. When I went to the restaurant at 1 pm I was asked to wait for around 45 minutes. I was told the cake was ready but the box to pack the same is not available and they are searching for it. 4.
