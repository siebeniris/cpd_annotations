We were in Philadelphia for a conference. I had my mother 1 year old child and small dog with me. Upon arrival at 1030pm on a Wednesday there was no valet. I checked in with a woman who I do not think smiled the entire time. I told her I had a dog which was noted in my reservation. At that point it would have been helpful for her to tell me where I could take my dog to relieve herself. No. She maybe said 6 words the entire time. I wandered around in the dark to find a patch of grass for her. The bellman was very helpful and took our luggage to the room. I was then expected to park the car in the garage by myself which was dark and had no other people in it. It also had a fire alarm going off for at least 20 minutes while I was in there which means if you scream no one can hear you. We were on the 7th floor. It was dark and smelly. There were stains on the carpet in the hall. The room stunk of stale smoke to the point I did not want my child in there. The comforters had some yellow stains on them. The window sills were constantly wet with moisture. I did request a refrigerator and they delivered it right away and the gentleman that brought it was friendly. The two stars are mostly for the housekeeper. She was extremely nice checking on my mom and child frequently.

Fair enough sometimes those thing happen. I did a pre reg a hotel verbiage meaning doing everything the hotel needs and just waiting for key to a clean room and give her my cell phone number to call if a room gets cleaned. Make things short at 3 pm we came back to hotel and was given a room but my complain is no one even informed us that there were rooms cleaned and ready and I am sure this was not the 1st room cleaned. In the hotel I worked at we take responsibility to fulfill guest requests. Also the hotel really needs renovations big time cracked marble in bathroom frayed carpets in hallway and room etc and their staffs need to be retrained in hospitality business such as making eye contact with guests acknowledging guests in front of you even if you can not help at that moment friendliness smiling under promise but over deliver.
