Betrayed by stupid decisions. We managed essentially four side trips two official culture tour local culture expert chocolate factory art gallery nice and rum factory fort market and city and two via local bus Ardastra Zoo and a trip to downtown Nassau. Things that went very well All travel arangments were good. Seats were good. Pickups happened. Side trips were good. Hotel was very clean with very helpful staff. Pools bars beach were very nice. Three of the four special restaurants were very good. Buffet much better than acceptable. And with nice service. The main buffet was pretty good with some variety plus an egg station at breakfast and sometimes meat slicers at dinner. When we arrived we were advised to book the Italian restaurant for dinner asap. Turns out the main buffet is closed Mondays. Good advice. When we asked for a room change they did it asap and moved the bags while we went on to do other things. Porter left one room key in the room afterward P had her own so it all worked out. When we asked for a second chair on the balcony 689. they provided two. A bit of overkill but the second chair was much appreciated. WiFi was very slow but after querying why the phone DLS did not work WiFi got 10 100 times faster in the same place in the same room. Quite usable. My netbok uses the old protocol. The corridor to 689 is a thermal experience. Some of it is exposed with half sanded large windows. Oddly as we approached our room it always got cooler no outside windows in last corridor which is long even on the last leg. We did NOT use the A C as the room temperature was perfectly acceptable noticably but not exesively cooler than outside. One time the AC had been turned on maids I guess. and I turned it off. this is a first for meWater pressure in 689 is very good. In 917 it was a trickle. Things that could should have been beterWestJet meal pre order is unhelpful. Their website gave me an unclear error. I used contact us at least twice and received no response. Apparently you can not pre order a meal until a rather short time before takeoff. Then the same reservation code simply worked. The airport pickup was weird. Most pickups had names on cards. We saw nothing with our name and nothing with Majestic either. When we asked where Majestic was we were pointed to a person far down the airport outside wall who Now held up a Majestic sign. We asked specifically for a quiet room and were assigned 917 in the East wing. This room is adjacent to and shares a wall with. some equipment with large cylinders going brm brm brm all the time. We requested a move and were put into 689 in the West wing. While at the end of an even longer corridor I had not thought this possible. it was quiet and had a much nicer view a bit of the beach could be seen from the balcony. The alarm clock in the room is tricky to set I must have left the switch between positions at least once as it did not go off. On the last day there was a power outage at roughly 50 am so the rooms alarm clock was counting forward from then as midnight. Fortunately I always set our own travel clock for a bit later just in case. The tapas bar service is terrible the noisy six beside us had four beer refills before we were even considered. Even worse the conch fritters were soggy and we were both sick afterwards. Please make up room now sign does not work. They were just a few rooms away when we left and waited till we returned over an hour later to interrupt us. sigh. On Friday the phone stopped working. Despite repeated promises it was never fixed. On November 8 Sunday for no apparent reason an entire linen and towel change plus an iron were placed as a stack on our bed the one we clearly were using. P put this on top of the safe in the closet. Weird. Either change the linen or do not do not give us a stack. One last thing the hotel website clearly says entertainment nightly. There was none the entertainment area was I assume behind the plywood panels hiding construction of some sort. P points out that the insurance policy number was only on an eMail was very small and we were expected to write it ourselves onto our wallet cards. This could easily have been missed was not on the terms and conditions and imho designed to avoid paying claims. This on the most expensive insurance as a percent of trip cost I have ever seen. we will be using either CIBC or VISA insurance unles the cost of alternatives is both reasonable and reasonably easy for ordinary humans to collect on. Net and Overall ImpresionI calculate cost per person week for every trip. This was a bit more expensive than Saint Lucia and there we did four extensive side trips. On the other hand it is quite comparable with our Guatemala trip and there we had a refund. Decent value for money. We chose Nassau for shorter flight and pleasant experience. We were NOT disappointed. Cost was not a major factor in the decision except to prefer Nassau Bahamas over Bermuda where the breakfast plan is absurdly expensive for just six breakfastsThe hotel is very good with the tiny exceptions noted above. Staff are friendly helpful effective. In checking out the attractions I think we saw most of those that would interest us. So while I would heartily recommend this destination and this hotel it is unlikely we would return unles we really needed to simply veg out with no side trips. I feel the same way about St Lucia Jamaica and Guatemala as well. Very good. Seen itFinal Comment. The manager had no control over the missing phone despite several promises to fix it. They lied to us. Service comes from outside and they do not ask for it for one room. Promises over the weekend were nonsense. This is a nice hotel. With a nice beach. With a sea that is well active. With three pools. With good restaurants if you do not sit next to six boisterous clients and do not really expect conch fritters to be crisp and cooked. With good side trips. Net Net Betrayed. Betrayed by not understanding that your machine room is not next to a quiet one. Betrayed by toxic food in the tapas restaurant. Betrayed by a phone that never got fixed and that we now realize is probably not fixed now. Sad. A Very Nice Hotel with Very NIce dedicated staff with great service everywhere.

First of all if you are expecting a Sandals. please book at Sandals. I have stayed at them and they are great. We like a little less formal and love the Melia Paradisus Properties so this was a nice option. Also please know these staff are amazingly hard working and incredibly friendly. Everyone from check in and all levels of service welcomed us even just in passing. So PLEASE TIP. The minimum wage in the Bahamas is about 3 hour. it is an incredibly expensive country to live in as everything has to be shipped in. So something as simple as Milk is 8 to 10. If you can afford to go please put a bit extra in your budget to share with these hardworking people. Room. Get a Level Suite. The space is worth it for sure. We had the most amazing views see attached. Two balconies and two bathrooms made everything just over the top great. The bed was comfy. The room immaculately clean. Kudos to housekeeping as I am picky and it met exceeded my expectations. We always had towels and the mini bar well stocked. Actually they even brought a few of the things we asked for. Everything was in great order and we could not be happier with our room. The Level. There have been good and bad comments about this. We felt it was worth the money. The Level Beach has nice amenities and we are beach people. So loungers daybeds bar service right to your lounger towel service food service was all part of the Level beach service. Loved it. Also the level has a private check in and check out lounge. You will appreciate this if you see the lineups downstairs at the front desk. You bypass all of that. There is a lounge and bar for the Level guests with top level drinks and appetizers. We enjoyed meeting people from all over the world and the bartender is a hoot. The Level also offers preferred dinner reservations. If you want the a la carte restaurants at a good time you will like this perk for sure. The resort is indeed 40 years old and Melia only took it over in 2013. Then the recession hit North America and tourism suffered in the Bahamas. They are renovating rooms and the property on an on going basis. We never heard anyt construction noise etc but did see the workers behind the scenes painting fixing renovating upgrading rooms etc. I think this will be a work in progress for the next year or two. They are getting there though. A few things to consider We like late room service and theirs ends at 11 pm. last order at 1030pm. The menu and selection is great. Just would be nice to have it later. Other Melia and Paradisus have 24 hour room service in the Royal or upgraded sides. The fitness area is large and well equipped with never equipment. So if that is important to you you will enjoy their facilities. This is close to the airport. On a white sandy beach and lovely. There is a bus that stops at the bottom of the stairs out front and takes you to town. with all the other tourists from the resorts on Cable Beach. It is only 125 and takes you right downtown to all of the attractions. Any challenges we did have were quickly taken care of by the level staff. They really understand customer service and we enjoyed our time here. We felt their hospitality went above and beyond most other places we have stayed.

Once I did I was told the only way I could make a change to my reservation was via email. no one else had the ability. About 10 days later I finally heard back from someone. The price difference per day if I had booked the level room originally was only 90 per day more. However they are now asking me for more than double that amount. I asked if I could get a refund and rebok the level room to save myself a few hundred dollars and was told no.

I booked this vacation as a surprise tripFor my boyfriend for our 1 year anniversary. I booked a thur sun package in the levelSection. We arrived and went to check in at the level office they had a person working in an area where there are 2 desks. So we had to wait a little bit while two couples ahead of us were checked in. Not a big deal however there were 2Couples after us so I can imagine their wait would be a bit annoying considering it would have been quicker to check in downstairs. The level area is good if you want to get some quiet work done or get a latte or higher end drink where you serve yourself. A couple snacks were available like lunchmeat. Smoked salmon and veggies and fruit. Our room was ready at 12 Which was a pleasant surprise as we had been traveling since 4 am. Prior to arriving at the melia I had emailed them to ask for a room closest to the ocean and newly renovated if possible as it was our anniversary trip. Upon opening the door the room was newly renovated and had a very large balcony with two sliding doors. We also had two double beds. I had emailed them later that day in regards to this issue but never heard back From anyone so we slept in separate beds the 3 nights we were here. The room is renovated yes is it worth the price it is listed at. Definitely not. The floor is like a giant placemat type material and is already stained with red giant drops of something. The washroom is clean and newer but you ca n\u2019t fit two people inside to get ready at same time. The balcony does n\u2019t make any sense. Yes I have a very big balcony but we ca n\u2019t sit outside because we just look directly at the cement wall that encloses it. Maybe they should buy bar height chairs with a round table so we can possibly enjoy our ocean view rather than standing against the railing. We did n\u2019t come here to spend time in room however it \u2019s prob the worst room layout and value I have ever had. The hallways are also something out of the movie the shining I would seriously be afraid walking Down these hallways at night without my boyfriend. There were 3 connecting hallways to get to my room and it just was n\u2019t what I had envisioned for a tropical resort experience. The fod the marketplace is really lacking as a buffet. I \u2019ve been to 30 all inclusive and I never have an issue finding something to eat but here the breakfast is limited and cold and lunch was even worst. We chose to eat at ogril for breakfast as level guests and lunch. The food was much beter the breakfast was actually very good. The theme restaurants are just ok. They have basically 2 aps 3 4 mains as choice which is mind blowing as I could n\u2019t really find anything I enjoyed at either cilantro or nikei. We left the resort on our last night and went to the twisted lime which was a neat spot to check out. Also the twisted lime is a good place to go to escape the resort atmosphere and you get to experience a local restaurant. The food is n\u2019t anything spectacular but it \u2019s still beautiful to eat outside on a deck that overhangs the water and you can see the fish swimming under youThe level beach I \u2019ve always upgraded to the best package however I do n\u2019t really see a point in upgrading at this resort other than for the better breakfast. The beach service is a joke. The first day I could n\u2019t get a drink or food menu for 2 hours. Other people were being served and then the server would n\u2019t look around to see if anyone else wanted anything and then would run off somewhere and be gone for 25Minutes. I finally got the attention of one guy and asked him for a menu and the look on his face was one of pure confusion and disgust. It was like I had asked him a seriously perverted question. Luckily the couple he was serving passed me their menu and then the man never came back to take my order. Finally a guy named Jordan asked me if I would like anything. He was the only person on this entire 4 day trip who asked if we wanted anything. I could have saved a lot of money booked an ocean view room and walked to the bar once an hour and would have been much hapier and possibly brought my protein shake mix and had a better breakfast experience than that the marketplaceOfers. I have been to Bahamas twice before staying at Atlantis and I realize you can not compare the two worlds however I thought bahamas had some standards but clearly not the melia is a 3 star at best and I am truly disappointed and embarrassed that I brought my bf here for our anniversary.

We came back 2 hours later and still no room was available Manager Seion originally related no room would be available until Sunday 772019. Once again we told him we could not stay in a room that had mildew he assigned us another Room 874 gave us Level privileges to the beach and breakfast and a 250 credit for the hotel restaurant and souvenir shop. Okay that was good. At Room 874 every time it rained water was coming through and soaking the rug. Now we understood why the previous room had a bad smell it was probably the same problem. We were very concerned about the effect of the wet rug causing mildew and the water on the terrace. On 782019 we spoke to manager Angelia about this problem She was going to inquire about getting us a one day compensation for the problems we encountered. On Tuesday my cousin came back to the room from the beach and a man was on our terrace on the telephone. My cousin panicked thinking we were being robbed. The man explained that he was from maintenance to fix the water leak. Apparently the terrace was not caulked correctly which allowed water to come under the terrace and seep into the carpet. Although it was necessary for the leak to be fixed we should have been notified that someone would be coming to our room. The manager Angelia had my cell number email and a message could have been left on our room phone. No guest should walk in and find a strange person in her his room. We then got a visit from Pinder and Salvadore who came to check that the caulking was done properly. The caulking was done but nothing was done to clean the rug which still was wet. After our initial two contacts with Angelia she was then out of the office on 7102019 so we spoke to Camila. We are still waiting to hear about our compensation. The ridiculous. We ordered room service but they forgot to send up utensils the Caesar salad consisted of 1 piece of iceberg lettuce two dressings on the side and a hard piece of bread.

When I asked for my second drink to be served without ice the waiter came to the table with a drink that had ice in it and poured the liquid into my glass which still had ice in it. When I questioned him about this he related that they are not allowed to bring a drink from the bar without ice. When asked how long we would have to wait for our food his response continued to be Shortly. He gave us the bill without ever asking if we wanted dessert so we left.

Rooms were overlooking pools and ocean and a beautiful view. The rooms had everything you needed and whilst our aircon worked beautifully not so much in our childrens room next door. As level guests you get a small fridge with a variety of drinks inside. Despite the fact we only drank one type of drink from the fridge you had think that s what they would re stock it with but NO. so thankfully as Level guests we could grab some from the fridge in that lounge each day as we walked by. Rooms are well maintained and ready each day as we came back in. Restaurants thank goodness for being a Level guest as they booked our dinner times for us other guests have to be queuing before 8 am each day to book for that night whereas Level guests can book 3 days in advance. Good choice of restaurants but the Angus Steak house is so expensive. Such a shame to make it like this which prevents many guests from going there as its such a beautiful restaurant great staff and food. Japanese again is excellent staff are brilliant and food is delicious. Cilantro both times we went in had to wait 30mins for table booking and then several dishes not available each time. Service varied in here. Aqua Italian again had to wait a considerable amount of time to get table and be served. Almost 45 mins on our second visit. Again items missing off the menu. Can understand once but on both visits. Service was poor in this restaurant. Market only visited twice for breakfast and again long queues. If staff got on and cleared tables quicker the queues would be less. Definite attitude of some staff in this restaurant and really unhelpful. Such a shame as great food and could be easily rectified which better management. Outside BQ lady WOW. works her socks off and food is excellent. Bars by far our favourite and big shout out to the Dicenzo on the bar outside the restaurants as they were the best. Level Beach a special area designated just for Level guests and has comfy sunbeds own towel hut and drinks service. Beds are great and good location for all. Loved it down here everyday but two problems that again could be easily solved to make this space perfect. we have been to lots of all inclusive that nail this. Each day the beds were dirty you had to waste one towel cleaning them down of debris sand etc before you could lie your towels down. Staff are outside working just add this into the tasks. Towels ran out frequently. its a Caribbean island you have rainstorms every day. the towels get soaked you should have enough towels or a laundry that can deal with this. Go to the Atlantis it has towels for hotel guests water park guests cruise ship guests. AND IT does not RUN OUT. Buy more if necessary. we went one day asking at all towel huts and even at 5 pm could not get one so had to pad back through hotel to rooms. wet. Level drinks service. you either had two of them working the beach at the same time for about 30 mins or nothing for 2 hours and you ended up walking and getting your own drinks due to dehydration I am not joking. most of the time they are sitting in their hut on their phones FACTSuch a shame as this hotel has the actual potential to be amazing but it falls short on so many sides. Its a 3 star and no more. I could write so much more but its depressing to be so negative. LEVEL STAFF are brilliant and help you with everything so big shout out to them.", "offset": [337, 434], "date": "2019-07-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "85442807-c160-4d17-9006-ee882daa7f19", "sentence": "Worst hotel in Nasua stay away. We have stayed at several Melia resorts in the past and at the Atlantis in Nassau before and never have we stayed at such a poorly maintained and managed hotel. Beyond the level of filth all over this hotel the lack of customer service makes this hotel a waste of money. Stay next door at the Baha Mar the rates are about the same and the resort is far better. Not only was the hotel disgusting it did not feel safe the food quality was poor and the customer service almost did not exist. For example the room next received room service at 1230 AM or at least the kitchen thought they did. because when the food was delivered they knocked kicked and yelled at the door for 15 minutes while no one answered. Instead of calling the room when someone did not answer they woke the entire hallway up by banging and kicking on the door to deliver the food. This is just one of several ridiculous encounters during our stay. The room smelled it was so dirty that we had to wear shoes instead of walking on the damp carpet the lock on the door was broken off the shampoo bottle had been refilled several times and looked too gross to even touch. The fridge was empty and broken the safe was broken we often did not have wash rags or other towels without calling for them. The hotel really does need to be closed for renovations too much needs to be done and not while people are vacationing. The noise and constant construction really takes away from the relaxing beach views.", "offset": [1170, 1295], "date": "2019-09-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "f0562019-5fdd-4e1b-b830-1fe4c3724b61", "sentence": "Perfect Honeymoon. We stayed at the Melia for our honeymoon this past week and LOVED it. Do n\u2019t let some of these negative reviews steer you away. This is NOT a club med or Sandals \u201c luxury \u201d resort it \u2019s a clean high traffic beach resort at a great price point. If you \u2019re not bothered by a regular old shower head or if the hallway paint is chipped this place is amazing. I \u2019ve never understood why some reviews show close ups of sink pipesWe\u2019l start with the location a quick 15 minute bus ride to downtown 150 one way to get to the fish fry or straw market areas. A cab is about 18 for 2 people so take the bus if it \u2019s before 5 pm. Always felt safe in this area both on the resort and around the shops just outside as well. The Daiquiri shack is directly across the street and has a fun vibe. Also right next to Baha Mar with a free shuttle. The resort is directly on the beach which is a huge plus. Also close to the airport about 10 minutes. There is not shuttle included here but we arranged for a paid shuttle before we arrived. There are also taxis outside the resort which the staff will help you get if need be. The food I \u2019ve never been to an all inclusive before so I ca n\u2019t really compare. The food was just OK to me. But I was n\u2019t there for the food so it did n\u2019t bother me at all. There are plenty of options although the restaurant menus have a more \u201c hip \u201d vibe than what we typically go for but we still found something we liked each night. Reservations can be tough to get especially when it \u2019s busy. If you \u2019ve upgraded to the level you can email 5 days in advance for reservations. Otherwise the buffet is just fine. Different choices each night. If when we return we \u2019d likely stick with the buffet dinner Aqua Italian and maybe Cilantro Mexican. We had lunch on the beach every day since we upgraded to the Level. Burgers were great my wife enjoyed the shrimp as well. The rooms we loved our room. We had an amazing view it was clean and we had fresh towels daily and plenty of bottled water. Like I said before if you \u2019re not worried about minor details we are n\u2019t. the rooms are everything you need for a relaxing stay. The activities we mostly just wanted to park our butts on the beach and relax so we did n\u2019t participate much in the day time activities but there was always something going on by the pool. We did take part in a mixology class which was fun. We all got to go behind the bar and make a cocktail of our choosing. DJs karaoke dancing at night In the lobby bar and a fire show were all great too. There are floats and snorkels to use for free on the beach which was great. If you \u2019re looking for excursions there are people walking the beach daily you can book with or find one online. The Level. I personally found this upgrade worth it. You get top shelf liquor quicker private check in and out wait service on the beach drinks and lunch a private lounge discount at the steakhouse and priority reservations. You also have a separate beach area with covered cabanas beds and lounge chairs. The other section of the beach I noticed had no shade or umbrellas so if you \u2019re someone that needs the shade consider the Level. Since it was our honeymoon we sprung for this upgrade and I \u2019m glad we did. We did n\u2019t have to lift a finger. The staff The people working at Meli\u00e1 seriously made our honeymoon amazing. Check in was a breeze and our luggage met us in our room without a problem. Our rooms were always cleaned and fresh towels morning AND night. Frederick was the funniest bartender and super attentive. He had drinks ready for us as soon as he saw us comingAl of the waitstaf on the Level beach are seriously amazing. They bust their butts making sure everyone has what they need. Melinda took care of us every day she was working during our stay. Not only is she attentive but she is super friendly and just an all around great human being. Anything we needed whether it was drinks lunch or recommendations on places outside of the resort to visit she had us covered and always with a smileI\u2019ve seen some reviews stating the staff are not friendly. Maybe we interacted with different staff but we never had a problem. What we DID notice was a serious lack of respect toward the staff by some of the guests. Our first day there we watched a grown man throw a fit about chicken nuggets. I get it \u2019s frustrating when things do n\u2019t go as planned or when advertised amenities are not available to you. However this should n\u2019t be taken out on the staff who have ZERO control over the issues. It also helps to just be NICE to your bartenders and wait staff. They \u2019re humans too treat them that way. Also consider tipping when someone is running around all day so you do n\u2019t have to. It helps.", "offset": [263, 373], "date": "2019-11-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "389a5b09-4fc7-4bec-b0a8-75fcf23b898f", "sentence": "Bday Trip. I \u2019m very disappointed at how misleading this hotel is. Inclusive means all included but this hotel have a selection of things that are included and we were not informed at the hotel. It \u2019s apparent it depends on what type of room you book that depends on what you have access too. We switched rooms twice asking for a newer room that was worth the money we were paying the rooms are old. Top shelf liquor is not included with all inclusive only rail liquor. They charge a 10 room service delivery fee which is confusing because it \u2019s room service why am I being charged for a service that \u2019s also suppose to be all inclusive. The food from roof service was not that great i had a pizza and my friend had a turkey sandwich with fries that was just ok. The breakfast was ok u do get unlimited mimosas which were good. It \u2019s another restaurant on the resort that sells good lunch by the pool I enjoyed that. They have an Italian I believe Mexican and the steakhouse restaurant which I had dinner at and that was the best meal I had while there. The food was great and so was the service. I did n\u2019t have a problem with the staff my main issue is inclusive means everything not selected things. There \u2019s barely staff there at night such as people being available at the front desk or housekeeping just in case you may need them. The hotel is beautiful and clean I just did n\u2019t get a newer room.

Bottom Line definitely not a horrible resort but there is no reason to spend the money to go here when better cheaper options are available. Go to Mexico. We stayed for 8 days and met up with family who stayed for 7. Rooms are dated and covered in brown carpet that feels dirty despite having been cleaned. We also took some cleaning wipes from the gym to wipe down rusted towel bars in the bathroom. Bar fridges in the rooms were inconsistently restocked. Most days we had to call front desk to have water restocked. Daily housekeeping is fine but never seemed to give us the same service some days we \u2019d get a bath mat and two towels other days the bath mat was missing we \u2019d get three towels and no face clothes. Almost as if none of them were following a standardized checklist. Buffet had a decent selection of food but we found it often cold when we got back to our seats. Service there can be hit or miss. Some of the staff were very nice other times they seemed annoyed that they had to help you. A la carte \u2019s Cilantro and Nikei are pretty good though the hibachi at Nikei was n\u2019t as good as we \u2019ve experienced at other resorts. The tapas restaurant Esta Vida was Ok but service was almost always unfriendly and extremely slow. Keep in mind that Esta Vida is located in the main lobby front desk entertainment area so it \u2019s almost always too loud to actually hear anyone in your party speaking. Drinks everywhere on the resort are also inconsistent. You \u2019re not likely to order the same drink twice and have it taste the same both times. It \u2019s also extremely slow service at the beach bar. However Monique who provides drink service to the beach and pools is super friendly and helpful but because she covers such a large area you wo n\u2019t often see her. Again it \u2019s not a horrible resort. The beach is lovely although prepare to wake at 7 am to claim a palapa or umbrella and service is much better at the a la carte restaurants. It just does n\u2019t provide good bang for your buck and feels as if they \u2019ve cut corners to save money.", "offset": [485, 545], "date": "2020-02-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}]}
