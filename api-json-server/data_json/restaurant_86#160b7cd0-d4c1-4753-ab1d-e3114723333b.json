The best part of this resort is the staff. Friendly courteous helpful. There are plenty of restaurants activities seating areas and water sports available. Upon arrival we had to wait 15 minutes to check in. There was one person at the front desk and two couples in front of us. While waiting I noticed the two upholstered chairs in the lobby only two were worn and one was actually torn. Also the immense plants trees in the atrium next to the lobby looked as if they had n\u2019t been tended to in a year their leaves were brown and withered. Not what I expect for Ritz quality and price and not a good first visual while waiting. After finally checking in and being told our room was not ready 4 pm check in they said they had call us. This surprised me because we clearly observed that the hotel was about half full. We waited 2 hours went back to the front desk only to be told that the room had been ready for an hour. They had never called us. When we got to the room I was disappointed that there was no welcome bottle of wine or sweets for my husbands birthday I had notified them earlier. For the price we paid that is the least they could have done. However the room was well appointed comfy bed and pillows large bathroom contemporary furnishings. We stayed in the Eugenia building that is a bit further to the pool area with lots of steps. If you go ask to stay in Begonia Camilia or Dahlia buildings. Because the hotel was not at full capacity there were plenty of lounge chairs to choose from on the beach and at the pool. At one point my husband and I went to sit under one of three empty cabanas only to have a staff member tell us that the cabana could only be used reserved for 400 each per day. I found that offensive. We took a 10minute cab ride to Moes Market to pick up wine and snacks. I recommend doing this to save on the pricey menus and besides the fridge in the room is not stocked. Otherwise I do not recommend wandering outside the resort. there is no need to. The ferry to St John right across from Moes Market is convenient. it is a 15minute ride if you want to explore that island.

We have visited several Ritz Carlton properties in the US and found this hotel to have very high standards. We had two connecting rooms. Both overlooked the pool and beach. The rooms were spacious and very clean and the beds were comfortable as we expected from the Ritz Carlton. The beach was a smal to mid size beach very clean and pleasant and beach service with towels and refreshments was available albeit at the slightly slower pace of the islands. As with many hotels at Spring Break it behooves you to get to the beach or pool early in the morning to claim your beach chair. On the beach there are hobie cats wind surfers and kayaks among other activities as well as organized excursions that depart from the beach daily see Cruz Bay Water Sports for more info. The Hobie sailing on our last day was one of the best sailing experiences of my husbands life and he has been sailing since he was a small boy. I know he wants to return for more. There is a small restaurant that overlooks the beach which is nice for a light meal or drink during the day. The pool overlooks the beach and is very picturesque. There is a small slightly sloped lawn next to the pool area where kids were playing lawn games. Three restaurants over look the beach and pool. The breakfast that is served daily is excellent. We tried each of the restaurants and were impressed by the servers each was professional attentive very friendly warm and welcoming. The quality of the food did not quite match up to the high standards set by the wait staff. Blue Water was the best restaurant for dinners. We had steak and it was cooked perfectly and delicious. We were disappointed by Coconut Cove. The lighting detracts from the atmosphere and the food was below the standards of the Ritz Carlton. The food at Esenza was good but not great simple safe Italian American food. The snacks at Sails were good and complimented the cocktails nicely. We would definitely return to the Ritz Carlton St Thomas but we would go out for dinner rather than staying on campus until there is some improvement in the quality of the food that is served for dinners. We hate to say that about the restaurants because everything else about the Ritz Carlton St Thomas was really great and from what we observed it truly is among the very nicest hotels in the Virgin Islands. The attentive and friendly staff at every level from bellman to wait staff to beach side represent the Ritz Carlton brand very well and bring a unique island feeling to this property that you will not experience at another RC elsewhere. It was impressive and we commend the management of the hotel for creating a culture where the employees convey such warmth and dedication. We were at the property over Spring Break when the hotel was full to capacity. There were times when we would ring the front desk and not get an answer but we were reassured when our messages were returned promptly and our needs were addressed timely. We would definitely recommend the Ritz Carlton to friends and even though we are tempted to explore other islands in the future we are pretty sure that the Ritz Carlton will be the best hotel we will experience in the Virgin Islands.", "offset": [1585, 1632], "date": "2016-03-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "7e8b448c-96ec-48c4-a1ad-f083d44885f3", "sentence": "Quiet Getaway.

Not sure how one priveledged old man was able to commandeer 16 18 of the best located lounge chairs at the pool every morning. I guess. It does not seem fair that you either have to pay or bribe pool boys to do that for you every morning or the other option is to wake up at 5 AM and go down there and put your own towels on those spots just to grab four chairs of the 16 to 18 he took up every day. I understand saving 4 to 6 chairs maybe but when you take up a whole side of the pool that is too much. Say five or six chairs and then everybody else gets a chair when they get down here.

I really do not like giving average or negative reviews especially in this case because the staff is super kind. I just feel like the hotel needs to be aware of some things. First of all we had a very welcoming greeting when we arrived. We were brought drinks immediately upon our arrival while we checked in. After check in they gave us an additional. It was a sweet gesture to start our stay off right. During check in we were told that we would be given a 200 resort credit per night because the hotel still is not completely finished. This was a great surprise and a very kind gesture. We were in Puerto Rico staying at the St Regis over Christmas before we came here. it is hard to not compare the two. We read TripAdvisor reviews on this hotel and our expectations were not very high so being told we would be credited was a very nice surprise. We arrived at our room and while it was okay it was not anything fancy. Much smaller than the room we stayed in at the St Regis. Beds were comfortable and we had a deck which was nice. Although the Ocean View room we had was more of a view of the construction of the pool. We did not spend time out there since it was mainly construction. As for the shower in the bathroom it seems odd that it is frosted glass that you can see into the main room. So you can see someone showering or at least the shadow of them. There was also light from the shower so if others are still sleeping in your room its not dark. Being a Ritz I would have expected better. The first night we ate at Coconut Cove. Nakita was our server and she was very friendly. My husband ordered a seafood pasta with Lobster mussels clams and shrimp. My daughter and I had the chicken pasta. The chicken pasta was absolutely delicious both my daughter and I loved it. As for the seafood pasta there was no lobster and barely any mussels or clams. It was mainly shrimp. When my husband questioned it the manager asked the chef and he said he was out of lobster. That is fine but they should have told us that because it was 14 more for the lobster. They offered to take it off our bill but my husband said no it was still good and since he ate it he suggested to just charge him like it was a chicken pasta which they did. I am only pointing this out because of what happens a few days later which I will talk about below. The guys and gals working the pool were super friendly and helped get your chairs set up. Christmas is a busy time but we never had issues finding chairs. There were plenty. Lunch at the pool took over an hour to receive which seemed like a long time so just order before you are too hungry. Most restaurants require reservations before you arrive because when we got there they were all booked for dinners. The breakfast buffet restaurant near the pool was good although you could tell the wait staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The second day we ate here there was quite a wait. We told them we would be waiting outside and they said they would come out and let us know when our table was ready. As we saw people behind us in line getting seated my daughter went up and questioned and the lady was not very kind and said we have been calling your name for awhile. My daughter quickly reminded her that we told her we were waiting outside since there was no room to wait inside and that she agreed to come out to tell us when our table was ready. They sat us next. New Years Eve lunch we decided to eat at Coconut Cove again because we wanted the chicken pasta. Nakita was our waitress again and we were happy to see her. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She asked what kind of cheese and he said swiss. She came by our table shortly later and my husband questioned if saw that it said bacon on the cheeseburger. She said he was accurate and there would be bacon. So out comes his cheeseburger and my husband jokingly said this is the orangest swiss I have ever seen. Nakita felt bad and said she would take it back and fix it immediately. My husband told her no it is not a big deal he likes cheddar too. She leaves and my husband realizes there is no bacon. So when she comes back he tells her and you can tell she is completely embarrassed. She brings the bacon. My husband then started eating the burger and after a few bites he realizes there is something in his burger. Sure enough it was the wax paper that divides the cheese. He calls Nakita over and she looked mortified. She asked to put it on a plate to show the chef. My husband was done eating at this point. When our bill was brought to us we thought for sure they would take his meal off especially since my husband did not have them take off the pasta off the first night like they asked. We thought it was only fair since he had wax paper in his burger that he be comped that. So he scratched off that part of the bill and did a new total. When we received our final bill we saw that they did make the adjustment on their end which was good however it should have never been on the bill in the first place. That night we went out to eat in town. When we came home there was a bottle of champagne and a very kind note from Nakita. That was great customer service and they definitely tried to right their wrong. We were thankful for that even though we do not drink champagne. On our last morning there we had to get up early for our taxi and when I went to shower I realized the staff that serviced our rooms forgot to leave us any fresh towels. They took all of our old towels during turndown service but forgot to leave new towels so we did not even have hand towels. It was about 7 am and I called housekeeping and they never answered I called the front desk concierge and they never answered. Since we all needed to be up and showered it was quite frustrating no one answered their phones. I had to call the bell desk to ask for towels. They said they would be right up. They arrived at 830am. Luckily our flight was delayed by several hours so it was okay it took them so long for the towels to arrive. I do feel there should always be someone available answering phones for guests though. We were eaten alive by the sand flies so be sure to use the Off they have for you near the pool. My daughter stopped counting at 100 bites on her body. Red bumps welts that were super itchy. Ok back to the good. The water is beautiful there is coral and rocks in the water but we still got in and my son and husband did some snorkeling. That was fun for them. The sand is super soft and when you are not looking at the pool construction the view is stunning. I loved looking out to St John. I would return. I just hope they get some of these kinks worked out soon especially when I had to use more than the usual points for our stay for a hotel that was not quite ready.
