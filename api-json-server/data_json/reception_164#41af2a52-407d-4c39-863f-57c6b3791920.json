If you want a centrally located base from which to explore Dubai then this is not the hotel for you as it is a good 30mins by taxi to the city. HOWEVER if you want a fabulous hotel with great service beautiful beach and 2 pools friendly staff delicious food and great rooms then this is so the place to go. My daughter and I came here for a week to celebrate her 21st birthday and could not be more pleased with our experience. We arrived to a birthday cake in the room as our travel agent had noted her birthday on the booking such a lovely touch. Room was clean comfy and whilst not the biggest room I have stayed in it was roomy enough for two and room service cleanliness was of a high standard. Pools and beach were clean and so many sun beds yes there was the usual towels out early to get the nicest sun bed by the polbut I have yet to find a hotel with a solution to that. but there were always plenty of empty ones around the beach and beautiful gardens. Food was delicious and such a variety. All the restaurant we used were great and the staff really pleasant. If you want to use one of the restaurants that you have to book for do so as soon as you arrive we did not as we were told that it was ok to book in the morning and when we did everything was full. That said I did then go back and express my disappointment at being told the incorrect information always better to complain when you are there rather than on here after you have arrived home and the staff were very helpful and a compromise was found. Lots to do around the grounds with water sports golf and stables. I can not really comment on those as I was far too busy doing nothing by the pool and enjoying the food. If however you do want to go see some sights then there is a complementary shuttle service we personally found the time restrictions of this a little inconvenient so opted for taxi it cost about \u00a3 20 each way to get to the malls etc. Yes this could be considered a little pricey if you are going out everyday but for us the cost was so worth having such a fabulous hotel to stay in with clean air and spacious ground neither of which you will get in central Dubai. The resounding endorsement that we found was the number of other guests that we spoke to who were there for their 2nd or third visit.

When going on holiday on my own for the first time I was nervous and knew that I needed to go somewhere I knew I \u2019d be comfortable and could relax. having been here several times before not as a solo traveller and loving it it seemed like the perfect choice. I booked a few weeks in advance and with a little apprehension awaited my well earned holiday. I was n\u2019t disappointed. Since I last visited the hotel had undergone a refurbishment in fact I arrived on day 1. The hotel was beautiful before but even more so after the refurb. The change to glass balconies from enclosed ones made such a massive difference to sitting out but also to the light and views in the room. I was disappointed that Mushref bar had been closed it \u2019s where I first sampled the drink \u201c French connection \u201d which is now my go to but there is the addition of Vasco Da Gama just off the Beach Hotels Lobby which is fun and lively and makes up for it. There were a few teething problems such as room mini fridge was empty but can not fault the staff or hotel for these as I was given an early check in at 9 am and it was rectified within 20minutes. The staff are really helpful friendly and manners are impeccable not sure I have been anywhere where the staff are as good. It \u2019s always good to see staff staying somewhere for several years I think it says a lot. This did wonders for my nerves at travelling on my own. Nothing was too much trouble and they were quite often able to preempt what I may like. I felt my tour operator misrepresented a few details but the resort manager was quickly on hand to rectify these and made my stay fantastic. All of the restaurants were fantastic food faultless so much choice so you \u2019l always enjoy something. Sadly Phoenicia and Sete were n\u2019t quite open when I was there but looking forward to trying them when I return. Special mention to the manager in Shooters who could n\u2019t have made it feel more normal to be dining alone one of my biggest fears before hand. I have been meaning to post since I returned home but have n\u2019t had chance but now that I m looking at dates to rerun on my own this year and also with my family for Christmas finally got round to it.

Firstly I would like to say that we had a lovely time whilst spending a week at the hotel. We certainly felt very relaxed and well rested as we are here as time together before the birth of our first child. We had booked based upon the recommendation of friends who return year on year who stated that the all inclusive was fantastic and the a la carte restaurants were excellent. Whilst I would agree with parts there are also other parts that I would very much disagree with. I would like to state that my wife and I when we book a holiday look for a nice resort all inclusive a nice variety of a la carte restaurants somewhere to relax. This will differ vastly from what a lot of readers may want from their holiday and what we will be looking to book in future so I felt it was important to understand our opinions based on what we like. I will start on hotel location. Our driver from the airport made a comment that we would be driving through \u2018 new Dubai \u2019 through \u2018 old Dubai \u2019 and into \u2018 empty Dubai \u2019. This was not an issue for us as we did n\u2019t plan on heading into the main attraction areas and would stay on the resort but you are looking at a 20 25 minute taxi from the hotel back to what the driver described as \u2018 old Dubai \u2019. We never looked into it but the hotel do put on shuttles to the malls etc. But at what frequency and how many stops they make I could not tell you. On arrival at the hotel the grounds looked fantastic. We drove past the equestrian centre and the golf course that both looked great. We also did n\u2019t take advantage of these facilities. The lobby was rather grand and on initial arrival check in was simple and staff very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately a room was not free for us when we arrived as we got here at 080 local time. Staff were good enough to provide us somewhere to leave our bags and left us with a mobile phone that reception would call us on when the room was ready. This was around 120 3 hours earlier than check in timeOnce we arrived at our double sea view room the best I could describe it as in all honesty is just above average. Whilst it is nicely decorated and furnished it \u2019s only big enough I would say for two adults and an infant. The balcony is even smaller. I \u2019m used to large rooms with plenty of facilities but this just was n\u2019t what I expect of a 5 star hotel. I have stayed in travel lodge rooms with similar decor furnishings and facilities. The air con whilst it worked certainly did n\u2019t go to the temperatures it stated. This would be more like a city hotel room rather than a resort for my previous experience. But none the less a room that was more than acceptable for us as we did not plan on spending too much time in there other than sleeping. BIG WARNING check with the provider you are booking with if you are looking at booking all inclusive to check wether you are being booked \u2018 Deluxe \u2019 or \u2018 Ultra \u2019 all inclusive. We booked via Travel republic who made absolutely no mention of two differing types of package and also stated that there were a la carte restaurants included. We were placed on Deluxe all inclusive and if I \u2019m honest it \u2019s pretty naf. Travel republic later told us that it is a standard package which pretty much just includes buffet \u2019s and a couple of smaller restaurants which are more like gastro pubs and bar food. The a la carte restaurants offer 50 off the bill for guests who do not have the a la carte restaurants included. I will attach copies of what is included on both packages via pictures. We were not happy with this as Travel republic had not advertised this correctly and after some back and forth they admitted that the information on their site was incorrect and we fought and got upgraded to the ultra all inclusive package which is what we expected of an all inclusive and thought we would be getting. The facilities at the hotel are great. There are plenty of pools plenty of places to eat lots of bars a nice beach area and from what I can tell lots of activities for families with kids. I would certainly recommend this hotel for people with young children as there are plenty here and all the families seem to be having fun. Sun loungers have really nice comfortable cushions on and towels are included. All of the areas are very clean and well maintained. It \u2019s clear a lot of effort goes into maintaining cleanliness standards here. One of the big issues I have with this hotel is that which ever board basis you are staying you have to sign the bill for each order. Even as all inclusive you can get large bills to sign although staff inform this is for record purposes I still felt like on check out I was going to receive a large bill. None of the restaurants or bars make it perfectly clear what is and what is n\u2019t included and we felt the need to reconfirm what was included in our package at each one before ordering. The need to sign for stuff that is all included seems pointless to me and in all honestly became annoying in the end. The service from staff was inconsistent to say the least. We found some incredibly helpful others not so. Some staff would run your bill for the whole days worth of drinks at the pool others would make you sign each order. Staff at the a la carte restaurants were excellent. Very attentive and polite and nothing was too much. At the buffets smaller restaurants and bars although food service was fairly quick you could be waiting an age for a drink even if you were the only person waiting. Quite often receiving 1 item off the order then waiting 10 minutes for the second whilst someone else was served. Saying this every staff member was incredibly polite and friendly. Staff at reception were also very polite and helpful I may add. Each and everyone one of the a la carte restaurants were excellent. I ca n\u2019t fault the food and service and this was one of the main reasons for booking this hotel and it did n\u2019t disappoint. Whilst the bars and restaurants vary in location between the three hotels here it was not much hassle using the resorts shuttle services to get to each one. I would make sure if you are booking all inclusive that you select the ultra package as you need to eat at the a la carte venues as they were so nice. You are paying for all inclusive so do n\u2019t make a mistake and have to cover half of your bills each night. The only a la carte experience not included is the tepanyaki dinner in the Asian restaurant. This will come at a 50 discount to guests. We took advantage of this and we had an incredible meal and enjoyed the show. The buffets certainly are n\u2019t amongst the largest I \u2019ve seen but they have a fair average selection and you would n\u2019t go hungry. Other facilities that were available such as golf water sports horse riding shooting range sports complex and paintball all looked great. We did not try any of these so would be unfair to comment but they are there to use. Overall I would say this was a nice hotel and would rate my experience here as three and a half stars out of five. As I mentioned earlier there are some really attractive points to this hotel but two differing all inclusive packages a basic room signing for each order and inconsistent service were enough to drop the score in my opinion. I \u2019m sure other people including our friends who return each year will have a different opinion to ours but this is an honest review as I can give based upon what we wanted from our holiday and what we thought we received.

Reception denied this. what was the point of going to AI resort and not have spa bars and potentially restaurants closed. Given this we made the decision that there would be a rush of people to get flights home so we changed flights and went home. Hotel would do nothing in reimbursing for days we did not stay there. these are exceptional times and I would have expected some gesture 50 even to be returned. I will avoid this chain of hotels from now on i m afraid despite lovely staff.", "offset": [0, 135], "date": "2020-03-24 11:16:23", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
