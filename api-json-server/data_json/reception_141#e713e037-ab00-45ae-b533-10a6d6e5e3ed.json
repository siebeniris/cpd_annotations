However my wife used her credit card at the bar and grill blackrocknext to the pool. She asked for her card back after paying and receiving the food and closing out. The server mumbled something and smiled to her walked off and took the card with him. She brought the food drinks to our lounge chairs and asked me to get the card. She mentioned to me it was odd. I got the card 10 minutes later and thought nothing of it. That was the first she had used her card in over a week. Shortly afterwards I got an email from the credit card company questioning the validity of 2 charges of 49 each for Essential Oils at an online site. I called and said they were not our charges. Before it was blocked 2 more 49 charges came through. Because of the strange situation of not promptly returning our card when asked and the fact that her card had just been used for the first time in a long time we strongly suspect the card info was taken and used there. We reported it to management including time of the transaction and the server on the receipt but because it was an internet fraudulent charge nothing could be definitively proved. There seemed to be little interest on Sheraton managements part. They said they would look into it but we did not hear again.

I was so excited to stay at the Sheraton Maui for my Honeymoon. I picked it so that we could enjoy the resort feel and my husband and I could just relax knowing everything was taken care of. We paid more than we would normally pay because we were interested in the amenities a resort provides. I really wanted it to be a special trip for my husband. Our first two days were relatively uneventful but not without hiccups. When we arrived the staff was pleasant but there was no lei or little special treat to make you get into the resort mood that I have experienced at less expensive Hawaiian resorts in the past. I let them know it was our honeymoon and we were n\u2019t even congratulated. We found our room and it was fine except that the AC is either on full blast or not at all. We went down to the pool and enjoyed one of the pool bar restaurants where the waitress was very nice and gave us some great recommendations for places to visit. We did notice as everyone else has mentioned that there were not enough pool chairs at the pool. The next day we noticed a steep decline in service at the restaurants. Our waiter in the morning seemed distracted and missed my husbands order. Finally we would n\u2019t care but we were in a hurry to get to the ferry and could n\u2019t wait for them to cook it for him. The waiter was very nice and offered for him to get whatever he wanted from the buffet but my husband was feeling grumpy and we had to go. The next day we tried to eat at the buffet again and my husband enjoyed his food but they ran out of a lot and had long wait times to replenish it 10 minutes for more oatmeal and no one came to refill our coffee or water which was frustrating because again we were in a relative hurry and the buffet was rather expensive. The next day we skipped breakfast at the hotel and ate off property but we came back to the bar restaurant we had previously enjoyed. This time the staff seemed again distracted no one came to greet us once we did flag someone down and ordered it took a while to get our food and no one came to refill our water or our drinks. The man who was working was covering too many tables which I think was the same issue at the buffet. The entire experience up to this point was not living up to what we expected service was lacking it did n\u2019t feel special and every little thing was an upcharge or a hassle. But we were still ignoring the bad and just enjoying the vacation and Maui in general. The next morning things got much worse. We were up early to take a day tour and noticed a paper posted in the elevator that said there was a work stoppage and that housekeeping service would be effected as well as the restaurants. It was worded in a way that made it seem like services would be slightly impacted and did n\u2019t spell out what was actually about to happen. When we got back from our trip there no more information slipped under our door or left in a message. There was trash left down our hallway and a pile of towels and toiletries on a table near the elevator. What the strike actually meant is that there is no housekeeping service to the rooms you can pick up your own towels though. All the bars and restaurants are closed. They do have a bunch of what appear to be teenagers serving a limited menu of maybe 7 items in one of the buildings and running the buffet. No one from the hotel thought that maybe they should consider people with dietary restrictions when making up their menu. The kids working the room seem nice but burgers in take out containers being served with plastic cutlery is n\u2019t what I signed up for when I paid more to stay at a nice resort. When you come back from a tour you do n\u2019t want to arrange for transportation to other hotels so you can eat somewhere else. The closing of the pool bar saddens us the most because we came here for the pool and planned to spend the last few days of our honeymoon out there enjoying the amenities and relaxing before heading back to work. Tonight they left trash bags by our door without any explanation. Judging from the debris in the hallway I think we are supposed to bundle up dirty towels or maybe the trash and throw it out there. It would be nice if they told us or updated us at all. I went to the desk last night to ask what they were going to do to make this better for the guests and all they offered was to waive the 26 daily resort fee. I feel like this is a good beginning but they act like not having these amenities is n\u2019t really a big deal and that they \u2019re doing us a favor by offering anything. I think that \u2019s BS. People paid more to stay here precisely for the things that are no longer available and the price difference when I was booking between hotels with fewer amenities and this resort was much more than 26 a day. I plan to approach the front desk again tomorrow and will amend this review if they do anything to rectify the situation. I bear no ill will to those on the picket lines.

This was honestly the worst customer service experience I have ever had. The staff was on strike during our stay which was for our wedding week and they did an excellent job of making sure that no one could enjoy their vacation anywhere near the property. In addition to almost all of the restaurants and room service being closed there were protesters screaming into megaphones on the beach every single day of our ten day trip multiple times a day. Try relaxing while listening to people chant for an hour it is great. We were initially disappointed to learn about the restaurants being closed but could have gotten over that. The protesting made it absolutely impossible to enjoy your time at the resort. I ended up talking to the protesters at some point and was told that they announced that they would be striking this month to the hotel 6 months ago if negotiations were not held and the company did absolutely nothing to negotiate with them until they started striking. So the hotel knew for 6 months that all of their guests experiences would be ruined this month they did nothing to work with their staff to resolve things did nothing to replace their staff and did nothing to notify their guests that their stay would be impacted by these activities. In addition they were not even extra accommodating to make up for it. We got breakfast at the one restaurant that was open on our wedding day asked if we could take it up to our room because we wanted to start getting ready and were told no this is not room service. Yeah thanks we had planned to order room service on our wedding day if only it was actually available. I am just glad my actual wedding was at a restaurant and not on the property. Some other poor bride did have her wedding at the resort while we were there and had protesters shouting at her wedding. She was sobbing. How absolutely unacceptable is it to know that this will be occurring and not give your guests a heads up. I have traveled quite a bit and have stayed at a lot of hotels ranging from quaint bargain places to nice resorts and I have never in my life been even remotely this dissatisfied.

The number one thing the Sheraton has going for it is its location. Being right on Black Rock where all the snorkeling and honu action happens is exactly where you want to be. Whereas you can of course walk to Black Rock from all of the other Kanapali Beach hotels none of the others allow you to roll right out of bed and into the turtle invested waters. Besides its location the hotel itself is nice and I think holding up a little bit better than some of the other properties like the Westin who have really allowed their facilities and service to go downhill in recent years. The Sheraton still feels comfortable and newish although certainly it could use a bit of a refresh. The facilities are nice the pool lovely and the pool area somewhat quiet. Every staff member we came across was friendly and all of the food and drinks were great. The room itself was comfortable with great blackout curtains and a wonderful thermostat that both kept the room cool and allowed you to set it to a continuous mode to block out external noise. It was not the Four Seasons but we slept well. I do have a couple of gripes of course but nothing that would prevent me from returning. First and this is a problem at all of the hotels on the beach there is so little shade that you have to pay the astronomical fees to rent an umbrella or cabana on the beach or rent buy a flimsy one that blows away when even the tiniest breeze pops up. I wish hotels would not do this. Drives me nuts. No one visiting the islands from the mainland should be in the sun the entire day. Bad juju. Second when you do go to the expense of renting said cabana or umbrella they make you give it back at 4 of the clock. The sun is still blazing then and most times of the year it is still up for at least another two hours. I have never stayed at a hotel that kicked you out of your cabana before sunset. At least let you have it until 5. Especially considering the cost.

Let me preface this review by saying that I have stayed at the Sheraton Maui in the past and truly enjoyed it. The location is exceptional close to shopping and restaurants as well as on site snorkeling and wonderful walking paths. It was the property itself and the service that made this stay feel like a disappointing value. The property is in desperate need of updating and lacks the small touches that one would expect at this price point. Looking out from balconies and seeing planters filled with soil and drip lines but no PLANTS in sight makes the place feel even more run down. I believe that in past months there have been major disputes between management and staff. This is clearly evident. Most employees wear Respect Workers buttons. Services were provided sort of but there was no friendliness or enthusiasm on the part of the staff. As an example our daily housekeeping was totally inconsistent. During a weeks stay on two occasions I had to call because it was not done and most often they were cleaning and restocking our room at 40 430 PM just as we wanted to change for dinner reservations. Two mornings including the day of departure when we had requested noon check out housekeeping was at our door at 845 AM. Of course this is not earth shattering but it is just an example of the details that make this property disappointing. Check out was a bit of a nightmare. we had reboked our stay at a lower rate a week before arrival through Mariotcom. We had received email confirmations of this rate. At check out we were billed at our original rate 156 over the rate we had been confirmed at. This was finally resolved after 45 minutes at the counter several excuses We only have one guy here today who knows the Mariot system and a curt admonishment by the front desk staffer that we should have gone over each days rate at the time of check in instead of simply giving our name and confirmation number. While I suppose that ideally this is true I had suspect that many travelers to Hawaii are just eager to check in as quickly and easily as possible and get to their room after a long flight. If each days rate needs to be reviewed and okd by the guest I think it would be a courtesy for the hotel to initiate this during the check in process and not burden weary guests with remembering to do so. I want to love this property again honestly I do. However as of right now I had go a few doors down to the Westin.

Unprofessional lack of customer service accountability by management. Overall the property appears very dated compared to the other Mariot properties on the island. The hotel has an island cabana compared to the more open luxurious resort atmospheres of The Westin KOR Nanea Mariot Ocean Club Wailea Beach resort. The rooms appear to have been slightly renovated but bathrooms are lacking we had green mold on our laundry string hanger. The location is very central for us as it \u2019s close to Lahaina Kanapali shops. We had a very poor experience with them honoring resolving status perks so our advice is to go in without expecting recognition that you might typically receive from a hotel chain. The service staff can be hit or miss depending on who you talk to although most were friendly helpful. The Bell staff were great and eager to help. Unfortunately the management there was not. The breakfast buffet was a nice welcome gift elite members can get free valet parking. See below for more detailed review of our experience here My wife and I stayed 5 nights at the Sheraton Maui Resort Spa. While the location of the Sheraton Maui is fantastic located on BlackRock we will not stay here again and would strongly recommend other Mariot status holders to stay elsewhere. The management does not honor Mariot benefits seemingly does not care about the experience of their loyal members. The Westin Kanapali Ocean Resort Villas The Westin Nanea Ocean Resort Villas Mariot Ocean Club Maui Wailea Beach Resort Mariot Maui are much better options within the same category. We booked 5 nights using points and Suite Night Awards SNA so that we could upgrade to a better room. We really wanted to be on Kanapali beach and unfortunately The Westin Maui Spa Resort was in the middle of construction. After visiting The Westin we would recommend avoiding until construction is finished. Although I have titanium status my wife and I really wanted peace of mind of having a nice room for our vacation and to secure any potential upgrades ahead of time. Luckily for us 5 days before our check in we received notification through the Mariot ap through email that our SNA request was approved our upgrade was confirmed to a \u201c Deluxe Ocean Front Suite \u201d. It was our top request and our other requests were either other suites or ocean front rooms. We were both very excited relieved when we learned this. Fast forward to 2 days before check in I get a notification saying that I can do the mobile check in but I noticed my room was downgraded. Instead of an oceanfront suite the ap was now showing a \u201c Deluxe Ocean View Guest Room \u201d. I immediately called the hotel since we had received confirmation of an upgrade already. I spoke to Shawna who kept saying my room was never confirmed that hotels can only confirm a room at check in. I tried to explain that by using a SNA you should be getting a confirmation up to 5 days before arrival. If a room was available it should be reserved for our stay if we are using SNA. If I had to physically check in on the day of my stay to confirm a SNA upgrade what is the difference between a titanium upgrade. When I told her I had the upgrade confirmation up on my phone Shawna said she could have a manager contact me. I asked for them to contact me in 90 minutes as we were about to enter an activity where we would n\u2019t have access to our phones30 minutes later while I said I was unavailable Andrew Lee the Guest Services Manager contacts me and leaves a voice mail admitting there was a mistake by the room controller. He did not apologize for the mistake. He mentioned how I had booked a resort view room with points and that they typically try to set aside an \u201c upgrade \u201d for guests. I found it strange that 1. He mentioned booking with points specifically and the room type we boked2. The \u201c upgrade \u201d did not seem to be related to the Suite Night Awards seemed to be a minimal effort to honor their upgrade policy while keeping rooms open for \u201c paying customers \u201d. Platinum above status members are eligible to receive the best available room on property not just a better room. When I called Andrew back I tried to be understanding because mistakes do happen and we were thankful for any room better than the standard guestroom. He admitted the mistake was on the hotel room controller when they were moving rooms around so it seems like a room was available and we were moved out of it for a \u201c paying customer \u201d but he never took responsibility or apologized for what had happened. At the end he told me that he was working the next couple of days and would personally check for me to see if anything opened that he would take care of us. He said he would be working when we checked in and would follow up with us. Although we had received confirmation from Mariot the SNA were deducted from my account I understood that these things were n\u2019t guaranteed and that I was n\u2019t expecting him to kick someone out of their room. It was my mistake to not escalate this trust Andrew with an opportunity to rectify this situation even just a little. Literally not even an apology. The Sheraton Maui does not have an elite check in desk but does have a great bellmen staff. As an elite member they offer complimentary valet service which was a great benefit. When we arrived there were already 4 groups in line already. When it was our turn we spoke with Shawna. I did n\u2019t realize until listening to Andrew \u2019s voicemail later that this was likely who I had spoken with 2 days earlier. When Shawna looked us up in the system you could tell she was quickly reading the notes in the reservation that Andrew promised he would make. She did not acknowledge our Mariot elite status which is inconsequential but it \u2019s a pretty basic welcome procedure and nice gesture to loyal members or anything else in the notes. When we asked her if there were any potential upgrades or updates on the situation available she promptly cut us off and said that we \u2019ve been upgraded to the deluxe ocean view guest room and that we should be happy because it was a good upgrade. She did not try to check the system at all. She started to rush us through like she was trying to avoid the situation. As a result we did n\u2019t receive any orientation or overview of hotel amenities again basic welcome procedure. We had to ask the front desk the next morning where to go for breakfast and later how to check out pool towels because none of it was explained to us. There was only 1 group behind us in line at the time so I doubt that \u2019s why we were rushed through. I saw other front desk team members taking time to go over the activity schedule stepping around the desk to direct guests to their rooms and overall just happy to help their guests. Our experience with other members of the front desk were generally positive outside of Shawna Andrew who was not present or available at our check in as promised. We went to our room not wanting to dampen anyone \u2019s vacation by creating a scene in the lobby just happy to be in Kanapali. We had a \u201c premium \u201d corner room in building 2 on the 3rd floor of 6 facing the ocean but separated by the luau lawn. Overall the property appears dated compared to newer open concept resorts but the rooms are slightly more renovated. It looked our building was one of the few facing toward the ocean and we liked the lawn better than overlooking the pool for privacy. However after walking the property it seems like building 5 6 are the ones with the best views. They sit on top of BlackRock and while there is n\u2019t direct beach access they are right on the ocean and you can hear the waves. Since we ended up with a guest room instead of a suite I find it difficult to believe that there was not a single room available on a higher floor or in a better location with a better view. I did not feel like Andrew took care of us like he said he would. A day before we checked out we tried to get in touch with Andrew again. This should n\u2019t be our responsibility while on vacation. The front desk said he was in but not at his desk. I left my number so he could call me when he \u201c returned to his desk \u201d so that I could discuss our experience in person before writing any reviews. After 4 hours with no response we went back to the front desk. When we asked the front desk team member she went into the back of the office and did n\u2019t come out for several minutes like she was having a conversation. When she came back she apologized and said Andrew had just left at 340pm \u2026. Seems like an odd time and that she could try to help us instead. When we asked to talk with another manager on duty we were told there was no one else but that we could leave a number for someone to call us back. I appreciated her help but at this point this is n\u2019t her problem to solve and management needs to be held accountable for the way they care for their guests. 30 minutes after we left and went back to our room we received a call from Andrew and not a different manager on duty. Coincidentally he was n\u2019t there to talk in person and would n\u2019t be in tomorrow Sunday either. My first call with Andrew was on a Sunday. Same conversation as before. No apologies despite admitting it was the hotel \u2019s mistake. When we went over the SNA he again said he would take care of us etc. If he looked at our reservation as he said he would he would be aware that we were checking out the next day. He mentioned again how we booked with points and how \u201c paying customers \u201d were prioritized. Are we not supposed to use Mariot points at Mariot properties. Why even offer SNA. If this is the kind of rewards that Mariot wants to share with it \u2019s members I would strongly consider another hotel brand. When we talked about our check in experience he was again quick to not accept responsibility blame Shawna. When we asked why she did n\u2019t address our situation or try to take better care of us or acknowledge our status he tried to play it off as there were no notes or that she did n\u2019t read them. He had promised to make notes take care of us so if there truly was nothing written down that \u2019s on him. If she did n\u2019t read them that is unprofessional ultimately still on him for training. I asked to return our suite nights since we were upgraded to a room we did n\u2019t list and denied our original suite. Since we had booked with points he offered to gift us \u00bd a night in points in exchange for our troubles. Given how he treats his point paying guests this was a patronizing compensation. We would not be excited to spend points at the Sheraton Maui so that we can be treated like second rate guests again. Lastly he said he would follow up on Monday and that the SNA and points should be in our account by then. As with his other promises none of those things happened. A quick note about check out as other reviewers have pointed out they like to add on a phone charge and you must ask them to remove it at check out \u2026. Also 2 hours after we checked out at the front desk the hotel called me to ask if I had left the room so they could clean it. We did not bother to ask for 4 pm check out.", "offset": [704, 806], "date": "2019-06-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "7987f1e8-2275-46d6-9175-9fe68d4f4cb8", "sentence": "Good hotel but understaffed.

The hotel grounds were clean and manicured and generally speaking the staff was friendly and accommodating. We love the location situated directly next to Black Rock with great sandy beach cliff jumping and nice snorkeling the experience of swimming with huge sea turtles is exhilarating. Check in and check out went smooth and fast. Rather basic breakfast buffet is available for extra charge or you can opt to go with the a la cartea menu no matter what your choice is take into consideration that a breakfast for a family of 5 will cost you an extra of 100 per day. The main complaint that we have with the hotel is the lack of staff available mainly with the valet parking service and with house keeping. One can easily wait for the car for 20 minutes and in some cases the room was not cleaned until the afternoon.

We just stayed there this weekend and I can not tell you how disappointed we were. They are under construction and never told us when we booked this hotel. Also when we checked in they completely downplayed the actual construction that was going on saying that they were just redoing their lobby when in fact their entire middle part of the hotel was blocked off and under construction. To get from one end of the hotel to the other you needed to completely go around the property. There were no signs or help to get you places on the property. They gave you a tiny map and you had to guess whether or not the walkways were open and not under construction. The rooms were nice alas the reason for the 3 stars and not lower and the bed was comfortable. Also the beach outside the hotel was worth the 3 stars and more so visit their beach but stay somewhere else. The majority of the staff were trying to make the best of the mess they were working in but communication was just not there for the guests. There was an instructional video on the TV but the instructions that were given were untrue ie. you need to get a towel card to get beach towels when no one had any towel card nor needed one. We asked for a recommendation from one of the concierges for something to do on the Sunday coming up and she told us that people go to church on Sunday and that things close early on Sunday. that was it no other recommendation.
