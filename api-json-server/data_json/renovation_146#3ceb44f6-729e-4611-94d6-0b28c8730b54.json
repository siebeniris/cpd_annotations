I have stayed here several times and it is ok if you are getting in late and just want a bed but it is a poor representation of a Mariot courtyard. The walls are thin the lobby does not have an open market the decor is in need of update Etc. the staff is ok but not truly Mariot quality. Not sure where the glowing reviews come from unles it is people enamored with the lower price versus nearby offerings. I am completing a 5 night stay and will not do anything more than a single night in the future due to the above.

I have never ben treated more kindly serviced so well and enjoyed a breakfast buffet that was a 10. Melissa at the front desk was awesome. I had to extend my stay. no problem. I showed up a day early. no problem. This team of employees are clearly being tasked to do more with less it is slightly obvious but then again what company is staffed appropriately anymore. I would strongly encourage you to book a stay here. If you have kids you will make out like a bandit breakfast is a memory maker for the kids if you are a savvy business person who wants to get great service and not break the budget book here. There was a travel desk that was not a sales pitch. It was consultative. There was a well stocked Hertz desk thereFre Shuttles to Disney limited options but save the 20 on parking at DisneyFre use of Luggage carts just ask.

This place DELIVERED. This was a pleasure trip and I wish I knew about this property the last 2 times I was in the Orlando area on business. Rooms kept clean cleaning staff was well spoken and professional. I hung a privacy tag ion my door and was quite surprised to see a note under my door offering to come later or to deliver supplies if I needed a refresh. The dining room hosted a class act clown during the weekend days. A true professional clown not just a guy who painted his face and called himself a clown. He was multi lingual at least 5 languages. He sung short songs in the childrens native language at least 4 languages that I heard in the two weekend mornings I was thereI am a business guy in my early 50s.

We booked our reservation months in advance of our trip. When we arrived to check in the manager told us they had moved us to another hotel.

After further questioning it became clear that they had overboked and they kicked us out in favor of someone paying a higher rate. When I asked what good it was to have a reservation the manager said and I quote A reservation does not guarantee a room. All we have to do is find you a room somewhere else and we have met our legal obligation. What a great way to start a vacation.

I have n\u2019t stayed at this property before.

Overall we had no major issues. Our room was clean or as clean as it could get and we felt safe. This is the most important detail to me when I travel. Check in was friendly and quick. All of the employees I saw were friendly and polite. But the property is definitely dated and our room and furnishings were very dingy worn out and simply over used. The atmosphere especially the bed felt like a motel and reading that the rooms are being renovated makes me hope that ours was not done yet. The elevator outside of our room was out of service leaving us to walk to the opposite end of our building. The staircase at this end exited outside which made that way equally difficult.
