We chose Chateau Elan because we read wonderful reviews and we wanted a quick romantic weekend away from home. The exterior is impressive and very romantic. We selected the weekend romance package with the wine tasting experience. The check in was very easy but the staff was just average. They were nice but you expect above and beyond when paying for a 4 star hotel. We easily found our room but could see right away that the interior needed renovation with more modern furnishings and carpet. The winery is currently undergoing a 2 million dollar renovation and should be beautiful when complete. We ate at Caf\u00e9 Elan inside the winery and it was very loud which did not bother us but if you were looking for quiet or romantic there are several other options on the property that may suit you better. The wine tasting was fun and the wine manager did a good job of mixing education and fun. The wine was not good though many fruity wines and you have to use the same glass over and over. Overall it was a nice experience but not somewhere I would go back again.

My family and I have been coming to the Chateau for years. We come several times a year and every Thanksgiving for the past 5 years. This year for the first time we invited extended family. Although they do n\u2019t like to travel we convinced them that the Thanksgiving buffet we always do the Thanksgiving overnight package that included the buffet was to die for and a must seUnfortunately the new owners have heralded in a new era of mediocrity at this once charming and lovely hotel. I was SO embarrassed for convincing our guests that they should come here for this incredible buffet and unique European hospitality. The only thing incredible about our entire stay was how shockingly fast this once great getaway did a complete 180 in every way from its appearance to its food to its management and everything in between. Their Thanksgiving buffet used to be the talk of the town. Worth every cent of its 80 price tag 2 tickets included per room if you stay with the Thanksgiving package. This year however there was a MARKED difference in the quality and the presentation. A select few dishes were superb the sweet potato pot de creme the Brusel sprouts au gratin the leeks with mushrooms and the whipped mashed potatoes. The crab legs were highly disappointing much smaller than in years past every dessert was either abysmal mediocre or tasteless the stuffing was dry meaty and horrendous the turkey was dry gravy was awful. The bread station was the best part. Apart from the food the ambience has gone completely downhill as well. They stuck the pianist in a back corner under the staircase where you could barely hear her. She used to be near the buffet table where all the guests could enjoy the music and could watch her play. They also did away with the lovely ice sculptures that added so much beauty to the decor. If I had never been to their Thanksgiving buffet before I would say it was good but far from great. Having been to it several times in the past I would say it was sad and disappointing. And I \u2019m not the only one. While on the buffet line I overheard several other guests lamenting the downhill turn it took and my extended family being there for the first time reported back to me that several people on the dessert line were complaining about how wonderful the dessert room used to be in both taste and looks and how mediocre it is now. The bad news did n\u2019t stop there. The breakfast at Versailles the next day was a joke. 23 for a buffet where the food is the same quality as a cafeteria. It was shameful. Later that day we had one of the worst lunches I \u2019ve ever had at Marc the restaurant at the winery. The night of Thanksgiving we had a late dinner at Paddy \u2019s Irish Pub. Nothing to write home about. As soon as we walked into the hotel we knew it would n\u2019t be the same. The new owners changed the lobby and did away with all its elegance and European charm. Now it looks like the inside of any airport hotel where you stay on a layover. The management mirrors the decline in ambience.

They did offer us a complimentary glass of wine while we waited again. Our food came out again and even though it was n\u2019t cold the meat was dry and definitely not seasoned well. I had much better steaks before for way less money. When we went back to the Inn we went to their bar. They were playing jazz and that all they played.

I understand this is a Couples Get away and they mainly focus on couples spending time together but I think in order for the Chateau Elan complex to go to the next level they need more. Maybe partner with other companies to create a more robust experience. A live Jazz band or music. Maybe an art showing or even a poetry slam. I really do not think CE can survive and do really well unles they add another dimension to the experience.

The selection is simply gone and the coffee is now a notch or two above Waffle House whereas before I am certain they used Douwe Egberts cold brew to make coffee which was absolutely phenomenal.
