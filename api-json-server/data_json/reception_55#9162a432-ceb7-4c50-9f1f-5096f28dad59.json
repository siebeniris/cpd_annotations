I will explain the almost later. The front desk team is very professional and friendly when you are checking in. We arrived about 245 checkin is posted as 3 and were told we might have to wait awhile for our rooms to be ready. so heres is the thing. when we travel we either get there way past the checkin time or pretty close. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME we arrived within 15 minutes of checkin and were told it could be an hour or so more. I might not have minded so much if the bar was open. but it was not and after travelling that morning to get into NYC I needed to put my butt down and relax. I am not a whiny traveller but they said this with such a straight face I was a little dumbstruck. anyway after a little while we asked to speak to a manager and we were assigned a room in about a half hour Like I said if the bar was open or they had a glass of wine or something I might have been a little less cranky about it. Anyway we got to our room and it was a good size room. nicely appointed decor must be a signature of the hotel line because when I walked in I said we had stayed at a hotel decorated like this turns out it was a hotel in Portland last year owned by the same group. We got settled rested and went out to get a quick bite came back and they had a happy hour in the lobby We enjoyed a hot cider and rum before heading back out. The room was on the 16th floor and had a view looking out over a shared alley space so nothing scenic but very quiet. Bed was really comfortable. Bathroom was acceptable size not alot of counter space but we managed haha. one kink the toilet clogged up twice in one night so we finally asked them to leave the plunger. other than that the room met our expectations clean quiet comfy. Staff always exceeded our expectations prompt and courteous on every single encounter. My only beef with the facility itself was that while we were waiting in the lobby to get checked in there is no way to get out of the way of a blast of cold when those doors open. so in the winter lobby lounging is not really an option The location is a great one if you will be hanging around TS. it was literally a half block off the action yet once you made it back to the Muse the mayhem was left behind. So yes I would say this is a property worth checking out and next stay I hope to try NIOS it was closed for the holiday.", "offset": [149, 228], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "ad3f2d6a-2080-4543-b6e6-9d12f0b6dafe", "sentence": "Gracious and Comfortable.

The concierge left a treat bag for the dog in the room with treats and several toys. what a nice touch. The front desk staff was always friendly and was available to assist us with any questions or requests we had. Our room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. We had room service breakfast in the morning and everything that was supposed to be hot was and the cold stuff was cold. We received our breakfast within 20 minutes of ordering.

The Muse Hotel is just half a block off of Time Square yet 46th Street is not that loud so you do not get a lot of noise. The lobby is modern and welcoming desk staff was good all times we had to deal with them and the room has a lot of bench seating. We got a room with two full size bed and it seemed to be a good to large size for NYC standards. We did hear some say they had a king bed and a VERY small room. Staff told us on check. in that is was newly refurbished and indeed we got that smell of fresh paint or new carpet as soon as we walked in. However already the carpet had stains and the wood floor was scratched not a big deal but a few items I did find disappointing about the room 1You have to get out of bed and stand in front of the TV for the remote control to work and change channel volume would work fine from the bed wacky. 2. The closet was half way in the hall between the door to the room and the main part of the room and had no light around it. silly placement of the ceiling lights in the hallway. 3. The HVAC system is loud. We went to the Bar two nights and the staff was very nice. First night we got some Sliders and Fries that were ok not fantastic but they hit the spot and the place had a lot of other items on the menu. Mr Bartender did a good job with the drink but it was not cheap hey I know it is NYC. Night two Ms Bartender also hit the mark on the drinks but kitchen was closed on Friday night and in fact we had to hit the road before we wanted as some company had booked the bar restaurant for the night. Ms Bartender did calm us with a nice bowl of almonds to keep us from crying about the kitchen. Do ask for a coffee maker to get sent to the room as coffee service in the lobby cuts off at 9 AMThey have a happy hour in the lobby at 5 PM. white and red wine of so so quality. Last note a few times we would come out and ask the doorman to get us a cab. He would go out and stand in the center of 47th St but nothing and I am not talking about when it is raining. no cabs a block off Time Square.

I have stayed at the sister hotel 48ink a few times prior to staying at The Muse. Quite honestly I only really like the decor of the room I stayed in and the proximity to Times Square. My trip started out with not having any parking in the valet section so I pulled up a little forward. The man working valet at the time I did not know he was an employee. was back in valet section whistling at my car. Not knowing he was an employee I did not move my car. Why could not he have just walked up to my vehicle and ask me to back up. Walking into the hotel there was no real greeting and the front desk people appeared cold. After settling in the hotel room which was lovely word to the wise pull back your bedding before going to sleep because I was bit my a spider on my right elbow I was placed on hold twice when calling the concierge and my call was never answered. Later that evening I enjoyed the wine hour in the lobby and when I went to enter the bar area of Nios the host kindly told me that outside alcohol was not allowed in the restaurant. So after staying there and at 48ink I think I will continue staying at 48ink. They make you feel at home and not a burden.

Nevertheless it was a great option and a very good supply of drinks and snacks. My room only had one window but with the smart window treatments made the window area attractive. Complaints. The room had a very noisy heat air conditioning unit. Upon check in I was not impressed with my initial contact of the front dest staff. The representatives seem disorganized. One rep was twirling her hair as she checked in the couple next to me. The other one had her hair constantly falling in her face. The gentleman had a suit jacket on that was way too small for him and was quite obvious. Though the staff was very friendly the rep next to me asked all the proper questions if the guest next to me was their first first time staying at The Muse. She then shared some of the hotel service to the first time guest such as the very nice complimentary wine hour hours breakfast served etc etc. My rep basically checked me in and handed me the key and that was about it. I had to ask all what was available. The lobby is in much need of a refurbishing. Padded seats were scattered throughout the lobby with no backs and very uncomfortable area to sit and or to meet friends etc. The restaurant off the lobby appeared to have a very good wine selection. We had dinner reservations at another restaurant. The following morning we started to walk into the restaurant but it was extremely dark and very depressing to start the day out. Fortunately the bellman was very helpful in suggesting other restaurants nearby when we mentioned we would be more comfortable elsewhere. Check out was very smooth and the agents were sincerely interested in reassuring that we had a pleasant stay. Overall the rooms hallway floors good room soundproofing were very acceptable. I strongly feel the front desk should wear some type of uniforms and have some type of standard grooming policies in place. Completely refurbish the lobby area with better lighting and comfortable chairs sofa etc and this could be an all around top choice hotel to stay at. it is as if the quality of the rooms except for the noisy heater does not match the quality of the lobby and the appearance of the front dest staff.

The hotel is so close to great restaurants Times Square and all the Broadway theaters. The hotel is unassuming quiet beautifully and tastefully decorated and inviting. We had a great room with a balcony Unfortunately we were there during a Blizzard so did not get to use it much. But they do make amazing hot chocolate and serve wine during Happy Hour.

I am an IHG Platinum Member. Despite all the negative reviews on TripAdvisor for this hotel I went ahead and booked a two night stay here 39 to 31 since I am a big fan of Kimpton properties with their friendly staff. In the past Kimpton staff has always gone out of their ways to please their guests I just stayed at Kimpton Portland and the staff was wonderful. I have been staying at Kimpton properties for many years and never once complained. Unfortunately after this stay I would seriously reconsider my loyalty with IHG especially with Kimpton. First off Kimpton Muse night front desk staffs are very unaccommodating with unfriendly attitudes. The morning staff much nicer has promised me that I could have a late check out to 2 pm and said she would note on the computer. When I confirmed with the night staff he said he could only give me till 1 pm and said no record of 2 pm late checkout on his computer. He and the night manager kept on stating to check back tomorrow morning with the lady who promised me and said its should not be a problem. Why ca n\u2019t they just confirm it now. I was annoyed by the statement and the poor communication between morning and evening front desk staff. What \u2019s more upsetting when I tried to enter the room the room keys two of them did not even work. I went downstairs twice and the keys still did n\u2019t work. The night manager in charge did n\u2019t even try to go out of his way to remedy the inconvenience. He sent a security to open the door for us at least 20 minutes wait in front of the room. The security promised to deliver a new key promptly. Over an hour later no one sent new keys nor informed us the status. I \u2019m beyond upset at this point since we were supposed to go out for anniversary dinner. We decided to cancel our anniversary dinner by now since I ca n\u2019t go thru the same situations up and down to the front desk just to open the door. I called the front desk twice after and the phone kept on ringing. Somehow they decided not to pick up my phone from the room. Later on I sent my friend downstairs to inquiry the status of two new keys promised to be sent right away. Now they said the battery needs to be replaced. That \u2019s it. End of conversation. They sent my friend upstairs with two \u201c not working \u201d keys. it seems Kimpton friendly attitude at least Kimpton Muse toward their guests have lost in translation. I sent an email to IHG which they nicely replied and said that the morning manager has been made aware of the situation and will talk to me. In the morning when I approached the front desk and asked for the manager he is not even aware of the situation. After explaining the situation again they finally sent a technician to my room to try to replace the key. By this time I do not need the door to be fixed since I am staying in and checking out in the afternoon anyway. The morning manager did give me until 2 pm to check out. What bothers me the most again I got a phone call from front desk at 1 pm asking me to vacate the room. It becomes apparent to me that Kimpton Muse staff has communication problems. Also at check in I was given two raid the Bar coupons when I tried to present them during check out they said I can only use one of them and the check in staff should not be giving me two. I am beyond shocked and angry at this point. I think Kimpton Muse and IHG needs to retrain their staff. Also noted the morning manager who gave me 2 pm check out stood there when I checked out with no apology said for everything happened during my stay.", "offset": [1112, 1215], "date": "2019-03-21", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "fc0f04ed-2528-49d3-a24b-5db9f69af306", "sentence": "Great stay at a terrific hotel. We were able to grab a great discount on this website. Kimpton Muse location was perfect a block off Times Square. We were only in NYC for one night but we were attending two shows in the Theater District so location was paramount as we strolled from restaurant to theater to bar to theater. Our Deluxe King room 610 was stylish and quiet and the bed extremely comfortable. There was no view but as I stated earlier we were in New York City so we were not going to spend any time looking out a hotel windowThe Kimpton chain serves wine in the lobby in the evening free which we were told at check in. We also overheard another desk rep tell other guests that breakfast was included. What I did not realize was that those guests were loyalty members breakfast was included for them but not for everyone. It was my own fault for assuming but it would help other guests if it was stated specifically at check in the cost of breakfast.", "offset": [633, 714], "date": "2019-04-11", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "cdb54e0c-b578-494b-8cd8-3141503f54fa", "sentence": "The service at this hotel was unparalleled and it started even before we checked in. My mother and I were on an overnight girls trip in the city but due to street closures and traffic we could not get to the hotel by car. I walked a few blocks while my mother stayed in traffic and I asked the concierge how to proceed. The valet David introduced himself explained where the garage was but I was confused so he walked and found my mother in traffic helped her get to the garage parked her car AND carried our bags to the hotel. In the meantime I was able to check in and they upgraded us to a larger room that was ready early. The room was beautiful and spotless and I wish we had spent a few more days here. When we checked out and went to grab a quick lunch David kept our bags and then had the car loaded and waiting by the time we got back. The whole experience with this hotel and staff was extraordinary but David is a special kind of hero.", "offset": [222, 319], "date": "2019-08-14", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "a62213af-160b-4f1c-a24c-d050adfd7f86", "sentence": "Comfortable clean rooms great service in Midtown. The Muse is fantastic. You are steps away from Times Square Broadway theaters and tasty restaurants. The team at The Muse does a phenomenal job. The front desk people are great about welcoming back return customers. They are also eager to please in terms of making sure you are comfortable and enjoying your stay. I \u2019ve been going to this hotel over the past several years. Sometimes there is a gap of a few months based on my need to be in New York. Still the managers and front desk folks welcome me back like family. Cleaning staff does a first rate job. They have fresh coffee out for guests first thing in the morning. Later in the day they \u2019l have refreshing water for guests leaving or returning to the hotel. They also feature a hosted wine reception in the evening which can be a blast after a day of sightseeing or business. Or it can be great fun before you head out for the evening. This place is a wonderful hotel in a fantastic location.

The Muse was great. Awesome location no matter where you are wanting to go touristy or not. Very close to the theaters and times square. The room was VERY big for NYC. For four ladies it was great. The team at the front desk that welcomed me and my friend was super nice and kind I want to say his name was Chris. He helped us out on our first night and ensured that we had a great visit. The other staff was very welcoming but my only issue was the housekeeping. Not only did they not take our old glasses from previous nights see pictures we were there for 3 nights nor did they replace them they also were INCREDIBLY rude the morning we left. We had late check out noon and at 8 am they came in asking when we were going to leave. They then came back at 1045 which at that point we were almost out but we also had till noon and were all. Oh you are still here.

Our stay was OK. hotel was sold out so it was probably busier than normal and slightly understaffed. Staff was friendly and acomodating. Our room was not particularly clean.
