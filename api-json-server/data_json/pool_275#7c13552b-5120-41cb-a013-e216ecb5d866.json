I could not have loved this experience more. Check in was friendly and warm unlike the typical Hilton experience. Anything we needed was taken care of quickly. The room was gorgeous had a great view of the city and access to the rooftop pool deck that was divine in the evenings. My only hang up was the valet and the doorman. The valet was slow and sort of clueless. The doorman was more concerned with talking on the phone and looking angrily at people than welcoming people to the hotel and doing his job.

Have stayed before here so always great place close to LA Live Staples Center for our events. Rooms are big and nice. 1st odd event is all places downtown now have security and at night the security were acting as doorman. I want security out of the way and doorman to be door man. at one point 2 security and 2 door man all in the way. 2nd issue is this hotel had the best pool on the roof top and though we never use the pool it was so nice to sit up on the roof and over look the city. Well now the pool is filled and beach style chairs fill the space but on Saturday night we brought up a few friends to enjoy the view but it was closed for a private partyMore and more hotels are using amenities for extra revenue stream but our bill was no less because if a major amenities we wanted to use was blocked from useNot a big deal just more annoying to have to go to a different hotel The Strand to do what we wanted to do at our hotel we paid forGreat area close to subway lightrail lots of good places to eat and drink seem pretty safe no real issues and we stayed out late. Always a movie or commercials or TV shows being filmed every time we go. Wish the bar was a little more friendly and people focused always seemed empty. Front desk was a little slow so we would call in needs and request. Shower need adjusting and heater did nt work 1st night but fixed the next day. Missing mini bars refrigerators. Over all a great stay but with a few tweaks could have been perfectWould stay again.", "offset": [387, 538], "date": "2015-03-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "c3b7dfb0-5b8b-4243-9142-d19ca5f20c8a", "sentence": "A Gem in Downtown Los Angeles. full service hotel with handsome bar and rooftop Jacuzi no pool anymore. corner room was flooded with sunlight and nice views of the city. great location. downtown location close to shops restaurants museums and it is all in walking distance.", "offset": [31, 103], "date": "2015-03-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "0f601f5d-a70b-4f63-8436-3023dd3b80a2", "sentence": "Kiss the cook shoot the decorator. I stayed this weekend at the Hilton Checkers hotel. I decided to book the Penthouse because I could get it at a reduced rate due to hotel points. I was so excited to stay there. The location is fabulous right next to the grand Downtown Library. The rooftop terrace was superb and open to all guests spectacular views of downtown a little jacuzi hot pool and elegant furniture. The staff was great and 5 stars plus to the cokI had a bar special Vietnamese Chicken which I highly recommend to anyone who likes spicy hot chicken. Now the negatives the decor in the Penthouse was atrocious. It looked like a cross between a bordello and 1960s Las Vegas gangster. The Penthouse was all black inside the wallpaper black and gold the bedroom gold vinyl textured. The carpet. Black and Tan textured. I could not sleep at all. I do not think there are many guests in the penthouse because there were 3 large moths in it. The handyman killed one I killed the other two during the night.

Upon entering the lobby you will be greeted by a friendly staff when you check in to the Hilton Checkers.

Hilton Checkers is a Hilton located in downtown Los Angeles in a renovated building originally built in the 1920s. The property has a small boutique flair with Hilton standards. Rooms are appropriately furnished with the expected firm beds comfortable pillows and soft sheets. Business men seem to be the primary customers. However for some reason throughout my six days stay it seemed that something was not quite right see cons below. The elevators and room has proximity sensor where you put the room key next to operate the elevators or open the door. I expect Hilton properties to meet certain standards and Hilton Checkers fell a bit short. PROs Unique boutique style hotel with character and flair Penthouse on the top floor with a great view overlooking downtown Los Angeles and jacuzi Bar with a great selection of beverages but \u2026. Great gym \u2013 Precor equipment 2x Elipticals 1x recumbent bike 3x treadmills. dumbbells from 5 \u2013 50 pounds but \u2026 CONs Although the bar has great selection they ran out of the draft IPA on Tuesday only on Thursday did we find out that they were going to replace it with another brand. Service was hit or miss depending upon who was tending the bar. After three nights my buddy and I decided to imbibe elsewhere Although the gym had great equipment ventilation was lacking \u2013 when full Monday Tuesday morning stagnant sweaty air permeated throughout the gym. NOT good. Additionally on Wednesday morning there were NO towels in the gym. I walked down to the front desk to inform them and they stated that they would immediately bring some up to the gym. I started my cardio routine \u2026 30 minutes later no towels. UGH Much like the hit or miss service at the bar the front desk service seems fit the same standard hit or miss. I expect a certain level of standard from Hiltons \u2013 the certainty is what makes staying in Hilton brand properties automatic.

Stayed one night. Took advantage of a very inexpensive upgrade to the Penthouse Suite. Room is huge you can really lose yourself in there. The carpets are old and there were many deep scratches on the wooden floors. There is a gas fireplace that actually worked we checked. The room has a door to the outdoor patio but I did n\u2019t like that the patio area is shared with the public patio. I feel the penthouse patio area should have been private. There is also a jacuzi on the top floor public patio but the water was cold. the biggest issue was that we could not figure out how to get the air conditioner to cool the room. The room was 80 degrees I bit warm for me I could n\u2019t sleep. I threw in the towel at 5 am and called the front desk. Staff was sent up and he could n\u2019t figure it out either. Finally decided to open the two windows for a slight relief. Front desk staff at check. in was super delightful. The building is one of the oldest in town according to the staff and supposedly was the tallest building in LA upon opening. However now surrounding buildings tower over it. I went to get breakfast at the restaurant but the staff did n\u2019t seem in to much of a hurry to let me take a peak at a menu so I left. The penthouse would probably be great for a Hangover Type Party as I do n\u2019t see how much harm could be done to the old room.
