When I arrived I was told the fitness room was under renovations so if we wanted to use a gym we had to go to the hotel across the street. They could have mentioned this when I was looking to make reservations. There is a card in the washroom listing the complimentary services available should you need anything ie shampoo phone charger etc. When I called for more Kleenex and shampoo not only did it take awhile for someone to answer the phone the items never arrived. I had a pedicure at the spa in the hotel and the esthetician was not very friendly. It was the fastest pedicure I have ever had and she did a good job but I am paying for the experience being pampered friendly service etc. You are required to pay an 18 gratuity for all spa services as well as at the restaurants in the hotel. I disagree with this. A gratuity is EARNED. I do not mind paying 18 if the esthetician earned it but I would have left less. Overall I will return to Miami but will stay at another hotel.

My husband and I stayed at the EPIC August 29 30 and had a terrific stay. They were undergoing some construction so navigating in to the hotel itself was a bit challenging. However once inside everything was very convenient. We were checked in by a very kind gentlemen who felt badly we had just missed their nightly happy hour. He provided us with vouchers for cocktails on their rooftop bar. Our room was absolutely gorgeous and we had a great view of the water and a nearby dog park great for those of us missing our four legged friends at home. We did visit the roof top bar and the views were spectacular. The hotel provided a coffee bar in the lobby each morning and all of the staff was very helpful. The only 2 minor items that made our stay less than perfect the hotels rooftop pool was closed for renovations during our visit. Kudos to the hotel for working out an alternative we were able to visit the pool at the Intercontinental hotel just 3 blocks away. While I was really looking forward to the gorgeous setting at EPICs pool I thought this was a great compromise. The other issue was our room did not not have a great hot water temperature. Our showers were never much hotter than luke warm. Good news is in the August heat we were not too disappointed but if I had been traveling at another time this would have been frustrating.", "offset": [739, 867], "date": "2017-11-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "9638c1b2-a72a-47d0-b8bd-6d4de8e3e258", "sentence": "Lovely pet friendly. hotel in a great location.

We have stayed multiple times at the Kimpton EPIC Hotel and have had an outstanding experience every time. Our most recent stay was over Thanksgiving 2017. There were some renovations going on which made for dirtier balconies but otherwise did not inconvenience the guests. The decor of the rooms are very modern and clean. We were fortunate to stay in one of the high floor one bedroom suites and found the views to be breathtaking. As mentioned above the balconies were a little dirty from the renovations but not messy enough to detract from the beautiful city and bay views. Zuma the Japanese restaurant in the lobby was not open during Thanksgiving but is always an excellent and convenient meal if staying at the Epic. I highly recommend the brunch. Parking is a bit on the pricier side but you can enter and exit as many times as you would like. I have also noticed they have installed a new service when you can text your valet code down so the car will be ready for you. It helped to speed up car retrieval times significantly. The additional benefit of staying at this hotel is how conveniently located it is to numerous other hotels and restaurants in the area. I also appreciate the little personal touches that went into our stay. This was our first time travelling to Miami with our little one and they were kind enough to chill a bottle of sparkling cider and provide a very nice hand written note and stuffed toy for our toddler. All the staff from check in to gym to check out were very friendly. I also appreciated the front desk working with us to wipe a charge for a movie that our toddler accidentally purchased surprisingly pricy at 25Definitely also recommend signing up for their Kimpton Karma rewards program as it unlocks a 10 credit for the minibar. Always a nice treat as a midnight snack.

This doubled as a personal and business trip and our business meeting room was great and the food and serving staff excellent. Everybody except valet staff was truly friendly and accommodating. Kudos to management for maintaining that culture. CONs. We were Surprised to experience the following at an IHG property Hotel was under construction pools were closed and we had dust flying into our balcony. I guess the part that strikes a chord with us is that we were not informed when booking. Although they offered sister properties in the vicinity that had pools we could use it is not the ideal. When we visit Miami we love to be able to enjoy the hotel pool without the commute hence choosing the premium hotels. The fact that we were charged regular rate or not even offered some kind of perk made us feel taken advantage of Rooms need better upkeep. You could see the room needed an update and maintenance. There are stains on the carpet furniture and bathroom floors. Wallpaper seams were coming apart in various places and the mattress was. just in very bad shape. Our bed was uneven the headboard side was lower and we had to switch position as we felt our blood rushing to your head. lol.

The hotel is a great value for what you are getting updated modern rooms complimentary happy hour 5 6 daily great location and good hospitality. The junior suite is a worthwhile upgrade as the extra space is wonderful and it is very private.
