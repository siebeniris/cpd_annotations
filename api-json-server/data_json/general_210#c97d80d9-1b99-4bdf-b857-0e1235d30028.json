She informed me that she had worked there for something like 20 years and the other woman apparently did n\u2019t know what she was talking about.

We classify this as a three star business hotel. Upon check in we found the room to be very stuffy and the HVAC inoperative. We called the desk who sent a staff person holding a six inch fan. He tapped the thermostat checked the circuit breaker and informed me that the six inch fan was going to be the solution. I do not know how stirring stuffy air with a six inch fan was going to be an acceptable solution for a four day stay. We went down to the desk but the clerk seemed reluctant to give us a different room. I suppose that this is how a two star flophouse works but not a hotel purporting to be a business hotel. I was required to become a bit strident. This clerk wanted to know if we had used any towels rather than ascertaining how he could make us happy. I told him that until the HVAC was repaired that this room was simply uninhabitable for any paying guest. There was another clerk next to him and it seemed that they were both insulting us in Swedish. I guess this is what happens when you get your front desk staff from farm country. They certainly did not seem to be well acquainted with common practices in the hospitality industry. Grudgingly he gave us a different room. Fortunately the HVAC was functioning and here we remained for our stay. Getting over this unpleasantness we enjoyed our stay. Our room was small was efficiently laid out and our two suitcases could be kept out of the way. The mattresses were good providing restful sleep and the towels were plush. Housekeeping is a bit curious as it has apparently been farmed out to a third party provider. This resulted in seemingly inefficient housekeeping service as the men or women providing housekeeping service did not just go from room to room in a line. This was confusing to me who used to be the weekend maid at my parents motel in my youth. The most efficient method for stayovers was always to just go down the line and not hop around with the cart. The breakfast area offers a wide variety of choices and the wife particularly enjoyed the salmon while I enjoyed the freshly baked bread. The train station is next door to the hotel and the subways are located one floor below. At the SL office we purchased our three day passes and were thus able to ride buses subways and certain local ferries.

This was really nice surprise. We came just for two nights and we did n\u2019t have time to prepare so we asked staff to bring slippers bathrobes and dental kits that we were provided as fast as it was possible. We had breakfast in the room which was really nice as it was suprise staff did n\u2019t disturb me just knocked in the morning and brought that nice playe full of tasty breakfast. After breakfast we decided to experience hotel \u2019s spa facilities. Well we were a bit disapointed as we did n\u2019t had anything we came in bathrobes and luckily spa receptionist gave us towels which is not allowed as fas as we understood. Spa overall was nice separate female and male saunas pool and jacuzi. Jacuzi to be honest with you was too hot it was really hot like 40 degrees which is not really good for health. After we came from spa we found opened window in the room which was really unexpectedly. It was 5 outside and of course after it was cold in the room. In the evening we enjoyed nice roof top bar and we suggest everyone to go there really nice coctails nice and professional staff. One of the main things that we worried about was the noise noise from the doors that were closing and making so big noise. Everytime when neighbor closed door we woke up. I understand that it is not guest \u2019s fault but the acoustics but it was really annoying.

So I lost two days of training and had to pay for a gym outside the hotel. This withholding of information is a scam the hotel should mention this access restriction when we pay.

Secondly our room was not quite ready when we arrived yet we arrived at 200 our bed had not been prepared. Thirdly the pool is not a swimming pool but a tiny pool. It is clearly stated that diving is forbidden but both children and some adults jumped in the water permanently under the eyes of a supervisor without the latter intervening it is always nice to have a child jumping over your head when you are in the water. I have never seen such a badly managed space with no rules followed. Finally the sauna is not mixed and it is tiny.
