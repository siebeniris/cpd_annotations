We paid very little and received so much. They treat their Hilton Gold members very very well. We were upgraded to the Executive Floor. The morning breakfast was very good plenty of hot items and cold but no omelet station. The area to eat in is an atrium and is a nice atmosphere. The Executive Floor also includes a cocktail hour alcoholic drinks are not included there are soft drinks and appetizers. Much better than standard Embassy Suites fare. They have veggies and dips and some hot appetizers. Late night they put out huge cookies coffee tea and hot coco. A great way to end the day. Abdul a concierge on the Executive Floor was extremely helpful and answered every question we had and accommodated all of our requests. He helped make our trip much more enjoyable. Kids loved the outdoor elevators with a view of the city. You can walk inside between all the enclosed walkways to get almost to Centennial Park. Great for bad weather. About 20 mins from Emory and Bulkhead and great shopping. The self parking was very convenient. The hotel is a few minutes drive away from the MLK Sites Mary Mac Tea Room delicious the Jimmy Carter Library and walking distance from World of Coke Centennial Park the Aquarium and CN Center. Great value for a solid hotel. The rating of this hotel should be higher than it is. It is not a luxury hotel but it is a solid business hotel that also works for a family of travelers.", "offset": [841, 885], "date": "2015-01-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "170fdcf8-251e-41a1-a125-52108afaa7f6", "sentence": "Visiting family was a very easy on and off of the highway.

Recently stayed here a few nights for a short business trip. Ended up upgrading to the executive floor for no other reason than to get breakfast and what I thought would be a better service.

The hotel has a great location in the heart of downtown Atlanta. It looks like a higher end large Hilton with all the amenities. There is a pool and 2 tennis courts that are a real plus if you are combining vacation and work on your trip to Atlanta. The rooms look nice and are spacious. The real problem for me was the lack of service. It has the look of a 4 star property but the service from a 2 3 star hotel. I asked for room service and it took over 1 hour to come. There were just 2 towels in the room and I called for more. That took over 15 hours. If I had wanted to go straight to bed it would have been impossible. I got into bed and tried to use the phone to set up a wakeup but it was broken. I had to get out of bed to walk to the desk. No one told me about wifi at check in. I asked to have my breakfast charge posted immediately so I could check out and the waitress assured me that was done. When I went to check out nothing had posted. Another delay. All in all if you get a great rate at this hotel it is probably worth it.

The check in staff was wonderful. The concierge was fabulous. BUT not having the room cleaned until 530 pm was rotten. We came back to take a shower and go out to dinner but the room was still a mess used towels were not collected. We put a note on the bed not to change the sheets for water conservation purposes and the housekeeper did not even have the courtesy to make up the bed when he. she finally came at 530 or 6 pm. We left a 20 tip and got shabby housekeeping service. The WIFI did not connect for us and when we left Sunday morning the exit line of cars was so long it took us 15 minutes just to get out of the parking garage. Why not use the two exit lanes you have at peak hours. Also I was not able to regulate the room temp. It was FREEZING in the room all the time even though I moved the temperature arrow up to a higher temp. That combined with the rain left me with a sore throat and a head cold to travel with. We were very disappointed with your hotel for the above reasons. They are all fixable and I hope you will do that.

My wife and I booked this hotel for a weekend away from home as we traveled to downtown Atlanta Stone Mountain. During our research for a nice hotel the pictures and description was just what we were looking for. Upon arrival we were welcomed by the front desk in a very rude and short manner. The front desk was not only short but did not explain any of the amenities that the hotel had to offer. When we arrived to the room the first thing we noticed was hair all over the bathroom vanity toilet and bathroom floor. Due to the fact that we just drove 4 hours to get there and it was late we overlooked the mess sat down our things and made a trip to the bar downstairs for a night cap. The bar area had a great presence around it as multiple people were having a good time so we were under the impression that this bar stayed open fairly late as it was currently 145 pm when we arrived down stairs. We took a seat and was completely ignored by the bar staff and servers to the point that I had to go up to the bar to order a drink. When I walked up to the bar I was spoken to in a very rude manner by what seemed to be the bar manager telling me that I needed to hurry up because this is last call. I had no issue that the bar was closing however it was the way the manager spoke to me that had me question our current reservation there along with the front desk staff but we continued along with our night. Going back to our room we started to notice more and more filth. The head board had a grease spot on it from the back of someones head the lamps in the room looked like they had not been dusted since they was placed in the room the mattress cover was full of holes to the point that I actually woke up in the middle of the night with my foot in one of the holes the alarm clock was covered in food and dust the base boards was disgusting in hair and dust and there was a blood spot on one of our pillows. We woke up the next morning in hopes to start off with a new crew but that was not the case. The morning staff at the front desk was just as rude and basically called me a liar when I had to explain to the associate that we were charged for valet when I self parked. The whole time that the associate was fixing his error on our invoice he cussed and rolled his eyes the whole time then handed me the invoice and walked off. I had to come back to the front desk to have another associate explain the invoice to me because their credits on the invoice looks like an additional charge. I am a Hilton honors Gold member and stay at my fair share of Hiltons and this was by far my worst experience so far. The only good things I can say about this Hilton was the breakfast was actually outstanding as they had multiple items to choose from along with a person there to make omelets and that it was convenient to be downtown. Other than that I felt that I wasted my points as this is what I used to book the room and will not be making any future reservations at this hotel.", "offset": [564, 733], "date": "2018-05-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "family"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "8e8cb03a-1d45-4156-bed0-b749b198fe9c", "sentence": "This is not a hotel for families with young children especially during event times.
