Yes please. First off we love Kimpton Hotels and the fact that THIS one was less than a 10 minute walk to concert we were attending at the Saban Theatre made it a slam dunk. Beyond that you can also walk to numerous art museums the La Brea Tar Pits and slightly farther but totally do able the wonderfully historic Farmers Market. Getting back to the hotel. typical of Kimptons the service was wonderful. Allowing us an early check in complimentary champagne and fruit sweets tray celebrating special occasion and a concierge Mark who personally emailed me before our stay and was super helpful. They even downloaded a pic of our dear dog and had it in a frame on the nightstand when we checked inThe room was lovely if slightly small ish but nicely appointed comfy bed big flat screen lovely shower and products to go with it flamboyant plush robes and view of the Hollywood Hills. We were on the top floor and had a nice hillside view. Wonderful rooftop restaurant bar set around pool with panoramic views. Note pool is super small and only 3 feet deep. The menu was small but delish and healthy. The service again impeccable. Great vibe and the setting felt like we walked into a Robert Altman movie. Parking is valet and kind of spendy but the service was super prompt. The front desk staff were wonderful and recommended an AMAZING Mexican restaurant that you should try called Mercado. In short they GET it.

I will say the morning breakfast bar is very very well done also. My favorite was the yogurt parfaits so good. The coffee was good and included cold press coffee. For being included in the hotel stay it was a very thoughtful arrangement. Again the staff needs to keep up on making sure there are enough plates and coffee for their guests. A couple plates about 5 looks nice but everyone was asking where are the plates.
