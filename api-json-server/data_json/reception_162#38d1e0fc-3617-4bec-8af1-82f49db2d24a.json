I can understand the postioning close to the railway do not help but at the same time this i believe you could not offer the brekfast 30 cm from the rats.

Novotel has been our choice for many years and we were really impressed by this newly renovated hotel. It is in a great location just of the edge of the Old Town which is hot and hectic in August. The modern design of the public areas of the hotel are of high quality and include a nice outdoor space. Having been recently renovated our room was modern and spotlessly clean. The gym is equally new but has no water. Amongst the long list of positives about this hotel the thing that stands out are the friendly and helpful staff. From the reception staff who have to deal with a reception desk clearly designed by an architect not a receptionist to the restaurant staff dealing calmly with the bunfights at breakfasts they were excellent. Not forgetting the housekeeping who were genuinely friendly. The \u201c but \u201d is the disaster that befell us and the management \u2019s response. Our car with rofbox was too high for the hotel car park. The receptionist advised us to park in a public car park two blocks away which we did. When we went to collect the car the car park was occupied by a market and no sign of the car. The receptionist was very apologetic offered to pay the recovery fee and was helpful in phoning the police and compound where the car had been towed. A police station taxi ride an industrial estate and three hours in 30c later we had our car back. The manager offered his apologies as we finally got to check out at 20pm. I pointed out that we owed money for four drinks from the bar the previous night expecting this to be waived and the manager said \u201dyou can pay the receptionist \u201d. I was not happy.
