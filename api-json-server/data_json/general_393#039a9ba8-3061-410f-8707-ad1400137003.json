The wifi on the ground floor was perfect it would appear our rooms 2 on the 3rd floor facing the hotel courtyard must of been so far away from the signal as it was pretty much non existent yet friends staying on the same floor facing the river had no issues what so ever. Out next problem appeared to be the shower in our room it appeared to have a mind of its own. It could n\u2019t decide weather it was a shower or a bath again this was reported to reception but the problem without any real success again it was good job we had 2 adjoining rooms as 1 room the shower worked fine and the other had a mind of its own.

It was a catastrophic stay for us and I really expected so much more from a hotel with 4 stars that belongs to the Radison Group. It started with the booking I booked a Junior Suite online and checked with the hotel reception by phone to make sure I really get this room with the nice river view. When we arrived it turned out that the hotel was overboked and we will only get a standard room of course without river view. We did not accept that so they upgraded us to an apartment of course without river view. When we enter the room we were quite in shock there was used linen on the sofa the bathroom not clean and LOTS of hair in the bed and on the pillows. We complained and the staff replaced the linen while we were out for a beer. When we came back the room was more clean but in the bed and on the pillows there was still plenty of hair. No manager available in the night shift so we complained next morning and got a new room and guess what LOTS of hair in the bed and on the pillows. we are talking about 10 15 hairs of different size and color on each pillow. Easily visible. How can you miss thatThis hotel definitifely has a problem with the cleaning and with the management. After we complained again the manager promised to fix it this time for good we got new linen on the bed but again with lots of hair on it. The management finally gave up and the celaning staff did not even bother looking at it. Just a reminder for the hotel management you do not get your stars for a clean bed. A clean bed is the MINIMUM requirement for every hotel even with zero stars. The breakfast was quite nice but even on sunday at 930 of the clock they did not care to refill things. Salad was out Ketchup not available rolls just empty eggs only available from time to time. You have to ask several times untiul they find something in the kitchen. But only if you are lucky. Very strange I have never seen something like this in a 4 star hotel. The only positive experience in this hotel was the Spa area which includes a nice Jacuzi a fitness area large swimming pool and 3 saunas. The Spa staff is polite and competent as well as some of the reception staff. We have no intention to go back to this hotel there are better choices in Bratislava. Next to the cleaning problem we were very disappointed by the management of the hotel. If a guest complains about very visible and present cleaning issues 3 times you should really make sure there is no 4th time to complain.

Grupo Radison. Comenz\u00f3 con la reserva reserv\u00e9 una Junior Suite en l\u00ednea y verifiqu\u00e9 con la recepci\u00f3n del hotel por tel\u00e9fono para asegurarme de que realmente obtuviera esta habitaci\u00f3n con la hermosa vista del r\u00edo. Cuando legamos. result\u00f3 que el hotel estaba sobrecargado y solo obtendr\u00edamos una habitaci\u00f3n est\u00e1ndar por supuesto sin vista al r\u00edo. No aceptamos eso as\u00ed que nos pasaron a un apartamento por supuesto sin vista al r\u00edo. Cuando entramos en la habitaci\u00f3n est\u00e1bamos bastante en shock hab\u00eda ropa de cama usada en el sof\u00e1 el ba\u00f1o no estaba limpio y MUCHOS pelos en la cama y en las almohadas. Nos quejamos y el personal remplaz\u00f3 la ropa mientras est\u00e1bamos fuera por una cerveza. Cuando regresamos la habitaci\u00f3n estaba m\u00e1s limpia pero en la cama y en las almohadas todav\u00eda hab\u00eda mucho pelo. No hay ning\u00fan gerente disponible en el turno de la noche. as\u00ed que nos quejamos a la ma\u00f1ana siguiente y conseguimos una nueva habitaci\u00f3n y adivinen qu\u00e9. MUCHO pelo en la cama y en las almohadas. \u00a1. Estamos hablando de 10 15 pelos de diferente tama\u00f1o y color en cada almohada. F\u00e1cilmente visible. \u00bf. C\u00f3mo puedes extra\u00f1ar eso. Este hotel definitivamente tiene un problema con la limpieza y con la administraci\u00f3n. Despu\u00e9s de que nos quejamos nuevamente el gerente prometi\u00f3 areglarlo esta vez para siempre tenemos ropa nueva en la cama pero otra vez con mucho pelo. La gerencia finalmente se rindi\u00f3 y el personal de celaning ni siquiera se molest\u00f3 en mirarlo. Solo un recordatorio para la gerencia del hotel. no consigues tus estrelas para una cama limpia. Una cama limpia es el requisito M\u00cdNIMO de cada hotel incluso con cero estrelas. El desayuno era bastante bueno pero incluso los domingos a las 930 no les importaba relenar las cosas. La ensalada estaba fuera el ketchup no estaba disponible los rollos estaban vac\u00edos los huevos solo estaban disponibles de vez en cuando. Tienes que preguntar varias veces hasta que encuentren. algo en la cocina. Pero solo si tienes suerte. Muy extra\u00f1o nunca hab\u00eda visto algo as\u00ed en un hotel de 4 estrelas. La \u00fanica experiencia positiva en este hotel fue la zona de Spa que incluye un agradable jacuzi una zona de gimnasio una gran piscina y 3 saunas. El personal del spa es educado y competente al igual que parte del personal de la recepci\u00f3n. No tenemos intenci\u00f3n de volver a este hotel hay mejores opciones en Bratislava. Al lado del problema de la limpieza nos sentimos muy decepcionados por la gesti\u00f3n del hotel. Si un hu\u00e9sped se queja 3 veces de problemas de limpieza muy visibles y presentes realmente debe asegurarse de que no haya 4ta vez para quejarse. \u00a1 Resuelve el problema de tu cabelo es asqueroso.", "offset": [2810, 2835], "date": "2019-06-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "c3fbeb9d-00d4-427e-b714-3daad5d15106", "sentence": "Great hotel and locationBreakfast could have been much better for a hotel I \u2019d this standard.
