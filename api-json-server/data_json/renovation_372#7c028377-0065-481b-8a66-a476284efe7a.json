Not sure how this hotel got a VIP rating but compared with others I have stayed at this was disappointing. Nothing big but all the little things added together. Even though there were 2 of us sharing we received 1 complementary welcome drink and 1 complementary bottle of water. Other VIP have always extended those small amenities. When the heat is our room stopped working on the second night and 2 service men failed to get it going again we were offered insultingly so in my opinion a complementary bottle of water for the inconvenience. Since changing rooms for the last night seemed pointless the offer to space heater was accepted but that died in the middle of the night. The mandatory VIP parking at 26 seemed pricy and the fire station across the street was very busy so lots of siren noise. Always be wary of hotels that do not post pictures of the bathroom although it was clean the utilitarian sink tapes and bent pipe faucet were amusing. Over all just a very disappointing stay Not very much Gas Lamp area is within walking distance but next time I had stay elsewhere Bathrooms need updating.", "offset": [967, 1121], "date": "2015-11-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "85ba4d04-0930-4d54-98af-66a9aeb7f86d", "sentence": "do nt understand pther revues.

I noticed there were ear plugs on the dresser but I did not realize why until 60 am came and I was awoken by the loud sounds of trucks rolling over the train tracks nearby. There was not much of a view but I did not come for the view so it was fine. The decor was okay but one of the most exciting things was that while I was staying here they were making plans for renovating the hotel. It sounded very exciting and I think I will return later to check it out. From this location I was able to walk to the gaslamp district as well as to seaport village.

Great location easy walking distance to Gastown and with slightly longer walk Little Italy 92 bus to from airport just 12 block away. Staff pleasant to deal with. Free WiFi works well.

No room fridge in our room not sure if this is the case for all rooms. Lots of street noise weekdays after 545am weekends a bit later. recommend trying to get a room facing away from 1st or C street andor on upper floor. They DO provide earplugs with the rooms. Memo to hotel management next time you renovate get double pane glass for the outdoor windows at least on lower floors. Yes you do not need it for energy saving reasons in San Diego but there is a big sound insulation difference.

The room itself is very updated contemporary and stylish. Bed was a bit soft for my taste and only had feather pillows which are n\u2019t my favorite but I \u2019m sure many would find it perfectly comfortable. The bathroom had nice sized dedicated shower stall instead the typical bathtub shower combo. It seems like a recently updated bathroom. I was there for five days and the one piece of furniture I really missed was a set of drawers. Storage consisted entirely of a small closet which is fine for a couple days but drawers are nice when staying a bit longer unles you enjoy living out of your suitcase. I \u2019d have preferred some drawers instead of the massive 55 or 60 \u201d LED tv which I never used. Or put the tv on a stand with drawers instead the fancy but otherwise worthless stand it is on. WiFi was horrible constantly dropping out on all my devices iPhone iPad and Dell laptop. I ended using my cell phone for a wireless hotspot good thing I have an unlimited data plan because their WiFi was so useless. Worst part however was the noise. It \u2019s always a bad sign when you walk into your hotel room and there are two sets of earplugs by the bed. The hotel is located between a fire station on one side and a fire and rescue station on the other side. Plus every 20 30 minutes this horrible trolley sounds it \u2019s klaxon horns multiple times as it passes every nearby intersection. So between the sirens and the klaxons I got very little sleep. I ca n\u2019t sleep with earplugs wedged into my ears all night \u2014. that is way too painful so I just got awakened constantly. In summary as lovely as the room is decorated I would never stay in this hotel again. I would opt for one of the hotels down by the bay away from the fire stations and the god awful trolley which frankly was more obnoxious than the sirens.", "offset": [51, 108], "date": "2018-04-12", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "47f4a3e8-5a62-4c92-8e90-19fc3139ca4c", "sentence": "Exceptional.

Most people complain about the expensive parking but really this is the perfect location to walk mostly anywhere so normally I was freaked out about this fee since almost all the reviews complain about it. But TRUST me its worth it. Steps from Horton Plaza and a ton of good eats cheap and expensive alike. Cofe Cap Machine in the Lobby was awesome. I met one of the staff members asking about where to thrift in the area and she was AWESOME her name is Hope. She really needs a place at the front desk wink wink. We were with a group of people that were in and out and the Hotel was very accommodating to our event. My husbands Bike broke down and the parking attendants and maintenance staff were very helpful and even offered to help jump start his bike.
