Wifey and I were looking for an overnight destination near our home to get away from house and family stuff for our anniversary. Chateau Elan is only 30 minutes from our house and we had never been. The hotel is attractive and once you get inside you see it is big really big. The atrium area is a massive 3story space under skylights. The Versailles restaurant takes up about half of the floor space and the other half was used for a couple of weddings the afternoon we were there. Our room was king bed. The room is big and has all the amenities you had expect. The bed is comfy and tall. My wife who is vertically challenged laughed about the trouble she had climbing into bed. Any shorter she is 53 and she had need a step stool. The room was absolutely silent. I do not know if there were not guests on either side of us or if the soundproofing is good but the room was so quiet. The air conditioning was almost unnoticeable noise wise compared to some hotel rooms where the AC compressor shakes the windows. We ate dinner and breakfast in the Versailles restaurant and had nightcaps in the Lauberge Lounge. I review those separately but I was pleased with everythng we had. We used valet parking since it was in the upper 90s when we checked in and the self parking area is a decent hike. Getting out car took just a few minutes and the cost was 20. Not unreasonable. Overall it was a nice stay. The service and staff were excellent. Since it is a resort the prices are a bit high but we knew that going in.

Well. My wife and I are not hotel nor resort snobs and while we both this property a thumbs up we struggle to rate it higher than a 75 out of a ten.

Now if there is a scheduled comprehensive rehab upgrade of the property planned then I will eat crow. For the typical rack rate for a weekend I believe guests have high expectations ourselves included. The food at the main restaurant located within the actual winery facility was very good as was expected. The service was exceptional with great product knowledge expressed by staff. The tastings are generous with their Ouse wine Velvet taking the number one spot in both popularity and in taste. The pool is nice with a large hot tub and a waterfall.

I agree with all poor reviews of Chateau Elan. I was really excited to spend some time alone with my husband in the resort. The room was outdated. The desk chair was ruined with large pieces of top leather peeled off the mirror was supposed to be antique looking but just looked really ugly. The carpet has stains which you can see in the mirror pic. The plastic coffee maker and actual coffee is the cheapest type. The bed was comfortable but the bedding sounded like it had plastic in it and is very noisy and not cosy and comfortable. The robes were not even ironed and I think just replaced on hangers as they were so visually unappealing and seriously wrinkled. Wish I had taken more pics. The corduroy type chez lounge was old and looked as if it needed a steam clean too. We paid for late checkout and had a do not disturb sign up and yet housekeeping knocked twice and woke us. The view we had was of the top of a low roof and we kept the curtains closed since it was so ugly. The bathroom was lovely with a great bath and shower although no bath sheets even just normal towels and very basic soaps etc. I was very disappointed as I have stayed in far superior accommodations world wide for much less than the cost at Chateau Elan. I did purchase a sale price on their room as they had Christmas specials and am thinking that perhaps they offer their ugliest rooms to those who buy on sale. The staff did enquire upon checkout if I was happy with my stay and I wish I had said something now. but at that point I was annoyed wanted to leave and knew they would not have done anything about it anyway since these are their accommodations and what they offer.

It all started with my two colleagues and I booking an overnight stay to work and enjoy an evening with the girls. After HOURS of shooting around the property we went downstairs to have dinner at Versailles. Upon sitting we noticed there was only one other couple at the restaurant so we thought perfect our food should be out fast. Boy were we wrong. Not only did it take a long time for the waitress to even come acknowledge us she rushed us. I could totally understand a busy night but on Monday because the winery is n\u2019t open it was completely dead. Our waitress Emie was unfriendly and cold the entire time taking our order. Once we finally were able to order our food came out lukewarm. I was so confused but as I said we were tired and hungry so we ate. Plus we did n\u2019t want anyone to spit in our food. they gave off a warning vibe. We ordered a bottle of wine and would n\u2019t you know it. after tracking her down we had to ask for her to give us clean glasses and water which she reluctantly did and with an eye roll. Needless to say we ended up pouring our own drinks. We eat and asked for a to go bag. She finds one behind the hostess stand and hands me a Chinese take out plastic bag. My colleagues kind of chuckled at how embarrassed she was for the restaurant as she had just traveled from paris just weeks before coming here and definitely was n\u2019t handed a plastic bag to take her food in. After dinner we took a few pictures and headed to our room. We were in our room for roughly an hour before we hear loud banging on the door and a woman clearly drunk and in distress asking for her friend \u201c Andrea \u201d. After opening the door to assist her she assaults us in the doorway. My colleague called security atleast 6 7 times before anyone even answers. It \u2019s 1 am and here I am with two other women having to fight off this lady trying to break in our room. After an elapsed time of about 20 30 mins security finally strolls down the hall all nonchalantly and starts arguing with US. He sees the other woman in the hallway and automatically takes her side. It got worse by what ensued next. Not only did he verbally attack me by telling me to \u201c shut the fck up \u201d he also motioned towards me in a threatening manner and gets right in my face and says \u201c did n\u2019t I tell you to be quiet \u201d. I am completely baffled at how this is a 5 star 4 diamond hotel. I was treated like I was at a motel 8 at dinner then I go to my room just to be attacked by a stranger to then be threatened by security. luxury hotel where. The police should \u2019ve been called on their end and they never did until I called at around 10 am. I asked for management and for her to be put out the hotel she was escorted downstairs just for her to be brought right back to her room where she had a greats night rest right in the room next to us for the entire night. There is also a video of the attack that I am gladly posting on all social media platforms. No one deserves to be treated like they \u2019re second rate threatened or assaulted while in a supposedly luxury safe environment. I \u2019ve worked with some of the most luxurious resorts around the world and NEVER had any of this happen to me before. I am holding the hotel their lack of security and this woman responsible for the events leading up to the bruises and scratches on my arms. Hotel or police would not release her name but she was there on a work trip and claims to not have any recollection of the incident.
