Overall I think this is a great choice for St Thomas but I have a few suggestions for travelers and the hotel. The hotel is on the opposite side of the island from the airport so it can take 45 50 minutes to go about 11 miles. This is an expensive place to stay. It is up there with some of the most expensive beach hotels I have ever stayed in. We upgraded to an ocean view which was an extra 100 per night but well worth it. If you can stay here on business that would be the way to do it. The hotel has incredibly nice staff. The restaurant staff was particularly friendly not just nice but truly friendly. Our room was lovely. The bathroom was large although I think more counter space instead of two huge sinks would have been better. The view from our balcony was beautiful. I would recommend staying away from the rooms next to the ice machine and staff closet Room 215 and anything above or below as it can be noisy. The restaurants are expensive. However we went to a mediocre restaurant in Red Hook and it was expensive too. The breakfast buffet at the Ritz Carlton is 35 per person. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night. The half portions of pasta are small but the salads and appetizers are generous. The bread and tapenade are good. It is nice to sit outside and eat on the patio. Not the best Italian but not bad either. While the hotel does not advertise it guests can and should eat at Palazo. This restaurant is located above the ownership units which are somewhat separated from the hotel. It has indoor and outdoor seating with views of the ocean. The owner of the restaurant made a point ot check in with us. The Tagine was very good as was the grilled artichoke. The Pad Thai was a bit spicy for our tastes. Service was very good. Guests should make it a point to go out on the Lady Lyndsey catamaran. We did the sunset sail and it was wonderful. The staff is great the appetizers are quite good and so are the drinks. Since you can not see the sunset from the hotel due to the direction it faces this is a great way to see the sunset. The guests on our sail were all very friendly and we got and shared some good tips about the area. One of the biggest complaints I have about the hotel is the pool and beach situation. There seemed to be too few chairs for the number of guests. Also although I love little kids most hotels of this caliber would have an adult pool. I was surpised at how many young children were at this hotel. The rooms have Nespreso machines which is a nice touch if you like little cups of espresso. Personally I think most people would prefer a Keurig or coffee maker. We had a car during our visit. It was nice to have the car during the day as the taxis are really open air trams and can be very crowded. Driving on the left is not too bad but driving at night is scary. If you stay at the Ritz Carlton you can not really walk anywhere to shop or eat. On the positive side the hotel is very close to the Red Hook ferry which takes you to St John. A day trip that is highly recommended. Overall I think this is a great choice on St Thomas if you do not mind the expense.", "offset": [457, 537], "date": "2015-04-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "942e3b35-43fc-49af-96b4-09d667db325b", "sentence": "Beautiful Property.

The location is awesome whether you are breakfasting in the open air lazing on the beaches or enjoying a quiet evening in the polside cafe. Rooms are spacious and have all amenities. Wifi is excellent. There were lots of activities to choose from like kayaking sailing snorkeling etc. as well as kid friendly activities like feeding iguanas etc. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms were always very clean and organized. Only cons I could find were1. There were bed bugs in the bed. Having never experienced bed bugs previously I searched madly for invisible insects and mosquitoes. Only realized on day 3 last day of our stay that there were bed bugs2. The restaurants all close by 9. So if you prefer a late dinner you have to resort to their late night menu a highly stripped down version with very poor options and not very appetising.

Highlights we were really happy with the room. clean beautiful bathroom spacious enough with a tasteful fold out bed for our daughter even though we booked a resort room on the 1st floor as opposed to an ocean view we were pleasantly surprised with the huge balcony which overlooked the pool and the ocean.

Frankly I do not think they should allow it since there were beer cans and empty cups lining the side of the pool and I prefer to drink my pina coladas not swim in them the beach is rocky not that big and lined with beach chairs. So do not expect an expansive beach for your kids to play in the food is good but as expected very expensive. There is a little store called Zest that serves breakfast snacks and frozen yogurt. The frozen yogurt sadly was bordering on nasty but we had breakfast there bagels english muffins lattes. every morning which was a pleasant experience.

My wife and I stayed for a week in Mid October. I have seen varied reviews so hopefully some perspective will help especially for first time visitors. St Thomas The airport is 45 minutes away. You need to either take a cab rent a private car with driver or rent a car to drive yourself. A cab is usually a 10 12 person van which will take multiple groups till it fills up. That means stopping along the way at various hotels. The cost is lowest. A private van or car would be 90 120 each way. Car rental varies but can be difficult navigating as they drive on the left and have limited street signs. We paid for a private car with driver. We met a couple that rented a car and they said it took over two hours to get to the resort. The Ritz Carlton does not provide transportation. Resort. The Ritz Carlton Resort is made up of multiple buildings spread out along the hill overlooking Great Bay and you may find yourself walking a good distance. The terrain is hilly but they do provide resort shuttles for those that prefer not to walk. Shuttles are golf carts driven by staff. The sister resort next door is the Ritz Carlton Destination Club and you can use the Services Amenities. If you are interested in visiting St John and any of the BVI this is a great location on St Thomas. Room. We booked Resort View with Club Level. The room had a great view of both the garden interior and Great Bay. Based on the hotel set up everyone has a view to the Great Bay but some are a bit better. I posted pictures from the room so you can see. Everything looks exactly like pictures on the Ritz Carlton website. The room bathroom were great. The Club Level provides food and drink from 7 am to 10 pm. We had a buffet breakfast with an omelet or fresh eggs each day. Lunch some days and snacks and adult drinks all day into the night. The offering at dinner is hors doeuvres so not what most would want for a meal. Later evening is small deserts. Dining. the Ritz We ate lunch at Sails twice and Coconut Cove at the Ritz Carlton Destination Club twice. Both were good with no complaints. Serving size was large in our opinion. We were not able to finish our lunch. Viola Sails and Al at Coconut Cove provided excellent service. I do n\u2019t recall the names of our other servers but the people working there were great. We also ate at Bluewater and Grand Palazo Club and both dinners were very good. Note you need to pay via credit card at Grand Palazo Club as it seems to be leasing space at the Ritz Carlton Destination Club. Amenities. Beach is soft sand and little to no waves as it is on Great Bay. The snorkeling is very good and you can use the non motorized equipment as they included in the resort fee. Paddle boats Stand up paddle boards Kayaks Hobie cats Windsurfers and Snorkel equipment. The pool was being resurfaced while we were there. So we did miss having the pool but we could use the Ritz Carlton Destination Club pools if we wanted. We liked the beach but a couple days the noise from the resurfacing got a bit loud. We did n\u2019t use the fitness center. Day Trips. We took the Red Hook Ferry to Cruz Bay in St John. Note it runs on the top of the hour. We arrived at 1005 am and had to wait an hour for the next ferry. We rented a car and drove all over St John. Ate at Skinny Legs in Coral Bay and visited Cinnamon Bay Trunk Bay and had dinner at The Beach Bar in Cruz Bay that night. I would definitely recommend going to St John. We also booked the Lady Lynsey day trip to Jost Van Dyke and White Bay. They pick you up at the Ritz Beach. It is a full day trip with a snorkeling stop followed by an afternoon soaking in the Soggy Dollar Bar in White Bay. Snorkel gear is included. Lady Lynsey is the Ritz Carlton Catamaran but is operated by Cruz Bay Watersports. Thoughts. We really enjoyed our trip and the resort but you have to understand when going to places off season they may be doing repairs or some things may be closed. For example we wanted to eat lunch on St John at the Canel Bay Resort Beach Bar as part of a day trip. When we arrived at the gate we were told the resort was closed for two months as it is off season.", "offset": [1322, 1360], "date": "2016-10-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "6c8cb0bc-14ba-4d82-8e5e-865bfd93c609", "sentence": "Wonderful Vacation Ritz Club. This review is for the Ritz Club. My family of 4 kids are 9 and 10 just returned from a week long stay at the Ritz Club Aug 19 26. In short we absolutely loved it. We stayed in a 2 bedroom 25 bath unit in the Jasmine building. The unit was spotless. The furnishings were clean and felt fairly new. The kitchen is stocked well enough with utensils and pots pans that you can easily make breakfast of eggs and pancakes and simple dinners. We had more than enough space to spread out. Housekeeping was excellent. Our unit overlooked the pool and to the beach beyond. Beautiful view. For us this location was perfect as the kids were up and down a lot from the pool beach. We also purchased beer and snacks at the grocery store so it was easy to go to and from the room while kids played in the pool. Having the washer and dryer in the unit is a nice bonus. We had no problem using only carry on luggage. And even then I felt we overpacked. The pool area was really nice. The staff at the pool is very helpful. We were there during a very quiet week so we could go an hour and be the only people in the pool. This was a huge bonus for us. Others may not like how quiet it was but we loved it. The iguanas that hang out polside are very cool to watch. Kids also had fun with the games ping pong ring toss fosbal etc that are spread around the pool area. The beach on the club side can definitely get lots of seaweed. I had brought water shoes for us and I am really glad I did. There is nothing wrong with the seaweed but if having it under your feet would bother you water shoes solve that problem. I got them on Amazon before leaving for 15 not a big investment for a big pay off. My oldest was not liking the seaweed at all but got past it with water shoes on. They do sweep it. And I have to think that the wind plays a role in the amount of seaweed as some days there was none at all and others lots. However the snorkeling right from the beach is really good. Not to mention just floating on a raft at the beach is lovely. The club pool and beach area so nice we liked it better than the hotel side. As for the hotel side we did go over there at least once a day either for the Lady Lynsey or to get smoothies frozen yogurt at Zest. It is a 5 min walk along a nice path. The infinity pool is gorgeous. Again we there in the low season so it was not crowded though I wonder if in the high season it is packed. The services at the hotel pool and beach are nice passed out fruit kebobs and ices. They do not do that on the club side though you can get up and order anything from the restaurant on the club side. The beach on the hotel side seemed to have less seaweed and easier entry points but there were boats coming and going. Not a big deal but the hotel beach felt busy to me and it must get very crowded. I loved being able to use both hotel and club. We did 2 excursions on the Lady Lyndsey and LOVED both. They were the highlight of our trip. We did the Sunday Brunch and the Turtle picnic. When you see the cost it seems expensive but in the end you get a good value. The crew on both excursions was kind funny and very knowledgable. Highly recommend if you want to snorkel and be out on the water. Food on the boat is good and lots of good drink choices. My youngest 9 yr old did do a short dive lesson with Pentagon. It was her favorite part of the trip. And the instructor was incredible with kids. I never thought she would be brave enough to dive down in the water but she did and she loved it. Another worthwhile expenseNot every onsite restaurant was open due to the low season so I can not say much about the food. We quickly realized that all the food at the Ritz hotel and club was pricey. We did enjoy two lunches at Coconut Cove but otherwise ate in the room or ofsite. Prior to the trip I thought we would eat onsite more as we really did not want to be cooking andor trekking into town. But once we realized there was a good grocery store and that Red Hook is a great little town I was happy to have those choices. We did rent a car so we drove to Red Hook for dinner. XO Bistro was the highest quality meal we had and it is indoors if its a rainy night. but we also really enjoyed Fish Tails and Island Pub for casual food. Ordered pizza for delivery from Se\u00f1or Pizza one evening. My recommendation is spend your money on the excursions offered by the Ritz as they are great. Save your money by eating in town and cooking as the food at the Ritz is pricey. The Ritz food is good but not memorable. The Ritz location feels like a world away from the cruise ships and busy Charlotte Amalie. But the location next to Red Hook is really wonderful. Red Hook is just big enough that you get some variety in food and style and the ferry is there for easy access to St John. The car ride from Ritz to Red Hook is 5 min. If it is a busy time I would ask about parking before driving in we figured it out but seems limited. We did take the car to St John which was a nice day trip. However we did screw up coming back and ended up on a different ferry line they would not accept the round trip ticket so it cost us an extra 30 in the end. In retrospect it was fairly obvious as we seemed to be with all the trucks. The other ferry was clearly tourist. Partially our fault for not asking. We were not interested in shopping so I can not speak to any of there. Bring det. The mosquitos come out at sunset but only seem to really be an issue for an hour. Just bring it you will be glad you did. Keep it in your bag. Spray before going to dinner and you will be fine. No shortcuts on the bug spray. You can rent snorkel equipment at the hotel but you have to return it by 430 every day. My kids own their own so that was convenient. I think if own it bringing it saves you the extra step of walking to and from club and hotel. If you do not then renting is no big deal but just be mindful of bringing it back. My oldest daughter and I did a horseback ride at Golden Age Ranch which was about 10 min away. It was a fun thing to do that was different. Muddy but it had rained the night before. If you want to try something a little different than resort life it is worth checking out. I need to add that all the Ritz staff were amazing. Very helpful and there when needed but not hovering. Also very personable. All in all I can not say enough about our week in St Thomas and at the Ritz Club. It is not an inexpensive trip but we loved every moment. we will absolutely be back.", "offset": [699, 826], "date": "2017-08-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "e37fa878-56e8-4eea-acad-9704dba0c649", "sentence": "St Thomas Great Bay Resort Mariot.

This hotel is not ready to reopen. Welcome Home. That is what we are used to hearing when we check in at a Ritz Property. We book club level because they know I want unsweet ice tea my wife has a gluten sensitivity and they make sure to accommodate her without asking. My grandsons adore the Clubs chocolate chip cookies. We have stayed at many Ritz properties and the service is always a level above any competitor. The Ritz Carlton St Thomas however is not up to any civilized standard for a hotel let alone a Ritz property. This particular property was a victim over 2 years ago of Hurricane Irma and Maria. The property has been closed until recently to go through a 100 M renovation. When we heard they were re opening we booked a trip for us our kids and grandkids as a Christmas present to the family. We always stay on club level so we booked club level rooms. We arrived at the hotel on Tuesday Dec 3rd only to discover that club level is not ready and will not be open for month or more. We were very disappointed because club level is where we congregate as a family on our trips together. The Ritz should have notified us in advance so that we could have made other plans if desired. They did not do so. We also had to wait in line for nearly 20 minutes to check in because they had only 1 person handling check in. They then check us in and send us to our rooms on the 5th floor of E building. They had not bothered to tell us that the elevators in the building did not work. Climbing the hill from the beach to the rooms and then having to climb 5 flights of stairs in addition is not easy for an old fat guy like me. I called to talk to a manager and waited nearly an hour for a call back before I decided to go address my concerns in person. When I arrived at the lobby I found the elevators were not working there either. In fact we have had trouble walking the sidewalks around the resort because they are re tiling portions of them. Construction is going on all over the property and they expect their guests to tolerate the noise. They have hired someone to play music all day long at the old pool and beach to try to cover up the noise but they have to keep the volume too high for some of the guests comfort to accomplish that feat. We have found that the level of service at this Ritz property is not up to Ritz standards not even close. Ritz keeps a comprehensive database on their customers so they know how to attend to them. The concept they push is that if you have to ask it is not service. Currently at this property you have to ask multiple times. Our safe did not work. It had a battery issue. We called Wednesday morning asking they replace the battery. Nothing happened. We called Wednesday evening asking they replace the battery. 30 minutes later someone shows up and then has to leave to get a battery because he did not bring one even though we reported the error. At the same time they elected to fix a light in our hallway that was broken. When we returned from dinner the light was working and hanging from the ceiling. Nice touch. Today we left at 730 am to go on an all day boat charter. We returned this evening to find that neither our room nor our kids room had been cleaned. I called the concierge to get housekeeping but instead had the phone answered by in room dining. I ended up talking to the in room dining manager and he was simply no help. I called and requested to speak to a manager and then got fed up and walked to the lobby to see him in person. He was in a meeting. He did come to my room shortly afterwards and once again promised to make things right. I told him that I was not looking for any special treatment. I simply wanted the service I expect from a Ritz property. I explained that thus far I have received much better service at many Mariot Courtyards. I am not looking for freebies I am not looking for discounts I do not mind paying for service. that is why I have been a Ritz customer for years. However at this property that service is not remotely close to what we have become accustomed to at Ritz Properties. The staff is poorly trained. They do not have enough personnel working in some roles to handle guest volumes. The property is under construction so key facilities such as the elevators are not working. Ritz Carlton should have never opened this property in the condition it is in and they should have been much more extensive in the training of their staff. I can site a myriad of small examples as well but suffice it to say this property is not close to Ritz standards and every guest we have talked with agrees. They will lose business at this property and potentially lose long term Ritz customers like myself thanks to this experience. I plan these Christmas trips for my family and try to make them special. This year is a disappointment thanks to a sub standard hotel. Ritz promotes their properties by asking Let us stay with you.

To be perfectly honest I was a bit skeptical after reading some the reviews here on TripAdvisor. However St Thomas looked like the picture perfect place to spend our 10 year wedding anniversary Mother and 2 children in tow. We rented a beautiful 3 bedroom condo on the resident side. Check in was easy and quick. The welcome cocktail was a nice addition. Our bags were brought to the room in a timely manner by a very nice gentleman whom we looked forward to seeing during the remainder of our 5 day stay. He was just a real gem. Room was very clean and any issues that did arise water was not warm enough to run a bath one evening was VERY quickly resolved. Every employee we encountered was lovely and kind. I really can not say enough about Delta she really went above and beyond to make our vacation one to remember. A piece of beautiful cake and a bottle of wine was a equisite touch as well as a touching hand written card delivered to our residense for our anniversary. We booked a boat rental with Captain Dan on the resort but unfortunately the weather for our day did not cooperate. My Husband enjoyed chatting with him during our stay. can not wait to return to get out on the ocean with him. We spent a lot of time by the pool and beach and while yes the beach is not great for swimming. Its a short distance to impecible beaches our favorite was Magens Bay and sweet spots Captain Dan recommended. We did find some not so rocky spots on the hotel side towards the right side for the children. I also think if we had swim shoes it would have been just fine. Remember also mother nature has done quite a lot to this property in general over the past few years. They have done a tremendous job bouncing back. The family pool on the hotel side was of course under construction but did not bother us. The view from the infinity pool is picturesque and service was great. Staff stopping by to clean sunglasses and give ice pops was a nice touch as well. We were all sad to leave. All in all very satisfied and my family and I can not wait to return.

We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas staying in an oceanfront queen bedroom.

However we were extremely disappointed with the consistency of service offered. We take this special trip every other year and were extremely disappointed with our stay. From the beginning we were not able to reach anyone at the hotel via phone or email to answer questions related to the reservation. One time that I did talk to someone it took over an hour on the phone to attempt to change our room type. After leaving several messages and emails for a concierge no one ever responded. Eventually our Mariot Ambassador was able to confirm everything for us before we arrived. While the check in process was simple through the ap and the welcome lovely after several calls to the front desk we were told that we would need to pay an additional 350 night for access to the Club Lounge regardless of the lifetime status. We made several requests at the concierge desk the pool deck and over the phone to reserve a pool cabana and never received any response. Half of the time when we would call for reservations or room service no one would answer the phone at all. While lounging at the beach the service was spotty and inconsistent at best.

Our room was on the 5th floor of building E and with only one elevator on the other side of the building I would not recommend this hotel for anyone with mobility issues. There are stairs everywhere throughout the main building to and from the pool and the beach etc. The construction of the family pool was very disruptive. It was visible from every room and the hotel attempted to disguise with music that started early each morning on the pool deck with the same playlist each day. The construction definitely cuts into the pool deck and you need to reserve your pool loungers early in the morning if you want a place to sit. At the beach you need to reserve a chair early in the morning if you want to sit in the front row. The attendants were friendly but not helpful even with tips.

The Verdict. This is a nicely remodeled Ritz with well appointed contemporary rooms though would not call them overly spacious some solid food nicely manicured grounds and a pretty infinity pool. That said this hotel has two glaring problems. First its located on a pretty underwhelming beach. If you love the sound of crashing waves the sight of crystal turquoise water and soft white sand on your feet this is not the resort for you. Pretty to look at but ultimately more of a small bay inlet. Pool lovers will likely have no problem here. Secondly the service was pretty hit or miss. We expected this given its a recently reopened resort of this size but disappointing nonetheless. Some highlights. Roms grounds and pool area. Food was solid for a beach resort we liked Aloro Staf is warm and mostly accommodating. Olivia in Guest Relations was wonderful. Arranged all of our restaurants spa transfers etc in advance personally oversaw our arrival checked in with us throughout our stay. But onto the issues Club We had a pretty unfortunate experience here. I will say it is been nicely remodeled. But as it turns out as a Titanium Bonvoy tier you actually DO NOT have access. After being warmly greeted by the staff we were enjoying a glass of wine before dinner when confronted by the Manager asking for our last name. I told her and continued on not thinking anything of it. She clearly went to cross reference and came out to the deck to loudly inform us that we in fact do not have Club access. Sure this was our mistake though Titanium typically gets this perk in the US. She then offered to call the front desk to charge our room 300 night if we would like to keep enjoying during our stay. It was really the delivery that got us upset she was not terribly rude but everyone heard around us and it was embarrassing. Its a 5Star hotel we were n\u2019t trying to sneak into the Club. She offered we could finish our drinks after telling us the hotel is not classified as a US property its in the USVI \u2026. Felt nickel and dimedPol Chairs. I think this is just given they expanded the pool area but the pool furniture should be nicer than beach chairs.

Service in the club lounge was great but at the pool the level of service was not up to the standard one would expect at the price point. There are nowhere near enough chairs at the pool Each of the 4 days we were there we had to wait for chairs forget about a choice of where to sit and some days we were forced to go to the beach because every single pool chair was taken. Overall nice hotel beautiful location but the quality of service and luxury not up to the price point.
