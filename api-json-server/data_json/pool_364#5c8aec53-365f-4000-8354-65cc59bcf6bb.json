The grounds are great with a terrific set of pools including a fun waterslide water features and easy beach access. Our room was problematic the first 2 nights overlooking an outdoor function area. Not a huge deal but the 2nd night there was a party with literally a drum corps. Guests should have been notified in advance it was impossible to sleep until that was done. Another night the AC went out in the entire building. Not fun but the rooms had fans so not as bad as it might have been. Our issues were resolved but I had to do some asking.

We had another great vacation at the Hyat. The regency club is worth it and this property did not disappoint. I recommend reserving a Papala for the week. Yes it was more but we decided to do this vs waiting in line or doing the online reservation. I did not want to be tied to a clock or my phone. We enjoyed the beach attendants especially Rahul. They were all great but Rahul went out of his way to make us feel special. Regency club was great and had a nice selection of food each day. Staff through out the hotel was great and very friendly. We had a nice lunch at the Palms restaurant the fruit tea was amazing and ordered panini sandwiches from Choco starbucks for lunch. Eduardos next door had a great fruit cup too. Loved having a Dunkin Donuts right next door on the beach cash only. As a big Dunkin fan this made fora good morning sitting on the beach. The pool area was nice and we all loved the slide. Recommend Cafe Tau and Gianis for restaurants. We had good experiences with Delphi water sports for tubing Jolly Pirates snorkel tour and the Octopus parasailing. Best happy hour was Petes pier. The weather was great and overall was a fabulous vacation. The only negative was the wifi was spotty and limited to only 6 devices. As a family of four with several phones ipads this was a challenge. Wifi ranged from very good in spots to slow and non existent in other areas. It was not a deal breaker but annoying to the teenagers.

Let me start by talking about the things that could be improved. Hm let me see I guess that is it. Now for the good stuff. Our room was not huge but hey if I wanted a huge room I could have stayed at my home in frozen upstate NY. The bed was very comfortable showers had plenty of hot water and the AC was perfect and quiet. We were there on Super Bowl Sunday. They had a huge screen set up in the water off the shore for the game. Unfortunately they were charging 100 a head to be seated food was includedThe pool and hot tubs 2. were very clean. In fact they have a small army of workers out early each morning cleaning and trimming the lush vegetation. They even have a decent water slide for your entertainment. There is not much natural shade in the resort so you need to get a beach palapa or an umbrella by the pool if you want some relief from the sun. Oh they have palm trees all over the property but they do not provide sufficient shade. They have a number of umbrellas and palapas though. we have been at Caribbean resorts where you had to get out at 50 AM in order to claim a lounge chair or shady spot. At the Hyat they have an interesting procedure to handle this claiming process. Each afternoon at 40 PM you can go to the beach towel hut or go online and reserve your spot for the next day. This worked for our entire stay nice. Some of the more coveted palapas are not free you have to pay extra for them. We found the free beach and pool spots perfect for us. The sea water is very calm and suitable for younger children. There are several small lunch and breakfast places within yards of the Hyat beach. So you can choose to eat at the Hyat or try out one of these places. A relative new eatery was Kouzinas located about 20 feet from the Hyat property line. Great Greek food friendly owners and very clean. Eduardos is right next door and offer the best fruit dishes and super smoothies. At night there are a ton of restaurants within a few hundred yards off the property. Back to the Hyat. there is nothing like coming back from dinner and sitting in the lobby with the continuous warm breeze blowing.

They were all so friendly and wonderful always catering to our every need. Fany especially became a quick favorite of our little boys with her charming lullabies.

We visited the Hyat in March t celebrate our anniversary. The hotel is in an ideal location. The beach is lovely and no need to take a cab anywhere super restaurants right outside your door. The hotel is very well maintained and the staff is very pleasant and accommodating. The fellow guests are very talkative \u2013 a true NE vibe \u2013 NY NJ Boston etc \u2026 As you likely know \u2013 the weather is Aruba can not be beat. Perfect every day with the cool breeze coming off the water. That \u2019s why people come back year after year and this property is lovely and we would definitely come back. But you should know what you are in for before you go. We went peak season \u2013 so we paid a premium. I am not complaining about the room rate \u2013 no issue \u2013 but at this price I expected some luxury. The property is crowded. Not spacious and you are chair to chair by the pool. You have to sign out your towel from the towel hut. I know some people steal towels \u2013 but really. Charge everyone an extra 5 per night and account for the stolen towels. You must also use their system to rent the choice palapas or chairs in advance of your stay. If you do n\u2019t \u2013 you will be accommodated but likely not a great spot. We did rent the big pool cabana for a couple of days. Very nice not to be knee to knee with the other guests but not much is included. They do give you a bucket of beer and fruit bowl \u2013 whole fruit that is not chilled and was not ripe \u2013. do n\u2019t expect much. The food at the resort \u2013 meh \u2026. Not good \u2013 not bad \u2013 just meh. Standard pool fare \u2013 the turkey club was pretty ok. For 20 you get a burger sandwich in a paper \u2018 to go box \u201d and the box will sit next to you for a while before being picked up. Very nice breakfast buffet that was included with our Amex Platinum reservation. All that being said \u2013 you should know what you are in for. From the other guests we spoke with \u2013 who go back year after year \u2013 the other resorts are about the same \u2013 and the Hyat is the best of the options.

We LOVED the Hyat. We had stayed at this hotel 3 4 times in the last 3 years. But likely never again. On our most recent trip we booked in July for September via American Express. When we showed up at the property they had lost our reservation. These things happen however the front of house staff handled the situation without professionalism and without apology. After about 20 minutes of scrambling and me emailing the front desk my confirmation we were told that we would be booked in different room for the first night then the room we reserved for the remainder of the trip a credit would be applied for the difference in rate thanks for giving me back what I paid for. After 2 hours and no updates we asked the trainee at the front desk for an update he had no idea how to respond not his fault. We asked for the manager but no one showed. Important travel tip for this hotel. ASK FOR THE MANAGER 3 TIMES that seems to be the magic number. The manager explained that what we already knew and told us a room was not ready and proceeded to make us wait in the lobby another tip that Hyat has an open air lobby that is not air conditioned. Instead offering a room to change in so my kids could enjoy the pool or even a cooler place to wait both at no cost to the hotel. we were left in limbo. Eventually I called AMEX and had them rebok us at the Ritz Carlton. I explained to the manager as we were leaving with my kids screaming that we love the hotel and spend a good sum of money there every year sometimes multiple times per year did not seem to phase her. I also explained that this is my sons favorite place in the world and that because of this mistake we were leaving perhaps harsh but true. Before I walked away I asked for the GM of the hotel to which she refused and away we went. it is truly sad. the Hyat has a beautiful property with an amazing pool and beach. The proximity to downtown Palm Beach is great. With the exception of the front of house the entire staff has always treated us with kindness and welcomed us as if we were family. If you have never been to Aruba the locals are truly amazing people they are welcoming and loving and I have never once felt unsafe or unwelcomed. Unfortunately for those dealing with the Hyat as their ambassador to Aruba you may be setup for the wrong first impression. Hopefully someone at Hyat sees this and recognizes that they have lost a repeat customer over something as simple as an administrative error that was handled very poorly.", "offset": [1157, 1286], "date": "2019-10-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "6bfcb004-0f7c-4068-811d-9766e1d9a473", "sentence": "The beach housekeeping and reception staff were very professional and helpful.
