Being a seasoned hotelier who has travelled the world to a certain extent staying at the Four Seasons Doha makes you realise how well they understand customer service. Their attention to details and personalisation of every single interaction is a delight. The most impressive remains the Spa with an incredible service and world class level of treatments.

I was undecided before booking between staying here and the St Regis. I ultimately chose this as it looked a little more centrally located it \u2019s not realyThe hotel itself is nice and the restaurants were very good. We tried the Friday Brunch excellent selection and great food and service the Asian restaurant for dinner again very good and breakfast on the beach no faults at alMy big gripe with this hotel was the concierge service particularly a concierge named AhmedAhmed was to setup a city tour one day for us and a custom tour to the camel track and Sheikh Faisal Museum on our departure day. He initially said it would be no problem at all but then spent the next two days giving us multiple excuses for his failure to organize such as every possible guide being full they were not. I called the next day and they all said I should have called the night before \u2026. the day Ahmed was to book for us tour offices being closed because it was Friday they were not again I spoke to mentioned tour agencies on a Friday and that the Museum requires reservations that only his contact could secure the morning of the tour not true after he could not \u2019 get us in I filled out the Museum website form and received confirmation for a same day visit within two hours. He lied to us and put no effort in booking any tours for us. He was always nice when speaking and was very polite I think he \u2019d make an excellent door greeter but as soon as you left his sight it was clear that he put no effort into making your requests come to fruition. We ended up with no city tour we ended up booking a driver to take us to a few city sights and no Museum tour. He just had us play the waiting game to no avail. When we checked out I was asked by the front desk about my stay. I mentioned everything was good except the concierge service and that Ahmed did not treat us right. The guy at the front desk I think he was named Fadi could not be bothered to look up from his screen and just mumbled \u201c sorry bout that \u201d before handing me the bill. Before that happened I would have probably stayed again but after they showed that they really do n\u2019t care I would not stay here again. In my opinion it \u2019s the level of service that sets hotels like the Four Seasons apart from the rest and apart from the restaurant staff who did a great job this hotel just did not measure up. If you do choose to stay here I \u2019d take care of any tour restaurant requests in advance and with another company. If you do end up at the concierge desk make sure to avoid Ahmed.", "offset": [1880, 2045], "date": "2015-05-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "73023bce-8ad9-45d1-a789-40b7d1dea7ec", "sentence": "Clean rooms.

We stayed at Four Seasons Doha for 4 days. Aesthetically the resort was truly amazing. It was beautiful. The rooms were spacious and clean. We were upgraded to a Seaview room and view was breathtaking. From check in the lady who checked in was so nice and accommodating. She assisted me with my inquiry. The Housekeeping during our stay was beyond belief they made sure that the room was neat and clean each and every time we leave the room even if we just went to the pool and the beach. I was not able to meet them personally but please do extend our gratitude. The pool service was superb the Pool service guy with the specs was very attentive and anticipated our needs. Service was way better than other five star hotels where they over charge you even with a bottle of water and they give it to you very cold in an ice cooler for free. Fruit juices are available for free and even fruit snacks and cold towels. The SPA was truly relaxing it was too bad that we were only able to use it during the last hours of our stay. Only downside for me was the sound proofing of the room. We can literally hear the laughing talking and screaming of the guest in the other room. And we got complained for playing loud music which I do not normally get with other hotels even if our music was loud.

First time conducting business here in Doha from the US. The company I am contracting with booked 4 weeks at the Four Seasons. The property is impeccable and the service truly first class as you would expect. However having spent the day at the beach bathing in the beautiful warm waters of the Gulf I became concerned about a rash infection on the heel of my right foot. Unsure of where to go to obtain 1st aid supplies or medical care I called the front desk. Moments later there was a staff member at my door with a first aid kit alcohol prep pads iodine bandages and an offer to get me to a medical facility right then and there. I was more than happy with a simple reassurance that if it did not look better by morning the staff physician would see me and make sure I got proper medical attention. I am sure it will be fine but VERY comforting to have that level of attentive care service and that kind of reassurance when traveling so very far away from home. Thank you Four Seasons Doha.

I only had a really short stay at the Four Seasons as I had a quite long layover at night. In overall I was satisfied with the service the concierge had organized as requested transportation in and out of the hotel When I arrive at the hotel a lady was waiting for me outside the door and we did the check in directly in the room. She was really nice and always smiling. I had booked a premier room which was big a nice bathroom with separated shower and bath. Premier rooms are always overlooking the Arabian gulf it was more or less the case as my view was partially blocked by a sort of dome and a wall. Anyway that was okay as I was only staying for few hours. An other bad point is that my rood had a tiny balcony in order to enjoy fresh air. It would have been nicer if the balcony did not have bird feces on the handle. Also I was disappointed that there are not any concierge in the hotel at night. One thing the concierge should ask guest when organizing transportations to go to the airport is what class they are flying as I wanted to leave the latest as possible the hotel. They proposed 60 am for a flight schedule at 835 am. even though I told hime that I did not have any bags to check in the time remained the same. The departing time was finally changed when I told him I was not flying economics.
