Heres the serious security issue that needs fixed. As a woman traveling alone I expect my room number to be kept as guarded information. The clerk allowed the card with my room number to lay open on the desk with a male guest watching. As I stepped away from the desk he then called my room number out to me. Perhaps Chicago never experiences crime. or perhaps the clerk can tell by looking which guests are robbers or rapists. Hotel staff should ALWAYS use security conscious procedures especially with a woman traveling solo. The third issue cultural sensitivity. Please do not play overtly Christian radio stations in your shuttle bus. I do not need biblical encouragement just a simple ride to the airport. I guess everyone in Chicago is Christian.

We decided to stay here as part of a park stay and fly option for our recent trip. I could not have been more disappointed. It took my husband over 30 minutes to check in with only one person working and a line of people waiting to check in. We finally made it to our room which looked straight out of a 1975 horror film. The hotel is very dark the rooms have not been updated in decades and I was not sure how clean it was. Luckily we were only in the room for a few hours between check in and shuttle service. The shuttle service left at 6 am the next morning for the airport. We were in the lobby at 545 and the shuttle driver yelled at us for being late. The website says it is a 10 minute shuttle ride but really it took over 20 minutes with no traffic to get us to the airport. When we arrived back in Chicago from our vacation we called the hotel to ask for the shuttle to pick us up they said 35 minutes. We still had to pick up our luggage and de plane so no big deal. After waiting a very long time for our luggage and making it to the shuttle we were the only ones on the shuttle the driver continued to question what took us so long and why we were delayed.

The suite was quiet comfortable and easily accessible to the atrium. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the bathroom fixtures and layout was very nice. The overall maintenance of the facility seems to be slipping.

Also much of the exercise equipment is is need of routine maintenance and the weight machine is difficult to use and outdated. The bathroom door is in need of repair on it is backside where water from the tub shower has ruined the veneer. The worst problem was with the breakfast. The bacon and sausage being served was obviously old and stale on the verge of being dangerous. I alerted the waiter about it and observed that he did nothing as in speaking to the cook or floor manager. So I reached the conclusion that food service purposefully uses outdated food to get by on the cheap. Hotel literature and pictures on line show a bathroom scale as being in every room. There was none in our room. Consequently I was concerned that we may be charged for the missing scale but the front desk clerk said the scales had been removed and I would not be charged.

A doorstop was broken and lying on the counter. Further by design the hotel does not have a concierge lounge like a traditional Mariot. Instead there is a pantry for Rewards members note the door was broken but when I arrived at 8 pm there was an empty plate of crumbs. The coffee tea machine was working and there was a cooler with juice and sodas. In the morning at 830am there were a couple of bagels a bowl of apples some rotten and some dry oatmeal you could make yourself with hot water from the tea machine. It was just sad all around. Definitely not worth the 300 I paid. I had rather stay at a Courtyard or a full sized Mariot. This was like the worst of both worlds.
