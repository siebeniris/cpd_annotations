Stayed here recently for a few days while attending meetings for work. I travel all over the country and have over the last few years had the privilege of staying at some of the finest hotels in North America. Looking up the Hyat online I had admittedly high expectations going in especially for the cost of the rooms etc. Located only about 20 minutes away from John Wayne airport it really was not hard to get here and only about 15 with an Uber. After arrival my check in was friendly enough however they had my arrival wrong and had me checking in a day later luckily I save everything and had the confirmation email from my company stating my arrival that day so they made the change but god forbid if I had not had that email how long would I have been standing at that desk trying to get a room. They gave me directions to my room and a map. I thought it was strange I was to be given a map to my room. until I found the room at the other end of the Hotel and after taking many wrong turns. For some reason my meetings were mainly centered at the reception lobby end of the hotel but someone had thought it was a good idea to put me almost at the very end room 2539 which meant that to go and eat attend my meeting or just grab a bite to eat or purchase something from the little village of stores they have it was a 10 minute walk. my commute to work is less than the time it took me to get from my room to my meetings. Also i was not impressed with the view from my room one side of the view was dominated by the wall of the corridor opposite and the rest of my view was looking over the roof of a pool area I had a hard time getting to. The view of Huntington Beach for me was mainly resigned to construction across the road and parts of the hotel building. On the plus side the food I experienced at the hotel was very good quality customer service was good even though they denied my request to move rooms and the one thing i was impressed at is somehow they have elevators down to a fine art. pretty much every time I pressed an elevator button it arrived within seconds such a small detail but important. Nice property friendly staff and great location but be aware of where they are putting you especially if getting around is a challenge for you or if indeed you have kids.
