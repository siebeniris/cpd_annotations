We upgraded to a corner room which was spacious and really nice with a great view of the pool Ideally located that we Ubered to Del Friscos for dinner and stayed at the hotel because of their fun bar with dance floor. The hotel has a great atmosphere and fun clientele. The dance floor starts filling up as wedding guests start spilling in from local weddings they attended and are staying at this hotel. The rooms are really quiet and nice. We will be staying here more often as a fun staycation on the weekends.", "offset": [69, 286], "date": "2015-10-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2e4b5cda-8f4d-427d-8a7a-89f37a5467f1", "sentence": "do not stay here. I pre checked in 2 days prior to my stay and when I arrived at Omni after 3PM the room was not ready and I was told it would be 45 minutes until it would be ready. Lo and behold two of my other friends checked in after I did and received Deluxe King rooms without doing express check in. I had to get ready for a wedding so I was incredibly disappointed that I was not offered another room an upgrade something. I had give this 1 star. In Noe it took 15 minutes for a server to greet me and get my drink order. This bar is not that big and it was not that busy. It took another 25 minutes for the food to come out but the server was friendly and brought me the check right away when I asked. I had give this 2 stars. The valet parking. I do not even know where to begin. TERRIBLE. Omni charges for self parking 20. so I figured I had spend an extra 10 to do valet. Both times I called valet to pull my car around BEFORE I left my hotel room I waited for THIRTY minutes before the car arrived. Unbelievable. The parking garage is literally right across the street. I had give this 0 stars. We also ordered room service breakfast. They forgot the coffee and tea so all we received was toast and apple juice and hot water. Really. I give this 1 star. Overall my experience at Omni Houston Riverway was beyond terrible. From check in to the bar to valet I have never experienced so much incompetence from staff members as a collective whole. I am never one to complain and I always have a lot of patience especially when hotels are busy but the service I received throughout my entire stay was unacceptable. I honestly should have asked for a refund but even that would not make up for all the things that went wrong during this stay. I will not be staying here again and I urge anyone who thinks they want to think again.

I chose this hotel for its pool. Although we were hampered by thunderstorms we did get a chance to swim at night. The large pool is actually 2 separate pools with one being warmed to 82F year round. The Noe restaurant breakfast buffet was outstanding and so was their service. All hotel staff were extremely kind. My only negative comment would be the one road in out of the hotel. While we did not have issues personally there was a prom for a large high school going on while we were there. It seemed that there was quite a long line of cars trying to get into the prom and I imagine many waited for a long time to get in. We were otherwise not impacted by the prom being held there. The facilities are plenty large enough to handle such a shindig and not impact their guests.

My husband and I stayed at the Omni Houston Hotel Riverway for two nights in early December 2018 for a short getaway. With the rewards program Black status we were upgraded to a suite with pool view.

We enjoyed the in room coffee service we had each morning and also the breakfast room service eggs etc. one day. The Whiskey Bar was fun to visit one evening and drinks were good. The restaurant Birdies was very pleasant and the food tasty but the portions were at times small and the overall menu prices were expensive for some of the ingredients and portion sizes. We ate all our meals there and the staff were nice. The pool was beautiful and we were lucky to be there on a weekend with great weather in December 75 degrees and sunny. We did not use the gym but when passing by it seemed spacious with many treadmills and other general equipment. Also the conference reception space seemed to be nice and accommodate large parties for holiday events or weddings.

I was very dissatisfied with this stay compared to other Omni Hotel stays I have had in other cities. There was no refrigerator in the room so forget saving leftovers from restaurants there was no vending machines that we could find to get a drink either on our floor or in the lobby and the hotel store always seemed to be closed or out of what we needed the ice machine on our floor was in some kind of janitors closet with wires from some kind of electrical box sticking out behind it and it was an old school ice machine that had a scoper on a chain instead of just pushing a button like newer ice machines. There is literally nothing around this hotel within walking distance except commercial offices and condos so you have to rely on the hotel shuttle to go eat anywhere but that can lead to extremely long wait times for drop off and pick up if you are there during a conference like I was. The one restaurant this hotel has I thought was terrible with extremely slow service even though I ate there at an off hour time so the restaurant was not busy not a lot of food choices and extremely overpriced. For example I paid 15 for mac n cheese. We were kicked out of the pool on multiple nights BEFORE the advertised closing time posted on the sign and we were NOT being loud in any way. We went to the pool until we were kicked out because there was absolutely nothing else to do or no where to go after the hotel shuttle stopped for the night.
