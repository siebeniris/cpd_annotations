We ended up at the Ritz after United had to cancel our return flight due to a broken door and the rest of the island was booked up full. We frequent Mariot resorts and thought we were used to quite some luxury but the Ritz is a few steps better. The first pleasant surprise was that the front desk was actually a desk on four legs not a bar like structure that staff hides behind. We were greeted with rum punch and incredibly friendly staff guided us to our room. The design of the room was modern. The bathroom was spectacular it had three rooms the main room a large shower cell with the best shower we have ever used and a separate toilet room. The bed was the best one we have ever slept on in a hotel. The beach is truly gorgeous with a nice view of St John. On the beach a friendly fellow finds you a good spot and then packs your chair with towels. The only minor complaint is that the Ritz boat that was picking up passengers for some trip took its sweet time docking in the middle of the beach. Why not on the sideThe breakfast buffet was also fantastic. Omelets yogurts salmon brie cheese croissants bagels fresh fruits and if you want to there is an option or champagne. Now of course this comes at a price. Our room was 131 for the night and the Italian dinner buffet is 125. Should you want more affordable options check out the Red Hook marina. On the other hand small medication was cheaper than at the Mariot Frenchmans Cove. And while the staff was incredibly friendly on the whole we did have a little beef at check out because our room got mixed up with that of another couple whose room charges were initially waived by the check out staff but still ended up partially charged to my credit card.

Everyone seemed to have disapeard. The one or two workers I did see around the grounds were not very friendly at all. I needed to go back to my room because I bought something that i did nt want to carry around. I ran into housekeeping at the room and that was a big mistake. I literally was getting yelled at by a housekeeper for trying to put something I had bought into my room. After calming her down I then had to prove to her my key opened my door. Then the hotel had an issue with my credit card or vice versa. When I tried to get a hold of the front desk it was next to impossible.

The pool and beach areas had plenty of lounge chairs if you are not too late. SPF 15 30 or 50 lotion was included in the resort fee. Snorkeling good for beach snorkeling and water sports are included too. The website has a list of all that is included for that fee. The trip to the Baths by Cruz Bay water sports was fantastic and well run. The Italian restaurant was so good we went twice. The chef said hello one night.

Trying to keep it brief and noting upfront that the review is from snobby travelers with high expectations with the Dorado Beach Ritz Carlton Reserve in Puerto Rico setting a baseline. We stayed at a nice two bedroom apartment on the Residence side of the Ritz in St Thomas. The Residence side might come across a little aged but definitely grew on us. It has a nice pool at least two hot tubs a kids pool and tons of family activities from a ping pong table to a fosbal table etc. A lot of the beach at the Residence seems to have been washed away in the last hurricane but it is still enough to call it beach maybe. The staff is friendly and acomodating. The Ritz Carlton Hotel has been renovated and shows nicely although some construction is still going at the time of our stay. The food is ok not great. From breakfast to lunch to dinner and including their top restaurant the Aloro there is room for improvement without going into details. We enjoyed traveling the island in our rental car and visiting different beaches and restaurants. We also went to St John by car ferry and enjoyed it but did not think it stood out to St Thomas as you hear so often.

I really do not like giving average or negative reviews especially in this case because the staff is super kind. I just feel like the hotel needs to be aware of some things. First of all we had a very welcoming greeting when we arrived. We were brought drinks immediately upon our arrival while we checked in. After check in they gave us an additional. It was a sweet gesture to start our stay off right. During check in we were told that we would be given a 200 resort credit per night because the hotel still is not completely finished. This was a great surprise and a very kind gesture. We were in Puerto Rico staying at the St Regis over Christmas before we came here. it is hard to not compare the two. We read TripAdvisor reviews on this hotel and our expectations were not very high so being told we would be credited was a very nice surprise. We arrived at our room and while it was okay it was not anything fancy. Much smaller than the room we stayed in at the St Regis. Beds were comfortable and we had a deck which was nice. Although the Ocean View room we had was more of a view of the construction of the pool. We did not spend time out there since it was mainly construction. As for the shower in the bathroom it seems odd that it is frosted glass that you can see into the main room. So you can see someone showering or at least the shadow of them. There was also light from the shower so if others are still sleeping in your room its not dark. Being a Ritz I would have expected better. The first night we ate at Coconut Cove. Nakita was our server and she was very friendly. My husband ordered a seafood pasta with Lobster mussels clams and shrimp. My daughter and I had the chicken pasta. The chicken pasta was absolutely delicious both my daughter and I loved it. As for the seafood pasta there was no lobster and barely any mussels or clams. It was mainly shrimp. When my husband questioned it the manager asked the chef and he said he was out of lobster. That is fine but they should have told us that because it was 14 more for the lobster. They offered to take it off our bill but my husband said no it was still good and since he ate it he suggested to just charge him like it was a chicken pasta which they did. I am only pointing this out because of what happens a few days later which I will talk about below. The guys and gals working the pool were super friendly and helped get your chairs set up. Christmas is a busy time but we never had issues finding chairs. There were plenty. Lunch at the pool took over an hour to receive which seemed like a long time so just order before you are too hungry. Most restaurants require reservations before you arrive because when we got there they were all booked for dinners. The breakfast buffet restaurant near the pool was good although you could tell the wait staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The second day we ate here there was quite a wait. We told them we would be waiting outside and they said they would come out and let us know when our table was ready. As we saw people behind us in line getting seated my daughter went up and questioned and the lady was not very kind and said we have been calling your name for awhile. My daughter quickly reminded her that we told her we were waiting outside since there was no room to wait inside and that she agreed to come out to tell us when our table was ready. They sat us next. New Years Eve lunch we decided to eat at Coconut Cove again because we wanted the chicken pasta. Nakita was our waitress again and we were happy to see her. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She asked what kind of cheese and he said swiss. She came by our table shortly later and my husband questioned if saw that it said bacon on the cheeseburger. She said he was accurate and there would be bacon. So out comes his cheeseburger and my husband jokingly said this is the orangest swiss I have ever seen. Nakita felt bad and said she would take it back and fix it immediately. My husband told her no it is not a big deal he likes cheddar too. She leaves and my husband realizes there is no bacon. So when she comes back he tells her and you can tell she is completely embarrassed. She brings the bacon. My husband then started eating the burger and after a few bites he realizes there is something in his burger. Sure enough it was the wax paper that divides the cheese. He calls Nakita over and she looked mortified. She asked to put it on a plate to show the chef. My husband was done eating at this point. When our bill was brought to us we thought for sure they would take his meal off especially since my husband did not have them take off the pasta off the first night like they asked. We thought it was only fair since he had wax paper in his burger that he be comped that. So he scratched off that part of the bill and did a new total. When we received our final bill we saw that they did make the adjustment on their end which was good however it should have never been on the bill in the first place. That night we went out to eat in town. When we came home there was a bottle of champagne and a very kind note from Nakita. That was great customer service and they definitely tried to right their wrong. We were thankful for that even though we do not drink champagne. On our last morning there we had to get up early for our taxi and when I went to shower I realized the staff that serviced our rooms forgot to leave us any fresh towels. They took all of our old towels during turndown service but forgot to leave new towels so we did not even have hand towels. It was about 7 am and I called housekeeping and they never answered I called the front desk concierge and they never answered. Since we all needed to be up and showered it was quite frustrating no one answered their phones. I had to call the bell desk to ask for towels. They said they would be right up. They arrived at 830am. Luckily our flight was delayed by several hours so it was okay it took them so long for the towels to arrive. I do feel there should always be someone available answering phones for guests though. We were eaten alive by the sand flies so be sure to use the Off they have for you near the pool. My daughter stopped counting at 100 bites on her body. Red bumps welts that were super itchy. Ok back to the good. The water is beautiful there is coral and rocks in the water but we still got in and my son and husband did some snorkeling. That was fun for them. The sand is super soft and when you are not looking at the pool construction the view is stunning. I loved looking out to St John. I would return. I just hope they get some of these kinks worked out soon especially when I had to use more than the usual points for our stay for a hotel that was not quite ready.

We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas staying in an oceanfront queen bedroom. With Bon Voy Ambassador status and previous Ritz stays my expectations were high but tempered by recent reviews and understanding that they are still recuperating from the hurricanes. However we were extremely disappointed with the consistency of service offered. We take this special trip every other year and were extremely disappointed with our stay. From the beginning we were not able to reach anyone at the hotel via phone or email to answer questions related to the reservation. One time that I did talk to someone it took over an hour on the phone to attempt to change our room type. After leaving several messages and emails for a concierge no one ever responded. Eventually our Mariot Ambassador was able to confirm everything for us before we arrived. While the check in process was simple through the ap and the welcome lovely after several calls to the front desk we were told that we would need to pay an additional 350 night for access to the Club Lounge regardless of the lifetime status. We made several requests at the concierge desk the pool deck and over the phone to reserve a pool cabana and never received any response. Half of the time when we would call for reservations or room service no one would answer the phone at all. While lounging at the beach the service was spotty and inconsistent at best. There was an issue with the Sails kitchen which prompted a very limited menu for lunch and food being prepared next to the pool beach on grills under a tent. I was not expecting just one restaurant on property to be available for meals. Our room was on the 5th floor of building E and with only one elevator on the other side of the building I would not recommend this hotel for anyone with mobility issues. There are stairs everywhere throughout the main building to and from the pool and the beach etc. The construction of the family pool was very disruptive. It was visible from every room and the hotel attempted to disguise with music that started early each morning on the pool deck with the same playlist each day. The construction definitely cuts into the pool deck and you need to reserve your pool loungers early in the morning if you want a place to sit. At the beach you need to reserve a chair early in the morning if you want to sit in the front row. The attendants were friendly but not helpful even with tips. There just did not seem to be any focus on the customer experience at this resort.

So the beach is quite narrow compared to what it was pre storm.", "offset": [461, 602], "date": "2020-03-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "3ee715e7-2e9f-4144-b955-bd45326f21c1", "sentence": "Nice but You can not comoditize luxury. My wife and I were at the hotel for 4 nights. Presidents wekWe had a club level room. This was our third stay at the hotel our first since it re opened post hurricane. They have done a really nice job on the rooms though I would not call it 5 star luxury levelParts of the common areas are still undergoing renovation. Service in the club lounge was great but at the pool the level of service was not up to the standard one would expect at the price point. There are nowhere near enough chairs at the pool Each of the 4 days we were there we had to wait for chairs forget about a choice of where to sit and some days we were forced to go to the beach because every single pool chair was taken. Overall nice hotel beautiful location but the quality of service and luxury not up to the price point. I do not know if this is a function of Starwod Mariot merger and Roy Carlton no longer being the top level luxury brand or whether this was just an issue at this hotel. Regardless Not worth the money.", "offset": [497, 733], "date": "2020-03-05", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}]}
