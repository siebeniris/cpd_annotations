I made a reservation and was checked in just fine. There was not even any wait before my check in. I had a one king bed jacuzi suite. It was a non smoking room and the room hall did not smell at all. When I arrived in my room I was satisfied. The jacuzi was in the corner of the room which I liked because I could watch TV while soaking. My only small complaint was that the shower would not turn to when a warm setting like the handle was broke. That was fine because of the jacuzi though. I went to a get together for work a couple hours after arriving. Then got back to the room and basically passed out.

This is a very nice hotel clean nicely decorated and a decent breakfast. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the hotel is being renovated and many of the amenities ie TV Internet were not working in some rooms I heard several complaints but fortunately my room was fine. The new concrete in entrance way and paving stones on entrance drive were being sealed with a protective coat this morning when I was trying to have breakfast. The front entrance was the only entry exit and the VERY strong chemical smell lasted for an hour or better. My suggestion is to Close this hotel during those periods when they are using strong chemicals. They might do this work after breakfast maybe mid afternoon or late in the evening when guests are not in and out the front entrance. A large fan near the front entrance Blowing away from the lobby would have been helpful or an alternative entry exit. Honestly the staff working the front desk must have monster headaches this evening. I would recommend this hotel to friends NEXT YEAR certainly not this summer.
