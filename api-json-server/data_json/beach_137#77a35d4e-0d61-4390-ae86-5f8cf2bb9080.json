Two restaurants were closed for a but out function including the Cafe itself which was a bit annoying. That left only a bakery for food. Rooms were nice enough and quiet.

I was at the casino on 520. Of course the lovely bank of 5 15 blackjack tables in the polside casino have been removed in favor of valuable to the casino tight slots but I considered the casino to be a decent place to buy a few drinks and hang with friends. My experience on that date was decent GREAT bartenders at Grey Salt though they do close a bit earlyHowever shortly after this experience I saw online that the business would begin charging for parking in June 2016. I find this to be an offensive egregious and extortive tactic to bleed an extra 5 out of patrons especially at a time when MGM Resorts is being utterly blasted for the same policies in Las Vegas. I immediately took to the web to register my disdain. In the week that followed repeated honest attempts to solicit the truth out of the casino I was banned on the Seminole Hard Rock Tampas Facebok page as well as the Seminole Hard Rock Tampas Instagram account. My posts were 100 appropriate and above board. It became immediately apparent to me that either 1. the casino did not want the truth to emerge before it was ready to unveil it or 2 the casino had no idea WHAT the policy would be. It could also have to do with my pointing out that on Facebok a social media platform with a noted review inflation dilemma. the property boasted more 5 star ratings than 1 4 star ratings COMBINEDAfter repeated calls and talking to different folks at the front desk at security and more it became apparent to me that the latter was likely the left hand did not know what the right was doing. Some folks said all lots would require payment and others said it would only be the garages. All of them cited upgraded security as a justification. For reference my car has never been the victim of crime on the property my deepest sympathies to the fraction of a fraction of a percent for which this has been a problem. If you have held a copy of the Tampa Bay Times in your hands recently you are almost certainly aware that the casino is embarking upon a lavish and expensive expansion in the coming years. If you think for a second that this extortive and outrageous parking policy has nothing to do with that I have some fabulous beachfront property to sell you on Orient Road. This establishment has done everything it could to hide its true intentions with regard to paid parking. I have gone through THREE social media managers hello Darien C Flo J and Melissa C to try to get to the root of this issue but this particular squeaky wheel is not getting the grease. I am glad the Tribes gaming compact died in Tallahassee this year. That combined with a parking fee I will never pay has saved me and cost them. some money in the long run. Stay greedy and opportunistic Seminole Tribe. I would not expect anything less. If you are planning on gaming I recommend an online Costa Rican or British with VPN or Biloxi Vegas casino. do not give these leeches your money. you are worth far more than that.", "offset": [2110, 2282], "date": "2016-06-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "140576dc-9bb7-48fe-9edc-a4c09408e1c4", "sentence": "Pay for parking.
