Joseph D \u2019s cruel and insensitive behavior concerned a service animal and his questioning and mean remarks around the disability our dog is needed for. Outside of that Joseph D was arrogant snappy and argumentative. While the hotel is nice minus the fact that only one of the elevators is working I would not recommend this particular Best Western. In fact avoid it at all costs if Joseph D is working. If proper action is n\u2019t taken this will be the last time I stay at any Best Western and I have been a decades long customer. An update No manager or anyone from BW has been in touch. We will be staying at The Drury Inn for the remainder of this trip and will be switching our reward membership to them. BW just lost a damn good customer.", "offset": [1134, 1258], "date": "2019-10-19", "cpt": "4", "category": "general"}, {"id": 43, "uid": "77f8816a-e0e3-46fb-a210-de5abb3ef3da", "sentence": "newly renovated modern fresh and great location.

The only good part was getting the room earlier than we thought and not having to leave our bags in a car for hours while we were at the football game.

The bad parts of the stay was while we were waiting for our room we stopped to have lunch in the Boulevard Cafe there was one wait staff for a room of about 40 fans here for the football game.
