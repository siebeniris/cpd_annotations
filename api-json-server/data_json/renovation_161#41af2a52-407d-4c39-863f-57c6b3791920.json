We stayed at the Palm tree court a wonderful beachfront setting very slightly marred by distant construction work on The Palm Jebel Ali that by the looks of it have stopped. Myself and my wife have now stayed at this hotel 4 times 3 of which have been over the last three years. This year my daughter and son in law came with us. Please read all of my review as I have put my disappointment first this is a reflection on my stupidity not the hotel. We checked in at 10 am on the 6th July 2015 for 10 nights The receptionist was very welcoming once everything was signed we was told our rooms were ready and that if we followed the bell boy he would take us to our rooms by buggy. On arrival to our rooms we was a little disappointed Palm tree court is made up of blokes of apartment rooms the rooms we were taken to were at the far end of the complex meaning a very long walk back to the main reception area where morning breakfast is served and evening meals. As the temperatures outside was around 38 degrees and never really dropped below this even in the evenings My wife felt that this walk was too much. As I suffer from an illness the room was just too far away from all the amenities for me to walk in the heat all the time. We knew the hotel was not full due to it being Ramadam. I called reception and asked if we could be moved to rooms nearer the main building Reception promptly said yes and would send the buggy back to collect us and for me to pop back into reception as I would need to sign new paperwork. We thought everything was going to well. For us to move rooms I had to pay an extra cost 120 dirhams per night per room without thinking I paid this On reflection this was over and above what the room was worth as we did not care if we had sea view or garden as both views have their own beauty. All we wanted was to be near the main building. The room its self was no different from the room we had first been put in other than nearer the building. For the rest of the holiday all I thought about was paying this extra for nothing. \u201c yes \u201d I should have said something my fault stupid. One other very small disappointment for us was one of the main tree pools was under renovation it just so happen to be the one we loved to visit on our last two visits not a complaint as we understand improvements need to go on and at times it will affect them who are there at the time. Other than the two disappointment above I can only suggest that you give the Jebel Ali a try ever the Palm tree court or the hotel as both are equally as good as each other. We spent the remainder of the afternoon at the nearest pool a short walk away. The pool design is attractive looking out over the sea. We dined at most of the restaurants on the site I can recommend Shooter \u2019s located about 4 km away at the Jebel Ali International Shooting Club. The resort has a complimentary shuttle running every 30 minutes. The steaks were excellent services was exhalant. For the evening the only bar not restaurant open for alcohol after 8 pm was the white orchid bar where the staff are great every one of them no need to mention names as every one of them was as good as each other. Overall my recommendation is no different from my review of 2014 the hotel is still very good. One last comment it was the first time my son in law had been to Dubai and his words \u201c fantastic hotel \u201d.", "offset": [2124, 2411], "date": "2015-07-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "afe0bf29-2f7f-4a42-b116-04acb4e9ebb9", "sentence": "Kids paradise. 3 swimming pools to choose from and plenty of activities for kids in the resort.

This was our third trip to Jebel Ali and I feel it will be our last trip unles there is major refurbishment the rooms are looking old and worn and in general the hotel would benefit from a major refurbishment. The staff at this hotel are still amazing and would go out of their way to do anything for you a big thanks to Vincent who looked after us every day on the beach and had done so for all our visits. The restaurants have lost their appeal for me and I found them very average this time but again can not fault the staff in most of them. The Captains table still delivers decent food consistently but sometimes the staff become a bit flustered especially when it gets a tad busy. I feel the resort is changing especially as the White Orchid is not part of the AI for Jebel Ali clients yet Palm tree clients spend most of their time in the Jebel Ali part of the resortthe beach is still clean and well maintained even though my he view is not very pleasant. Maybe it is time for me yo move on and discover what other hotel in Dubai offer.", "offset": [38, 247], "date": "2015-09-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "11b8db78-a168-46b9-afdd-bfd6ca51e258", "sentence": "Brilliant staff and brilliant service. One of the main reasons for my choice was due to the hotel offering an All Inclusive package and high recommendations. I will start by saying the first problem I had was my uncertainty of the socket type that was used out in Dubai. I did try to google this but was rewarded with an array of answers so I thought I \u2019d do the next best thing and call the hotel itself. The receptionist on the phone was very helpful and I was told that they have multi sockets in the hotel room. This was excellent and one less worry for me whilst packing all my relevant equipment. Upon arriving I was greeted with a glass of juice and was checked in very promptly. It was also nice to see that they catered for people arriving late and had provided a basic but welcomed menu. A big thumbs up for this as I was famished after my long journey. The rooms were very spacious and clean. I did find the carpets in the corridor rather dated however I found that I was able to sleep better as I could not hear people walking up and down the corridor at night due to the carpet. The Hotel breakfast was full of variety and the omelette chef Saman was spectacular. Watching him cook three dishes at the same time was entertainment in itself. A slight bug bear about the hotel is that the location is very sparse. The Ja Jebel is about 30min away from anywhere. However the hotel has dealt with this by laying on a free shuttle service to the most popular destinations. If used correctly you can save yourself a ton of money in taxi fares a massive thumbs up for this service they have provided. A little tip for those of you who wish to escape your hotel for excursions make sure you use well known third party websites to pre book your excursions like the Burj Khalif. I found these other sites to be at least 50 cheaper than waltzing up on the day and paying at the door. Once arriving on the beach it was brought to my attention that people who are on the all inclusive package have access to free water sports equipment for a limited time. I took advantage of this and took the kayak out for 30min which was more than enough time to remind me why I need to go gym more often. I also noticed how health and safety was always paramount at this resort. Each pool is manned with a life guard and the ones I had encountered all had positive attitudes and came across very friendly. Choosing a beach lounge was definitely easier than expected as they were in plentiful supply. The beach attendant Guyan was always available to erect an umbrella at the chosen lounge which was necessary to protect you from the raging heat. He could n\u2019t do enough for us. This seemed to be a common denominator amongst all the staff. On the beach you have a choice of two bars in close proximity that you are able to use. Each serving food in its own unique style. I used the captains bar more than I did the Anchors bar but this was more so to do with the irritating flies that swarmed the Anchor bar. I put that down to the shrubbery close by to Anchor bar. The manager did come out and apoligise and gave us some candles to try and keep the pesky flies at bay. I really ca n\u2019t blame them for mother natures play in this but maybe they need to have the smoky repellents to assist in the deterrent of the flies. Alwyn and Laxman were ever so courteous in every which way they were prompt with our food and very attentive to our needs. Definitely an asset to the Anchor bar team which kept us fed and watered. On another plus side the Anchor bar is close to the pool if u prefer that than a dip in the sea. I frequented in the Captains bar where I often encountered Depesh and Savil who practically remembered my favourite drinks and my room number. They were again very attentive to detail and I was never left waiting with an empty glass for very long. Whilst on my holiday we did encounter a power cut which ironically set off the alarms on the second and first floor. This was irritating as it went on for over an in the early hours of the morning. I called reception to let them know that our alarm was going off in our room also. The next day a letter with a bottle of wine apologising for the disturbances in the morning was left in our room. It was personal and really nice to see the hotel taking ownership for the mishap. Our room was cleaned impeccably by Rommel. You could see that he took pride in his work and was thoroughly disappointed when we said we did not need our room cleaned one of the days we were there. He even offered to come back at a later time but we assured him it was just not necessary that day. Usually when writing reviews I try to give as much negatives as there would be positives. I honestly have not got anything negative to say that effected my holiday tremendously. However I did find that they lacked some entertainment for teenagers which was voiced by other people staying in the hotel. The closest they had to entertainment was live music on the top floor but please note that children are not allowed in this area. It \u2019s regarded as a chill out zone for adults. But again nothing for young teenagers like I have experienced in other 5 hotels. Again I struggle to find any big negatives that would deter me from recommending this hotel however the A C in rooms were extremely noisy. Please upgrade the the A C in the rooms or at least update them to ones that have timers on. Never have I gone out of my way to take names of staff to show my appreciation of the service that I was given. Narendra Manoj Dushan Samundra Medgi and Javes. All names mentioned in this review really are an asset to this establishment and I hope management have reward systems in place for such staff. In summary would I stay here again. Definitely yes.", "offset": [5320, 5412], "date": "2016-09-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "9cd10577-9a23-4ea7-9b29-0eb3370a22d1", "sentence": "Second visit and just as good. Currently spending our last day here at the Jebal Ali. My husband and I came to this hotel last year for our 1st Anniversary and when we planned our trip this year for the rugby sevens even though this hotel is not near the stadium we decided to stay here again. As always everywhere is spotless the pool is heated so always lovely to dip in. Food just as outstanding as we remember and even though this year I am now a vegetarian there was still plenty on the menu for me. Rooms are big and have all you had expect and the maid service is outstanding. We were treated to a wee firework display at the marina was was lovely and various other little treats due to it being national day in December. We did have an issue with our return taxi from the sevens stadium that the hotel were meant to be sorting for us but we never got any updates so assumed it was not followed through but we did not let it ruin our night although would have been nice to have been updated. When we came for our first anniversary we got the hotel bath duck with 2015 and sadly my daughter accidentally deposed of it and the hotel tried to replace it for me as it was a special memory but sadly they did not find me a replacement which was really disappointing but I did get this years duck and hopefully will be back next year to get the 2017 edition.

We were an early morning check in but were lucky enough to have our room ready almost straight away cases taken to our room and our holiday was to begin. The hotel grounds pool areas were all as fantastic as we remembered food quality again was first class. We used shooters a couple of times and the sister hotels restaurant the white orchid which was also first class. Breakfast was plentiful with a good and adequate variety. All staff were very welcoming from reception to housekeeping pool staff and hard working maintenance employees. The food standards are superb here and the all inclusive beverages again very good with many branded beers wines and spirits. Complimentary bus service to the malls again were great and prompt as well.
