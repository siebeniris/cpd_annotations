I am by most standards a seasoned traveler. I spend every week of the year traveling. My wife and I booked a week in Curacao for our honeymoon. After reading the previous reviews of this hotel I was a bit hesitant. To point the I almost cancelled my reservation and looked elsewhere. I am glad I did not. From the very moment we checked in we were made to feel very welcomed. During our entire trip we never encountered an unfriendly face from the hotel staff. In several of the previous reviews there was special note given to the staffs performance in the executive lounge. I agree. The staff was exceptional. Unlike most of my other frequent travelers my use of the excutive lounge was very limited. We primarily just grabbed a bottle of water for our daily trips out exploring the island and wake up coffee in the morning. But even with that limited use and exposure I was impressed by the fact that the staff addressed me by name even though I had never introduced myself. I would also like to point out the exceptional service of the hotel management and front desk staff. They were very helpful during our stay. The grounds of the hotel are exceptional. The pool was wonderful clean and inviting. The beach was small but very refreshing. The dock at the dive shop just begs for a cannonball. I happily accommodated it. The breakfast downstairs was great. We ate there every morning. The only bad food experience we had at the hotel was at the bar on our first day. We decided to grab a bite to eat and it turned out to be terrible. The pizza was a cheap frozen pizza and the chicken nuggets were just as bad. Think the bill was around 38 for that. We learned and moved on. So hotel manager. fix that minor detail and your golden. As for the rooms I found our executive oceanfront king room was great. You can tell that most of the room amenities are relatively new. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was clean and the AC keep the room cooler than outside. What more do you need. As for me and my wife the decor of the room is not important to us. We come for the view and as long as the room is clean then we are good to go. This hotel still needs some refreshing but it is obvious that those upgrades are underway. If you want to come to Curacao and stay in your hotel room the entire time then this might not be the property for you. If you are looking for a great property with clean rooms plenty of activities professional staff and good food then come on down and have a great time. Thanks to the entire staff of the hotel that made every aspect of our honeymoon special. Keep up the great work.", "offset": [2141, 2218], "date": "2015-09-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e570e619-5692-4c8d-9a6e-10d8ca7e2596", "sentence": "Beautiful beach location.

Yes the hotel needs a little tender loving care refurbishing as it definitely shows its age. Rooms are comfortable as expected of Hilton hotels and with the 45 amenities. We had the BQ buffet on Sunday evening Valentines Day which was adequate not amazing but definitely good and reasonably priced for Curacao.

We stayed from March 19 to March 26th 2016. We stayed on the 5th floor executive floor overlooking the sea. It was Beautiful. The executive lounge has breakfast on the 5th floor executive lounge as well as in the downstairs outdoor restaurant. If you are diamond you can get made to order eggs as well as everything else for breakfast. The executive lounge at night has wine and beer for about 4 each with some hot hors doeuvres. Tip 1 Be sure to buy duty free alcohol at the curacao airport before going to the Hilton this will save you a lot. Also bring or buy snacks with you as all food and drinks at the Hilton is expensive. In case you missed that I will say it again All food and drink at the Hilton Curacao is expensive. Plan on spending 20 25 for lunch and 30 per dinner per person. The executive lounge staff are tremendous. Karen is the best. Dawn and Petcha are wonderful as well. The cappuccino is fantastic. The views from the lounge are breathtakingWear Sunscreen a lot of it. And bring it from homeThe free shuttle to Wilemstad is worth the trip. There is a free morning and afternoon shuttle. It only takes about 10 minutes to get each way and it is definitely worth itBe sure to feed the lizards bananas. They love them and it is a fun way to start the dayWe did have wifi in our room executive lounge and in the main area. Not on the beach. We are diamond members and do not know if everyone gets it for free. There is a little kids pool as well as a regular pool. The regular pool is nice with great viewsThe resort is run down. The carpets are in desperate need of being replaced. I believe that there are mold issues in the carpet and vents. Let me know if you find yourself with some breathing issues or congestion. It would not take that much to make this hotel a lot better. Cleaning up the land parking lot signage carpet repaint the hotel would be a great start. More Music. Put music at pools not just at the bar.

My husband and I visited this property April 30May 7 2016 for what we thought would be a relaxing vacation. For multiple reasons it was not so. I will begin with the GOOD. Karen the Guest Ambassador is excellent. She was always there to check on us and to provide whatever she could to make our stay comfortable. Azucena the Housekeeper is one of the best housekeepers I have ever seen. She not only anticipates the needs of guests but provides for same. Wonderful wonderful service from her. The pool is peaceful and lovely. Uncrowded with exceptions that I will address later. The lounge chairs are clean and comfortable. Water at the small beach is clear and calm great for swimming and snorkeling. Executive lounge is very nice with nice amenities. Service there is wonderful. Petcha was great answering our questions. All staff encountered were friendly and genuinely tried to be helpful. The Mediocre The beach is white sand but it is not powdery. it is packed down hot and rocky. In my experience soft powdery sand can be difficult to walk in unles you know how from doing it often. One could walk on this beach in heels. Water shoes sandals are needed even to walk to a chair on the beach. The lounges on the beach are old and dirty. The beach area can be hot and humid as the breeze does not seem to blow through here as it does at the pool. We stayed in room 401 which is directly under the executive lounge. Views were wonderful and the room was clean. Granted furniture is old but then I have seen this many times in beach hotels. Bathrooms are spacious but have no storage room for items such as make up bags hair dryers curling straightening irons or anything really. A hand held hair dryer is provided. There is an unlit magnifying mirror that seemed to me to be a 3x magnifier. I bring my own anyway so this was not an issue. There is only one electrical outlet we were able to use being from the US not sure of the terminology. The other outlet is Type F for European appliances. Either way there is only one outlet in the bathroom. Room service is not good. Food arrives cold and sometimes uncovered. Concierge service is poor. We were actually discouraged from shopping in Curacao. The UNACCEPTABLE. There is no pool or beach service for drinks or food that we saw the entire week we were here. There are only four frozen drinks listed on the menus at both beach bars. Bartenders make these inconsistently and most times incorrectly. If you request something different like a Mudslide that is standard at most beach hotels you have to instruct the bartender how to make it. This hotel sells day passes to locals on holidays and weekends. On those days the pool and beach are overrun with screaming rowdy children from morning to night. Even though there are POOL RULES and BEACH RULES listed with signage in two languages the rules are consistently and continuously broken. Security seems to turn a blind eye to this disruption. We and others complained about this with no resultant improvement. If you are considering this hotel check the holiday dates AND they do vary from year to year. I intended to list them but can not as they change. We learned this the hard way as the hotel does not provide this information anywhere. No one seems to be in charge here. We spoke with several Assistant Managers but never spoke to a Manager as one was never available. In summary this could be a great place to stay but due to lack of management inept employees and what seems to be a general lack of concern by Hilton it currently is not.", "offset": [1463, 1507], "date": "2016-05-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "b792af44-b59b-4384-8650-280b07205469", "sentence": "Pleasant stay for family.

We just returned from a few days at the Hilton in Curacao. I am a very loyal Hhonors member so was excited to see I could use my points and a minimal amount in Curacao. I have highlighted the pros and cons of the property below. Pros. Check in was very easy and the people at the front desk were very nice. They answered questions and provided suggestions on what to do and where to go it was New Years Eve. The beach although quite small is very beautiful. It has a secluded feel and the water is by far the most clear and serene I have ever been in. The grounds of the hotel are also very nice. It seems like it is almost situated on a cape you can walk the path around the hotel and the ocean wraps around it. There are iguanas everywhere which we thought was pretty cool. The hotel is also compact which we liked we never had to walk far to get what we needed. ConsThis hotel is expensive. there is no other way to say it. The first thing we did was order a beer it was only 7 oz. and came to 850. I suppose we are used to staying all inclusive. The food is also VERY expensive. The food. What can I say about the food. Meh. There are three places to order food two outside and one inside. However the inside restaurant was never open when we were there. You can order your basic food pizza burgers tacos. We ordered two tiny fish tacos with no sides 15. I would not complain as much about the prices if the food tasted a bit better. Although the beach was really pretty they did not have a beach butler or waiter. Everytime we wanted another 7 oz beer we had to walk back up to the bar those tiny beers go fastThe pool was just ok. it was full of leaves and debris so we did not stay in it long. Overall I think I would stay there again if I had to. we were just so shelshocked by the prices of everything. The rooms were comfortable and there was a casino onsite which was fun.

We spent a week at the Hilton as gold club members and really enjoyed our stay.

You can also take a taxi one way or both ways instead of the shuttle and the taxi will cost 15 one way. As gold club members we had access to the executive lounge where we had breakfast every day as well as a daily reception with hors doeuvres. The management team whom we met during a private reception for gold and diamond club members is very dedicated. Sure the rooms could use an update but our room and refrigerator on the 5th floor was very clean and the housekeeping staff was very good. The decor is not up to the same standards as some other Hilton hotels in the cities but I have a much more casual approach to decor when it is a beach resort. The only negative aspects were that there was no hot water for a few days only affected us for 2 days since it was fixed on Thursday. and I did not get a 515 am wake up call. although this has happened to us at other hotels that is why I always set the alarm in the room.

Stayed her the 2nd time and again had a room on the executive floor to have access to the executive launch which has complimentary breakfast buffet and snacks in the afternoon and free non alcoholic drinks all day. Staff of this launch is excellent. A room with access to the executive launch is the best deal you can get. All the pros and cons of this hotel I have listed in my previous review and you can also read in the review by others. I want to share why I think Mgt is questionable. There is a serious issue with the AC on the executive top floor. We were given room 515 and the AC was not cooling properly. The air coming out the AC was almost the same as ambient air temperature. Could not sleep because of the heat. Other guests on the executive floor also had similar problems. One of them was already moved to a lower level. Several complains by us were launched at the front desk and standard answers were given with their best poker face like we will have Engineering check it out Engineering could not find nothing etc. Finally we got an acknowledgement that the AC was an issue and since the hotel was booked full we could only move the next day to another room on the 4th floor. Spending 2 of the 5 nights in a hot room we got usd 75 discount compensation. To our big surprise I noticed room 515 was occupied again putting the new guest in the same situation as us and hope they do not complain and if they do give them the same standard answers with their best poker face. In my opinion if the AC is not functioning properly the room should be taken out OR at least tell the guest upfront that there is an issue and give them the option of another hotel if they do not like the hot rooms. Temperature strips can be put in the room so Mgt can tell the guests upfront what the expected temperature is in the room during day time and at night. Putting guest deliberately in a rooms with inadequate AC facilities. hoping they will not complain and if they do act with the best poker face that this is something new is bad Mgt.

When he discovered that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary he gave us a voucher to have two free drinks at the bar. Although we were early for the 40 pm Check in we were allowed to go up to our room which was ready. I must say that we felt quite comfortable from the get go. Our five night reservation was inclusive of breakfast and dinner. The Buffet breakfast was great offering a wide variety that was quite tasty. Every morning I was able to begin my breakfast with a hot beverage and end my breakfast with a mimosa. Most of the employees assisting with breakfast were extremely pleasant. One can tell that the hotel does have some age but the rooms corridors and its environs were always spotless. I must commend the pleasantly smiling employees who did a great job cleaning our room daily. We had a choice of eating at the Italian Restaurant or ordering off the menu at Captain Blighs Bar. That was not a choice for us as my husband does not eat Italian at all. So we were left with the menu from the bar which was a bit limited especially for my husband who is a bit picky. However he did not make that a problem more or less ordering the same chicken dishes every night. I must iterate that the staff at the bar who served us our dinner was simply the best. Kudos to the handsome young man who served us our first night and Bo who was our attendant the other nights. Situated more or less on the beach front this hotel is charmingly beautiful. During our stay the ocean was calmly inviting but so too was the warmth of the pool.

I am writing this review as I do not feel that the negative reviews are fair or accurate so want to provide an honest review. First off we are a couple in our late 40s and traveled to the Hilton Curacao in January 2019. We have traveled all over the world. I love Hilton hotels and stay there when the price is right. We are members but only blue basic members. The hotel and grounds were amazing. Check in was no problem and anytime we went to the front desk they were always helpful and friendly. Our first room was on the 4th floor ocean view but it had 2 double beds. We went down to front desk and asked for a King room and they told us they were booked but could get us into a King room in a couple of days. That was reasonable not their issue if no room available. We eventually did move a couple of days later and the room was on 2nd floor and just as nice. The rooms were very large and clean. They had a safe mini fridge television and desk. Lots of storage. The odd things was there was a door to the balcony rather than sliding door which was new for me in the Caribbean but it worked. Balconies were large and ocean view was spectacular. Bed was very comfy and the bathroom was large and clean. There was a bathtub in the double room but only a shower in the king room. Our toilet clogged one time and we called and they sent someone up to fix it. Not a big deal. The hotel grounds are very large. There is the main beach out front that is small but gorgeous. Snorkeling right off the beach was spectacular and there were many different fish to see. You could snorkel by the dock and also by this structure farther out. First class snorkeling. There was some saving of chairs on the beach under palapas. We typically were up around 830 and still got a palapas on the beach just not in the first row. The rest of the grounds were amazing. The pool area was never crowded and could always find a spot around there. The water is a little chilly but nice relief from the heat. There was also some debris in the pool but just pick out the leaves and bugs yourself not an issue. You could walk from main beach to Momba beach which has privileges with Hilton. That beach is wider and much more waves. You could use the chairs and stay at that beach which gave you options. They have a little beach club there and we went for lunch one day and the food was great as well as the frozen drinks and the view. Such a nice option. We met people from hotel who rented a palapas on this beach and stayed the day. Overall there are so many options of places to sit and relax that there was never a problem finding something. Dining. Blighs bar was the main place where people congregated. Every night there is a different special on Nachos and 2 margaritas tapas and 2 glasses of wine burger night. It was nice to have that variety and the food was good. Service could take a bit depending on how busy they were but it was nothing terrible and they were always courteous. We also did the steak night at the restaurant by the beach. Be prepared as the steaks are very thin so cooking to your liking was difficult. Having said that we were eating on the beach in paradise and it was great. We also had lunch at this same restaurant and the burgers were great. Prices were reasonable for food and drinks. Pirates Bay beach and Tomatoes restaurant are very close. You have to either walk outside the resort or you could swim over. We swam over for lunch one day and had a drink and pub food. It was adequate fried food nothing to write home about but it was exciting to swim over there and just get out of water and sit and have something. We also walked over to Tomatoes for pizza supper. Again the views are spectacular and the pizza was very good. The shuttle that they offer to Wilemstad is a bonus. We went in one afternoon and walked around between 130 and 530. We had dinner at the Governers House and it was very very good. Walked all over town and across the bridge and saw it open several times. Hilton typically had 11 spots available twice per day to go into the city. We only went in once and booked the day before. It was a nice perk. We rented a car from the Budget onsite car rental office. We rented it for one day 24 hours for aprox 50 USD. Very easy to get around Curacao and we stopped at several beaches. We swam with turtles which is amazing we went to Sanabil mall and went to Centro grocery store where we bought cheese meat bagete 2 bottles of wine and 12 beers for aprox 60 USD and we brought it back to our room and had a nice dinner on our balcony overlooking the beautiful sunset and ocean. It also allowed us to bring some beers down to the beach with us during the day. Would highly recommend renting a car for minimal one day. Almost forgot that we also drove to Mambo beach complex for Sushi that same day. This is a huge complex with several hotels and beach clubs restaurants and shopping. The beach is beautiful and the ocean part is man made so blocked off from waves. We were there around dusk so did not swim but was interesting to see. My husband booked a 2 tank shore dive through the dive shop directly on Hilton property. It was reasonably priced and because they had room I got to go along paid 50USD to see two other beaches and hang out and snorkel on the beaches while they dove. It was a nice way to spend the day and my husband said the diving was spectacular and highly recommend this company. The executive lounge was permanently closed and we had booked it in our package. Instead the hotel gave us free american full breakfast and vouchers for 1 free drink and appetizers at the bar between 5 7. The breakfast was fine. Yes some of the food was lukewarmish. I stayed away from that and got them to make me eggs or an omelette every morning which was fresh. There was also lots of fresh fruit and bread so lots to choose from. The drink and appetizers were nice a bit of a pain to have to bring your voucher with you but it was within the first week of them closing executive lounge so probably figuring out the kinks. There have been alot of comments on here about the hotel and room being dated. seriously. Not sure where you usually stay but this property was beautiful the the rooms were great. Yes the carpet in hallways had some stains on it. and if this is what tips the scale for you as far as how you enjoy your vacation or your opinion of this property then there is no pleasing you. Every thing was immaculately cleaned and so stains on carpet do not bother me. We went to the managers reception which was a very nice touch and got to personally meet with the different managers of the hotel. They were all incredibly nice and took the time to connect with every one there. We spoke with the manager of housekeeping at length and discussed some of the negative comments online. She shared that people have to remember that they are on an island. Ordering lamp shades takes months and months not only to choose but delivery is very difficult given the island thing. She stated that they have renovation plans but unlike properties on mainlands it takes a lot more time. There have also been comments around the rudeness of staff. That was not our experience in fact it was the complete opposite. Everyone we encountered was courteous and kind. If they were busy it took a little longer to be served but it was understandable. We checked our hotel account every couple of days and one day we saw a charge for something that should not have been on there. We addressed it with the front desk and they looked through their receipts and apologized and it was taken care of. People are human and errors are made. They handled it more than nicely. Overall we would go back in a heartbeat the rooms property ocean beaches staff etc made this vacation amazing. If you can handle some stains on the carpet you will not be disappointed in this hotel and this area.", "offset": [926, 974], "date": "2019-02-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "786ed907-6637-4106-9bd4-4d39a2c4e3f7", "sentence": "The pool beach and gym were great.

I immediately went to the front desk and told and they said they would get to it right away. Two days later after several people including the hotel manager said they would fix it or replace it they had not done either. I decided to try changing the batteries in the safe took the batteries out of my speaker and the safe worked fine. In the middle of the week there at 5 pm we discovered that our bathroom sink was leaking and pouring out to the bathroom floor. I told the front desk and they said they would have someone up there right away. When we returned to our room at 10 pm no one had done anything. I went to the front desk and loudly complained they sent up a maintenance person who said he could fix it but it could not be used for 24 hours. they gave us another room and sent up a bellman to help with the luggage at 1030 pm.

I was one of the first guests in the newly opened Curacao mariot beach resort. In general I was very happy though there were some issues during our stay. The hotel was beautiful the lobby was perfect for chilling DJ was often playing and the view to the pool and beach was spectacular. Our room was located on the first floor so we had access to infinity pool right from our terrace and since we were there in November there were not a lot of people so often it seemed like we had to whole pool to ourselves. It was the perfect place to just sit and watch the view and de stress from every day worries. I recommend traveling here on November December since the weather is perfect. around 30 celcius all the time and there aren\u00b4t too many tourists. I came to the hotel to run the curacao marathon and the organising of the event was done very well by the hotel. The staff wast mostly friedly special thanks to Jacqueline from the breakfast serving se really owned the customer service and made us feel welcome. The rooms were clean and overall the hotel had some many places to sit and enjoy that you really didn\u00b4t even need to go outside the hotel. well we did anywayThose were the positives the negatives were that we had to change our room two times due to issues in pluming. most likely due to hotel being so new. For this we received only one free breakfast which was not enough because it took a lot of time to pack and unpack two times. Also when we arrived we had to wait for our room a long time. On the last day we asked if we could get a late check in because we had so many issues while changing the room and we were not granted that. That was unfortunate and not good customer service. Other than that I was happy with everything. Also usually this level Mariot hotels have free sports equipment you can borrow like paddle boards but they had none. I recommend this hotel and would go again.

My wife and I along with another couple stayed 7 nights at the Cura\u00e7ao Mariot Beach Resort 27 Jan3 Feb 2020. From what I understand the resort re opened in late November so we were there about 2 months after it re opened. I am happy to report that whatever problems they may have had with inexperienced staff are now a thing of the past at least in our experience. Without exception we were pleased with every employee we encountered from the front desk the bell staff the restaurant and bar staff even the towel and chaise guys at the swimming pools. They were without fail polite eager to please and efficient. They wanted to do whatever it took to make sure our stay was a pleasurable one. The redone facilities are just beautiful. The pools and gardens look beautiful at night and I think that you will get at least a partial ocean view from any room overlooking a swimming pool. The guest rooms are all new. The bathrooms have been reconfigured with a spacious shower stall and height adjustable shower piece without any low pressure problems. At first I though it odd that the clothes closet was inside the bathroom and then I remembered the advice about how to get wrinkles out of clothes while travelling by leaving them in bathroom while showering. Putting the closet in the bathroom itself is just brilliant. The rooms need more outlets. Bring the adapters for round European type 20 outlets and an extension cord if you are travelling with more than one CPAP machine. I have made some suggestions to Mariot about improvements but will also mention them here briefly. The adult Serenity pool should have a handrail alongside the steps leading into the water. They are already there in the main pool but even there there should be a handrail on the steps leading down to the pool deck. Pretty much anywhere there are steps you should have something to hold onto. There is a need for more shade at the pools especially the main family pool. Other than that the pools were delightful. There are no hot tubs but the family pool has many nooks and coves built into it that provide some privacy. it is quite cleverly laid out. The adult pool is fine for those doing laps. At the moment the only place you can sit down for breakfast is at the buffet priced at 26 per person. it is good but there should be an \u00e0 la carte breakfast option other than the Papiamento Marketplace which is really more of a small store.

I heard from a guest that had just arrived that there was no hot water in the shower ours was fine. The plumber they sent to the room told her the renovation did not provide enough hot water production so beware of a room like that until they fix it.

We had a fabulous time at the renovated Curacao Mariot where we spent 8 nights. When we arrived we were welcomed with cold bottles of water. As a Platinum member we asked about an upgrade to the Ocean Front room we had originally reserved. Kaina graciously upgraded us to one of the largest suites we have ever stayed in. The ocean front suite had a \u00bd bath kitchen dining area living area bedroom with king bed and a HUGE bathroom with a bathtub and walk in shower for 2 people. The big balcony had a lots of patio furniture and faced the ocean while the bedroom had a view of the main pool. The location of the resort was ideal for exploring the entire island as well as hanging out at the pool and beach. We rented a car from DD Car Rental for our entire stay and parked at no charge in the parking lot. The staff was very friendly and helpful including Kaina front desk Dylan bellman Jordan passed out smoothie samples by pool Cerita waitress at Salty Iguana Ocean Grill Rameses waiter at C Spice Ruthline waitress at C Spice who had a great laugh Andrew front desk who had a secret stash of 5 bills and Ana who cleaned our suite. As Platinum members we chose the option of having a complimentary continental breakfast every morning at C Spice during our stay instead of paying 50 for the Reef Club. We also found a nearby grocery store where we got bottled water wine and snacks. There are only 7 umbrellas on the beach and these umbrellas get \u201c reserved \u201d early in the morning by hotel guests. There are more umbrellas by the main pool but these also get \u201c reserved \u201d every morning by hotel guests. Some of the pool umbrellas do not move and others can be moved. So my husband would get up early to \u201c reserve \u201d 2 chaises and an umbrella that moves so we could stay in the shade by the pool and facing the ocean. The Curacao Mariot definitely needs to order and install more umbrellas on the beach by the pool and by the Salty Iguana Ocean Grill. We were impacted by a 9 hour island wide power outage on February 11th. The hotel has generators so the main lobby and restaurants were not impacted. But the rooms were impacted \u2014 no air conditioning lights or water. The toilets are electronic and could not be flushed. Once the power came on about 5 pm it took another hour before an engineer flipped the breaker switch so our suite had power. The Curacao Mariot needs to have more generators in case there are more island wide power outages.
