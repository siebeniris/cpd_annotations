Food overall better than most hotels in Mexico although I had stay away from the basic steak since too tough. as has been my experience over the years. Although rooms rates seem pricey. when you consider that it includes ALL meals taxes tips plus wine alcohol. it is a great deal. With a 150 credit applied to the excellent spa NY steak lobster trade up winesgift shop etc. the cost is reduced even further.

Spent our 16th anniversary in sunny Cancun Le Blanc. We spent 3 nights at Le Blanc not nearly enough and were treated like royalty from the moment we walked in the resort to the very last minute. After a long flight we took a nap in our room. When we awoke the butler provided us a happy anniversary chocolate cake along with a bottle of bubbly. The service for this resort is over the top. If you are looking for a loud resort. this is NOT your place. If you are looking for a relaxing resort that caters to your every desire whether it is your umbrella placement in the sand to the type of pillow that you need to the hot bath drawn for you with your desired scents. then this is the PLACE for you. We ate at the french restaurant which requires reservations. Our favorite was the Italian which we tried twice. Everything was prepared to perfection at both restaurants. We tried room service several times and found it to be spot on in freshness and delivery. Wifi was acceptable although not nearly as fast as our house however we get 50 mps at our house. The only concern we had was one afternoon when we went to the beach and decided to stay all the way to the left side of the Le Blanc property. There were children that migrated over to our area and they were nice however they were somewhat noisy. Keep in mind we love children but on this trip it was all about us. We also had some beach neighbors 3 4 guys that became pretty drunk and began complaining about how there were no women to hit on too bad for them. They should have read the reviews and learned that Le Blanc is a premium couples resort. Nonetheless we had too many distractions. No worries within a few minutes one of the beach attendants moved us to a remote spot on the beach in just a few minutes. All in all 5 stars is awarded and deserved to this establishment. If you are looking for fine dining relaxing and unparalleled service in an all inclusive there is no finer resort than this. Also as far as resort credits we did not use any of ours. We ate slept and stayed on the beach the entire time. which is probably the nicest beach in all of Cancun.

This was our first time at Le Blanc and most likely it wo n\u2019t be our last. If you \u2019re looking for an all inclusive resort this is it. I do n\u2019t think that anyone does it much better. I researched this trip for at least a year before we actually traveled so my expectations were high. In nearly every category they were met or exceeded. The resort is compact but never seems crowded. It is an older hotel that has obviously been gusied up and in places it shows. The food is good and they offer a nice variety. Drinks were okay but did seem watered down at times. The spa was relaxing and comfortable. The service that I requested was good \u2013 albeit maybe a little too short. We spent one day at the main pool and one day at the beach. Both were excellent. Any complaint was immediately addressed to make sure that we were happy which I appreciated. Also on my birthday we came back to our room to find a special bath with rose petals chocolate covered strawberries chilled champagne and a Happy Birthday banner \u2013 all without having to request it. Very memorable. If I had to point out a few things. Apple TV did n\u2019t work for us. The wifi was too weak to make the connection which was disappointing since we were looking forward to chilling out with a movie. There is very little to do at night besides eat and sit at the main bar in the lobby. The shows offered are at dinner time and we missed most of them. They could do with putting more thought into this area. Also there were a couple of requests that we made at the main pool \u2013 needing an umbrella menu. etc. \u2013 that went unaddressed. There was also a rowdy bunch that seemed to take over the swim up bar while we were there. Taking shots and playing loud music ruining the ambiance for the rest of us. Overall the service makes this resort. The staff is really nice and accommodating. We had a great time and will return.

From the moment we were picked up at the airport in an SUV by Juan Carlos we knew this was going to be an experience like no other. He told us before we left the airport that himself and the all staff at Le Blanc would do everything they could to make this an extraordinary vacation. He then asked if we had a drink choice presented us with our pillow aromatherapy and bath salts options. He also offered me a flower for me to give to my wife. When we arrived at Le Blanc we were greeted by Eidy the concierge given the drinks we chose in the SUV and brought over to reception to check in. This was the easiest check in we have had anywhere we have ever traveledUpon arriving on our floor we were greeted by Manuel the first of two butlers who work on our floor. He introduced himself to us and again offered to provide us anything we wanted whenever we wanted it. We asked about their unpacking service which he said he had do just to let him know when it would be convenient for us. We were going to lunch so we asked if he could do it at that time. When we arrived back at our room EVERYTHING was unpacked it looked like we were shopping in a department store. Everything was perfectly placed and hung pretty much where we would have put it ourselves if we were unpacking. We also met Isaac the other butler who made our dinner reservations and was also there for anything we needed. The restaurants at Le Blanc are amazing. Everyone can have a favorite but its really hard to chose one here because they are all so different in a good way. We ate breakfast at the International restaurant and were always greeted by Vanessa and Gabriela and Marcelino was our waiter almost every morning. Mexican Asian Italian French and outdoor Bistro are all covered at Le Blanc. They also have options for dinner on the beach in a cabana and the do not miss event is the Chefs dinner. Most of our time was spent at the pool or beach. Again the staff was awesome Lucinda Janete Sarah made sure we were well hydrated and fed. We used resort credits to get a beach cabana and David and Hugo took excellent care of us. We liked to finished the day at the quiet pool by the lagoon and it was there we met our new favorite bartender Jesus. When I told him I liked tequila he looked up classic recipes online and hand wrote them into his journal then made something different for me everyday. If you have any questions or concerns we went to Public Relations. Pamela Luna was so sweet and helpful and always had the answers to all our questions. We chose Le Blanc because its standard of service was rated as excellent and boy that is an understatement. Five diamonds does not even begin to describe the far beyond anything you could imagine experience you receive when you walk into the resort. It would be nearly impossible to name all the staff who work so hard to be sure our vacation was a memorable one but each one of them deserves credit for making Le Blanc the success that it is.

Room Facilities. 6 out of 10The biggest problem we had during our stay is with our rooms which is quite surprising for such a pricey hotel. We arrived late in the day around 8 pm and were told that there are no other rooms available except for the 1st floor. The lobby is very nice but when you actually go into the suites area you can see that it \u2019s no where near a 5 star with all the bad paint jobs and cracks. Considering they just had a renovation early this year I \u2019d say the renovation team did a very very bad job. In fact part of the hotel is still under construction but it \u2019s pretty minor. Back to our rooms both of the rooms we got on the 1st floor had cockroaches problems at the first night one room had one and the other room had two. So we talked to the supervisor and she was kind enough to switch us onto the third floor. But we were told nothing else is available upon check in. She also offered a free spa massage to make up for the bug problem. The two rooms on the third floors are much better in terms of the maintenance and cleaness although they are the same room type. We did see another cockroach in one of the rooms on the 4th day but just to be fair with the hotel the rooms seem to be well cleaned. Some people are less sensitive to bugs but unfortunately we really do n\u2019t like them so that and the bad construction job really brought down the overall ratings quite a lot. Pools and gym are pretty nice though. Food 8 out of 10The 4 1 restaurants are actually quite enough for the dinners for a good week of stay. The 1 is a bistro called Terrace which is n\u2019t featured on their website. During dinner hours this place is actually a steakhouse which we only found out about on our last day. We did get to try it out and it \u2019s pretty awesome. Asian restaurant is very nice and seems to be the most popular. Mexican restaurant the same place where you have breakfast and lunch buffet seems to be the least popular but it \u2019s actually very good. Perhaps people just do n\u2019t want to go the same restaurant for all three meals during the day. Italian restaurant and French restaurant are also pretty decent and the presentation is excellent.

Which could be use towards upgrading your dinner items some of the hotel operated tours and for the SPA. I see a lot of people complaining about the extra 16 charge for the RC but personally I do n\u2019t think it \u2019s a bad deal. It \u2019s true that we are already paying a lot of money for the hotel and we do n\u2019t like paying extra. But for 100 RC which is 16 USD out of pocket you can get two lobster tails.

My husband and I went there for our 10th year anniversary for three nights four days. We booked through Costco Travel and as part of the package we received a 500 resort credits. Upon arrival the front desk lady asked if we were here on any special occasion. I told her our reason. We had a hotel view room and asked if we could get an ocean view instead of as we were celebrating our 10th year anniversary. She said she could give us an ocean view room but that would be an additional 80 night in which we opted for. After we checked in with the front desk we were told that our room will be available in an hour and that a concierge will talk to us about restaurants and other resort info. They sat us down and showed us activities that we can use the resort credit for. These include a snorkel tour swim with dolphins spa treatments etc. The concierge told us that only 120 of our 500 resort credit can be used toward the spa. However if we checked out the other resorts under The Palace brand they will give us all 500 toward the spa if we want. We heard great things about the spa at Le Blanc. We knew this was going to be another timeshare sale pitch but we used to it and have an exit strategy. We expected a lot more from Le Blanc than trying to sell us a timeshare. We were very disappointed. Yet we went for it anyway as we wanted the 500 credit all toward the spa. When we got to our room we were disappointed there were no roses on the bed. Why would the front desk asked for our occasion of the stay and not doing something delightful. The next morning as part of the timeshare sale presentation agreement we were taken to the sister resort 15 minutes away. It is not a luxury hotel like Le Blanc and the breakfast was subpar. We spent 90 minutes there and they sale person worked very hard to get us to spend 600 on the timeshare. The spa treatment was amazing. The couple massage was 450 before tax. We paid 66 for tax on top. After the massage the lady was helping me with the spa experience. She told me to first start off with a sauna she laid the towel down put cucumbers on my eyes and a cold towel on my forehead. Came back to get me after 10 15 minutes. Then showed me to the Ice Room where I rubbed ice on my body and then she gave me aloe to cover my body with. I ended with the hot tub cold pool and warm pool. It was excellent. We tried all of the restaurants there and it was so exquisite. All of our dinners japanese mexican steak house italian were amazing. The lunch buffet at Blanc International was the best buffet I had. The only subpar meal was lunch at Teraza. Nothing special at all. We love the ice cream parlor by the pool. We get ice cream and shakes twice a day. We paid very frequent visits to the Coffee and Sweets cafe for the macaroon truffles and chocolates. It was the best. The butler service sounds good in theory but we did not really take advantage of that. A lot of people love it though so I think if you really use it it could be a grand experience.

She would check up on us when ever she passed us during the day to see if we need anything. Christina at the pool was continually bringing us drinks and food and she was a busy lady always had a smile on her face. We always had a warm greeting from all the staff in the morning during breakfast. could not pick out just one as they all were so gracious. Every one of the restaurants we chose to eat at for dinner we had great servers a few would be Omar Daniel Roger the Mgr. at the terrace wood bistro and the mgr at Luimere including our server. One big shout out to our driver to the airport Juan Carlos he was so informative on what to do and where to go once we arrived at the airport. I wish we had someone like him the first time we visited Cancun in 08. We are pretty seasoned travelers now but still it was great advice. The only negative thing is I wish there was one restaurant that offered the Mayan Coffee. We just could not get to the lobby bar at the time they were making those. We have always enjoyed a Mayan Coffee after one or two of our dinners. Really missed that. You really will not be disappointed in choosing Le Blanc. We will be back.", "offset": [1218, 1339], "date": "2019-09-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "a2e1c7e4-2db1-4a0b-8fea-dfbca32b88a8", "sentence": "Perfection. Every employee answers every request with the phrase \u201c it is my pleasure \u201d. \u201c No \u201d is not in their vocabulary. Attention to detail and customer satisfaction is front and center at this resort. It \u2019s as close to perfection as any place I \u2019ve ever been. We are members of the Palace Resorts vacation club and have traveled to most of the Palace resorts including Moon Palace Beach Palace Sun Palace Playacar Palace Cozumel Palace and Isla Mujeres Palace. While Playacar Palace and Sun Palace are both nice Le Blanc is far and above the ultimate in luxury and service not only within the Palace family but also in Canc\u00fan note 1 TripAdvisor rating and maybe in Mexico. I suspect a large portion of the credit for the exceptional service can be credited to our Diamond concierge Roger. Even if you are not a Diamond member you will benefit from Roger \u2019s discerning gift of service as he has trained many Palace service personnel. Food and Beverage Under the capable leadership of Isac there is truly something for everyone. Our favorite restaurants are Lumiere for fine dining and Bela for Italian cuisine. Up and coming in our favorites list is Teraza primarily for the beautiful view. Teraza is outside on the third floor with perfect views of the ocean. It was once only open for breakfast and lunch but now includes dinner. It is a premium choice for a quiet romantic dinner. We enjoyed its beautiful ambiance for our final meal of our vacation with a menu created just for us. Blanc the buffet under the capable management of Marco and his beautiful smile is always available for any meal. We usually enjoy breakfast or lunch there where if it \u2019s not presented on the buffet Marco will see to your desire. I understand that Marco prepared a beautiful birthday surprise for breakfast on my birthday which we missed because we decided to breakfast at Teraza that day. I will forever feel sorry for disappointing Marco and his precious staff. We like to begin each morning and evening in the lobby bar where Elias serves mimosas and comedy and magic with a smile in the morning and Byliyoel serves in the evening. At this visit we had dinner twice at the 1 for fine dining Lumiere. Once being my birthday dinner. Whether you choose the tasting menu or a la carte Lumiere is a culinary delight. I \u2019ve never in my 60 years had better. A young couple there one evening asked us our opinion on two entree choices. We had to tell them both were exceptional. One was steak which being from Texas we \u2019re steak lovers. Honestly I used to think steak was not a great option in Mexico but something has changed at Le Blanc. They \u2019ve now got steak down. Chef cooks it to perfection. What I told the couple is you ca n\u2019t go wrong with any choice because if by some chance it is n\u2019t to your liking they \u2019l be pleased to make anything else for you. TrulyChef Rene delighted us on each of our three visits to Bela. He visited our table to make suggestions from the menu or something not on the menu. Duo tomato and goat cheese soup is yummy. And I always had to finish the meal with the tiramisu. Yama the Japanese restaurant is not my favorite but that \u2019s probably due to my tastes. I \u2019m open to trying different foods. My father always encouraged that. Just nothing has bowled me over at that restaurant. It does have a large varied menu and that includes many sushi options so there \u2019s that. The miso soup is good. We usually do n\u2019t order room service for dinner when we travel as we find at most places it \u2019s sub par. We made an exception this trip one evening as I was not feeling well and we were enjoying relaxing in our suite. Once again Le Blanc did not disappoint. My soup arrived hot and delicious. My husband enjoyed the lasagna. Finally on the restaurant subject Fabien Le Blanc \u2019s sommelier is quickly available at any of the restaurants to make the perfect wine selection to accompany any meal from among Le Blanc \u2019s large and varied wine list. The Spa oh my. I ca n\u2019t say enough good things. From the time Ana greets you with her beautiful smile until you leave feeling like butter. The spa ambiance is quiet and relaxing. It \u2019s difficult to decide from the spa menu as every service is sure to make you feel great. PolThere are three choices. The main infinity pool offering a swim up bar and that VIEW of the beautiful ocean how many shades of blue. There is an even quieter pool also with swim up bar at the lagoon pool. There \u2019s also a healthy option restaurant there with smoothies. They made a special smoothie concoction for me on the day that I was not feeling well. All pools are serviced by the two hardest working sweet little ladies you will ever meet Laura and Lucinda. They run between the three pools and the beach making sure there are plenty of towels and everything is running smooth. Lucinda comes by with cucumbers for your eyes a scented cool towel and a little massage. Laura is on top of everything even the occasional miss behaving guest trying to disturb the spa ambiance with loud music or horseplay. By the way if that \u2019s your scene Le Blanc is not your place. Know before you go. The word SPA is not in the name of the resort by chance. The ambiance is all about relaxation. Customer service personnel Elizabeth and Bruno see to the maintenance of that ambiance. A little fun Le Blanc detail at three pm as the song Ca n\u2019t Stop the Feeling plays at the main pool the butlers parade among the guests with a little tasty treat for all to enjoy. Also hard working little ladies Chris and Jeanete and server Jorge are always at hand to serve drinks and food with the ever present \u201c it is my pleasure \u201d response. We \u2019re not late night or volleyball people but if you want entertainment Ana is there to fulfill those needs. The rooms at Le Blanc are designed with relaxation and comfort in mind. We sleep like the dead at Le Blanc. Night night and we are unconscious until morning. Every floor has butlers ours being Alejandro by day and Joel by night to be certain all your needs are being met. They will do anything you ask with that famous phrase again to be certain your needs are being met. As our concierge Roger made all of our dinner and spa arrangements for us but the butlers will do that also. There is an aromatherapy device in each room delivering your fragrance of choice. The butlers maintain that. They also make certain you have the perfect pillows to your specific tastes. At Le Blanc they are on top of service. If they detect a need they offer to fulfill it. It \u2019s uncanny. For example I \u2019m carrying my vase of flowers given to me for my birthday downstairs to give to an employee upon leaving because sadly I ca n\u2019t take them with me. Joel is right there to do that for me. There is a problem with our room key Joel jumps on the elevator with us to go directly to the desk with us to alleviate that issue. I have an envelope of documents I want to take to my room before relaxing at the pool. Assistant manager Leslie is THERE to do that for me. I have a bottle of water on my table Roger picks it up and loosens the top. God forbid a guest should have to carry something or take extra steps. Not at Le BlancEverything is so clean. You wo n\u2019t see leftover servicewear or an unflufed pillow anywhere. When a guest leaves their spot in the lobby or elsewhere an employee is immediately on that space to tidy. We do n\u2019t leave the resort while we \u2019re there except for maybe a shopping trip to La Isla. When you return you feel at home again greeted by a cool towel a bottle of water and bellman Isa \u2019s warm smile. Ah. home againI wish I could convey the total ambiance in mere words. But I ca n\u2019t convey all four senses. From the moment of arrival greeted by a cool rose scented towel and beverage throughout your stay no detail is overlooked. If they do n\u2019t have it your drink or food or whatever manager Janai and his staff would honestly be offended if you did n\u2019t ask for it. That \u2019s Le Blanc. I could go on and on. I \u2019m certain I \u2019ve missed a detail or an amazing staff member. If you \u2019re looking for the ultimate in relaxation service and cuisine look no further than Le Blanc.", "offset": [3389, 3411], "date": "2019-09-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "8a7dd6cc-f33b-4e7d-b131-47537e42323d", "sentence": "Our \u2018 Home Away from Home \u2019. We are just home from our week long stay at Le Blanc Cancun and all we would change is to still be there. Everyone at the resort is friendly and helpful. The recent renovation is beautiful and evident throughout the property. Roger our DC arranged everything for us in advance from spa reservations to restaurant reservations. He is wonderfully efficient and attentive from beginning to end. Joaquin picked us up with a big smile despite it having taken us almost two hours to get through the unusually long line at immigration. We had some wonderful waiters David and Candelario greeted us with our usual breakfast and lunch beverages kept us laughing and helped us with our Spanish. Vanessa greeted us at the door every day with a big smile and swept us off to our table. Gustavo was there every morning to help out David and Candelario keeping us flush with coffee and our favorite \u2018 green juice \u2019. We could n\u2019t help but notice Alfredo a restaurant manager who was absolutely everywhere making sure that all was well for everyone. We thoroughly enjoyed our three dinners at Blanc serving authentic Mexican cuisine. Our excellent waitress Karelia served us the first night and we requested her each night we returned. She is efficient and so knowledgeable about the dishes she was able to explain every choice and make recommendations. Our complements to the chef especially for his rendition of our most favorite Lime Soup. We had a number of awesome Butlers each one greeting us making our arrangements and helping us with our Spanish. Many many thanks to Alejandro Antonio and Alfredo. We met Alfredo the director of Activites who works tirelessly entertaining everyone. We enjoyed the Michael Jackson show. Our favorite spot to hang out is the Luna Pool and Dana had us set up in our usual spot every morning and along with Ivan kept us well fed and hydratedAnd so we left our second home Joaquin again driving us to the airport already missing everyone at Le Blanc and planning our next stay.", "offset": [1367, 1455], "date": "2019-11-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "be4c636a-4c21-4e4a-ac6b-edd4240545f4", "sentence": "Simply the best. This was our first visit to Le Blanc Cancun and it was everything we hoped for and much more. We came in for a short weekend Thursday through Sunday our only complaint was that we wished we could stay longer. The check in process was fast and professional in the first five minutes we arrived we were treated to warm neck pillows coconut water and cold towels we immediately felt special. Our room was beautiful and faced the ocean beach I wished we had a larger balcony however honestly we spent so much time on the rest of the property that it was definitely not an inconvenience whatsoever. The food was unbelievable if you closed your eyes you would have no idea whether you were at an all inclusive or a fancy new york restaurant. We dined at the Italian restaurant twice and also at Lumiere fine dining. Both were excellent and the service was over the top. The pool and beach are gorgeous and so nice and relaxing. This is definitely not a party environment no foam parties to be found which was exactly what we needed. The spa is beautiful if a massage is not your thing definitely check out the hydrotherapy which is included for any guest it was wonderful. The staff treat you like royalty and you truly feel important and special every moment of the day.

This was our first return visit to Le Blanc since its major renovation. The atmosphere is wonderful. The restaurants and public spaces are inviting and the rooms are excellent. Food and drink are top shelf. But once again what makes this such a special place is the outstanding staff that is there to serve your every need. From the moment of our arrival when Cesar greeted us and checked us in we felt pampered and special. Time on the beach was made special too. Ernando the lifeguard was always on watch and our super beach boy Mairco daily prepared beach chairs and positioned an amazing umbrella just right. All of the restaurants were excellent but our favorites were the breakfast buffet with Vanessa as hostess and David as our preferred waiter. The Terrace Restaurant was our favorite hangout. Walter is an amazing chef and Viridiana a delightful hostess. Waiters Mario Jorge Fausto Carlos and Alberto went out of their way to attend to our every need. My wife enjoys the spa and would love to bring Guadeloupe and Karina home. Lastly our floor butler Antonio provided just the right amount of TLC not to much and not to little. Because of our wonderfully positive experience with the staff and because of the understated elegance of the property we will be regular return guests.
