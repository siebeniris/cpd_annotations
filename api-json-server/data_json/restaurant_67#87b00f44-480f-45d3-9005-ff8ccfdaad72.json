We stayed here because we have stayed in the Four Point brand before and been pleased and because it is across the street and walking distance from Kaufman Field and we were in for game 6 of the ALCSIt turned out OK the rooms were comfortable enough the beds actually really comfy but I would describe the property as quite spartan. It is just the basics and not much more. There is a restaurant bar of sorts but as we discovered the hard way it is open for breakfast until 0930 but closed all day until 170 honestly the KC Sports Complex and this hotel is in the middle of absolutely nowhere you can see downtown KC about 10 miles away to the west. we did not have a rental car and you can not even get lunch at your hotelThe staff were very friendly but we were shocked at the lack of anything close by really there is nothing and do not be fooled by the Caseys sports bar ads from across the street advertised as open all day it is not same hours as the Four Point bar ie closed all day until 160. The only food available is at a Denys kitty corner at yet another hotel which is alright I guess but you want a beer with your lunch. ya no. the Denys is not licensed and full of little kids so mid day lunch on game day game 6 of the ALCS. hundreds if not thousands of out of town fans and there is not a beer within miles. Just not at all what we expected. Not sure what I would recommend if you are an out of towner going to KC for a big game but I would not stay at this property again.", "offset": [1029, 1162], "date": "2015-10-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "70cd329f-fc19-4098-b43a-47ccbfb64235", "sentence": "Will return. Have stayed here twice. Once for a Royals game and once for a Chiefs game. Both stays were great. The first time we stay we just went to the game and stayed over night. So we were not there long. This last time we stayed the night before so we checked out the bar. it is a nice little place but the food was cold when it came out. The bar staff also seemed a little uncaring and did not move very fast. I would not knock the hotel on that though as it seemed to be ran by an individual contractor or something like that.

The cooler barely kept the beer cold so she had to keep them in ice. Some of the TVs were not working. But the bartender and staff here are all nice no complaints there. The other things that annoyed me were much more minor. The toilet barely worked. The garbage cans did not have garbage bags. And there was a button missing on their soap dispenser in the shower.
