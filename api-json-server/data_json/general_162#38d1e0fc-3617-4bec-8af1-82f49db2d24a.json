We stayed for two nights on a busy July week when the hotel was fairly full. The staff members we encountered were all friendly and welcoming but slightly overwhelmed with the demands on their time.

However the bed was comfortable and it was reasonably quiet most of the time ours overlooked the rail lines and some trains caused the building to shake. Fortunately it is not too busy a line at night. The bar area was pleasant and the restaurant terrace also. We do not like the new Novotel restaurant menu which is dumbed down to a choice of beefburgers a simple steak and a fish dish. Here the chef had added a few local specialities which we chose and which were good. I have mentioned before that Novotels used to be known for their restaurants but sadly this has become a thing of the past so it is much appreciated if the chef does add something more interesting to the awful fast food fare which appears to be their new standard. We went out the second night. the location of the hotel is good and there are many restaurants a short walk away. Breakfast was a real scrum most items were running out fast and tables were not cleared. The second day we avoided this chaos and walked down the road to a cafe.

I am an Acor Club Platinum member which means I have probably spent years in Acor hotels and I am glad to say that I have seldom needed to complain until earlier this week when I had the misfortune to spend three nights over the New Year period in a building site with a sign outside saying Novotel Anecy Centre Atria a Novotel I have stayed in a number of times in the past and was very much looking forward to a New Year break. Instead I needed to find the \u201c Temporary \u201d hotel entrance on the other side of the building from the car park entrance navigate my way through the office block corridors to the lifts to take me to the temporary reception. Although the reception staff themselves were very welcoming the hotel is in an extremely sorry state our \u201c Executive \u201d room was very tired with the furniture stained and grubby and the heating AC operated with a mind of its own I could not control it at all. My wife was very cold during our first night but by the middle of the night the heating had come on with no input from us and the room became too hot. When we checked into the room the alarm bells should have rung when I noticed that while the A C was switched on the temperature control had been set to 30 degrees and it was still cold. All of this was after negotiating three separate lifts to get from the car park to our room on the fourth floor. The hotel restaurant temporarily located in a soulless function room on the first night of our stay Dec 30th the food was very good but the service was pretty ropey. On the second night New Year \u2019s Eve both the food and the service were excellent but on our third night the food and service were both terrible. I think it is worth noting that the waiting staff on New Year \u2019s Eve was different to the other two nights much better and more efficient. In my considered opinion this hotel should close immediately not to reopen until the renovations have been completed or alternatively any on line enquiries or bookings should carry a highly visible warning that the hotel was undergoing major renovation resulting in considerable disruption to the service they can provide. A total of 693 \u20ac for three nights and three dinners for two in a building site is not good enough.
