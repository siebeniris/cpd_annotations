Arrived at this hotel in the evening and it is a nightmare of one way roads to get here. Parking is not the easiest there is nowhere to park to decide if you will use self parking or the valet service. The valet kindly found a spot for my car while I checked in and heard the details and prices for both types of parking. There is no self parking other than on street parking and I never saw a single vacant on street space during my weeks stay. Check in was fast and smooth upgraded to a beautiful room with a stunning view in the tower on the far end from the front desk. Mr A Ramos at the front desk could not have been more helpful absolutely great. He was very helpful to me on several occasions throughout my stay including settling the items on my bill. Many thanks from a frequent traveler you made my stay much easier. The hotel is renovating the main bar lobby area but other than outside I did not notice any issues. Restaurants are adequate food is ok and priced within expectations for this area. Dinner service was good with a wide variety of options good quality and service. Pool and beach area are very nice loads of available loungers and all in good condition. Pool bar area also under reno the main bar drinks were good but service a bit hit miss. A few curious things why the security guard to the pool area. Odd as well as the signing for towels. Who even does that anymore especially for a simple bath towel exactly like the ones in the rooms. I enjoyed the reception for Gold Diamond H nice hospitality and really enjoyed the local food drink. However why the chintzy breakfast. Continental breakfast only for Gold Diamond or pay a 10 upgrade. Even Hampton gives me a hot breakfast for free. This needs a re look. Hotel is a prime candidate for an executive lounge. Appreciate the computers and printer in the main lobby area since the business center has limited hours. Room was huge and although older kept in good shape. There are some signs of age but the room was spotless. Kudos to housekeeping. Very quiet with no disturbances. Valet parking is the way to go here there are only two choices. Guys at the valet stand are amazing so nice and quick with your car when you need it. A bargain for the additional 6 or so a day. Great stay for business traveler would love to bring the family along next time.", "offset": [374, 497], "date": "2015-01-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "c50a4b60-2544-43c6-b98e-fcef6b67b7de", "sentence": "Convenient and clean hotel in a good location. We got our hotel deal through CheapCaribean which frankly is not very cheap. This is how we landed at the Hilton haven. The hotel is very nice. You enter through an open air lobby without walls which had a very island feel to it. There are a couple of areas on site that house native birds and koi fish too. The front desk staff were pleasant as were the concierge staff. Beach staff well if I had to work outside in that heat everyday I had be a bit grumpy too. The bedroom was nice enough and was kept very clean each day even when we did not indicate we had need towel sheet changes. The room had a look of being updated around 5 years ago but was a good size and comfortable. The bedding was immaculate and I intend to find out what pillows Hilton uses because they are awesome. That said bedding is very subjective. I can tell you the mattress was on the firm side which I always prefer. The pillows however had a lot of give and were definitely some kind of down or down fill. Bathroom had room to move around and two sinks mirrors which is a nice amenity. We also had our own balcony which is standard. Our view was not the best the neighboring parking lot. that is probably due to the rate we paid through the online site. The resort is an impressive size with several of its own restaurants two pools and a pool bar an indoor bar and open seating area near the lobby several conference rooms suites and several towers. Finally there is a small private beach area that my husband and I used each day. This was our first time on a resort so I lack experience to give a true review. But as a first timer I very much appreciated the convenience of leaving our hotel room to pop downstairs onto our own little beach complete with beach towels and chairs. The folks who put in the umbrellas did so reluctantly. Felt badly asking but that is why the hotel lovingly charges an 18 convenience fee on the total stay. Yes. You heard it here. We were not given this fine print when booking through CheapCaribean so buyer beware. The restaurants were very overpriced for what they offered food wise. As my husband and I like to venture out we were encouraged to find out what San Juan holds outside of resort central. There are awesome restaurants within walking distance including Pelayo \u2026 check out my review there under same name. One night when we were feeling lazy we went to Fogo De Chao which is on the resort compound. Wonderful staff service and great concept and food. but wow is it expensive. We live in Boston and this was the most I had ever spent on a meal for two people at 150 tip. Hotel is walking distance to Old San Juan and Condado area each logging about 15 2 miles but where it gets very warm it helps to take a taxi one way. Taxis are easy to access via front lobby area and around town. Car rental places nearby make for convenient day trip plans. Overall a nice stay and probably great for folks with families large groups of people who like resorts.", "offset": [1157, 1211], "date": "2015-04-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "8ecb0412-af01-4999-a0d3-d6192d8ea48f", "sentence": "Close to the Ocean but isolated from dining shopping outside of the hotel.

The decor is imitation Scandinavian with clean and simple lines but the venue is showing her age in spite of attempts to redecorate. The carpet is in need of renewal.

I was here on vacation with my mother over last winter break january. We stayed in a room facing the ocean on an upper floor and it was a beautiful view from the balcony. The room was extremely clean modern spacious and well kept. The front desk and housekeeping service was quick polite and helpful when I asked for another comforter on the bed. the AC definetly works. There was also a full length mirror in the room which I liked. One down fall for me was the pocket door on the bathroom. sliding it got annoying and when shut it was still a crack open so that kind of disturbed privacy. The grounds of this hotel were very well kept and beautiful. The circular tanning deck was super cool. it hung out slightly in the water so you felt like you were surrounded by the ocean. Chairs filled up quickly so go down early in the morning an put your stuff on a couple lounge chairs to hold your spot. They also have a very nice private beach just for guest which was clean and very calm because of the rock breakers that took out the larger waves before they reached the shore. Best part about this hotel is the location. All of the other hotels we encountered were in the heart of san juan which was busier rowdier and dirtier. This hotel kind of stands alone between san juan and old san juan and is a cheaper taxi ride into the old city because of its location. Taxi into the old city was about 13 14 dollars and completely worth it. We spent one night eating in the old city and then an entire day touring and shopping and eating in the city. We both agree we could have spent more time in the city had we gotten the chance. There is a great mexican restaurant within walking distance of the hotel that had really excellent food must have eaten here three times it was so delicious and the staff was beyond friendly. They really went the extra mile to make you feel welcome. Wish I could remember the name but ask at the front desk. there are not too many places within walking distance so they should know where it is. Also there was a sushi place nearby which was yummy surprisingly and the bar at the pool had a good hamburger. If you want to rent a car they will tell you there is a car rental man at the hotel but he was much more expensive than the place directly across the street from the hotel. Its a small little building with only one person working but offered better prices faster availability and we were able to just park the car right out in front of the rental place at the end of the day instead of pay money to house the car int he garage which you have to do if you rent from the car rental in the hotel. TIP Do not bother buying excursions from the hotel. Complete waste of money time and patience. Instead rent a car and drive around doing what you want. To rent a car is only about 50 70 a day and all the excursions are pretty cheap when you book them directly. When you buy an excursion through the hotel you are basically paying for the ride there. For example to tour the riu camay caves it was about 100 PER PERSON through the hotel. but we just hopped in our car and drove to the cave park where it was only 12 to get in. Also driving in puerto rico is so easy and the roads are beautiful even the highways. You see mountains lush green plants and trees and the roads were easy to navigate and never traficy. We were able to do and see so much more because of the rental car.", "offset": [3101, 3189], "date": "2015-07-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "64db3e37-f2de-4957-9598-9d2d1fd3b9c1", "sentence": "I love that hotel.

After reading reviews I was puzzled by the disparity now I understand after our recent two night stay. Our first night rated one star the second rated 4star. We are Hilton Diamond. so stay at a lot of hotels particularly Hilton brand. I used points for this stay and booked a standard king room. On check in we were upgraded to a junior suite in the garden wing. A bit shocked when we entered the room a not very functional anteroom with a couch TV small frig single window up near the ceiling to block view of garage. Bathroom small dark dank. Bedroom with interconnecting door. Narrow balcony with view out over an unattractive football field size rooftop with its AC units. As the room was free points I thought it would be good enough for the 2 nights and was not going to ask to move. There was water pooled around the toilet on our arrival I thought left by the maids. Sopped it up. It kept coming back. That PM our neighbors on the other side of the interconnecting door arrived we could hear every word could even hear them unzipping their suitcases. Toilet continued to ooze all over the floor. Between the noise the leaking toilet the thin walls we needed to move. At 6AM I went online to see what other rooms were available there were many types to include a corner oceanview for 100 more than what our room would have cost. I asked front desk if we could move and I would pay the difference to upgrade. Told to wait until 9 when reservations arrived. Returned at 9 even though the room I wanted was still available online I was told I could not have it. but could get a suite in the tower wing for 400 more or a suite in the garden wing for 100 we were unwilling to give the garden wing another try. We packed our bags and were going to move to the Condada. I called the Hilton Diamond desk to see if I could transfer the points I had used on the upcoming night at the Caribe to the Condada and was told they were not transferable we would lose them if we moved. They offered to call the Caribe manager she contacted me shortly after and offered the ocean corner room I had inquired about without additional charge which I happily accepted I thought it very gracious and would have paid an upgrade fee the room was open but needed to be cleaned 1030 AM. We checked at noon then 2 then 4 normal check in time still not cleaned. It was finally ready at 545 PM. It was a beautiful room. Spotless light airy great views modern furnishings quick elevators wide bright hallways leading to room. Just what you would expect in a nice resort. So bottom line. there is such a difference in the rooms wings at this resort garden wing is dark old most with views of rooftops some at the far end probably look at trees. Tower wing we did not see the rooms but lobby looked nice is set far back from the ocean but I would imagine the high level rooms have good views the low level rooms look at the parking structure or the concrete wall of the 8story garden wing. The main wing is what you want. BUT you can not tell what wing you are getting booking online. Probably worthwhile calling the hotel and seeing if you can book specifically into the main wing or high tower level. There were many NICE things I want to mention. Pool was beautiful. It is oceanfront with a lagoon to swim in. Grounds are old school Caribbean with flowers trees wildlife. Terrific fitness center. Breakfast buffet is not cheap but what I would expect to pay at any resort and food was good. We had a great meal at Il Giardino restaurant not cafe part wonderful pasta and pizza very personable service. The waiter was so attentive and entertaining without being obtrusive. The main bar was hopping and had interesting drinks engaging bartenders. I also feel the manager did a great customer satisfaction recovery with the room switch. but then was let down by her front desk it should not have needed to go to her and by housekeeping. Would I stay here again. The front desk was friendly but unresponsive. Housekeeping has some issues. they should have known the toilet was leaking and had it fixed not waiting for a guest to bring it up. Plus I would have expected them to expedite a room cleaning for a guest already on the premises that was moving to a new room due to facility issues. Vacations should be relatively stress free. this stay was not. If I returned I would need to contact the resort directly with confirmation I was in the main wing.

I am a Lifetime Diamond member with Hilton. We have stayed here a few times in the past 15 or 20 years and decided to take a week off and get away again. The old place seems to be mostly back after the hurricane. We do miss the old days with the concierge lounge for Gold and Diamond members. Let \u2019s face it those are now long gone at most Hilton properties. The use of hot tubs and extra pools in the back are gone. They do have two hot tubs that are lukewarm but that also seems to be the trend at most hotels. Too many drunk and old folks getting sick if they are over 95 degrees F. I hope they bring them back someday. The pier that you feed the fish off of has been shut down for years. We used to love feeding and seeing the fish. It has been shut down for many years. Before the hurricane. Let me start out by thanking the hotel staff for a great stay. The front desk was fantastic I do not say that often. Hiram and Roberto at the bar by the pool really make everyone feel welcome. The room pool beach chairs towels were all great. The food was ok. There is a mall across the street lots of choices and good prices for food. You have to leave the property and go to the corner to catch a UBER. I wish Hilton would let uber pick is up at the front of the hotel. The location with its protected bay is a gem. It is why we keep coming back here. I and giving them five stars and what I am about to write is hopefully taken as constructive and not a complaint. Having to go to the corner and catch an UBER is just strange. Taxis cost many times more then what Uber charges and we used Uber many times with zero issues. They were fast in getting us to where we wanted to go and much better than local taxis. Hilton should really consider creating an adult only section by the pool. For the most part parents kept their kids under control. But we all know some parents just leave their kids without supervision. They have several pools. How about the one by the bar for adults and the rest for families. Call it the serenity section Yes I stole that term. They have a scuba diving shop in the facility with some great staff. Diving here is hit or miss this time of year and delays have be expected. Do not let the shallow depth fool you. They have a strong current and it can be challenging. I wish I had brought my own gear because the rental great is in need of repair and upgrade. I would be shocked if they were a 5star PADI shop. Like I mentioned the staff is great but the dive equipment not so much.

After reading some reviews I was biting my nails on the flight down that my choice in this property would result in an impending divorce and so after spending a week I hope my perspective might help your future travel to this property. We arrived at 145 which was bad news because check in was at 4. I could certainly feel the burning from my wives eyes that potentially we had 4 hours with zero amenities available to us. Miguel aka hero at the front desk had us checked in to the waves tower in 5 minutes and gave us a better room than we originally had. He was awesome friendly and efficient. As were the few staff handling the taxis on arrival. The room was just about what I expected perhaps a bit better. Clean fantastic view bed was good hot shower with good water pressure. Did nt spend a whole lot of time in it other than sleeping and the occasional 5 minute recreational time so it fit all the bills. The property itself was very nice. Pool was good a tad chilly but after the initial 2 mintues you got used to it. Swim up bar was also very nice. The hot tubs were not hot but other than staying in the northeast I ve never actually experienced a hot hot tub in the caribean so no points lost here. The grounds were also well maintained and had some cool offerings like a walk out deck to the ocean and swim up barge some cool loungers ect. It was most certainly not 5 star pool and grounds but based on what we spent it most certainly fell in line or exceeded expectations. The beach is not large but not lacking. Loungers are everywhere and its clean and well kept. It has very little waves as its sheltered a bit with a reef which also provides beautiful views of breakers all day. However there is a public beach a 10 minute walk away thay is a nicer option should you like to mix it up. The indoor lobby space was great having a few shops and a Starbucks was a pleasant plus. The lobby bar was also a great place to get a not needed night cap after over staying our welcome downtown. Location was absolutely fantastic I walked every morning shaking off the antics of the night before to the marine park central luiz park city beach and 2 forts which were all within a 10 minute brisk walk away. Drink prices were not cheap in the least. Its a hotel resort so there should not be some huge surprise here. None the less there s a great convenience store a 3 iron away where beers are 6 a six pack liters of bacardi 10. If you want to go all james bond and stock your room and bring them down its worth it. To be honest some days i felt cute and ordered a 15 pina colada the travel up and down was nt worth it. Waitresses and waiters are not circiling around at the beach or pool fast and furiously I would see them here and there. After increasing my daily calorie count two fold on this trip I found the walk delightful to the indoor or pool bar. Other than the occasional pool lunch which was solid and about what I expected in pricing we chose to dine off site. Old San Juan is a 5 minute uber away as is other neighborhoods who have a lot more authentic bang for your buck including quite an array of happy hour options. Ubers were no problem and very inexpensive the pick up area is 150 yards from the front desk so anyone whinging about having to walk for ever to get picked up is barking up the wrong tree. This security problem with other reviews has left me a little confused as well. Yes they checked our bags if we entered or rentered the pool area but they seemed more annoyed having to stand there for an 8 hour shift than anything else. Since we were not brandishing any weaponry on this trip it seemed like a non issue. I will say that after 6 8 cocktails I enjoy a cigarette and if you are a smoker this really is nt a great location as you have to smoke in one designated area out front unles you are sneaking them by the ocean. The driving point here is the value you receive here is worth it. If you want to go to the Ritz and Doroado for 5 times the nightly rate than the grout in the shower will be perfect the umbrellas will be set up before you plop down on the beach ect.

I \u2019l start with the nice things to say. The location is only 10minutes from the airport and Old San Juan. They have a private beach cove and the lobby looks nicely remodeled. The tennis courts are in good condition 6 per racquet rental. We were happy to discover that there \u2019s a wonderful food hall in the Paseo Caribe complex a 5minute walk away. We ate most of our meals there as the Hilton \u2019s options looked sorely lacking. Uber can drop you off at the front door but they can only pick you up on the edge of the property which to be fair is only a 3minute covered walk from the front door. But the Uber drivers claim the Caribe is the only hotel with this restriction. The pool area is reasonably attractive it is on the ocean but could use a significant remodel as the tile is worn out and dirty looking although it probably is n\u2019t dirty per se. The 2 hot tubs are very small maybe 5 \u2019 x 8 \u2019 and did n\u2019t get very warm. As a Hilton Honors diamond member I \u2019m used to an included breakfast and simple courtesies. However this hotel charges 11 more per person if you want the \u201c hot breakfast \u201d wich consists of Omelettes eggs bacon sausage and waffles \u2014 standard low end fare. Both gold and diamond members are treated to this up charge. There are signs throughout the restaurant calling out what is verboten. They also wanted to charge for a 2 pm late checkout even though they \u2019re clearly not full. There was neither a welcome gift nor daily complimentary water provided. They did however provide a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite again because they \u2019re clearly not full. The junior suite is moderately spacious with an excellent view over the ocean and small balcony with two chairs and a table. FWIW we booked this stay with points. There are no built in USB charging ports so be sure to bring your own adapters. The bathroom is very standard combo showertub with curtain. The room walls are paper thin. You must use a library voice to avoid being heard by your neighbors either from an adjacent room or the hallway. In general if you have low expectations and are just looking for a decent place on the beach the Hilton Caribe will serve you fine.
