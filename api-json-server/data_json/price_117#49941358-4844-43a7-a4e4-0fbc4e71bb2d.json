I have often stayed in the 5star Landmark Mandarin Oriental in Central which is undoubtedly one of the finest name hotels anywhere. And while the rather small Ovolo can not offer the kind elaborate public spaces of its larger competitors the guest rooms are absolutely first rate with a well planned bath thoughtfully arranged desk facilities and superb lighting. The extraordinarily helpful staff was an added benefit. Taxi access is quite good and there are a host of reasonable restaurants and pubs within walking distance. The no nonsense Wifi puts many larger hotels to shame my connection was easy and reception was perfect throughout my stay. It is an ideal business hotel and the included breakfasts were simple but excellent. I wish this new hotel chain much success in the future and hope they stick to the model of this their first hotel.", "offset": [241, 472], "date": "2015-01-12 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3ab21788-7bbb-4a95-b159-1cf2fcb59c22", "sentence": "Excellent grown up accommodation. had not been to HK for a few years and we found it expensive on this visit A has plummeted.

The Ovolo Central is conveniently located for exploring Hong Kong Island since it is just a few minutes up the hill from the subway and is right in the middle of Soho Lan Kwai Fong. The rooms are not huge and yes they are super shiny including a copper wall and a chain mail pillow but they do the trick. Two of us managed pretty well for about five days because of the thoughtful space saving layout. Housekeeping kept the rooms very clean and also restocked the minibars daily with water soda etc at no additional charge. The shower is decent sized although I hated the square toilet this seems to be a Hong Kong thing. Our queen bed mattress was on the thin side and the sheets were not particularly crisp but climbing all of Hong Kongs hills made us fall asleep anyway. Also the room was a bit dark because of the window tinting and the shadows of other high rise buildings. We definitely took advantage of the self service laundry in the hotel lobby. The desk staff was efficient but not very smiley perhaps they were worn out from listening to the Radiovolo music blasting from the elevators they should really turn the sound down. I know I have not yet gotten Smooth Operator out of my head. Breakfast was included because we booked directly. Served in the diner named The Diner next door to the Ovolo it was generally fine but not stellar. Service was inconsistent and forgetful and the food was just okay. Again though it was convenient.
