This hotel is in an absolutely superb location. The immediate areas include the Jardins Tuileries the Louvre Place Concord and Place Vendome plus every very high end designer in the world. Lots of cafes in the immediate neighborhood and easy access to Metro taxis etc. The front desk staff both reception and concierge and including the bell staff are all extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The lobby is smallish but very comfortable and welcoming. The room we had was excellent in every way. The housekeeping service also excelled. High end amenities and evening turndown all add to the luxury feel as do the architecturally beautiful large windows. So the minor issues we found related to the food and drinks service situation. The hotel was finishing a renovation and that impacted both hours and space for those functions. The breakfast room and breakfast staff both seemed a little chaotic. The layout for breakfast is awkward and difficult for those sitting and for those using the buffet. But the breakfast food items were good and the staff generally good natured even while less efficient coping with the dysfunctional layout. The bar did not open until quite late apparently due to the on going renovation work. One real complaint the recorded music played in the public rooms and especially at breakfast was both loud and very modern club hip. It certainly did not seem to fit with the clientele and we found it downright annoying. We did not complain as it did not have that much impact on our enjoyment but perhaps others have weighed in on thisThis is not a place to meet French tourists or French business folks who are visiting Paris.

I have been a Mariot Rewards member for about 12 years. My wife and I have stayed at Mariots in London Amsterdam Zurich Rome and Florence. Every dollar I spend at Mariot is my own. This Mariot is the worst experience we have ever had at any Mariot property. First of all this is NOT a 5 star hotel as advertised but its rates are 5 star. This is a 3 star hotel in every sense. The owners whoever they are are using this hotel as a blatant cash grab. Mariot should sever its management contract when its up for renewal as their good name is being besmirched by association with this hotel. We arrived Oct 4th and planned to stay until Oct 11th. After 2 nights we could no longer stand to stay there and moved down the street to the Westin Vendome. It was our best decision. The Westin is truly a 5 star hotel with associated amenities. The Westins rates were 41 euros per night and included a FULL American breakfast. The Renaissances rates were 54 euros and did not include a full American breakfast. The Renaissances rates were going to be variable during our stay whereas the Westin charged the same rate throughout our stay. The first night my wife was in the shower and noticed that one of the glass doors in the shower was barely hanging on by one roller. The door had only one way to fall inside the shower. If that happened then she or I would have been seriously cut by the glass. We had to hold this door for one another so we could take a shower. does not anyone ever inspect these rooms for such a hazard. Inexcusable for this to happen. We reported this hazard the next day and it was fixed. But why did it exist in the first placeThe rooms are quite small with hardly any closet space. The Westin by contrast had spacious rooms with plenty of closet space. I know rooms in Paris are small but not in a truly 5 star hotel. A 3 star hotel yes but not 5 star which this hotel is clearly not. The restaurant Balagan attached but not operated by the hotel is another 5 star cash grab. It advertises a full American breakfast which is not true at all. It is more of a Mediterranean breakfast that looks like lunch. The oatmeal is dehydrated into which you have to pour hot water. It is inedible. In all my stays in various hotels I have NEVER seen dehydrated oatmeal. This is just one example that screams CHEAP. The owners are not putting any investment into the food offerings and are getting by with the cheapest offerings possible. Whoever heard of fried cauliflower as a breakfast staple. There was a lot of lettuce cold cuts fish hard bread etc. For all this Balagan charges 40 euros. The Westin by contrast offers a copious variety of breakfast items and it is included in the room rateOur room keys never worked. We were constantly having to go back to the front desk for a re set. We always keep our keys away from cell phones so that did cause the malfunctioning keys. The overall atmosphere in this hotel is claustrophobic. The lobby is small the rooms are small the hallways are a little dark. It was actually depressing by our 2nd day. The lobby is undergoing a renovation but this hotel will need more than a cosmetic change. It can start with truth in advertising as this is not a 5 star hotel. The location is good but that is about the only positive aspect. Compare the Westin Vendome with this hotel and the difference will be blatantly obvious to the most casual observer. I had a long talk with Michele the GM about the above. She was most helpful and personable. I enjoyed my interaction with Michele.
