Two of which are owned by the hotel and they are comfortable. Service is very slow at the pools but one can simply walk to the bar for drinks anyway. The Marquee Day pool is small and only seems to have areas for reserved bottle service seating. The Cosmopolitan itself has so many restaurants to eat at and they are all delicious as I spend most of my time here regardless of where I have stayed. As for the rooms one definitely needs to stay in a room with the view of the Belagio and its fountains. Spectacular and breathtaking views made this past trip one for my record book.

From arrival to this hotel to departing was the best service you could ask for. All hotel staff were incredibly helpful friendly and polite people. The hotel room was the wow factor worth paying slightly more for the fountain view we stayed in the terrace studio which had a balcony. This is the only hotel in Vegas with balconies and it is a definite plus. When it came to eating in the hotel we were spoilt for choice. We ate at the Holsteins for lunch which was yummy the secret pizza place is also worth a visit for a late night snack. Beauty and Essex was the best we tried with a pawn shop entrance it guides you into a dark classy and vibrant bar restaurant which did not fail to deliver on service and atmosphere and the quality of tapas style food was delicious lobster tacos. Unreal. The casino floors were also great along with the eye catching chandalier bar amazing. Marquee day club was a tremendous day we did this on a Sunday which may have been bit quieter than Fri. Sat sessions. Although this did not effect our experience. As a couple we booked a day bed which came at a cost but was worth it to take advantage of the bikini waitress service and being comfortable for the day. Overall the hotel was just incredible. The decor and size amongst other things stood out from the many many other hotels nearby.

What a beautiful modern hotel. Our room was luxurious and exactly what we imagined. However the service has a lot to work on. We arrived at 2 pm on a 45 degree day wearing jeans. We were told that our room would be ready at 3 pm when check in opened. We left our luggage as instructed to do and wandered around the hotel. We got back at 3 pm and were told to get back in the line which initially took us 30 minutes to see if our room was ready. My boyfriend refused and said that we are not lining up for another 30 minutes to be told its not ready. Lucky we did not as the room was not ready. We were told that we would get a text message to let us know when the room would be ready but to come back in 45 minutes anyway. We came back 45 minutes later the room was still not ready. They apologised and said that they would text us. We went outside in our jeans in the heat and wandered around. At 630 we went back 45 hours in total and found that our room was ready and they just had not called or text. So this was disappointing. They promised to give us two nights tax free and a 40 food drink voucher. On check out we asked for the bill and on there was ALL the nights of tax and ALL the drinks from the mini bar coming to 200. We did not have any drinks from the mini bar NONE. So they took them off and said that it must have been a mistake. If we had not of checked they would have charged us 200. They also failed to mention that they would hold 450 from the credit card. Whilst they only hold his and release it the day you leave it takes 5 working days to go back into your account.

Stayed here for 5 nights during memorial day weekend. I reserved a wraparound terrace suite with fountain view and was in the Boulevard Tower on the 21st floor. Excellent location. I had previous reviews about noise in the Boulevard Tower but our room was quiet. The layout was nice with separate kitchen and living area and a 2nd full bathroom. I had previously stay at the Wyn and the level of service between the two hotels are vastly different. At the Cosmopolitan the decor and furniture were worn and stains on the floor. The bed was not comfortable. There was no turn down service in the evening. There was a 35 resort fee per night and self parking was 10 night. Most of the 20 30something guests seemed to be quite intoxicated day or night. However at the Cosmopolitan having a terrace to walk on or sit and relax plus the views of the strip and the Belagio fountains is unequaled at any hotel in Las Vegas. So it will depend on your preferences for the same price if you want a 5 star hotel and service stay at Belagio or Wyn. If you want an average room with average service but an amazing view stay at the Cosmopolitan. We had dinner at Scarpeta one night and the food was fantastic I would definitely recommend that restaurant plus it overlooks the Belagio fountains. By the way I paid over 3500 for the 5 nights.

I have just returned for 11 nights at the Cosmopolitan. The decor of the hotel is very high and there are art installations throughout making it feel like a very fresh and modern hotel. The rooms are comfortable but the seating areas in the one bedroom suits are quite dark. I do have some issues with the hotel and my stay1 \u2013 Check in after a 10 hour flight the last thing I wanted to do is spend nearly 40 mins waiting in line to check in. With our package we were to be offered a \u201c free \u201d upgrade which we had to fight for with the check in staff. Only after we said we would be happy to wait for a room to be cleaned did we get the upgrade. At peak times the hotel REALLY need to have more staff checking people in2 \u2013 Bell Boys when we arrived our luggage was collected by the bell boys who said once we had checked in we would ring down and they would deliver the bags to our room. As above we had waiting 2 hours for the room to be ready then once had the key and called down for the bag we were told that there was a 40 to 50 minute wait for bags. AGAIN when your busy you need more stafAs we were going to have to wait we ordered some coffee again this arrived 40mins after we had ordered it so we spend the first 3 hours of our holiday sitting around waiting for things3 \u2013 Maid service VERY hit and miss the coffee pot and cups were still in the room 3 days after we had had the coffee for 4 days in total during our stay we did not have a maid service at all. We complained about this but things did not really improve4 \u2013. The Pool so the sunbeds are in high demand and if you want to sit by the pool you need to be there before 9 am. The pool staff where not however making sure that a bed with a towel on was actually still being used. I would say that about 25 of the beds with towels on are not being used. All the staff would need to do is once an hour walk round and any bed without personal belongings on it or being nearby remove the towels and free the sunbeds up5 \u2013. The staff again very hit and miss some could not do enough for you others acted like we were an inconvenience. On the last night I was approached by a prostitute in the pizza shop on the 3rd floor. Now I know that this is Vegas however I would have expected that the security staff would have been able to stop this type of thing especially in a hotel that in the brochure was a 5 star boutique hotel. I reported this to one of the blue coated security guys but they did nothing. Due to some issues with our original room we were moved however this did not go smoothly as it took 3 attempts before I was given the correct key. Again I was having to move all 4 of my suitcases from the new room door to the reception and back. Not once did a member of staff offer any help or assistance. The bell boys seem to have a 40mins permanent queue. Overall is the Cosmopolitan a nice hotel \u2013. Yes however it is all the small things that make a nice hotel into a fantastic one and the Cosmopolitan just lets itself down it would not take much to put things right but with so many hotels on the strip not sure if I would be back to see if they can improve \u2026.", "offset": [2023, 2133], "date": "2017-07-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "10f1cf17-a638-47b7-899e-b1a5f638880d", "sentence": "Inconsistent housekeeping.

Our suite was absolutely incredible it was massive with a gorgeous lounge luxurious bedrooms outstanding bathroom and the most incredible view from our balcony of the vegas strip. The view from our balcony was the most speculator imaginable overlooking the Belagio with views right up the entire strip honestly you could see right across Las Vegas. During my stay one night I was doing a little work before bed using my AirPods once I was finished I put my AirPods back in the case and set them on the night stand right beside the bed. The following morning we had planned a pool day being with company I did not need my AirPods and I just took essentials before leaving the room disconnected them from the charger to prevent battery damage from overcharging however left them in the same place. That evening I was getting prepared for dinner and as putting my iPhone on charge I had realised my AirPods where no longer there. I was surprised however due to time constraints I prevented looking until later that night when I got back to the room. I searched everywhere and attempted to ping them with the find my ap on my iPhone however I could not locate them. I am certain I never took them out of the room since arrival and simply could not understand what had occurred. I checked the rest of my personal belonging thankfully that where all accountable for. The following day I contacted hotel security after taking two hours to call out to my room they took down my information and my report. I could not imagine what had happened the only people with access to my room was housekeeping and I I have stayed in many different Mariot owned hotel before I have even use their rewards schemes and it was always my perception of a reputable trusted safe luxurious brand. Security had advised me they would investigate I called each day for an update with a guarantee someone would call me back that never did. On checkout I enquired further and they just stated there is nothing they can do. Unfortunately my travel insurance did not cover them either as in the fine print all personal items of value in a hotel room must be locked away in a safe when you are not present. However spending thousands upon thousands of dollars on an exclusive suite in an elitist hotel one of the best hotels in Vegas I never thought those actions would be essential to lock away your belongings in such a fashion the concept of getting robbed even by housekeeping never crossed my mind. Besides the bad experience getting my suite robbed and helpless rude hotel security I did enjoy the facilities the hotel had to offer. It was a really massive hotel resort I honestly got lost within it multiple times with lots to do. The interior is very modern with a sophisticated touch. Certain bars and casino area may have been slightly tacky however overall it was gorgeous. Location was excellent right on the strip everywhere was so accessible.

Would like to particularly thank Diego at the front desk Micah B our housekeeper who understood we do n\u2019t need nor like service everyday and Melissa in the Beauty Essex who kept me company while waiting an hour for my friend to arrive. But all who we came in contact with had outstanding customer service skills. My blessings to all the staff who are unable to work right now.", "offset": [858, 921], "date": "2020-03-20", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "400503f7-2569-44c4-bf25-6d456da8b023", "sentence": "Very good hotel right in the middle of the strip. I recently spent five nights here. The hotel and staff are both excellent. We ate in the Wicked Spoon buffet restaurant and the Va Bene cafe. Lovely pool area right on the strip.
