Hotel had a sustainability policy that sets the air conditioning to 25 degrees. So hotel can be quite warm compared to other hotels and venues in Bangkok. I booked a Club Room. The AC was not working properly so the management moved me to a much smaller and recently renovated room. So I m paying for a Club Room without receiving the room amenties. Club Room does not seem worth the extra money. There is no breakfast. Instead you join the masses for the mediocre buffet in the lobby. Afternoon tea is a bunch of little cakes. Cocktail hour iis fruit cheese peanuts and a few warm dishes like spring rolls or satay. Nothing very impressive. Room service very bland. Sea bass was dry. I suspect it was taken off the dinner buffet. Chicken was also dry and lacked seasoning. Breakfast arrived without the bacon ordered. On the plus side the lobby cake shops sells some very nice salads. Much better and cheaper than the bowl of lettuce offered on room service. Gym has 1 set off free weight at 5 pound intervals. There is 1 smith machine a preacher bar with ez bar and 1 chin up rack with cables. Lots of outside members in the gym so you will probably have difficulty getting to use the weights. Plenty of treadmills. Unlike my 2 gyms at home there is no coconut water available which comes from Thailand. Sport massage at spa was a joke. I actually feel asleep. I got a much better sport massage from True Spa in Zen Tower for about half the price. Tailor in lobby spoke very little English and could not answer questions about fabric origins. Concierge recommended Embassy Tailors which was better but not much. No mother of pearl buttons available and does not actually carry the Thomas Mason fabric advertised on its website. Claims to have Thomas Pink fabric and expects you to take there word for it. As a diabetic on a gluten free diet paleo there was very litle food I could eat in the hotel. Too many buffets. The hotel could use a cafe where you can order quality meals off a menu. Something free range and organic would be appreciated. In general staff needs English training. Hotel botched up my airport pick up and fast track apparently due to language issues. I would avoid this hotel and SPG properties in Bangkok.

This is really an update of my previous reviews. Those who have read those and those at my work who i debate with about the best hotel around the embassy know that I really appreciate and enjoy the Plaza. I have stayed several more times since my last reviews but i thought i would update including the new renovations. First you can have all the best rooms and renovated lobby you want and it still would be a hotel. As i have previous said it is the staff service anticipating needs that distinguishes a good hotel from an excellent hotel. There are many good hotels in the area with a few excellent ones like the Plaza. A GM needs to be on alert for a decrease in service for then will they know why the difference in rating is taking place. My last 2 visits contrast in roms February the standard room this March the new renovated rooms. For the most part the renovations are great huge flat screen TV again same big comfortable bed bathroom with much better commode and double wand in shower. I think the bathtube might be smaler but still big enough for a big guy like me. The refrigerator has been replaced but still has rooms for your own drinks but alas no little freezer where i kept my ice cream bars. A major plus for us electronic people plugs and multi plugs everywhere. Most i have seen at a hotel and very convenient. I like the new key just wave it at the door lock no longer sliding it in. They now have the key required to be in the slot to control the a c and room controls. Most hotels going to this utility saving device. I do not always like because i like to leave the TV on sometimes for security and the a c. But this a minor issue. The room features are nice modern which to some is better. My only downside is the long couch that has replaced the sofa chairs. It is one of those decorator things that looks nice but in reality not very useful. The cushion is thin and back not that comfortable to lean back in. The sides have a round bolster but i ended up throwing some pillows up against the wall for support to watch TV or read. I miss my sofa chairs but this is an issue of taste and maybe some like the new bench. Over all the upgrades are nice. Speaking of upgrades they are doing major renovations of the dinning area where breakfast is served as well as bar pool snack areas and hotel in general. This is a nice upgrade but I would remind the management their staff is the reason i continue to come back as well as other business men i talked to. My friends agree that the food at the Plaza breakfast and happy hour is better at the Plaza but some say the elegance or service at their hotels of choice are better. I doubt the service could be any better but the debate goes on. The only down side or area of improvement is pool side. The cabana really lacks anyone to take care of it also very few umbrellas next to the lounge chairs. The pool itself and surrounding gardens is not an infinity pool but a very pleasant experience. So welcome the new upgrades and the continued fine service for my choice of hotel.", "offset": [2232, 2385], "date": "2015-03-14 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "d975b8d0-62b6-4263-ab5e-ed6ec2fcf812", "sentence": "Great expectations.

The lobby is astonishingly beautiful and the views from the lounge are wonderful. Great first impressions then the stars came off the board. As many hotels they each go through renovations from time to time this was no different during the stay. This was not a concern to me as the hotel communication that was provided indicated work from 10a to 5p. Before 9a the next morning I heard the hotel construction crews hammering electric saw etc. I triple checked the time of the sounds definitely before 9a. Secondly the pool was being closed the next day since it too was being serviced. This was never communicated at check in nor was there any details on it until day of. And pool closing on days when the temps were excessively high. Poor planning my mgmt. I think one too many people complained about this and the closing came at end of the day instead at the start of the day. Lastly the gym was relocated to the 26th floor. I understood the need to for renovation purposes. But the gym was two normal hotel guest rooms in which one had a couple of tread mills and the other had a yoga ball and free weights.

Lobby staff is nice and friendly Lounge staff should improve mostly the guy at the executive check in.", "offset": [92, 175], "date": "2017-12-29", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "fe78386e-8510-42e2-8592-2be1968be099", "sentence": "First Visit for a Long Time. The Thai wife and I had a short stay here recently. We used to stay here often when it was the Plaza Athene. It has now remodeled become a Luxury Collection hotel in SPG and changed to the new name. Upon arrival we saw the foyer had been updated and access to the breakfast restaurant changed. The staff were in new uniforms and there was an increased focus on customer service although to be honest this was already a focus here in the time of our previous visits. We were allocated a room on a high floor and facing north. It is really quite remarkable the changes to the skyline over the last decade. So many new buildings including six large towers in close proximity. We always liked the rooms here and were a little surprised and pleased how much had been retained in the remodeling. Everything was clean and worked. The wifi was strong and stable for a laptop and iPadPro but neither of our iPhones would connect a problem we have never experienced elsewhere. We visited the Club Lounge during evening cocktails and were again impressed by the standard and quality of the food and service. This really is a good lounge. We took breakfast next day downstairs and consider the new layout to be better than the old one.

Athene would have escaped my radar unles it had climbed to the top on TA. I was somewhat surprised on this and decided to give it a try. Athene is indeed an excellent hotel. though there some minuses as well. LOCATION55 for locationLocated behind Okura Prestige the location of Athene could hardly be better what comes to central Bangkok. The Sky Train is close by but unlike Okura there \u2019s no direct walkway to the station. This does not really matter as the walking distance is minor. just round the Okura building Park Ventures. and you are there. Other hotels nearby include Indigo and Conrad. I stayed in Conrad in December 2017 and unles they renovate the property completely I would not recommend it. BUILDINGThe Athene building was built in early 20s in BK terms it \u2019s not spanking new. The hotel was previously Plaza Athene and as such I recon it never got much attention. The building has 29 floors and the pool and gym are on 4th floor. Only the top level floors have floor to ceiling windows. ARRIVAL AND FIRST IMPRESIONS55 even though the grand lobby is bit old school. When entering the building it is obvious that it has been there for a while the grand lobby looks bit old fashioned but the face lift they have done recently has done a miracle the lobby looks fresh and elegant in a classical way. The service at the lobby was also excellent relaxed but courteous at the same time. As my room was a Club Prestige I was escorted to the Club Lounge for check in. The Club Lounge was on 26th floor. After the fresh and elegant lobby it looked bit \u2018 worn \u2019 as if they had n\u2019t touched the Lounge when doing other works. I \u2019l come back to this later. ROMCoridors 25 room 55One thing that caught my eye was the carpet on the corridor of the 26th floor. It was stained looked old and was a mismatch with the otherwise elegant colour palette in the lobby and especially that of the room. Also the lighting in the corridors was not up to date. The Club Prestige room was at the corner facing Okura Prestige Hotel and Ploen Chit Sky Train Station. The rooms was very elegant again in a classical way. There were hints of Thailand in curtains and pillows. Blue gray and white looked good together and even managed to hide the places that had not been renovated. Bathroom had not been touched much and it was the only minus I have for the room. The bed was excellent just as expected. Also waves for the TV placement. POL45 for the refurbished pool areaThe pool area has been fixed too. The new decking and artificial lawn hide the horrid old teracota tiles. The pool is ok size for a city centre hotel bigger that what it seems in the pictures. There are several 5 star hotels in Bangkok with better pool area hence just 45. It is still good but not excellent. The bar restaurant next to the pool looks very nice. CLUB LOUNGEFor looks 45 for food and service 55Compared to the rooms the Club Lounge which I would have expected to follow the same style greys and whites looked bit scruffy. The carpets looked new but it looked like they had n\u2019t touched the furniture. Also the old carpet in the corridor could create this effect the beige red carpet really does n\u2019t look good with the new colours in the rooms. The Lounge was surprisingly empty when compared to many other hotels in Bangkok. Even just minutes before the evening cocktails ending there was plenty of nibbles left. The food at the Lounge was better than in many other hotels in Bangkok. BREAKFAST45 for the breakfast. The breakfast was as expected not the best in Bangkok but very good still. The breakfast area was also large enough even during busy hours there was space. Service was again excellent. CONCLUSIONSAthene well deserves its 4 5. I generally like new hotels more. Athene is like an elegant lady in her 70s civilised and stylish in an understated way. If they \u2019d still have the corridor carpeting in all floors renewed it could well be the most elegant hotel in Bangkok.", "offset": [2470, 2538], "date": "2018-08-14", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "f20aeab9-7037-4dac-8131-9e9f26dd1da6", "sentence": "My favorite hotel.

The staff are constantly checked in on my comfort have taken care of external reservations. even getting into the minute details of getting my luggage repaired preparing healthy foods when I have fallen ill really wonderful and customized care. A shout out to the staff. Marisa is a true star after a decade plus of working here she treats me like family whether at 6 am or 6 pm always looking out for my welfare. And it is no nice to be greeted so beautifully every morning by Suntre and Waraphon at the restaurant. It brings a smile to my face each time they go out of their way to seat me or grab a bag and cup for take out. Similarly when I leave and enter the hotel I have such lovely discussions with Ukris Pongsawat and Somchai who greet me at the door. And I absolutely adore the young girls who service floor 22 I can not help but hug them each time I see them. Same with Chulekorn who maintains the delicious evening cocktail yummy sushi buffet.

As a long time 10 or 12 years maybe and 9 or 10 times staying in this property I have to say the last visit was very disappointing. Many small things contributed to a disappointing stay in this supposed Luxury brand 5star hotel. Despite my regular business and fact I am Platinum member I was not offered an upgraded room in fact the staff member looked rather less than happy when I then requested one. When I went in to my assigned room it was occupied. That is to say full of someones belongings including computer although the person was not there. How could that happen. Definitely a big security red flag. Fortunately I am very honest person. As other reviewers noted the hotel has ongoing renovation. Construction noise disturbed my rest times. Towels are not of same quality as in previous stays. Hair found in pasta dish in club lounge. Service especially in Glaz bar much worse than before. I indicated many issues to GM Giles who said we will be glad to host you again and regain your confidence. that is rather meaningless without action and when I requested assistance with booking 3 rooms for next trip was quoted rates HIGHER than available online via their webpage. I am quite shocked and disappointed this 5star hotel now clearly does not care about regular repeat customers.

Let me start with a spoiler this is a negative review due to the treatment I have received as a Mariot rewards member. The hotel itself is good albeit a tad aged and with some maintenance issues and the staff try very hard. However I am unable to get ANY response from the hotel after leaving and could in different circumstances be severely out of pocket. Not good from a Luxury Collection hotel nor reasonable treatment for someone with a reasonable status level in the rewards system. I stayed ten nights in all across New Year. Accepting that New Year will always be rammed in Bangkok hotels overall it was a reasonable stay. Could not get a suite upgrade despite having top level status see below but settled for a room and was given a suite after asking again for the last two days of the first five. Lobby is impressive staff very good the young lady called Qing I spoke with later in the stay was excellent and a real credit to the Mariot organisation but see below and the breakfast once the chaos of New Year ended was very good. Room service expensive but reasonable quality. My issues though started with the initial room allocation. No working TV for three days and a wardrobe that would not close so the light remained on all night were anoyiong. WC broke on the fifth night I had despaired of maintenance by this point so ended up dismantling the cistern and fixing this myself. Oh well maybe we have different expectations of luxury. but luckily there are some great YouTube videos. I had to extend my stay for a few days as I was taken ill and the hotel managed to squeeze me into a basic room then a smoking suite. I did these extensions day by day using the Mariot Ap this showed suite availability but for various reasons the hotel did not feel it had a suite to offer me. Its this last point I find strange. I had hate to make pointed remarks but it was either the fact that I was elite with Mariot not Starwods or something else I will not put into writing but I have experienced in other Starwod properties in Bangkok previously. a reluctance to offer standard service that is freely given to others from different regionsSo what is my main concern. I am home now in the UK. I hit the magic number of stays and elite years on 31 Dec to achieve the top status with literally a day to spare. How. I paid to stay in another Mariot hotel in Bangkok. The Athene has so far failed to post eight of the ten nights I stayed. I have sent e mails called Mariot Platinum and despatched various carrier pigeons. Not a single word of response. As I said at the outset I am not sure all the hotels in the Starwod world are taking this merger as well as they should and I see The Athene very much in this category. I am sure a dedicated customer servcie agent will read this and eventually respond.

This hotel was extensively renovated in 2015. However the owners decided to maintain some of the old world Thai charm of the original hotel. As a result it is a combination of modern amenities but some parts do look a bit dated but could be perceived as charming. Location is alright. A 5 10 minute walk to the Phloenchit BTS station. It is clearly a popular hotel due to it is convenient location to All Seasons Place which houses many companies and offices. So be prepared for a busy atmosphere. Needless to say there are many PRCs who opt to stay here for both work and leisure and you know how much I absolutely hate the PRCs. Very unfortunately with more than 13 billion of them it is almost impossible to avoid them. The main lobby is stunning and to me other than the one at the Anantara formerly the Four Seasons at Ratchadamri this lobby at the Athene is the nicest and grandest though I am told the one at the MO in Bangkok is even more opulent. Check in was efficient even though there was a huge crowd of PRCs at the counters in their typical rude and unruly behaviour. I booked a suite which was very decently sized and quite well furnished. Everything worked which is not surprising since the renovation took place only about 3 4 years ago. The shower was great but the tiles in the bathroom looked old and tired. The bed was excellent and firm which I liked. Wireless internet access in the room was quite fast. So all in all a good place for the business traveller. Breakfast was just so so. Huge variety but the quality of the food and cooking was below average in my view. After the second day I decided to skip the breakfast on the subsequent days. I had access to the lounge which is where the disappointment started. They seem to have a strict dress code after 4 pm but clearly there were some guests who walked into the lounge with slippers some of them even wore the room slippers. and shorts. I was told by one of the staff to change from my shorts to long pants but I distinctly saw more than a few other guests who were not told to do the same. So much for the dress code. Another disappointment was when I wanted to change my airport transfer time. The request was not followed through by the staff and it was only after I called to check that the concierge did then make the change. So much for service reliability.

From the moment we were greeted at the airport by The Athene \u2019s luxury transfer service everything was picture perfect. Upon entering the hotel you are met by the most exquisite smell of tiare which is pleasantly pervasive throughout the hotel. We were greeted promptly at the front desk and whisked away to our room. Our accommodations were a Royal Club Room on the recently renovated Royal Club Lounge level where we were welcomed with some very thoughtful amenities including Thai elephants and rose petals on our bed. With Royal Club Lounge Access you have the choice of a light breakfast on the Club Level complete with Bangkok city views or the opulent buffet breakfast in the Rain Tree Caf\u00e9.

We stayed at the Athene Hotel in Bangkok in several times in Sept Oct and all stays were excellent. You would think an established hotel like this would lax into complacency and apathy but instead their staff are still on the ball gliding seamlesly between routine and meeting challenging tasks with gracious gusto. Since the upgrade to the Luxury Collection category The Athene pays homage to its brief history and takes it forward to embrace the future with a refurbishment worthy of its heritage. The hotel now fully refurbished is incomparably different to most of its contemporaries. Many hotels today have gone through the same metamorphosis however very few actually succeed in being unique. The Athene is a prime example of marrying todays technological necessities with a luxury forgotten in todays en masse development of hotels everywhere. The Athene here is elegant subdued and quiet what luxury should really be understated yet precise lush yet discreet. This hotel does not rely on over dazzling you with more chandeliers and lustre it glows and resonates from an established legacy and service which exemplifies what The Athene is today. The staff from point of entry onwards are not just welcoming and accommodating they were always interactive and objective with the sole purpose of helping out the guest. Our thanks to Kraisorn Donna and their staff in the Royal Club Lounge who made it their mission to ensure that we were taken care of. Nothing it seems could possibly faze them regardless of the circumstance. This attribute is rare as some staff in some other hotels just do their bare minimum to qualify their requirement of hospitality. Kudos to also Marisa and Jack at Silk Road who could not do more for us. Silk Road since it is refurbishment is now perhaps the most elegant Chinese restaurant in Bangkok. Food and service were elegantly presented and most of all delicious and innovative. The signature Thai restaurant House of Smooth Curry was also excellent with it is refreshed premise including a fabulous outdoor terrace. The star attraction perhaps is The Allium the reimagined French Continental restaurant. Sheathed in pomegranate red dining at The Allium was like sitting in a delicate lacqeured jewel box embellished with crystal and silver accessories to match. The time we dined there Felice Lo Basso was the guest Italian Michelin chef who certainly was the heart of The Allium experience.

The property had since climbed to top on TA but this time I can compare it with another Mariot property on top of TA \u2019s list Mariot Surawongse where I stayed just before moving to Athene. LOCATION 55Athene location is perfect for getting around the city. The sky train station is just around the corner and access to highway is easy. Also there are many high end shopping malls in the neighbourhood. The location is clearly better than that of Mariot Surawongse especially for business travellers. FIRST IMPRESSIONS 45On Saturday midday there was some occasion taking place at the hotel as there were police both outside the hotel and inside as well. The lobby is classical and it shows that the place has been build in an era when hotel lobbies were different what they tend to be today. It \u2019s still grand but the bling has been turned down a bit. While Mariot Surawongse has a masculine flair to the lobby Athene is gracefully aging dame. ROOM 45My room was on 9th floor and compared to the room I stayed previously this was much smaller and more classical in theme. Also the accents were in this room red while the room I stayed preciously was blue. Only on top floors the windows are floor to ceiling hence the lower floor rooms are bit dark. The roar of the traffic could be heard clearly on 9th floor. Bathroom fittings were old even though some new accents had been added Compared to Mariot Surawongse Athene room was more classical and now in a negative way. Some of the furniture might have been recycled from the previous decor. Mariot Surawongse room was far better as all fittings were new. Here they have done little to the entrance to the room and the bathroom. POOL. 55This is where Athene clearly surpasses Mariot Surawongse. Athene pool is large and the pool are and the adjacent roof top area can accommodate the number of people staying in the hotel. The pool is also 15 metres deep while in Mariot Surawongse it \u2019s only 12 metres. Oddly the EXECUTIVE LOUNGE. 55Last time I noted that the executive lounge seemed like it had been left untouched in the renovation. They had now renewed it completely. Gone were the stained carpets. The new look was more in line with the classical design of the hotel. The selection of small bites was excellent better than in most other club lounges in Bangkok. BREAKFAST 35Breakfast at club lounge was limited as one would expect but ok at the same time. CONCLUSIONSWhen setting the two hotels currently in 2 and 3 places on TA Mariot Surawongse surpasses Athene in all but two areas location and pool.
