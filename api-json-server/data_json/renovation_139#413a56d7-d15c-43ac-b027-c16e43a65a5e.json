We love this hotel so much that we keep coming back it is become an annual treat. The attention to detail and charm of this Raffles is exceptional. The staff are lovely and the service superb with the warmth more usually experienced in a boutique hotel. The luxurious experience starts with complimentary Mum champagne offered with breakfast through to the full evening room service and the accomplished pianist playing in the beautifully restored lounge in the evenings. And my husband a dedicated swimmer loves the huge pool. This time we tried a room in the newer wing cleverly designed to give great space walk in wardrobe separate spacious desk area etc. but after 1 night scooted back to our favourite. a Personality Suite in the old wing with it is lovely traditional historical feel. We were very pleased to find that some new very upscale restaurants have opened in Siem Reap in the past year or so. Sophisticated ambience with good wine lists and still only 20 or so for 3 delicious courses. We again went in Aug Sept. it is the low season so the temples and town are not crowded. The weather is perfect at this time of year. it is the rainy season which means there is usually an hour or so of heavy tropical rain each day which refreshes everything and makes this the green season when the countryside is at its prettiest. The rest of the day there re some hours of light cloud. a little bit cooler for sightseeing and plenty of hours of hot sun for time at the pool. Raffles and Siem Reap a perfect combination.

Our rooms were very spacious however some of the facilities are starting to show their age and compared to other luxury hotels we visited in Cambodia and Vietnam the pool area and the surrounds were disappointing. We visited a Raffles on Phnom Penh and were blown away by the hotel and the pool area so we were expecting the Siem Reap experience to be just as luxurious. The pool area was the biggest disappointment as it needed more shade and the paving and gardens updated. The pool water was uncomfortably hot perhaps there needs to be a cooling system or partial shade over the pool to protect it from the heat.

We stayed for three nights and had an incredible experience. There were a couple of issues with our stay mostly out the hotels control but they were fully resolved by the wonderful team that worked there. We arrived by a raffles chauffeur who was courteous and friendly. The car had adorable little touches like cold towels and breakfast pastries. On arrival to the hotel we were greeted by a number of the door staff concierge team and front of house. We booked a suite in the main part of the hotel greeted with a welcome drink made to feel at home while check in was taken care of. Then given a tour of the common areas which had realty been renovated and were elegant finished to a high very standard. We were then taken to our room via the original lift which is still in operation a great novelty. Once in our room we were shown all of the amenities and directed to the programme of events held at the hotel Christmas market Sling cocktail masterclas Monk blessing etcWe ate lunch on the terrace both the menu and execution were top quality lots of variety but with local dishes and fresh produce. We then went out for the day the hotel is in a great location a ten minute walk to the main drag or cheap tuk tuks are always on hand. Retuning in time for the Christmas market outside that evening. It was exceptionally festive and really well put on by the hotel carols mulled wine mince pies just perfect. We had another cocktail in the lobby bar and listened to the piano player who again was full of festive cheer. Shortly after we experienced our first issue on return to our room that night. All of the lights from the market directly below our room had attracted swarms of insects which had made their way through gaps in the patio door and were now in our room. Excessive numbers of insects meaning we could not stay there. Fortunately the staff were understanding and moved us away from the main building and generously to an even larger suiteThe next morning we took part in the champagne buffet breakfast which as far as buffets go was full of variety interesting and fresh. After a day of exploring we had cocktails by the pool the pool area is ablsolutely beautiful the staff kind and attentive. However there was ongoing building work even on weekends making it quite noisy. That evening we took part in the Sling master class with a very passionate bar team and took advantage of the bar happy hour most cocktails were half price but even at full price they were good value 1012 for such a standard of hotel. We went to book a massage at the spa but in our opinion is very overpriced for Siem Reap 120. We went to a stunning spa two minutes walk away and paid 40 for 90 minutesThe following morning there was another issue impacting our stay but again this was out of the hotels control. A local wedding and a temple adjoining the hotel started at 5 am. On a Sunday. It was unimaginably noisy with banging drumming and chanting. It did not stop for hours literally hours. While this was an external complaint the hotel could make you aware if this is a common weekend occurrence or invest in better soundproofing for the rooms in the garden areas. If we had have been notified ahead of time we could have arranged for the sunrise tour to Angkor Wat for that day instead of the previous day the sunrise tours run from 430am. But by this point nothing could be done we just had to endure the noise which can run we were told in hindsight from 4 am til 10pm. Again however the staff were keen to do what they could to amend the problems we experienced and on check out comped a number of items from our bill which did go a long way to demonstrate their commitment to ensuring every guest has the best possible experience. And for that we are extremely grateful to the entire Raffles team. Thank you. The staff really do treat each guest like royalty which can be a little overbearing at times saying hello to every member of staff you pass can be tiring. But that is just a personal thing.

The hotel has recently reopened following a major refurbishment and it looks superb. The level of service in the Far East usually exceeds all expectations. Although it was generally very good at Raffles it was not as good as other hotels we stayed in. Unfortunately check in was n\u2019t smooth. Firstly I could n\u2019t hear the receptionist above the sound of the piano in the lounge and suggested we move somewhere quieter. She then insisted on a tour of the hotel did I want to take photo of the historic lift. No I just want to get to my room after travelling all day. Our travel agent had notified the hotel in advance that we needed anti allergy bedding no feather pillows. Unfortunately this never made it to housekeeping and the receptionist had no idea what I was asking for. Luckily the gentleman who delivered our luggage did and arranged for suitable bedding to be provided. We also asked for a quiet room away from music and bars. However there was entertainment in the evening on the Aspara Terrace near our room. Fortunately it finished at 9 pm. The hotel management were suitable apologetic that our requests had not been picked up and offered a meal in compensation. Furthermore we were staying there to celebrate a big birthday which also went unnoticed until my partner pointed this out to them. Luckily they swung into action and redeemed themselves. We stayed in a standard room the \u201c new \u201d wing. It was decent size beautifully decorated and overlooked the gardens. The wardrobe was tiny and unsuitable if staying more than a few days. The bathroom had a bath with separate shower. There is a glass partition between the bathroom and bedroom with a blind. However the blind does not stop light filtering through when using the bathroom at night. Take an eye mask if a light sleperThe swimming pool is enormous and great for great for swimming lengths. An oasis of tranquillity with comfortable sun loungers. Pool service is available. The food at the hotel was excellent in both restaurants. Unusually for Asia the hotel does not use MSG which is great if intolerant to it. The Khmer food in 1932 restaurant was exceptional. I particularly liked the Australian chef stepping away from the kitchen to chat to diners. The cocktails in the Elephant bar were wonderful and good value if you catch happy hour.
