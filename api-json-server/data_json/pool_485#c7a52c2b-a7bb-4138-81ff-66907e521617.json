Wife I stayed 5 nights end of March on vacation to visit family in area. We are Hilton Honors and AAA members. Stayed on 7th Club Level floor got daily full breakfast buffet vouchers at restaurant on 2nd floor AAA plus premium high speed internet in our package. The rate was very reasonable. The hotel looks to have been built about 30 years ago but is very clean modern looking both inside out. Room size is nice and the beds comfortable. The bathroom could be bigger. Not all rooms have a tub important to the Mrs so we had to have 2 queen beds in order to have a tub. I understand that the kings on the club level floor have showers. The carpets TV furniture etc. all were clean and in good working order. ALL the staff were VERY friendly and helpful. There are free USA Today WSJ papers in the lobby on weekday AMs. There is plenty of free parking and a very nice pool and hot tub outside however TOO cold for us Texans to swim. Housekeeping kept room spotless. Tub drain plug leaked and maintenance was knocking on the door to fix within 3 minutes of calling the front desk at 830 in the evening. AC unit like at many hotels was hard to regulate especially at night. Debie the manager was very professional and helpful. Very impressed with this hotel.

She upgraded me to the executive level on the top floor as well as my co worker. We enjoyed the free breakfast. I also wanted to give kudos to the restaurant manager Daren. I called ahead and told them I would be bringing in my own wine. Hilton Customer service checked and told me no corkage fee. There was some initial hassle until Daren stepped in and made things happen. that is what managers do and the customer is king. We were able to enjoy a tasty rib eye dinner cooked to perfection and pasta dish split over two people with our wine. I did workout at the gym and had to wait for the elliptical since only one was in the gym. Need improvement in this area and add at least one more.
