After driving Highway 1 from San Francisco to San Diego we thought we deserved a chill out for a couple of days. The 2 days turned into 4 as we were enjoying the nice town beautiful weather and good value in Palm Springs. The Ivy Palm Resort was just the venue we needed the reception staff are excellent and Real that is his name. went the extra mile particularly. The pool was really nice and very warm and we had this to ourselves for the first couple of days until the weekend arrived along with the families. This was ok though as we were recharged and out on trips the second two days. Do nt miss the Tramway that takes you up the mountain to a lovely park and a trip into Joshua Tree to see Pioneer Town in the desert. There is a wild west street and Papy and Hariets bar which was teaming with bikers as there was a Lady Biker convention that weekend maybe best to visit during a week day. There are a couple of really good restaurants close by. Billy Reids is an experience as the inside looks nothing like you expect from outside its enormous with quirky d\u00e9cor but reasonable prices. Ricks Desert Grill offers good value Cuban themed food and has a happy hour until 7 pm with half price cocktails. You get decent size glasses of wine at 6 each a miracle in CaliforniaThe Wi Fi is a bit hit and miss but it did not spoil the stay.
