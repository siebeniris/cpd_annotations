TV Channel free in German only if you want to watch something else you can pay per view. At the check in I have been offered a smoking room that I accepted to take as I entered in the room I felt I was entering in an ashtray. The room was terribly smelly and the window was closed it was already late evening and 3C outside so I opened the window and I went out for dinner hoping the smell would go at least a bit. Nothing to do. It stank. Terribly. I left in the morning asking the cleaner to leave the window open and to spray some air freshener hoping that by the evening the smell would go. No. Even if the window was opened the smell was still there. The day after I had a bit of free time and I went to buy some air and fabric freshener to help me sleep better. I sprayed it everywhere curtains carpet chairs etc. and when I went back in I could finally breath and smell fresh flowers. Smoking room need extra care. I smoke but I like a clean environment especially in the bedroom. I could smoke a cigarette but I definitely open the window and I smoke next to it. Disgraceful experiencelet us turn on the TV. I do not speak German if I wanted something different I should have paid. I preferred to buy the Wi Fi and use my laptop to watch what I wanted. It worked the first night.

Not acceptable at that price. But I would like to highlight the admission to the breakfast restaurant. you are asked to provide your room number and your surname that they would scream when wishing you to enjoy your meal. Enjoy your breakfast Mrs X. I personally find this practice very unprofessional and against any privacy policy. Not to mention the fact that one day I have arrived and I had a group of Asian business people in front of me. At least six people that MUST provide their surname to be admitted. As you can easily imagine Japanese and Indian surname are not the easiest to understand for European so they have been asked to write it down making me wait 10 minutes in the queue. Atrocious. STAFF. very kind and professional. ROOM. Very spacious and clean despite the smell problem highlighted earlierTip You have a complementary small bottle of water in the room but if you do not drink it all it will not be replaced so you have to buy from the golden mini bar.

He assisted me with the subway which has a stop right under the lobby of the hotel with an elevator into the lobby and how to get around Munich well. He suggested good places to eat outside of the hotel where I could get authentic Bavarian food at family owned Gasthausen. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the hotel was built on an historic site where Hitler met at a Beer Hall with the early Nazis met called B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeler. There is a memorial plaque there but the Hilton built their hotel so that the plaque is under the dumpsters where Hitlers memory is best preserved. it is easy to get around Munich from this hotel too.

We spent four nights recently at the Hilton Munich City we booked here using some Hilton Honours points I had accumulated. There are some good positives to the hotel whilst not in the old town it is right on top of Rosenheimer Platz S Bahn station which made it very easy to get around. We arrived and left via Munich Central Station and made a day trip out to Fusen and the location was excellent in terms of ease of access. There is an entrance to the station from the hotel perfect when it was minus temperatures. You can walk easily to Marienplatz which we did not do though because it was either raining or snowing the days we were there. The beds were comfy and the rooms spacious. We liked that there was an extra couple of seats in the room so that you do not always have to sit on the bed. Our room was right at the end of a corridor so it was very quiet and we did not hear any noise from other guests. The new bar area downstairs looks great and there was always room to stop and have a drink. Check in and out were very easy and a room was provided to us as soon as we arrived even though it was before check in time. The downsides however were the airconditioning was set to warm and it did not change no matter what we set the temperature to. This meant the room was very warm every night so we would sleep with the window open despite it being minus temperatures overnight. We stayed in a King Hilton Guest Room and for which we had an internal courtyard view which meant that we had a view over the garbage bins and back entrance to the hotel kitchen for staff. Which is not terrible given that in winter there are not that many daylight hours and we were mostly out of the room but it did mean that when you are forced to sleep with the window open every night you are awoken by staff movements and deliveries from 430am. There was not much privacy in that respect other windows could see into yours as could the staff below which I found out when one of them waved at me friendly but a little disconcerting. Housekeeping was inconsistent one day they only left us with one towel despite there obviously being two people staying in the room some days they would leave one new towel and one old towel other days two new towels. They did however replace the toiletries every day. This is a bit of a personal gripe but I do not travel with shampoo or conditioner as most places provide it or else its easy enough to pick up at an supermarket. The Hilton uses Crabtre and Evelyn which sounds good but I find is not all that great. I need an entire container of conditioner to wash my hair. The room service options were very limited and did not have anything that would be considered traditional or local. If there had been many any open options in the area then it might not have seemed that terrible but it was New Years Day and nothing was open in the neighbourhood. This is another pet gripe of mine. the mini bar is one of those pressure ones so as soon as you remove something it triggers that its been taken. We like to buy local beers and schnapps but its not possible to keep it cold in the fridge. If the selection in the mini bar was a bit more interesting or else local we may have consumed it but what was there could have been found in any hotel in the world all mass produced. All in all this was not a bad stay but likely when we return to Munich we will see what other options are available.", "offset": [1421, 1609], "date": "2019-01-02", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "5bc830fb-3a5d-4125-b848-a9937a9488e4", "sentence": "Hilton. never again.
