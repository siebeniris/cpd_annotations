We were able to leave our belongings and go to the shops and have a drink while we waited. On our return we were told the room was just ready.

The latter was especially helpful also gave us a dinner recommendation too. I would also like to offer a shout out to Kylie on the front desk who was really kind and helpful. The hotel is really handy for local public transport as it \u2019s a short walk 5 minutes maximum to the train and buses. Into the city the train takes about 25 minutes and is clean safe and easy to use particularly with an Opal card. The hotel is also close to loads of local restaurants and a few bars and also two big shopping malls and other smaller shops. There was an on site bar and restaurant but it seemed closed during our stay.

Later in the room we found we had no WiFi and were expected to pay for it which I found a bit of a cheek in this day and age when it should come complimentary as standard. I also noticed that there was the option to sign up to the Mantra membership scheme which would offer complimentary WiFi and other benefits but we were n\u2019t offered these.

Something to note which lots of other guests and I mentioned to the front desk about is when you use your keycard to access floor numbers in the lift it \u2019s very unpredictable and frustrating. Sometimes it works fine and at other times it takes ages. This also sometimes happened when using your keycard to enter your room. Both are annoying especially when you \u2019re in a rush. Unfortunately with the room extension of another two nights we had there was a miscomunication between the front desk and housekeeping so we were kept waiting a while for our room to be serviced.
