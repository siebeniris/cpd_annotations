I needed a change from the chain hotels and the Cincinatian was absolutely lovely. Very botique like without faking it and going over the top. Very authentic. In fact they do not have those magnetic keys. they have REAL keys. I can not remember the last time I stayed at a place that had real keys to the hotel. So let us break it down. The rooms. Happened to get the view facing a building but it was kind of. cool. Red brick made me feel like I was in Boston or something. The bed was VERY comfortable. The cable tv was very basic. but again I kind of liked that. no renting movies or cable box to detract from the room and atmosphere. Staff. Unbelievably nice. They seem to have a lot of people that work here so a guest gets a lot of attention. Walked in they valeted my car and said you are all set. So easy. Food my wife and I had breakfast there. The food was delicious although the portions were large so may not need to order a ton unles you are very hungry. When at the sit down area it really felt like we were at a high end french restaurant but decorated like a queens home. 2 staff members waited on us and the whole experience was brilliant.

When you book an historic hotel you take a chance. Is it the grand old days or is it decrepitude or poor updating. Unfortunately our visit tended to the latter more than the former. The personnel were very very friendly a real plus. The front desk was very engaging. But our first room was on the second floor facing inward with a balcony opened onto by doors that were far from soundproof. And just below was the bar. The room also had a strange layout where the bathroom lay behind a 34 wall instead of a full wall. Nuf said. do not be trapped in one of these rooms. We asked to be transferred to another room the next morning at 10 and by 4 PM they still had not accomplished the task and we had to get dressed for a wedding. The nice lady at the front sprang into action when she realized what had happened to us and got us an upgrade to a corner room on the second floor that was bigger and opened to the street instead of the bar and this was a lot better. But why the 6 hour snafu we all wondered. And then there is breakfast. On the plus side it was not expensive which was welcome and tasty enough. The dining room was dowdy which was not the worst thing in the world as were some of the staff. But the problem was the wait. Maybe because it was a holiday weekend and the kitchen staff did not show up I do not know. But French toast and two fried eggs with toast and a less than half full dining room should not equal a 20 or 25 minute wait until they arrived. Just should not happen with no explanation or apology. But at least it was reasonably priced. So sadly I had have to say that should we journey back to Cincinnati we will be skipping the Cincinatian.

There was not one piece of artwork in the room anywhere. And the bed was the worst bed we have ever slept on including bed at cheap hotels. Our backs hurt so bad we could hardly stand up in the morning. The bathroom however was very nice. Very worn and needed updating but it was nice to have a large bathroom with two sinks. There was no make up mirror which made it almost impossible to get ready in the morning. Every other hotel we have stayed at in the last year has some kind of a magnifying mirror in the bathroom.

First of all no mention of EXTENSIVE renovations anywhere on their website when we booked in January for a conference. it is now April the website STILL acts like there are no renovations happening and they will not be done with renovations until beginning of June at the earliest according to an employee. So we felt pretty misled by the website which promises many things including a shuttle restaurant room service and gym that the current hotel does not deliver. I am sure the lobby construction will look nice when it is finished. How do I know. Because the only window in my room looked directly out into the construction zone INSIDE THE HOTEL. This is not an outdoor renovation it is right outside your door and window. I had to keep my blinds shut 24 7 because there were seven floors of scaffolding literally right outside my interior window which means that every wrench piece of lumber and drill that was dropped echoed loudly through all seven open stories of the atrium. Oh not to mention there could be a worker outside the window at any time. I slept about 7 hours total in my three night stay. Additionally I was on a floor of the hotel where literally every room around mine was seemingly being renovated. So we are in an old room surrounded by rooms full of construction workers ripping up hardwood floors drilling new light fixtures in and installing new fittings. There was never a quiet moment at any point of the day or night. No cofemaker in the room. The TV cabinet was partially disassembled with wires poking through. No hairdryer. Come on. Our first night there was a loud party in the room next door. AKA one of the empty construction rooms. To their credit they did shut it down when we called to complain. but we should not have had to do that at a so called four star hotel. That they are currently charging 2913 per night 1950 base room rate plus three taxes is RIDICULOUS. I have stayed at airport hotels with better services and rooms. Again I am sure post renovation it will be great. But right now it is terrible. But what is really beyond the pale is the clear lengths they have gone to hide the current state of the hotel. They did not notify us of renovations until three days before our national conference in other words when it was too late for us to escape. If we had cancelled at that point we still would have been charged for the first nights stay per their cancellation policy. But we could not cancel because every conference hotel in the city was already booked as they knew it would be. They gamed us. The one good thing I can say is that every single person who worked there was unfailingly polite and apologetic. None of this is their fault they are doing what they can.

One of the worst hotel experiences of my life. if it were possible to give 0 stars that \u2019s what I would rate it. My experience I booked a stay at this hotel back in March of this year for the night of June 9th for my husbands birthday. I had read some reviews about construction after booking so I contacted the hotel to ask a few months ago and they assured the construction would be completed upon our arrival. When we arrived we walked into a construction zone. I do n\u2019t mean a little construction I mean literally the entire hotel. They had a little table set up when you walk in the door with a computer. The two people working were in training. We were told our room was n\u2019t ready it was around 1245pm. I had called a few days prior and asked if we could check in early since we had a show to go to at 2 pm and they told me they would put a note in the computer. I expressed needing a room before the show and I finally said I wanted to shave my legs privately and the lady said loudly twice I could shave my legs in the public bathroom lol. We were taken to the third floor to literally a hotel room with a bed and bathroom that they were using for a \u201c public bathroom \u201d. We were told we could wait there for our room to be ready or go to the hotel next door to \u201c hang out \u201d. After our room was n\u2019t ready We had to go on to our show and before we left the lady at the front told us our room would be on the 7th floor away from the construction noise. We came back at 430 pm after the show and were then told the room which we paid over 400 dollars to stay in because it had a whirlpool tub was not available because the girl that checked us in that was still in training did not put us in the \u201c queue \u201d in the computer for a room so it was as if we had never been there in the system. At this point miraculously they came up with a room with a whirlpool tub on the second floor and said do n\u2019t let the construction scare you the room is all decked out. We literally walked through construction and our room even had a paper taped on it with construction items they were doing. Our room had a strange smell to it I assume from the construction. The mattress did not even have a mattress pad. There was nothing in the room literally a bed. At this point I was horrified but we had dinner reservations at 5 pm that we were going to miss so we could n\u2019t take care of it. We went to dinner and came back around 715pm and went straight to the room where another woman in our hallway was saying this was the worst experience of her life and she was leaving. We grabbed our bags which we never unpacked and went to the front to another boy who was in training and told him we were leaving. He asked if the room was not ready for us. I wanted to say this entire hotel is not ready for anybody. I did n\u2019t even ask for a refund because nobody knew what they were doing and it would have been pointless. I just asked for the managers name. They should not be allowed to be open. They should not be allowed to advertise pictures because it \u2019s a lie. It \u2019s false advertisement on the hotels part and Expedia \u2019s part and I do intend to call Expedia as well. We went and checked in at 21c thanks to another guest that was also leaving in the elevator that told us they had rooms. 21c was a great experience however cost us another over 300 dollars. Whatever you do DO NOT I repeat DO NOT stay at this hotel. It ruined our entire experience as well as my husbands birthday which we had really been looking forward to celebrating as we are only here for one night.
