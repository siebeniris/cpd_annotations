Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Our original assigned room had a broken toilet and no view. The staff gave us drinks at the bar while they got us a newly renovated room with a pool side view. We were hoping to stay in the colonial city to be walking distance to all historic buildings and museums but this turned out to be a fantastic choice. The breakfast buffet was outstanding with a cook to make you pancakes or scrambled eggs revoluetos. A knowledge of Spanish is helpful. The pool is fantastic. We had not brought swimsuits but went to a nearby mall and purchased them. It was a great place to relax and the water was the perfect temperature.

I always enjoy my stay at the Hotel El Embajador and recommend your hotel frequently. My comments on my stay at Hotel El Embajador can be found following my previous stay on TripAdvisor under Fabulous Baker Boy Miami for a visit in JUne 2014. The Embajador experience has changed a bit and unfortunately needs improvement and attention to detail for my recent April 19 24 2015 stay at your hotel. The same hospitable service the lovely new remodeling and updated rooms the excellent location are hallmarks of the Embajador and greatly appreciated. However there needs to be some attention to detail particularly in the area of Los Porches Restaurant room maintenance and housekeeping. Please see below my comments on specific items that need attention to room 524. There needs to be SERIOUS attention given to Los Porches Restaurant. The quality of the breakfast buffet is excellent and beautifully prepared but hot food is COLD in the chafing dishes specifically the mangu and scrambled eggs. Also the quality of coffee is not tasty and has the appearance of being from some type of concentrate or mix rather than freshly brewed coffee. There is delicious coffee in the Dominican Republic. I can not understand why inferior coffee is being served at a five star hotel. Finally the servers in Los Porches need refining and direction. There does not seem to be any purpose in their movements other than just wandering about checking on tables haphazardly as guests flag the waiters for attention. The waiters are all delightful and attentive and well mannered but NOT organized and need to be assigned specific areas of the dining room that they are responsible for and take ownership in the service for those tables.", "offset": [454, 604], "date": "2015-04-28 16:48:19", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "26cbcc82-7fd3-4293-afc4-75ea2f1c76c7", "sentence": "Classy.

On the first night we arrived at the hotel promptly my fiance and i decided to get a bite to eat pool side. Your resturant was to close at 10 pm. It was 945 and they refused to servce us. Unheard of. I would not turn any business away especially in food and beverage. But he did. I did not catch his name. We ordered room service. The food was excellent with in temperature. However the server was not prepared whether we wanted to put it to the room or pay cash. He came back to the room on three different occasions which defeats the purpsoe of room service.

Hotel Embajador was built back in 195 during the Trujilo dictatorship. It cost 5 MILLION dollars to build which in todays dollars is like a bajilion. The iconic look of the hotel emulates the classic Miami Beach hotels down to each room having individual balconies. But the hotel itself has been modernized and remodeled over the years to keo it current. Rooms are large and lavish with modern appliances and bathrooms with a shower tub AND a shower stall. I stayed in the executive floor so I can not speak for rooms on other floors. Beds are very comfortable with soft sheets and about a dozen pillows on your bed. The hotel is a very popular place for Dominican social events. During my stay I witnessed at least 6 weddings. Pool is large and DEEP 10 feet at the deep end. No kidie pool so watch your children. No jacuzi. Service is pretty good inside the hotel hit and miss by the pool Cotora Bar. The attendants are frendly but overworked. The front desk can get busy when there are a lot of guests checking out at the same time so make sure you allow sufficient time for check out. Food is pretty good. However EVERYTHING is expensive think US prices for drinks meals etc. However our fare had breakfast included. There are several dining options located within 100 yards of the hotels main entrance and many more within a 10 minute taxi ride. The views from the higher floor rooms are breathtaking. Ask for an oceanside room on 4th floor or abovethere is a casino a spa several restanrants meeting rooms business centers and even a small photo museum showing the hotel and its guests over the years. Look for Wiliam Holden Isabella Roselini and Cantinflas. Some nits elevator keycards had a tendency to deprogram themselves shower stall drain in our room was very slow probably blocked did not check pool area service was hit or miss only one attendant.

I have stayed at the historic Embajador Hotel many times over the past 3 years. I have found it to be consistently very good in service and facilities.

Francisco always makes me feel at home as soon as I step out of the taxi. Socrates is always very attentive and polite as is all the staff at Embajador. I always stay on the Executive Floor and the rooms are spacious and beds comfortable. I have heard they are remodeling the rooms. My company has held big events in the main ballroom and the events staff did an excellent job. They are currently renovating the main ballroom as well so it will be even better than before. I always look forward to staying at the Embajador also because it is also close to many business offices in town.
