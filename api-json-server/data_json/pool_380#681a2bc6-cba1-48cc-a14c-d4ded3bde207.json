What a treat. I attended a brief conference meeting here in early December and stayed over an extra night. I was so glad I did. The first weekend in December offers great sights to locals and tourists. The hotel is the center of the action too. Outside they light hundreds of lights and had showcases music free cocoa and cider and more. It was a wonderful visit. Check in and check out was seamless. The pool is really nice with a retractable roof. The hotel partners with a local gym so you have to another building to access it. No worries it is still inside. The restuarant serves an amazing lunch menu. it is a bit eclectic especially for the brunch but it is still delicious and worth a visit. My only dislike were the beds. I mentioned something at check out because I would be coming back in a few months for another conference. I was told during the renovation currently taking place beds were being replaced. If the bed was not too my liking I could also ask for a board to firm up the bed. I have to get something. That stay was made horrid by the bed. The shower is also a bit outdated and sprouts almost everywhere. The temp and pressure was nice but I felt as if I was cleaning the entire bathroom because the water seemed to be all over the place. Otherwise a good visit. Parking is approximately 20 night valet I believe. I walked to the hotel from the train station. About 10 minutes. It was a beautiful December day. Not too cold or breezy. Straight shot requiring two turns. There was an incline involved. I had a roller bag and my purse. There were an abundance of restaurants nearby. You can see the Capitol building from the hotel window by the elevator from the 9th floor on up. Although I am not super impressed and I will admit renovations are needed I had definitely return and recommend this hotel to others.

I have been an out of town regular at this hotel for the past 3 years but have stayed away for the past 5 months due to an inoperable pool. However I returned to my favorite hotel in Richmond and was quite taken back by the friendliness warmth and TLC by the staff. We did have a slight hiccup with my refrigerator which was requested four days in advance and when I arrived in my preferred room it was nowhere to be found. However Jesica Anunziata made sure to get it to my room and also kept me hydrated throughout the trip and ended up with more water than I needed for my swimming and walking activities during the weekend. She also went out of her away and surprised me with a swimming towel waiting in my room so it was a very lovely gesture and I appreciate the warmth and thought that made me feel very special at the hotel. I also was tickled pink by Tobie Mayer Director of Rooms who personally made sure that my room would be taken care of and housekeeping did not disappoint so she was a lady of her word and quite touched that she would take time out of her busy schedule to accommodate my needs. It was truly an organization that cares about its guests and I was impressed also by their newer employee Ryan who also went out of his way to make sure my breakfast was good on Saturday and also has a warmth and genuine personality to make me feel special as a returning guest.

Our room was a tiny bit dusty and the housekeeping service was not always consistent meaning sometimes new glasses were not left or no tea replaced etc. but mainly little things like that.
