Travelling to this breathtakingly beautiful new addition to the Four Seasons brand with children 13 10 6. The interiors are stunning and exude luxury and are absolutely five star. The quality finishes and attention to detail are exceptional. Staff are welcoming and friendly and are attentive to every need. Children are welcomed and amply provided for. We are staying in rooms 204 206 which are accessible from the main corridor by one door which opens on to a small foyer which has 2 doors leading off to each bedroom. The rooms are enormous the marble bathrooms are gorgeous with bath separate rain shower double vanity private toilet bidet. Both rooms have a gorgeous balcony overlooking the pool sea with lovely seating and chairs. Slippers robes gorgeous bathroom amenities pool bag free water in the room provided at all times. Lovely treats are left in the room every time we have been away from the room we return to find a beautiful and thoughtful gift left behind for both the adults and children. Darya the Guest Relations manager is amazing. The pool men are lovely and no sooner have you sat by the pool they come and provide water bottles in a little cooler and set up your towels. The pool has a lifeguard on duty too. It is HOT here. currently 9 am and it feels like 35 degrees so after the amazing buffet breakfast we are already by the pool. Buffet caters for everyone and I can not fault it the service is outstanding. I really want to go on and on about the styling and the design which is exceptional. Absolutely luxurious without the pretentious feel there is no looking down on anyone and everyone is treated beautifully by all staff. Sometimes when you travel to exclusive establishments with children you feel paranoid that your every move will be monitored however I have never felt anything less than comfortable in this hotel. The hotel is only 6 months old and everything is running perfectly. Room service is very quick and is served like it would be in the restaurant. Location on the beach is fantastic. The pools cater for adults and babies. There are massages and other treatments available by the pool including pedicure manicure for ladies and their little ladies also. The exterior is Arab in a gorgeous way and that is what first drew me to this hotel. I am absolutely in love and planning my next trip back already and my kids have already expressed their desire to move here. The Four Seasons have really made their mark in Dubai with this property and I have found this property to be worth every penny.

There were plenty of well trained banqueting staff to herd the delegates and operate the coffee machines. I found the ball room had good acoustics and air conditioning which did not compete with the speakers. There was a standard layout of audience and stage and the audio system worked well throughout. The catering was a fairly limited selection but everything provided was delicious and in plentiful amounts. The best thing was that the food was far more interesting than the usual sugary pap which hotels churn out for coffee breaks and it tasted much better.

Recently trying to catch an uncomplicated week away with my husband and daughter mixing a little business with some rr we spent a great week at the Four Seasons. With unusually high temperatures we could have had an uncomfortable week. However the staff at the Four Seasons could not have been more accommodating. A beautiful hotel with great facilities. The pool beach and spa were perfect. The gym state of the art. Despite the incredible amount of construction whichever way you turn the hotel managed to provide a calm and cool oasis amidst the frenetic work all around. There was a good compliment of restaurants with perhaps just the polside casual menu needing a little more variety. Sea Fu in the beach was a wonderfully relaxed spot with fabulous food. The rooms were large and comfortable with great bath and shower rooms. We could not get a pool sea view room and so our rooms at the back of the hotel were a little disappointing and would recommend asking for rooms nearer the central atrium.

My wife and I spent 8 nights and 9 days at this new four seasons property. As a backdrop we lived in Dubai for two years and this was our first time back as tourists since we left 6 years ago. The property is well situated off of Jumeirah beach road and has a very nice private beach. The attention to detail at this property is fantastic. The rooms are very well appointed. Our room had a king bed with very high count linens and a feather soft duvet. As we were there for a working holiday we were able to experience not only the resort aspect of this property but the business side of the meeting spaces and the hotel delivered with bespoke precision. The service in Dubai and hospitality talent that has been brought in is now of world class standards compared to when we lived there in 2010. And I must disclose we lived in a villa on The Palm and frequented the Burj AlArab and Atlantis weekly and the service then pales in comparison. The four seasons boasts a fantastic dining and night life scene and we were not disappointed with food quality or service at any of the venues. The pool areas one adult and one family are beautiful and again staff and service are impeccable. That being said I must now review the negative aspects of the property. The biggest issue with the property is the construction going on with new offshore developments about 500 yards from the beach. For people unaccustomed to the perpetual construction in Dubai this could be an issue. Having lived on the Palm while the crescent was still being constructed I was perhaps a bit used to this kind of activity. Two other issues that I took note of were the Motorsports. jet ski ski boat rentals which were incredibly overpriced and I might add rarely used and the terrace furniture for the hotel rooms which was uncomfortable and appeared somewhat low budget for a property demanding substantial room rates. The negative aspects notwithstanding I would rate this property as one of the top three resort properties in Dubai to date.", "offset": [988, 1131], "date": "2016-05-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "5675be1e-f6c6-4f53-9d53-b8d71b2ed317", "sentence": "Stay away from valet stay was amazing.

Stayed at the property for two nights solo for a weekend retreat getaway. The property is massive and beautiful in every way. The outdoor dor valet staff are friendly and welcome you on arrival. The front desk team at check in had me wait quite a long time to check in to the room as nothing was available yet aprox 45 minutes. They offered an upgrade in the end once I called the hotel from the lobby and asked the manager to inquire on a room. I was coming from the Fairmont and just wanted to relax outside on the beach not wait in a lobby staring into space. The room was spacious immaculate and modern. There were two balconies a large bedroom and two large televisions with surround sound in the living room. It kind of was a similar lay out and feel to the four seasons whistler resort in Canada except instead of dark tones like there here it was whites creme colours bright and fresh. The bed is very comfortable as all FS beds are. Pillows were fluffy and down perfect. Crisp white linens. The bath room was spacious and boasts two sinks a large rain fall shower with hand held shower head too and a large legged bath tub there were some hairs in the tub from a previous guest. Other than that cleaned very well. The views from your balcony face the sea if you request it and it offers a nice breeze in the afternoon. The private beach is fantastic and they offer cold water in a cooler for you complimentary. The attendant call button machines did not function on any day during my stay so you have to call out or get up to request service which is a little inconvenient but not a big deal. The pool area is very clean and large offering a few pools for private groups and the younger family bunch. Hammocks gardens and little rest areas all over the resort offer tranquility and comfort. The spa is truly a great place you can not resist. The service is outstanding and the products are top notch. My massage therapist from Bali was amazing. He was knowledgeable friendly and truly is a pro in his craft. I had the facial and massage combo highly recommend. There is a shower area in the spa that offers pre recorded sounds that mimic storms birds and zen sounds mixed with changing lights and different water intensities. Very unique. The hot tub and indoor pool area is very pristine and relaxing. There is also a cold mist room to wake you up and the traditional steam room. The gym is phenomenal. Enormous with any and every machine imaginable. A huge cardio bike room and a private treadmill room too. Water and towel service available. I am in love with this gym. I would never have an excuse to miss gym day if I had this everydayRom service was great. There are a lot of options available and they aim to please. Quick and friendly. They even went to the extent to research a drink I like back home and create it here. The breakfast buffet was very good. Many options selections and types of food offerings. Asian Arabic and American style offerings. The tables are set perfectly and the staff are friendly and passionate. The food at the resort I tried three restaurants is amazing. The chefs are very well trained and the offerings are perfect. The meal sizes and prices are average and I never felt hungry or full perfect.

We spend our Christmas break in Dubai at the Four Seasons Jumeirah Beach. Our stay there was just exceptional beyond anything else we have experienced in the past at other hotels. Four Seasons is truly one brand where service to guests incl. true recognition still means something. Feeling recognized\u201cFeling recognized \u201d was for me the key critical element to move from another hotel brand to Four Seasons. By reputation I was told that Four Seasons service level was excellent and because I was tired to pay for luxury brands without having any sort of excellent service I wanted to give it a try with the family. I had already experienced Four Seasons in Hong Kong and in Macau see other reviews I wrote and I was positively impressed. I have to say that the Four Seasons made me feel recognized \u2026 from the time of booking until the time of leaving. I was recognized as an individual but also as a guest. Anything I have asked was properly addressed and answered in the best way for me \u2013 meaning not always in the easiest way for the hotel but always in the best way for me see below on the room review. This was particularly the case for instance when we had to stay one more night because of flights cancellations. I must also say that I felt that my daughter and my wife were both recognised and felt \u201c at home \u201d in this property \u2013 one enjoying being enjoyed by the kids \u2019 staff through great activities and the other being very surprised to be assisted on anything she asked. Indeed there is no \u201c loyalty \u201d program at Four Seasons and indeed Four Seasons believes that guests are coming back not to \u201c earn points \u201d but rather for the memories that the brand is creating for guests. Prior to my stay I was thinking this was \u201c brand marketing \u201d only \u2013. but I must know recognized that this is true reality. I do n\u2019t care about \u201c earning points \u201d \u2013 I felt recognized with my family as a guest and this was worth paying the price \u2013 this was even priceless. PropertyThe Four Seasons Jumeirah Beach is a recent hotel so everything looks beautiful and luxurious. Especially the main entrance and corridor to the rooms and facilities is brilliant. The hotel has two pools \u2013 one quiet for \u00ab adults \u00bb and one fancy for \u00ab families \u00bb and \u00ab kids \u00bb. The hotel has also a spa a fitness different restaurants caf\u00e9s and a kids club. The hotel has also a private beach only accessible to hotel guests. As part of the hotel there is also a night club and close to it a few restaurants. RomWe booked a Jumeirah Skyline Suite \u2013 it is a gorgeous suite with everything you need in there the view on Dubai Skyline skyscrapers is just wonderful especially at night. The suite had a direct view on the Burj Khalifa tower. The suite had a bathroom with toilet bath and shower it also had a separate toilet. The bedroom was great also with very comfortable bed. For our daughter the sofa in the living room was converted into a bed which was also very comfortable. Each part of the suite has its own flat TV screen. However on the 2nd night we asked to change room because our room despite being on the 5th floor was just in front of the Provocateur night club this means that the area was very noisy and despite having all balcony doors closed we could hear the music \u2013 and the people \u2013 late in the night. As we were willing to rest during our holidays and as we were travelling with our 4years old daughter we asked to changed room and were therefore relocated into an Imperial Suite. The Imperial Suite was a great place \u2013 a lot of place especially the dining living room. The bathroom was made of a toilet a bath and a shower. There was one additional separate toilet. There was a desk part a kitchen a dining room \u2026 you name those elements. We were only three in the suite but it could easily welcome more guests. The balconies one for the bedroom and one for the dining room were also very vast with sun chairs on one and a table to dine on the other. Both were facing the quiet pool. Both suites were really gorgeous \u2013 fine luxury everything you need in there. RestaurantsWe have tried the SEA FU which is the fish Asian place of the hotel great food there reasonable pricing show cooking all with a luxury touch service was wonderful \u2013 good advice from the staff listening to what we wanted and delivering accordingly. We also spend the Christmas Eve there and I have to say that the staff was particularly great on that evening even nicely dancing with our daughter \u2026. The SUQ was the breakfast restaurant but you can also go there for easy dining Asian touch again. The breakfast offers a lot of choice for all tastes and it is pretty difficult not to find what you are looking for. Giles Arzur the Executive Chief was also coming to guests in the morning which is always very nice. One element to improve however is the service while trying to help the staff runs everywhere at the same time forgetting most of the things they are being asked or forgetting to prepare the tables for guests when they arrive. This is probably a gap in how the team is organised and I found this a bit weird given the excellent level of service elsewhere. For the dinner everything was OK and much less crowded food was also good for a very decent price. The Shai Salon is the place to have a coffee andor a snack late dining we went there late evening \u2013. food was also very good but service could have been better again you feel a bit alone with staff running across but forgetting about youThe Mercury Bar roof top is a trendy cosy bar \u2013 we went there to see the view but it was very windy and we felt that kids were not really welcomed so we did n\u2019t spend more than a few moments there. I would however recommend the place for adults willing to enjoy a glass of wine with an outstanding view on the Dubai skyline. In room diningAlways served on time and even before orders can be placed through an iPad mini in the room where you pick what you want add comments and send the order \u2026 just as easy as that. Food delivered in room was wonderful \u2013 fine food really for very reasonable prices. ConciergeProbably one of the best concierge desk ever \u2013 great advice many different languages spoken \u2026 and the \u00ab chat \u00bb ap accessible from your mobile. With this ap you can basically ask any sort of questions and you get an answer very fast \u2026 not just a \u00ab polite \u00bb answer but really a valid one with anything you need. We used the ap extensively for everything \u2013 booking a babysitter for our daughter booking a car for a transfer requesting assistance to book an appointment to the hairdresser booking tickets for an event in Dubai arranging airport transferts. This is also through the ap that on our 2nd evening we requested to change room because of the noise and a few minutes later the issue was solved. So every time we felt considered recognized and serviced properly. The team there was really making an outstanding job. Kids clubThe hotel offers a free kids club for kids aged 4 and above. Our daughter being close to 4 but not already 4 we could not leave her on her own to the club \u2013 we had to book a babysitter who would basically stay with our daughter while being at the kids club. This is a bit strange especially when your kid not yet aged 4 is behaving as a kid aged more than 4 but we understand why this rule was in place and appreciated the assistance provided by the hotel to book a babysitter wherever needed. The activities organised by the kids club were also very good \u2013 pets \u2019 zoo treasure hunt crafting \u2026 you name them. Our daughter even requested us to spend more time there while usually she would refuse to go. That meant something to us. The kids \u2019 club staff was also very friendly with our daughter. Side activities for kidsSanta Claus visited the hotel on Dec 25th and I have to say that I am still positively surprised by this event \u2013 I will not share any \u00ab secret \u00bb here but Santa Claus arrival at the Four Seasons hotel is one of those memory we will keep in mind for a very long time \u2026 Kids loved it but adults also. This was a wonderful moment really. Beside this the hotel offers a lot of things for kids \u2013 you really feel that they are welcomed. For instance a free kid buffet was available next to the swimming pool or a small pets zoo was brought to the hotel or the pool beach is proposing toys for kids so you do n\u2019t have to take your own. free tickets to visit parks \u2026 I have traveled extensively already with my daughter but I have to say that this place is the best I have ever been for her. PolWe stayed at the \u00ab family \u00bb pool and we felt very well here. The pool manager was recognizing us by our name and every staff member remembered our daughter name also. As soon as you sit on a sun chair you receive fresh water and towels and during your stay the staff is taking care of all your requests. SUMARYIn short \u2013 Four Seasons is not a cheap place to stay but at some point there is a price for what you get. At this property you receive exceptional services and enjoy a wonderful place. This comes at a significant price but I wo n\u2019t hesitate to pay it again given what I received for it. If you can afford or if you would like to indulge yourself with the highest service standards make a stay at the Four Seasons Jumeirah Beach \u2013 and enjoy every moment.", "offset": [7743, 8064], "date": "2017-12-29", "cpt": "3", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "23b1a1b6-1f73-4c52-ad69-d1c9d50be25d", "sentence": "If u go for an event parking is easy but getting it bacl can be a Nightmare.", "offset": [0, 76], "date": "2018-02-28", "cpt": "3", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "51888d04-1008-4d0f-8d8f-b3c5dd8d4481", "sentence": "I had a meeting at hotel lobby.
