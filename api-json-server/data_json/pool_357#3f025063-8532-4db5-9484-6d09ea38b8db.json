Thank you for a pleasant stay at Radison Blu Split 1st \u2013 8th September. ROOM. We stayed at the non renovated part of the hotel and I must say I do not quite understand the complaints I have read here the room was a bit worn out yes but it was also spotless clean and totally comfortable. We knew that it was not in the newer part of the hotel so we knew what we were getting. We also had a wonderful sea view from our small balconyBREAKFAST Breakfast buffet was just amazing. Fresh fruits and croissants straight from the oven. Love itREASTAURANTS BAR We had a dinner one night at the Caper. our mains were very good but desserts even better. We also had a buffet dinner at the Fig Leaf \u2013 it was ok but nothing too special. The hotel bar was a bit small but the outside area terrace was very nice for relaxing and having drinks. There was live music one night and it was very good. The singer had an angelic voice and the music was perfect for chilling. Tip. Croatian wines are great. Enjoy a glass or share a bottle of their amazing ros\u00e9 under a star lit sky on a warm summer night. Pure perfection. POOL AREA. The pool area by the hotel was clean and relaxing. The pool was quite cold but it felt perfect as the weather was really hot around 32\u201334 \u00b0 C. You get GREAT pizzas from the pool barSPA GYM We were actually pretty surprised to find out that the spa was so big and upscaled. Extremely relaxing and clean. Extra points for the Finnish sauna it was spot on. The temperature was hot enough for us Finns at least and it was great that you could pour water to the hot stones yourself \u2013. things that you usually can not find or do in saunas outside Finland. The gym was adequately equipped and spacious. Also fresh towels and water provided. Very nice for working out on your vacaySERVICE Best for last \u2026 The hotel may not be 5. but the service definitely was. Your staff from the reception to the restaurants the bar the pool the spa \u2026 Everyone of you deserve five stars. So helpful friendly smiling and very professional \u2013 all the time.

I have just returned from 7 nights stay at this lovely hotel. We were in a deluxe room with balcony and although we did not have a room overlooking the pool we had a partial view of the sea which was lovely. The hotel staff had even left a lovely birthday cake in my room which was really thoughtful. I would say always ask for a room in the renovated part of the hotel as I hear the other rooms are very small and not that nice so either worth requesting an upgrade or paying for a good room it is worth it. The facilities in the hotel are great 3 restaurants 2 of which we tried. The pool bar and the Mistral restaurant by the beach are great and the food is excellent it is not cheap but worth the money. The area by the pool and the beach are both really really good plenty of beds and never that busy so no need to put your towel done before breakfast. Breakfast was really good too included in the price and you could just help yourself. The only downside to the hotel is that they do not have an on site shop selling toiletries drinks etc which they could really do with and certainly have enough room for. the nearest Lidl is about 8 mins walk which does not sound much but when it is taking hot it is the last thing you feel like doing. Not sure the reasoning behind not having one but would certainly improve the hotel as there is nothing else nearby to purchase items.

The rooms we paid for superior were excellent as was the paid for sea view. Unfortunately the indoor swimming pool was closed for maintenance we were warned about this ahead of departure but the Hotel kept the outdoor pool open. Our daughter is the swimmer in the family and was very happy with this facility both in terms of size and heating. The breakfast offering was very good and the attention and hard work of the breakfast team was commendable. We have to commend the team in the Bar who made us feel very welcome and important remembering our order from the first night throughout our stay. Very friendly and a credit to the Hotel. We only ate once in the Hotel which did not promote its offerings to any great extent. With the self service one the Fig Leaf opening at 730pm and not all day as suggested in the Hotel guide book we were happy with the offering and the cost but had to visit the venue to find what was on offer and the price. No attention given to promoting the offer to us walk ins as we were referred to on entry. Against all this the attention of the staff was outstanding and the cost just about reasonable. As to the other restaurant the Caper there was no external indication of menu or price. The only information on offer were details of fine and very expensive wine. We did with difficulty manage to track down a copy of the menu this on a flimsy piece of paper and not very informative about the food offering. We were put off using this restaurant. The Hotel can not do anything about its location but it has to be said that it is not in walking distance of the Old Town despite not being too distant.

The hotel was clean and modern. On arrival we were greeted and instructed that our credit card would be debited by \u20ac 200 to cover drinks bill restaurant and spa treatments rather strange. We asked where we would get breakfast in the morning to be told to follow the people. After checking into our room which had a sea view was lovely and spacious air conditioning had no instructions and did n\u2019t work we wandered to the restaurant for a meal. The staff walked past us repeatedly before anyone acknowledged us. On being seated we discovered the menu was limited and very expensive. My partner chose seafood for a starter and main but both were mediocre at best. The wine comes in 010 measures at \u20ac 8 for a cheaper brand. \u20ac 15 for a larger glass. Breakfast at the radison blu is good and caters for everyone. We decided to walk down to the beach on our first day but could n\u2019t find the way after you left the hotel signage in general is poor in split. we walked along the beach front into the Riva which is amazing absolutely breathtaking. A great range of eateries are available and we quickly decided to eat out for our meals. Expect to pay about \u00a3 10 p for a starter and \u00a3 10\u00a320 for a main. Although we had googled the shorter journey back via the town rather than the beach 15 miles we did take a local taxi beware some drivers will charge over the odds 60 kuna is the norm but we were sometimes charged 90 kuna.

This was true the bar was so expensive not many used it. We ordered two cocktails at 90 kuna each to find there was no alcohol in them. On speaking to the barman he argued that there was when there clearly was none. The Hungarian football team were in residence so we had to walk through police private security guards etc not ideal when you are trying to relax. Two were stationed under our balcony overnight and kept us awake. Went to have my nails shelac\u2019d for 100 kuna the receptionist refused to allow me to book this without booking a manicure for another 200 kuna. there \u2019s up selling and there \u2019s losing a sale.
