In one of my previous stay in Hong Kong we stayed at Intercontinental Grand Standford but this time we decided to use my points and treat ourselves at the Intercontinental Hong Kong. A beautiful hotel and a fantastic location with a great view. The hotel has an aura of luxury but it did not deliver for me. The staff were not communicative or friendly however the lady for room service over the phone was polite and addressed me by name which I appreciated. What I felt is that we were constantly watched. I had placed my bag on a ledge to capture a picture when staff came over to tell me to put my bag on the floor as it may fall over to the floor below that had dining area. Then as I went to the bar lounge a staff came along to point out the step and cautioning me in case I fell over. The worst was when my 21 year old daughter had tucked one leg under the other leg while sitting on the foyer chair and being told to put her leg down. I have stayed in Intercontinental Hotel in Singapore Hong Kong and Fiji but this hotel was a let down.", "offset": [802, 952], "date": "2015-01-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "8b45f3cd-61da-4778-a381-84043ccbfe6f", "sentence": "Amazing View.

Great location to catch the subway next door to museums if that is what you are looking for. We dined at one of their 2 star Michelin restaurants on site Yan Toh Hen and it was beyond good.

My friends and I stayed in May for a few days before we moved to a hotel near the Conference venue. After staying at the Intercontinental we did not want to move. I had paid for gold ambassador status and was upgraded to a huge room. Always get the harbour view room that is what you are there to see. The view is simply outstanding. Joining their loyalty program also gives you free wi fi. Breakfast buffet will take your breath away. Lovely to see such a collection of european asian and indian food. The lobby bar is the place to meet. Sit and watch the magnificent view eat some nice snacky food and drink amazing and expensive cocktails. We did not eat in the hotel restaurants.

The view from both our room and the main lobby lounge overlooking the harbour is stunning and even better at nightOveral no complaints highly recommended great service great pool jacuzi and great for both falling asleep and waking up to what must be one of the most stunning views from a hotel anywhere in the world.

We stayed here for one night as a treat and it was worth it. As a family we booked what the hotel call outer connecting rooms which means there are 2 rooms and a mini foyer with another door to the hallway which works really very well. Our children had the twin room and we had the king. The harbour views are spectacular probably best view of HK island you are going to find and be able to enjoy from the comfort of your air conditioned romThe style is classic with large baths and showers marble and dark wood finishes everywhere. Very comfortable beds and lots of storage. The complimentary local mobile phone is such a great idea we used it even for the one nightThe pool is quite small for a hotel of this size but was not busy when we were there. We loved the pool side service and how friendly everyone was. Yes the building work is still going on but we did not find it too intrusive when we were staying perhaps the project has moved on to a less noisy stage. If you are new to HK this type of massive construction may be a shock but we are seasoned HK visitors and it did not bother us at all. The room service and mini bar are very pricey as you might expect from a luxury hotel but the price for the buffet dinner at the coffee shop was shockingly expensive. HK80 for each adult at the time that was around GB\u00a380 each. I think that this is expensive even for a luxury hotel although being in TST there are many places to eat instead. Overall our stay was very comfortable we were made to feel very welcome and well looked after.
