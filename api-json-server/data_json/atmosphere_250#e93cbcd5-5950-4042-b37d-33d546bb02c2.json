During our 4 days at the resort we never heard a single construction related noise. The staff was very attentive. The highlight of our stay was having dinner in their premiere designer residence. It was an ingenious way to deal with the fact that Flame was closed for renovations. The atmosphere was very intimate and the food was outstanding. I highly recommend this resort.

My husband an I stayed at the four seasons vail resorts for a much needed break. We were celebrating his birthday. We stay at many 5 star hotels throughout the states and abroad. But the service we received while staying here was above and beyond. They try to cater to your every need and more. Starting with the Concierge services that helped us plan amazing trips and tried to help us make the best of our trip. Kate helped me plan a romantic getaway for my husband to Piney River Ranch which we will forever remember. She was so responsive and emailed all the information so I would have everything I needed. She also arranged a little surprise in our room for him. The hotel was so accommodating with there car service. They allow you to use there hotel car which is a luxury GL450 and your request. Just as long you are flexible but we never had a problem taking the car since we would started our day early. Sam who also works at the concierge was incredibly helpful and provided us with great trips and went above and beyond to make sure our experience special. Towards the end of trip I decided that Sam could replace Suri on my Iphone due to all the knowledge he had about everything. I also received a phone call on the second day from the hotel manager making sure we were happy with everything and if we needed anything to make it even better. All the staff in the bar lobby were so personal and easy going. I had accidentally dropped my phone in water and as soon as David heard he brought me a bag of rice so I could somehow salvage my phone from breaking completely. Housekeeping kept our room so beautifully cleaned. They would lay everything out so it was well organized and turn down service was perfectly planned. I can not say enough good things about this place. If you want top service impeccable attention to details then this place is for you. I will booking another stay here soon.

Just like Ferari cars or the Police Academy movies when you hear the name Four Seasons you have certain expectations. Luxury settings and even more impressive service. Outstanding amenities and memorable locations to explore. The opportunity to take goofy photos with cocktails that are named after Sex Pistols songs. Those kinds of expectations. For this first timer the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Vail managed to bury those expectations in an avalanche of awesomenes making me eagerly anticipate another return visit at some point in the future. Located right off the highway and not far from a roundabout the Four Seasons is tough to beat in terms of location alone. The entrance is fairly small making it difficult for thre cars to park and unload but that is the only possible nitpick I could make after our stay here. A team of valets greeted us and we walked in to immediately find The Remedy looking back at us. we will talk about The Remedy in a second actually. First let us get to the front desk and the rooms. The front desk team was eager and helpful and had us on our way to the seventh floor to check into rooms 7032 and 7034. Our rooms were nothing short of what I imagine Heaven would be like only with 100 percent less Penelope Cruz. Nonetheless the rooms were outstanding. The bathrooms came equipped with freestanding tubs. The rooms came with fireplaces that roared to life in seconds. there is an all in one charging unit in the nightstand that can charge 11 electronics at once. It was enough to make me throw the patio door open and yell loudly to the mountain view I had looking back at me. And speaking of views when we checked in it was around the high 70s. About 36 hours later it was 19 and snowing. I seriously think we managed to see all four seasons here and I can confidently say they each are spectacular and worth enjoying both at the hotel and around the village nearbyin fact the proximity of this place to the nearby village is wonderful. You simply walk out the hallway on the main floor and you are literally across the street from shops restaurants and sculptures that make for wonderful intoxicated Kodak moments. But leaving the place would deny you the chance to enjoy The Flame and The Remedy. We had breakfast all three mornings in The Flame and if you happen to be here on a weekend this is a buffet that must be experienced. It spans a few rooms and spatial geography is always what I look for in a buffet. And it is all delicious. Even the regular breakfast menu is a treat and the staff working here could not be more engaging or attentive. Ditto the team working The Remedy the bar we finished each night at with a nightcap of bourbon or cocktails that pushed even my limits. Note good luck to anyone who attempts to drink a Medicine Cabinet after two other drinks. Our first night we sat outside around a fire pit on the patio overlooking the pool in a tranquil setting and our waitress was the MVP of our time here. She was just about the friendliest person I have met in quite some time and she gave us great suggestions for sights to see during our time in Vail. So not only were the drinks and the views awesome but the service was outstanding and informative. Does it get any better. Yeah actually the housekeeping team was also awesome operating like ninjas in the middle of the mornings and somehow never being seen. When all is said and done and you scroll back up to the top of this review to remember how it all began there are certainly other places to stay at in Vail. But the Four Seasons did not get to be at the time of this writing. the number one hotel in town on this site purely by coincidence. This is one of those instances where it is not only okay to believe the hype but doing so is actively encouraged.", "offset": [2889, 3040], "date": "2017-10-12", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "26dd5cf0-b0d9-4d1a-94c3-529632feea19", "sentence": "Best general manager of any hotel MrPazini.

We will almost always choose Four Seasons when we have the ability to do so because of the knowledge that we will receive a consistently excellent product. This property did not disappoint. Before even getting out of the car we were welcomed and immediately made to feel like we were right at home. We were warmly greeted at the front desk and had very positive interactions with everyone we encountered there and at the concierge desk. Any questions or requests were responded to quickly and politely. Bell staff in room dining engineering and ski concierge all provided excellent service. We had just left the rest of the family after a few days skiing in Utah and for the first time in a very long time were enjoying a ski vacation even if it was a mini one as just a couple. We so enjoyed our time at this hotel and in Vail Village. We were in a very comfortable mountain view executive suite. Views were not great but this hotel is not known for that so we were not expecting much. The room itself was extremely comfortable and laid out very nicely. The property is just at the edge of Vail Village barely a half a city block away and a very easy walk to and from. If you do not feel like walking they will quickly give you a ride or pick you up. The ski concierge is at the base of the gondola and again you can either walk or get a ride. Both food and drink at the hotel bar Remedy were very good in a very pretty and comfortable setting. We enjoyed breakfasts and one dinner at Flame the hotels restaurant. Another very pretty and comfortable place. Service in both the bar and restaurant was always very gracious and friendly. The only negative in terms of food and beverage offerings was that there is a coffee snack shop in the hotel that is only open in the morning. It would be great to have a place like that open in the afternoon maybe from 3 5 for quick afternoon after skiing beverages and snacks rather than having to go to the bar or get room service. We can not say enough about the high level of service at this hotel. Having just come from a not so great experience at another luxury hotel at Deer Valley which did not turn out to be so luxurious the excellence here was especially noticeable. Obviously another very well managed Four Seasons hotel.
