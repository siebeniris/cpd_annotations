The Chatanogan has been a favorite hotel of mine for a few years since we first stayed there. We make frequent trips to Chattanooga from Atlanta just to stay here. The rooms are very nice as is the entire hotel. It is tastefully modern contemporary with out overdoing it. Rooms are nice. I have stayed in 540 most recently. it is a king room with a city view. Floor to ceiling windows are nice. The room appears to have just recently been refurbished as the furniture all looked brand new. I have also stayed in courtyard suite which was also very nice. It has a fancier bathroom with a large tub. Facilities are all clean and well maintained. Indoor pool is always a highlight. The Foundry and Broad St Grill have good food and great service albeit a little on the pricy side. Only real downside is that there are very few other restaurants within walking distance.

The room was impeccable. Absolutely wonderful. However the actual campus of the hotel was not very well it at night and the walk from the parking garage to the actual hotel made me feel unsafe. It was very dark with no side walks and the paths were not lit up at all. I felt very insecure walking alone with my luggage. I suppose that is why they have valet. The lounge was not what I expected. there were large gaudy curtains everywhere and it really did not jive with the otherwise gorgeous Aesthetic. The bed was so comfortable in fact my fiance and I ended up using both beds rather than just one because they were that comfortable. I mean my bed at home is not that comfortable. I was not very impressed with the staff I called to confirm my reservation and the woman at the front desk was snotty and did not really answer my questions.

This hotel exceeded my expectations. The lobby is really nice with fire glowing in the middle. We played table shuffleboard and enjoyed the game.

The setting around the hotel reminded us of a park. I am already looking forward to our next trip. All the staff were excellent obviously well trained. The hotel itself is comfortable and we enjoyed the modern ambience. Excellent location close to one of my favorite restaurants Public House in Warehouse Row. We walked to Tivoli and enjoyed the walk.

The rooms are nice and neat very well kept and extremely clean. The pool was nice and the sauna and steam was a hit for us as well as the fitness area. However our air conditioner was not working properly and the hall was cooler than the room. The full size beds are a tad rough for 2 people to sleep in but are very comfortable as are the pillows. We are in the deluxe with mahogany furnishings which is pretty but if since it is a nicer room I am not sure I had want to see a regular room. When we checked in we checked in with Natalie and she was awesome she gave us all information to see that we had a great time however the night shift worker sent us walking toward a bad part of the neighborhood with no hint the we were headed toward a gang area. The parking was good 80 per day in a parking garage is a good deal especially in this area. The bands on the weekends were not our cup of tea but the bar is fairly laid back and nice. In my opinion it is not worth 1800 per night if some of the spa treatments were part of this price that may make it worth more. Maybe give the 20 per bottle of water rather than changing for it.

When checking in they stated \u201c we have had a malfunction or glitch in our system and we no longer have any rooms available for this evening. However we can arrange for you to stay at another hotel \u201d. This was very upsetting to hear. I had not been contacted via email or phone call that I did not have a room available. My entire family was staying at this hotel and now I had no place to stay or vehicle to get to another hotel. The staff working that night Andria acted as if this was not a big deal and was not concerned or willing to help me. I was very disappointed and upset at this point. The next day when trying to check into my room i experienced more difficulties. The young man working the concierge desk could not seem to find my paperwork. He offered to find another room but this would be of charge. I had mentioned that your hotel had offered me after a long discussion I would stay for free for my second night under ny reservation. After quite some time I was finally able to be found in your system and given my room. A family member of mine was also charged 60 dollars for a two night stay at a room rate around the price of 320 per night for \u201c incidental purposes \u201d.
