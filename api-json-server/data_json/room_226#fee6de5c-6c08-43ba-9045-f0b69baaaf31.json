I have been pretty successful with hitting all of these in past choices with Four Points. And with my loyalty they have extended way beyond my expectations with drink tokens laundry service free breakfast \u2026 etc. Until now. I am newly assigned to Sacramento and on paper this hotel seemed to work. But I can say that I will NEVER stay here again. Other than the nice respectful lounge waiter and room clean staff this property is a disaster. Made Corp Reservations through SPGcom for 2 rooms 3 nights each in January. My co worker was traveling with me. The day of travel he had to cancel until the next day. No problem \u2026 I would take care of it at the hotel. Airport Shuttle. I get to SMF retrieve my bag and call the hotel to confirm pickup area. They had told me it runs every half hour 10 minute ride. I called at 126. I was put on hold for 5 minutes. Then told that because I did n\u2019t call by 125 the shuttle is not coming. I had to wait until the 20 pm shuttle. Called Uber. Hotel Check in. I checked in and advised the second room would not be checking in until the next day. She advised they have a 48 hour cancellation and I would be charged. And the room would have to be re booked on a rate that was 60 higher per night. But she would get permission to \u201c let \u201d me check into both rooms to keep reservations. I showed my corporate reservation which clearly states I can cancel up to 60 pm day of travel with NO penalties. \u201c That is not our policy \u201d. She completely disregarded the SPG guidelines for corp travel reservations. Hotels were sold out in the area so I checked into both rooms so I did n\u2019t lose the reservation and planned to challenge this with SPGKeys. Old key system \u2014 if your key even comes close to your cell phone. It deactivates. Happened at least 2 times a day as I drop everything in my purse. Constant traffic to the front desk from many guests while the staff was busy trying to explain to phone calls about the ridiculous 48 hour cancellation policy. GYM. TVs on cardio do n\u2019t work. no antibacterial wipesRom noise. I could hear the next room using the bathroom. Thank goodness I was so high from the wafting MJ from below I fell asleep. Business Center. Out of OrderCofe. I can not think of any hotel that does not have coffee in the lobby 24 hours. After work out went over for a cup there is a set up in the restaurant area and asked for a cup. Was advised \u201c my rate does not include breakfast \u201d. I did n\u2019t want breakfast just a cup of cofeSo we stuck it out and checked out after the 3 days. Called SPG who fought with them for over an hour before hotel agreed to refund. Left my car there for the weekend \u2026 but returned and could n\u2019t stomach staying there again. Returned to this hotel 2 weeks later \u2026 only because no credit yet and mysterious 70 charge on my card. Figured it was easier discussing while \u201c giving them a second chance. \u201dStil no wipes in restaurant no coffee in lobby business center in op \u2026 same issues.
