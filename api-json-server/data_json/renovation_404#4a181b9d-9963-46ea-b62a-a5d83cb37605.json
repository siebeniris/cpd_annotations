The first part was bad we arrived expecting a garden room we got stuck in a small room with one bed and a sofa bed. We had booked 2 beds and a balcony. After calling the front desk we were told they were sold out that night but the next day we would be moved. Okay no problem. The next day I called and got the run around we will call you when our room was ready by 130 we wanted to move and unpack. Called back nobody would answer finally went down to the front desk luckily we got a nice person to help us. We did not get the beachfront that we had booked but we did get a garden room with a balcony. A couple of things we were not told they have a dress code there when you order a drink or food you have to put it on your room they take no cash this is also at the beach. So you do not need a lot of cash at this place except when you check outAs far as the beach the brochure says private beach you share it with all the other hotels also people that are not staying at any hotel. The beach had a lot of trash but was not gross. The guys that work there are nice they will get your chairs for you and a umbrella for 100 which was no problemMost of our trip was fine staying there once but would not stay there again. They do need to update their rooms mold in the bathroom one trash can for the 2 of us. The pillows are awful the bed was good pretty noisy room glad we brought a fan with us to block out some of the noise.

My only complaint about this property is something beyond their control the mosquitos. Thirty eight mosquito bites later I am one big itch. That aside this was a wonderful property with friendly staff. I was allowed to check in early and so were my other guests. Any complaints from my group were met with swift resolution. I had to rely heavily on the concierge manager David to pull my trip off and he went far beyond the call of duty to make sure that I kept a smile on my face and did not go into meltdown mode. In fact I do not have any complaints about the friendliness of the staff they made me feel like family. I stayed in an Ocean Lanais and found all of the appointments were modern the room spacious and the bed very comfortable. The grounds were always always clean. The lobby was a great place to hang out and people watch or dance if the music so moved you. I loved that there were different entertainment options each night.

I am so happy that I stayed here. Celebrating a 40th birthday celebration this hotel gave us everything that we needed. I read a lot of reviews and became nervous based on some of the bad ones but here is my take on some of that feedback good and bad. I think will be helpful. The rooms. The rooms hallways and elevators were a little dated so i could see where people expressed their disappointment that it was was not fresh. That said everything was clean and fresh including the beds and bathrooms although the walls and the paintings in the bathroom needed some refreshing. These are things that the hotel is addressing right now so I think when they are done renovating it will be better than ever. People who complained because of the cost of the room are obviously people who do not hunt for their best rate on TripAdvisor. I am someone who bargain shops my hotels because I like quality hotels for cheaper prices. Corporate Rate hotel points online deals whatever never pay full price and then you wo nt complain you did not get what you paid for. That said the beds were amazingly comfortable and the views breathtaking. Worth it. Staff Amazing people work here. Friendly attentive and accommodating the staff and bartenders are perfect. We were given then chance to move our room mid stay so we could check into a pool and ocean view for the last part of our stay and it was worth it. The front desk staff were knowledgeable and patient. A special thank you to Yaisa at the front desk who made our check in and entire stay personable. Her smile and professionalism and knowledge were unmatched. People like her are why people like me return to hotels. She knows how to make you feel special. Yamira at La Teraza made each morning special thank yous are in order. Everyone was special. Pools. The pools were excellently maintained and have beach access. They did play music and had entertainment onsite but it was never intrusive to our sleep. The swim up bar was so much fun and the waiters know their way around a drink. My only complaint was I wish they were a little stronger. When i do not want to pay 15 a drink I do not order it polside. that is common sense. I have never stayed anywhere that did not charge a premium for polside service. it is vacation not your local bar. Food There are a few onsite restaurants that are a bit on the pricey side. That said the breakfast buffet about 27 is worth it if you can go towards the end everything is still kept out fresh and it turns into a leisurely late breakfast early lunch. My friend got a salmon bagel and coffee and for 10 more I was completely full and did not eat again until dinner except for some fruit. The staff at La Teraza are wonderful and the outdoor seating is heaven to enjoy a meal and watch the water in the distance. The Italian restaurant also gives large portions that are easily share able and the sushi place is worth it if you do the hibachi. Always have one meal onsite I say but explore the area there are lots of yummy gems to choose from at a low price point. There is a club and casino onsite. I am not big on either but made it a point to experience an hour or two in each area. I recommend the same to others. You are there enjoy it. The live salso music is divine sit and have a drink and enjoyWalking into the hotel or just lounging during the day the energy is infectious. Other than the odd restrictive dress code in the lobby which you come to appreciate after a while. this location has everything you could need. Take a moment to walk around during the day and the night you wo nt be disappointed.

I will apologize in advance for my lengthy review. I recently became a Hilton Rewards Diamond member. On our recent trip from May 7May 10th we did not feel the Diamond status was discernably different than our previously lower tier of Hiltons reward program. There were a few things during our stay that deserve mention. both good and bad. We received a warm and friendly welcome from Angelo curbside upon arriving at the hotel. The lobby of this hotel is rich looking and luxurious. Unfortunately the rest of the hotel has not been kept up to carry that same quality throughout. I wish I could say we received a nice welcome from Mara at the reception desk however it was anything but warm and welcoming. Since our room was not ready we decided to sit by one of the two pools while we waited. We took note of the poor condition of the pool and its desperate need for a facelift. A nice touch are the handful of hammocks surrounding the pool which looked inviting. There is also an area by this pool with games ping pong can jam corn hole. The second pool with a swim up bar is nicer and has loungers surrounding it which provide both shade and comfort though the canopies and the wooden chaises have seen better days. The first room we were given was a renovated room with a garden pool view. Our only view would have been of the bush in front of our patio and I would use the term renovated loosely. While the bathroom had been updated the hallways and room itself appear to only have been re carpeted and painted. That seems more to me like maintenance rather than renovation. We went back to the reception desk and were greeted by someone more friendly and helpful this time. I wish I could remember her name Luzane possibly. She provided us with a key for two rooms from which we were able to choose our preference. We picked the main tower room 741 since the view was much better. It had both a pool and ocean view though also looked out over the dirty dome of the restaurant where breakfast is served. The need for room renovations was evident when looking at the worn and chipped furniture the dirty baseboards damaged wall and the rusted lamps. Also there were no outlets in the bathroom in which to plug in my hair dryer. The only area with a mirror near an outlet was the desk and there were no available outlets to plug into there. The Internet service worked well in the hotel but not out by the pool area. I can not stress enough. the real highlight of our trip was almost every staff member we came in contact with. They were polite friendly and very eager to help in any way to ensure our stay was the best possible. Jesie one of the pool area attendants was awesome. The young gentleman in the Tratoria also was very friendly and engaging when we stopped in for some gelato. The housekeeping staff cheerily assisted us a few times when we had difficulty with keys that were provided at the front desk. The wait staff in all the restaurants we dined in were very friendly as well. As for the quality of the hotel condition of rooms recreational facilities I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews on Trip Advisor. This hotel is badly in need of renovations which are reportedly underway for 2016. We also noted that this hotel attracts a younger more rowdy crowd as evidenced by the late night noise on our floor and the Spring Break like atmosphere at the pool during our short trip. We dined one evening at The Meat Market. The food atmosphere and service were outstanding. One other highlight of our trip was a recommendation given by our taxi driver on the way to our hotel. Mi Casita. a restaurant with authentic Puerto Rican food located down the block from the hotel in a small strip of stores. The food was outstanding and the restaurant was crowded a sure sign that it is a favorite of locals.

By 4 PM there was techno music blasting and the children had been replaced by tons of young men and women. The atmosphere went from family friendly to that of a South Beach club. My boyfriend and I are in our early 20s so we do not typically mind loud music but this was beyond loud and disrupted our last day which we had hoped would be relaxing.

We returned to ESJ after a few years absence eager to assess the results of the 65 million restoration and renovation past Hurricane Maria. The hotels iconic lobby is fully restored and some wonderful additions coffee area additional seating are in place. The traditional and superb live music Thurs Sat is back along with the lively and elegantly dressed crowd. We stayed in the tower in an upper level renovated room with a partial ocean view. Our room was spacious well appointed modern and the toiletries and other details were on a par with the level of this hotel. The beach and pool areas are just beautiful and we appreciated a choice of pools and seating areas as the Beach Club area features a thumping music beat and weekend DJ. that is not to every guests delight. We tried the Ca\u0144a Restaurant for a delicious lunch. Keep in mind this is upscale hotel dining priced accordingly and then add the local and resort fees. Still it was a memorable dining experience offset cost wise by the numerous moderately priced eateries in the neighborhood and other San Juan areas. The staff was unerringly helpful cordial and continuously cleaning sweeping serving etc. to maintain the space in perfect shape. While the official taxi lines have preset pricing to the airport old San Juan etc we found Uber to be a reliable and consistently far less costly way to travel.", "offset": [383, 465], "date": "2019-02-27", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "b33636c2-1ecf-4049-be14-fb6fa1e3fc14", "sentence": "Beautifully renovated hotel with helpful staff. This hotel underwent a top to bottom renovation in 2017 and the result is a stunningly elegant lobby and lobby bar area and hip restaurants. There are two good sized pools with hot tubs and servers to come around and take drink food orders although the old hotel pool is still fenced off and in need of renovation. There is also a new spa and exercise room with floor to ceiling windows looking into the pool area but I did not use either. The hotel staff members were polite and helpful and the room was cozy and spacious I had requested an ocean view which we received but did not get a complimentary upgrade although I have Hilton Gold status. One minor cautionary word about the rooms the pillows were not very comfortable and we both woke up with stiff necks. Perhaps we should have asked for different pillows to be brought up but we were only there 2 nights. The bathroom was small but adequate with plenty of high quality toiletries provided. This is not necessarily the hotel \u2019s fault but we had an odd experience at the Meat Market Restaurant there. It is an upscale and very expensive steak house inside the hotel there is also one in Miami I believe. There were at least 3 people waiting on us at the same time which caused some overlap in questioning about our orders. One server told us there was a special crab empanada appetizer while the next server only minutes later told us it was a lobster empanada. Two of the servers told us about a bison filet option on special which my husband ordered at about 715pm so early into the dinner rush. Ten minutes later one of the servers came back and told us the bison filet was sold out. And a good 30 minutes after that we heard out first server tell the table next to us about the bison special that was sold out. He had to go back and inform them that they no longer had it. There were some other unusual moments but other than my husband \u2019s first cocktail taking 20 minutes to arrive I ca n\u2019t recall the others. I \u2019m not faulting the hotel for the experience but conveying the info to anyone who may choose to eat there. Service was disorganized and disappointing for a place that projects an upscale vibe.", "offset": [0, 47], "date": "2019-05-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "f4f1df7c-3af2-4fd3-8a71-7f83db78625b", "sentence": "Very nice time. Very cleaned renovated great daily entertainment and the night club is one of the best. Specially on Saturday. I highly recommend the burgers and the sushi. But the meat market. Too pricy service took a very long time for the drinks and the food was not that great. Keep in mind that they charge 3 different taxes and service charges plus a daily rate of 350 so at the end of your stay expect a bill.

Definitely the most resort like feel from what we \u2019ve seen in Puerto Rico. Super friendly staff. Meat Market restaurant within the resort was subpar for the price. Amazing decor and beautiful bar setups. Although the liquor selection is lacking the service all around helps you forget that. They \u2019ve come quite along in regards to repairs post hurricane. You can still smell lingering water damage within the Meat Market but overall pristine just like everything else within the property. Two large pools with the largest steps away from the beach.

Our stay was great even considering that we were there for the major earthquake aftershock and power failure. Even though almost all of the island lost power the generators at the hotel came on immediately and there was no perceptible loss of lights or air conditioning. The earthquakes were in the southern part of the island and the hotel is in the north. Feeling everything shake was \u201c freaky \u201d but there was n\u2019t any noticeable damage to anything. Many of the surrounding shops and restaurants were closed after that because of the power failure. However many have generators of their own and were open. The hotel has lovely grounds with an enormous Banyan tree. There are multiple pools with nooks and crannies so you can choose to be near the bar or in a quiet location. The beach is right off the pool area. We enjoyed sitting and eating at the restaurant that flanks the pool. It would have been nice if breakfast was served until later since we do n\u2019t get going early. Even offering an all day egg dish and a yogurt and fruit option would be appreciated. The kiosk in the lobby that offers danish muffins and yogurt was n\u2019t adequately stocked or replenished. The staff were universally friendly and accommodating. I want to single out Mr Medina at the valet station. He was very helpful suggesting restaurants during the power failure. I was very interested in learning about how the natives coped after Hurricane Maria. Mr Medina was very happy to answer my questions and engage with me. The rooms were renovated and modern and bright. The hotel lobby is very dark and I guess \u201c retro \u201d. It was built in 1958 and that \u2019s how the lobby looks. We spent the first night in the main tower on the third floor. Directly below this is the lobby with a ballroom Cabaret and Club. The very loud music went on until 5 AM. My daughter \u2019s family could n\u2019t sleep and the two year old was up all night. They moved us the next night to the villas which had patios and was at a distance from the main building. That was perfect. This was a family trip with ages 2 27 31 65 and 80. Everyone was happy at the El San Juan. Accommodations pool beach surrounding area nightlife staff provided something for everyone.", "offset": [1524, 1571], "date": "2020-01-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}]}
