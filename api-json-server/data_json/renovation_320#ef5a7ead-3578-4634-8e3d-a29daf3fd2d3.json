I will start the review off with the positives then we can dive into where things went wrong. The hotel is located in a very convenient area close to restaurants and the Gardens Mall within walking distance. There is actually two bridges that connect the hotel to Downtown at the Gardens which hosts many different places to see. There was a lady chef for breakfast I did not catch her name but she was very sweet and she takes pride in her craft. Checking in was smooth because I did so before I arrived. While walking to our room I could not help but hear loud banging and digging up of flooring. I thought this was unusual because I did not receive any information that the hotel is going through a renovation. These loud sounds did not go away for awhile. What was supposed to be a relaxing stay for my wife on her birthday was quite noisy and irritating to say the least. I booked a Jr Suite room that has a balcony. When we tried to escape the loud noise inside and sit on the balcony we were greeted with all the workers throwing all the demo into the dumpster below our room. This room is also right above the big AC units which is extremely loud and makes the balcony basically a wash. I tried to remain positive but I could tell that my wife was extremely disappointed and annoyed. So here comes day two on a Saturday. We were woken up by the construction which went on the entire day Saturday. So much for sleeping in and watching TV and relaxing. As a Diamond Member for Hilton I must say I expected better from this chain. Someone sent me a courtesy text to check in on our stay. I rated it poorly and explained our frustrations. Nothing was done to accommodate us in any manner. I am upset that my wifes birthday was ruined. I spent money and points to be totally disappointed and guess what this continued into Sunday as well which we were woken once again by this nonstop noise. In conclusion the hotel is kept clean and like I said in a good location but I am not sure I would return because nothing was done to make this right.", "offset": [622, 736], "date": "2018-08-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "b9da050f-8ebc-407a-943c-3e0b0f4d829e", "sentence": "Under renovation and no warning on website Had stayed in the past and had a nice experience.

I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in Palm Beach Gardens for 5 nights. I chose the hotel due to the close proximity to Downtown. It was great to be able to walk to the restaurants and shops in Downtown and not have to worry about finding a parking spot. Our room overlooked the lake and Downtown and it was beautiful. Our room was quite large and looked as if it had been recently renovated. The room was very modern and clean however the beds were not the best. I like a softer bed and softer pillows. I was also surprised that the bathroom was quite small. I liked the shower stall as opposed to a bathtub shower with a shower curtain. The shower stall was modern and the shower head had many settings and had good pressure. The air conditioner worked well and once we figured out how to not turn off all the power in the room the refrigerator also worked well. The room was very quiet. We did not hear noise overhead or from other rooms next to us. I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the room was since the rooms are no longer carpeted. The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. As a Hilton Honors Member I was contacted by the front desk to make sure my stay was going well. I requested more towels and they were brought to my room immediately. The staff at the front desk were friendly and check in and check out were very easy and fast. I paid extra with the room for the breakfast. It was well worth it. I got a great deal though AAA. The breakfast without some type of deal is 1295 per person. This is a bit expensive but there was an omelette chef who would cook any type of eggs you wanted. However if you were not going to eat eggs the price was definitely high. The rest of the breakfast was standard food that one would find at any basic hotel. I must add however that this hotel had fresh melon and pineapple which was terrific. The breakfast area was kept clean and well stocked. Now to the grounds the location of the hotel is perfect and close to everything. There was ample pakring and the parking lot was well lit. The pool was very pretty although quite small. There were hardly any lounge chairs for a hotel of this size. I would not visit this location in the summer because there would be no place to sit at the pool. The deck area is quite small so they could not even put in more lounge chairs if they wanted to do so. Also the pool did not seem heated. It was cool and not many people were swimming despite the very warm temperature outside. In addition to the pool area there was a small area with two tables and a sitting area. The problem with this area was people were always smoking there. As a result it was difficult to sit outside and enjoy without inhaling tons of smoke. I have never been to a hotel where so many people smoked all the time. People smoked in front of the hotel so when you came in you were greeted by smoke at the front entrance and then there was smoke on the back deck. I think the hotel should only allow smoking a distance away from the hotel as it was quite unpleasant. However not the hotels fault. Overall I definitely recommend this hotel for cleanliness staff and location and plan to stay again when I am in the area.", "offset": [352, 425], "date": "2019-01-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "096ee720-3cb6-4df0-b6cc-11b1d1181bb9", "sentence": "Always great.

The two conference rooms which were utilized for our teaching were pleasant with warm indirect lighting that did not overpower our slideshow cool and well appointed with nearby restrooms. A major plus of this location is the proximity a short walk of a legitimate shopping mall Downtown with some excellent dining Avocado Grill et. al. and a Whole Foods so that we could stock up on comestibles for breakfast etc and not be utterly dependent upon the hotel for sustenance. That being said the catered lunches were excellent. We must also note that the staff of the hotel were uniformly pleasant and helpful we had like to single out Nancy who was on duty at the front desk when we arrived for particular praise she was a delight and recommended the superb food at Avocado Grill which we devoured with great relish following our arrival from New York.
