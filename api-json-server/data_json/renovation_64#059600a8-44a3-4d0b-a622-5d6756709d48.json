My wife and I stayed at this hotel during the week of February 16 2015 for 5 days. The resort overall was beautiful very nicely landscaped and had very well kept indoor outdoor grounds. Our room was a garden view and older style it was a nice space but the sheets and bedding could use some updating. The tile floors could use a bit of a sweep or mop but all was fine. The staff at Gran Melia was wonderful everyone was so helpful and accommodating. We had a great experience at the Avenue Bar as we were there every night. Selena the bartender was fantastic. She was very personable and knowledgeable about places to go things to do and visit. She made very tasty drinks and made our visits to the bar very enjoyable. The only negative is the restaurants were quite pricey and that there was nothing outside of the resort within walking distance to go and get food since we did not have a car. My wife is very particular with her food and on the first night we both dined at Tempo Restaurant and did not have a very good experience with the food and dining. The good thing is once we found out about room service we ordered from there almost every day as the food was so much better reasonable and delivered within a timely manner. Overall our experience at this resort was amazing. We had a really good time and would recommend this place if you are looking for a very relaxing vacation with nice pools.", "offset": [207, 321], "date": "2015-03-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "1c6b0397-3ca2-4b8b-b04d-ab780029852a", "sentence": "nice but needs improvements. the hotels grounds are beautiful.

Still Great. We have stayed at this property several times before when it was Gran Melia. Just reopened October 2019 as a Hyat resort still great. The rooms were done over in a clean white theme with great king mattress and nice updated bathrooms. The pool area is the star of the show lots of seating and umbelas. We have been coming to this area of Puerto Rico yearly for 12 years and I will tell you the the locals are spectaular people. They seem to to be unfazed by the recent earthquakes along the south coast as well as Huriane Maria. We have met scores of people at the tourist locations like resorts restaurants and shops as well as others going about their daily routine and I have NEVER had a bad experience. The Luquilo Rio Grande area is great with lots to do and easy to get around. Some other island like Jamaica you would not think of wandering away from the resort. Having a car is a must. I special shout out to the friendly service at the pool by Emilyane might be spelled different and our valet Adolfo and well as a new member of the management staff Bertha. so nice. The resort is off the main road PR3 about 3 miles to the water along a beautiful drive at Coco Beach Golf Course. The food at the resort is hit or miss. but we look forward to the local spots like Mi Vida Ekelekua Lluvia. Richies on the road past the Wyndham has a great view and the owner Richie is a great guy and Fredy the owner of Pasta y Pueblo in Luquilo has some of the tastiest food on the planet and is as friendly as can be. A great breakfast spot with great views and awesome food and service is Las Vistas in Fajardo near Seven Seas Beach worth the drive. Have also done may boating days trips out of the marinas in Fajardo and sailing to Icacos island with lunch and snorkeling is the best trip we have done and have used several operators and they are all great especially Salty DogI have been to many islands and tropical locations and absolutely like Puerto Rico the best.

I brought my family parents in laws and kids 6yrs 4yrs old to the Hyat Grand Reserve in February 2020. It was amazing the adults had a relaxing refreshing experience and our kids never once complained about being bored. The staff went above and beyond bringing a great attitude and level of service 100 of the time from breakfast at the Waters Edge restaurant to the pool beach area to family dinners at one of the great restaurants on the property. The staff at the kids club engaged our kids in numerous activities a treasure hunt water balloon fight hermit crab races on the beach movies in the beautiful conference center space with a legit popcorn machine when you include a massive pool and numerous water sports there is so much to do without leaving the property. In addition I took my son to play tennis on new tennis and pickle ball courts and we played golf at the PGA tour quality golf course. In fact the resort is hosting the PGA tour this weekend and so not only did we play a round but we were able to watch the pros practice for the tournament this wekendThe physical beauty of the property is also worth mentioning. Whether you sit in between the pool and the ocean or take a walk down the beach the property blends the feeling of a newly renovated beach resort with a sense of being in a remote location where you really feel away from the hustle of dense urbanization where many of us live and look to escape. This is not the typical Caribbean beach hotel where you are on a beach with a string of hotels up and down with a sea of beach chairs and people in every direction. This experience is the exact opposite. You feel like you are away but the resort has newly renovated infrastructure to provide everything you need. The GM mentioned that they are adding even more amenities in 2020 with Top Golf a new sports bar concept a new gym and spa etc. etc. So this place is going to be even better when I bring my family back next yearI have stayed at hotels in the Bahamas Mexico Costa Rica and have never experienced value like this. I felt like the experience was in line with hotels where I have paid 8010 per night and the room rate is a fraction of that. The rooms compare favorably to other hotels in Puerto Rico that are charging 80 per night over peak times. I found the food to be reasonably priced based on my previous experience. In summary I highly recommend you go and check it out. No need for a passport. Great weather in a beautiful setting with a staff that operates with a great attitude at a price point that I would put up against ANY resort in the Caribbean. You can not find better value than the Grand Reserve period.

The rain forest is a must and is close byWe are a family of 4 and stayed at the Hyat for 8 days 7 nights. Our kids are adult sized teenagers. The rooms have double beds so you might request a cot if your kids are not comfortable. The beds were excellent and the rooms were very quiet. The grounds are spectacular and Hyat was making improvements daily. Work out room was great spa was not open yet but is actively being renovated. A wine shop and golfing experience were being created while we were there. They have wrist bands that act as a room key and advise if you are in the Regency Club that were super convenient. We visited the Coco Beach golf shop drove down to Luquilo Kiosks Fajardo and went shopping in San Juan twice. This was our 5th time to PR so we feel great about driving and are quite at ease in a city anyway. The hotel needs to install towel hooks in the rooms as well as hangers for wet swim suits. Also getting the ticket for self parking validated daily is a major pain. Maybe have a scanner at the exit for the room key. Finally as we paid for Regency Club we suggest a better system at the private pool for access. The attendant let people without club access in for multiple days. We complained and nothing happened. The beach is a challenge. I understand the plan to put inflatables in the water is in the near future. There were a lot of sand bugs and both my daughter and I were significantly bit on our legs although the boys did not get a single bite. We spent about 2 days at the beach so we still enjoyed what was available. We will be back probably this fall. Really excited for what Hyat will have changed and looking forward to giving the 5 star rating it deserves. Staff was excellent pleasant and helpful. They even allowed an early check out as we needed to get back home. Thanks for a relaxing week Hyat.", "offset": [1063, 1140], "date": "2020-03-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}]}
