You can stay in Yosemite Park if you absolutely have your heart set on it but if you are on the fence about it I highly recommend staying at Tenaya Lodge just outside the park. Totally worth the drive in and out. You just get so much more at Tenaya. We visited all the properties in the park and Tenya wins hands down. It wins on appearance price space and service. The drive to the park each day afforded us the opportunity to see wild life every day on the drive in and out. We saw deer buck coyote owls squirrels and crows. The bears were still hibernating when we were there. The sunset was spectacular like the sky was on fire and we would not have seen that if we were in the park. The Tenaya property is extremely well cared for the rooms are spacious and clean. it is worth holding out for the King bed room because the room is so spacious it really makes the stay feel luxurious. You get a living area a wet bar area with a small sink coffee maker and fridge. There is a desk area and small nook area that looks out the window plus of course the king sized bed. The sink in the bath room area is separated from the toilet and the shower which is a plus. You get a super plush robe to snuggle up in while in the room. Big screen TV and free wi fi. Every single one of the staff was sincerely gracious and really made you feel VIP. I asked one of them about it and she said they all appreciate working at the lodge and are proud to be known for their VIP service to everyone not just VIPs. They compete with other properties for service votes and it is easy for them to win because it comes natrualy. I was told when celebs or dignitaries come in they are provided extra things such as special coffee special meals etc because the service is already super VIP and it is hard to top it so they have to provide added amenities to go over the top. The lodge really sparkeled at night with white lights dripping from the trees and it was not chrismas. They had a few beautiful fire pits you can sit around at night. You can take your drinks out there and just enjoy the stars and fresh air. I read that the place looked tired but to be honest I did not think so at all. it is a lodge and it is got that lodge feel lots of wood. it is not a city it is the woods. And even with that the natural accents like granite in the lobby bathroom was luxurious. The lobby bathroom was separated into three large areas a vanity the wash area and the toilet area. It was extremely comfortable clean and large. To me it was totally worth it because we compared the cost and look of the hotel and lodge in the park and Tenaya just offered so much more. Ps all park properties including Tenaya was owned by the same company.", "offset": [784, 902], "date": "2015-03-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "77c605f1-7bd4-4df9-8527-6da341c40844", "sentence": "Loved the quiet cottages.

Hotels in Yosemite near Yosemite do not have to be great to be full as there are so few options. This one is about an hour drive from the village which is not unusual. My main complaint is the nickel and diming of you when you are stuck so far from anything else. Want coffee from the pantry cafe. Sure. 4 for a small. Yep. 4. But you can refill it all day. yeah because I am not an hour away in the park all day. They have bikes out front and a dirt road behind for biking. 3 bikes for an hour. 41. The restaurants they say there are 3 but it is all 1 host and all one kitchen are average to not great. The food was just disappointing. We had free breakfast buffet with our room and the kid and I decided after day 1 that the best option there was cold cereal and fruit and croissants which were shockingly fresh. The hot food was not good. At all. That was in the Sierra portion of the restaurant. The Jackalopes Bar and Grill was where we had dinner 2 nights after long days in the park. One night my husband ordered a burger and fries an asked for a side salad too. 13. For the side salad. Everything on the ap menu was 13 in fact. Actual entrees were 26. This is for a bar and grill not the fancier Sierra or the even fancier Embers. The kids menu had a sundae on it for 7. that is fine until I watched the waiter take the order for it go to the pantry cafe and get it and bring it to the table. Stopped in the pantry cafe all of 10 feet away and got same for 225. Now before you think I am a cheapskate know this I will pay heartily for good food. But when it is basics reheated frozen pot stickers burgers and nachos that are just okay. it should not cost a family of 3 100 for dinner. On our last night we could not face another overpriced sub par meal and when into town 30 min to CrabCakes and had what I can only describe as well priced basics. It was not supremely good I had call it moderately better but it felt good not to be taken advantage of. Oh and the rooms. Sigh. We had ponied up for the cottages. Then we got in the door and U turned to reception to move to the lodge. The cottages are not renovated. At all. They are sad spaces in need of a serious refresh. The outdoor space was a patch of dirt and 2 plastic adirondack chairs. The lodge room was bigger more recently redone is a luxury rustic aesthetic and far far preferable. And cheaper by about 70. So stay in the lodge make sure you get a new room. And ask for it to be as far from the lobby as possible since it is it LOUD in the lobby and hallways. They really should put a set of double doors at the end of the hall to block sound. Pool is nice. Staff was nice though not terribly happy seeming. I just was looking for actual luxury and this is not it. it is a nice hotel but not a luxury experience. Luxury hotels do not nickel and dime you on coffee and water and bikes and make you feel like a cog in the vacation factory. This hotel has about 25 of that experience the outdoor pool and valet staff was great and plentiful and polite but the concierge was brusk and rude and failed to tell us important stuff like to get a reservation for the rafting and the desk staff seemed miserable. I have gone on too long but look a little further if you want luxury stay here if you want nice and get a decent price.

The staff were very friendly and happy to help. The room had a fire in it which was a lovely touch after a cold day in Yosemite. A couple of issues that stop the hotel being excellent in my view1. The resort fee. Having paid so much for the room I would have thought wifi and a bottle of water could be included2. To get access to the indoor pool you have to go out of the changing room and walk around the corridors in your swimming costume just because for some reason the door between the changing rooms and the pool is locked.

We very much enjoyed our 2 nights at the Tenaya Lodge. Everyone who worked there was genuinely friendly. The property is beautiful and well maintained. Our room was spacious beautifully decorated and clean. Beds were comfortable and there was a small fridge in the room to keep milk for the kids. The bathroom was spacious and had a spa like feel. though did not like BR barn door other reviews mentioned. I really like the brand of soap shampoo provided. We used the pool and hot tub everyday. Big enough area to acomodate all the guests using it plenty of chairs. There were some flotation devices for the the kids nice touch. There was also a separate small pool and hot tub for adults only. Bar in the pool area too with service at your chair. Towels big and thick. The indoor pool was big beautiful. High ceilings with skylights. We used it twice even though it was hot outside because it was such an attractive space the water temperature was perfect. It would be wonderful in the cold weather. Many thoughful touches provided toys at the pool complimentary swim diapers for toddlers babies free wash load of laundry pay for dryer. All appreciated. We ate one night at Jackalopes. The service was a bit slow but friendly and the food was perfectly good like any other pub like restaurant just pricier. All of this said the stay was quite expensive.

The extra resort fee of 20 a day covers things that budget hotels include at no extra charge parking Internet newspaper AND the budget hotels throw in continental breakfast. The many interesting resort activities offered are NOT included in the fee. extra charge for all of them. Deli and breakfast insanely expensive. A school lunch sized container of milk was 195.

Tenaya is the closest nice hotel at the south entrance of Yosemite Park. It is the closest nice hotel to the soon to be reopened Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias. It is located in Fish Camp pretty much out in the middle of nowhere. You will be coming in through Oakhurst where there are a Raleys and Vons supermarket. You should stop and get sandwich items beverages and snacks for your room. Why you may want to do this is explained later. We bought muffins for breakfast. there are Kuerigs in the rooms for coffee or tea. We had a cottage room which we loved with safe microwave fridge tv gas fireplace patio. all the accoutrements to make two people comfortable. The only negative about our cottage room was the small size of the bathrom but the water was hot and there was a super air heater in that room. Juniper 519I want to be very precise in this review. I feel that I made the best possible choice in booking Tenaya considering that I had really wanted to book inside. the valley. We drove into the valley 3 days from the lodge and that was really something I did not enjoy as I do not like heights. You are at 500 to 60 feet in elevation on a seemingly neverending series of switchbacks from the lodge and back. That is not fun. HOWEVER. the long and short of it is the Yosemite Valley Lodge AND the Majestic old Ahwahne are very lacking in the room department and crazy expensive. Over 300 to 500 a night for substandard rooms. I made it my business to check out the rooms. Public areas are better and very picturesque in the old Ahwahne but you are paying through the nose to stay in the park. And if your room is dirty grungy cramped or uncomfortabe you will be mad. We had a good lunch at the Majestic. good not great. When I went to the ladies room after. I climbed to the 2nd floor only to find two stalls in an antiquated bathroom not working with a line of frustrated foreign tourists queued up. I exited and went out to the family restroom where I was chewed out by a young mother who had been waiting to change her baby. Hey no problem. but the point I am making is that this is not really an acceptable situation for such a lauded acomodation. Thus for about half the price of a bad room in the park you can stay at the beautiful Tenaya Lodge which has bathrooms from the modern age. People were still using the heated outdoor pool in the 1st week of our October stay although the indoor pool was inviting. The grounds and reception were lovely and well kept. Most of the staff were friendly especially waiters. Shout out to Luis who helped seat us when we had dinner at the Embers and Jackalopes. He was very personable. Now here is the reason for 4 not 5 stars. As you are limited by the nature of the location of the lodge to one of their three restaurants you are kind of at their mercy as to seating time and food quality. You may be given a buzzer to wait for 30 minutes when there are 10 empty tables in plain view. All this time there is a herd of milenial food service workers behind the front desk. um looking down at screens chatting with one another not at or to you. This is guaranteed to make grownups mad. You can say your name is Tom and 1 minute later they will call you Joe. They give the impression of not knowing their head from their tail. They direct you to sit on some rather nice timber slabs to wait for one of the empty tables where your legs dangle like RoseAnaDana not touching the floor. Since the clientele is probably fairly affluent paying around 300 dollars a night one can fairly assume they will not respond well to this disorganization and they do not. First night there I saw one very POd woman in the doorway waiting for bar food. The food is okay but pricey. You are stuck at Tenaya unles you want to drive dangerous roads at night. This is an obvious deal breaker for many people at least to me who spent some time around the restaurant business. Our best guess as to why this occurs regularly is that they are understaffed in the waistaf so they can not give more than x amount of tables to one waiter. So we limited our encounters to dinners. We had our lunches in the Valley eateries and packed picnics some days. We enjoyed snacks and wine in our room. There is a good breakfast at Big Trees in Wawona going towards the valley. Really god just get there earlyish. I would still choose Tenaya over other local options but they absolutely must address the root of the tangled restaurant issues. I encourage the management to send a secret shopper in to assess the situation which has been mentioned in other reviews. Just one more word to thise who complain about price add ons and such. this is a resort. It is a truly lovely property and the value here is so much better than inside the park. words can not express.
