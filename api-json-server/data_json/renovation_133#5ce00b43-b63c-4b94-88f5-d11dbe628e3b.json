Initially we were a little disappointed with our stay at this property. There was major construction remodeling going on beneath our room for the entirety of our stay. No one informed us of this upon our reservation or check in so we were surprised to discover the loud noise each morning. When I mentioned this to the front desk upon check out I was told a front desk supervisor would contact us. They did and she did make our stay right. However my biggest issue with the property is the lack of control each room has over heat or ac. This is all dictated by the hotel as it is an older property. I would not consider a return to this property until this has been updated. Each night is was very hot in our room and we had no way to adjust to a cooler temperature except for opening a window. This should be updated by corporate asap to compete in an area where there are a lot of hotel choices.", "offset": [842, 944], "date": "2015-01-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "642d4db4-a4be-447a-935a-66a13632c192", "sentence": "BEWARE OF CONSTRUCTION.

This was one of the few hotels that can accommodate a family of 6 4 adults 2 kids in LA so I was really happy to have found a deal here. However after a long drive from San Francisco to LA I arrived at 11 pm only to find that they gave our suite away claiming that they do not honor third party reservations and it was my fault because I did not book with Embassy Suites directly. They said our only option was to sleep in a King suite room with one king bed and one sofa bed and they will give us blankets so the other two in our party can sleep on the floor. We were tired and upset and after we raised our concerns and annoyance the manager finally pulled the representative aside for five minutes. He came back to tell us that they have one two queen one sofabed suite that was under repair but it had a loud elevator noise that might disturb us. We reluctantly agreed not knowing how bad the noise was until we stepped into the room. The floor of the hotel suite was shaking every minute due to the elevator MOTOR not the elevator itself being located right next to our wall. The noise was unbearably loud I am not sure how they think they can sell someone a room like this. and we had enough of all the running around and went with the king suite. After all that and settling into our king suite and trying to situate ourselves we had to call the front office 5 times for them to send us additional blankets pillows and sheets so 2 in our party could sleep on the floor. The lady that kept delivering our sheets did not understand any english and kept delivering mattress pads and thin sheets no blankets. We eventually gave up around 1 am and made due with what we were given due to our early morning the next day. The next morning when we were getting ready we asked for extra towels and were handed bathroom floor rugs instead. Eventually we were given towels an hour after we initially requested them as we were getting ready to check out. The only silver lining to this monstrous rain cloud was their excellent breakfast. Great omelettes nice selection of foods and drink and the workers were very friendly unlike their front desk representatives. Tldr. because I booked through a third party Embassy sold my room to someone else and then did not give us appropriate alternative accommodations afterwards leading to two in my party to sleep on the floors and playing telephone to receive enough floor bedding blankets padding and towels. Zero customer service. The blame was placed on the customer at the end of the day because I did not book directly with them.", "offset": [737, 885], "date": "2017-08-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "5c7e823a-fb76-4152-8d9e-5f6d0c9a106e", "sentence": "Warning for you all.

We prefer it over some other four star hotels that we have been to. He loves the communal area the water feature and the sitting area. I love the complimentary breakfast and the managers reception. Just if you go make sure you do not get a room next to the elevators or the air conditioning units because it could be noisy at night if you are a soft sleeper I do not think they could change that though.

Not sure how there are so many great reviews. You get no sleep with the events happening on the first floor almost every night. We were on the third floor and it was so loud we could hear everything. I took sleeping pills and I still could not sleep with all the noise. The lobby echoes a lot so we could hear everything from a man sneezing to children playing to peoples conversations. It was just awful when you want to go to sleep but hear people yelling and loud music all night. The pull out couch mattress is horrible and the mattress pad they give you to make it more comfortable did not even fit. The air conditioning never worked properly so the room was always hot. Each room has its own thermostat but after talking with the front desk they said that hot air is pushed in if it is cold outside or the majority or people want warm air so our room stayed uncomfortably warm the entire time. It was at least 20 degrees warmer in our room than the lobby and hallways. We could only sleep with a sheet and some nights with no sheet or blanket at all. I usually run cold so imagine other people who were with me. Also the air in the room is humid. Every time you walk into the hotel room you have to adjust to the hot moist air even from the day we checked in. The bathroom in the lobby smells so awfully mildewy that I hated using it but with only one bathroom and several people in the hotel room you have to. They falsely advertise free WiFi and made to order breakfast. There is no free WiFi you must pay daily or weekly despite the Google page and Expedia promising free WiFi. I even overheard a front desk employing telling someone over the phone the Information is outdated and they do not provide free WiFi. So the company is aware of the issue but just doing this to make more money. I know this woman was only answering the mans question but just pointing out it is not an oversight. There is no made to order breakfast like they claim. They will make you an omelette to order but otherwise it is a buffet with tasteless eggs and bacon watery oatmeal cold pancakes and no waffles. it is a huge buffet but the food was not very enjoyable. A few of the front desk employees were rude especially the guy who checked us in for just us asking questions or requesting some items. The positives of this hotel. It looks updated and is kept clean. The housekeeping and food buffet workers are really nice. You can tell they work hard and will help you with anything you need. Gustavo who works in the breakfast buffet was so nice and hardworking. Our entire family made sure to say goodbye to him before we checked out. He gets 55 stars.
