This is a older hotel but was clean and the staff was excellent. Bed was a sleep comfort and adjustable but was not for me or my wife. The first room we were given was used as a storage and the staff at the desk made it right and was as helpful as could be. The only problems we had was drain in tub and toilet was slow. Tub would back up while showering and had to flush at least 2 times and one day the door card would not work and the staff on duty that day acted like we were bothering her. The only other thing was room had no fridge or micro wave. Micro wave does not matter to me but a fridge would have been nice. Staff was great in all area restaurant bar and house keeping except for one day. Great location for east side of the city. Easy on and easy off the freeway.

I made a last minute trip and my accommodations fell through so I went online and chose an undisclosed 3 star hotel in Chandler for a deeply discounted rate while on was shuttling from the airport to the rental car desk. Quick and easy. The afordability was key. When I arrived at the hotel it was easy to find and had ample free parking. Reception was pleasant and I was directed to a room on the third floor. The unexpected bonus was that this room and most likely all are two room junior suites. Though it looks like it has been without much updating over the past few years it was fine. Brand hotels have a tendency to mandate new amenities that may or may not truly enhance the experience. This room had a sleep member bed. I tried numerous settings and now know that it is not really for me. They also had an i home alarm clock and docking station that was unplugged. I have an android and most likely so did the prior guest. There are no usb ports bedside so I followed suit and used the outlet for my charger. The main concern I had was finding half used amenities in the bathroom mouthwash lotion. I took them to the desk and they were very responsive. However later I also found sodas and waters in the fridge left by the previous guest. I asked to have the bed changed just in case that guest left earlier than expected. Housekeeping took care of it and the manager even left a voice message which was a nice touch. My point is not to focus on the missteps but on the way the hotel responded. That is key. Each associate responded with concern and made efforts immediately to correct the situation. It is less important to me that everything is perfect in a hotel than how the staff responds when challenges arise. The people at this hotel deserve that praise.", "offset": [1049, 1137], "date": "2016-12-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "99bb7721-0dcb-4e1a-ae3d-e62878b1e083", "sentence": "Staff was great and courteous upon check in.
