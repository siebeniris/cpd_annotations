You know you are in for a good stay when it starts with a fast speedboat transfer from the nice pier area to the resort. The twin engined speedboat ride was great and gives you a fantastic overview of the area. The reception was first class check in very easy and we were in our room within 5 6minutes of the boat arriving. We got the two bedroom beach villa unit 1 and if this works for you spend the extra money for this as it has great views and is close to everything without sacrificing your privacy. The air conditioners worked great the private pool was a bit cool especially compared to the ocean. but felt great in the warm and humid afternoons. The room has everything you want and a good size refrigerator. We had our pick up driver stop at a convenience store to get some stuff before we went to the resort. Not that the resort prices are anything different than other resorts but for a few sodas beers chips candies for kids etc it was worth it plus we got what we wanted. The room is one of the best I have stayed in with regards to comfort music good television reception and excellent wi fi. We had no issue with wi fi. the whole trip. The food is typical Six Senses in that. it is very good very fresh good mixture of healthy food with normal beach food. The Indian Chef Vikram is outstanding so try anything he makes. The resort also has a small ice cream and bakery store that offers free ice cream for much of the day about 10 15 flavors and this is a very very nice touch. They also did not charge me for some samples of the various cakes they made which was also a nice touch. Even if you do not like chickens you should go to their chicken farm and collect eggs once during your stay. It is a hoot to see how the chickens like. the music and love to eat select flowers. There are tons of activities on your own or guided and you are very very close to Phi Phi James Bond Beaches etc so. do not miss that. I would. also say a must do is the hilltop reserve which is a multi room villa on the top of the hill with fantastic views of Phang Nha Bay. The villa is open during the day for everyone to enjoy but at night you can do private dining and swimming and the view is worth every scent. The service is as good as any SS I have been to and their Guest Managers bend over backwards to help. The SS Spa is also one of the best in Asia tucked away up on the hillside it is a great place to relax. My only suggestion is to improve the fitness area which I think they are already doing. The current one is in two small bungalows with small areas. The other suggestion is to fix the cracks in the tennis court and maybe re surface it. I know the heat and humidity is tough on courts. but it is nice to have this court there. but could use to help. Overall it was a great trip worth the expense and the memories from my young son to my wife and I will be long remembered.", "offset": [1538, 1642], "date": "2015-06-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "4b241847-22cc-464d-b4d8-c7a8cf034edb", "sentence": "Awesome location great service but book the Ocean View Villas. When we booked our holiday I was advised to try to find the extra money it would cost to upgrade from a Hideaway Pool Villa to one of the ocean view villas which we chose not to. Upon arrival we were taken to our Hideaway Villa which was everything we had been promised. Great space and the unique Six Senses barefoot luxury style. However I suddenly understood why the travel agent had suggested the upgrade. The hotel is in a stunning location but one which is completely invisible to you from this villa. Early next morning I wrote an email to the GM and asked if we could possibly be moved and that we would obviously be happy to pay for any extra charges. He answered my mail within minutes even at 630am and by the next morning we have been reassigned Beach Villa for a very reasonable extra charge. I made it clear that I was in no way complaining and my request was handled with speed professionalism and a genuine wish to ensure that our stay would live up to our expectations.

I stayed at the Ocean Panorama Pool Villa and the view is incredible in addition to the endless ocean the Hong islands really enhances the view. Upon arriving at Phuket airport we were driven about 15min to the helipad it took us about 10min to go over the safety instructions and after 20min of heli ride with breathtaking view we arrived at the hotel. There are plenty to do at the hotel and we also booked a whole day 7 hours private customized excursion on a nice speedboat to tour around nearby islands the price for the tour was very reasonable and there is a team of 3 people serving us two on the speedboat. I highly recommend a private trip because there is no rushing and you had want to spend more time in certain places than others. Loved being able to pick own eggs from the chicken farm for breakfast the 10 km bike ride into town was very enjoyable as you ride along the ocean the whole way and there are no steep hills to climb.

We stayed at the six senses in Oman last year for 4 days and we had wonderful time and food. When we saw there was a six senses hotel in Yao Noi we were very keen on trying one of their restaurants. We made a booking to go and eat at dining room. We arrived early so we had cocktails in the den. The cocktails were very good but considering the price we were disappointed to see that we did not even get a bowl of nuts to nibble on. We arrived at the dining room and the greeting from the staff was so so. Nobody really paid any attention to us. We ordered the degustation menu for 4 people and a bottle of wine. The prices were very expensive compared to the rest of the island so we expected great food and great service. The wine had still not been served 15mn after we had ordered it. We asked the waiter if he could bring the wine but he seemed a bit annoyed by our request. The starters arrived and the wine was still not on the table so we had to ask again. It arrives 5mn later. Just after we finished the starters the plates were cleared and they brought the main courses straight away. It felt like they wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. The food was really average. The curry was bland and the rest of the food was unoriginal. We ate in a lots of cheap restaurants on the island during our stay and their food was much better than what we had at Six senses. The only dish which was good was the fried bananas. The bill came to THB 780 for 4 people. 4 times what we paid in other places. When we asked for the bill the waiter did not seem to know how to use the card machine. He had to call 2 of his colleagues and it took the 3 of them 15mn to put the card through the machine. Unbelievable for a hotel of this standards that the staff did not seem to be trained at all. All in all a big disappointment.

Whereas sometimes you feel awkwardly enprisoned in super high end places the Six Senses is nothing like this. I seriously did not want to leave anymore. I have been in many high end places but the way this place is run is very clever. You feel that the staff is selected on energy or attitude rather than correct skilset. Every single one of them from you personal GEM to any other staff member feels completely genuine in their helpfulness and generosity. This combined with the reasonable pricing and the quality of their food made me stay inside the resort for three days. This in itself is unique since I always try to venture out and discover the real world outside the pearly gates but in this case I actually chose to hand them my money. Well played. Furthermore spa was top notch daily activities are varied and well executed cooking classes great. Sport wise I had some great Thai box classes and also the gym itself is top of the bill. Not really fit for heavy weightlifting but decent enough for a strenuous workout. tip to management buy an extra range of heavier free weights and you are complete.

TLDR. Our family of 5 stayed for 3 nights in a 2 Bedroom Hideaway Villa and everything was provided for. We even had our 7 month old with us and they had a crib and everything setup for us from the car seat in the airport transfer to the life vests for the kids and all throughout our stay. There were other kids and families also staying in the resort but there is no kids club to leave them at so you will have to be with them at all times. The kids though will love the unlimited ice cream and snacks at the Living Room Restaurant. Big thank you to our GEM Khun Gwen who again took very good care of us. Getting There We wanted to maximize our stay so we opted to stay at Perenial Resort near the airport since our flight at arrived late in the afternoon then we were able to take the earliest boat to the resort at 1030am. I wish I had known I could have requested a pick up at our airport hotel instead of having to locate the hotel staff at the domestic airport which is undergoing some renovation. The boat right was smooth and calm and we were delighted to see our GEM Khun Gwen from our last stay greet us upon arrival. AcomodationThe two bedroom Hideaway villa is huge and the kids loved having their own room and bathroom. Its almost like having 2 one bedroom Hideaway villas except there is no bathtub and outdoor shower in the other room. The pool seems a bit bigger and is not that deep so we were not worried about letting them swim unsupervised. Surprisingly the 2 bedroom hideaway and even the four bedroom one is more affordable than the ocean view rooms. So definitely look into this if you have a big group family. Each room in the villa can accommodate up to 2 adults and 2 children or 3 adults w extra charge. At night we used the cordless phone as an intercom so our kids could talk to us if they needed anything. FodFod was fantastic as usual. Breakfast is the same every morning more or less but there are plenty of options. I suggest ordering some eggs from the menu and some refreshing drinks its all included. Dinner buffet was sumptuous and so is the ala carte menus. We loved ordering the Thai and Indian cuisines from the In Villa dining. Also the food at the Hilltop Reserve is unique also and something to try in itself. They were also able to make vegetable puree as food for our baby and did not charge us for it. ActivitiesIt was hard to do much with a baby in tow but we tried the kickboxing with the kids and they loved it and were exhausted also. Was also able to use the spa and it was very relaxing and worth it. Most activities consisted of swimming in one of the pools or beaches and going get ice cream from the Living Room. It seems they get a decent amount of children so a bit more child focused activities would have been nice as the resort cater more to adults. There were some movie nights but for the movie was for adults and scheduled too late for kids an earlier showing for kids might have been nice as popcorn and a movie on the beach is an awesome experience. Also I heard the telescope for star gazing is no more as the sky was clear and would have been good to explore the stars with our kids. Conclusion. All expectations met kids loved it definitely coming back when we can. Very kid friendly resort but could use a little more kids activities or maybe a kids club. Staff was friendly and great all around. Six Senses Yao Noi is a great resort for both couples and families alike.

Perhaps he had made the wise decision to spend Christmas somewhere elseThe swimming pool at our villa was very cold. If you do not want to heat pools at least supply covers. The room and terrace had no sun after 20pm partly because the bushes had grown up which blocked it. Not much point in sun loungers with no sun. We were not warned that mosquitos come out before it gets dark. When we realised that it was full of mosquitos we found that there was no anti mosquito spray. We tried to book a motorboat for our first full day at the hotel. We were told that all the boats had been booked as the sea had been rough for the previous few days. We booked a long tail boat instead but it was cancelled due to bad weather. Despite showing your extensive range of boats on your website we were told that these were not owned by the hotel. There was no price list and it was difficult to find availablity. It seems your own boats can not go to Phi Phi island if the sea is not calm. At the end of our first day our very kind butler told us that one of your boats had become available for the second day. We booked it for the full day and decided to go to Phi Phi. We went down to the boat at 100 and were told that it was too late to go to Phi Phi. Had we been told this in advance we would obviously have gone earlier.

As usual we were impressed by the quality of the rooms Spa Wellness food and the kindness of the staff. The reason why I rate our stay Satisfactory is because of a major negative which requires all of your attention and improvement namely the beaches. Thailand being a beach destination the beaches of Six Senses Yao Noi is are a big letdown. The main beach really deserves a better attention and could benefit from the following improvements a combing and sweeping at least three times a day removing all the litter that the tide may bring b allowing for a larger swimming area c upgrading of the floating net separation looks like old tyres floating and d have a full and proper beach service towels drinks food much closer to the beach the staff are too far to attend effectively. I find it very telling that in this present Survey you have no chapters pertaining to the beaches the cleanliness of the beaches the services at the beaches FB at the beaches. It seems it is clearly not one of your priorities and that you do not care. At present the main beach is not a cosy place where you want to spend your day let alone a few hours to chill out. As a consequence clients flock to the ONLY remaining alternative ie the Hilltop Pool which becomes very crowded noisy kids and where finding an available sun lounger is a real struggle. After failing to obtain some space at the Hilltop Pool for the first couple of days we decided to arrive 15 minutes before the opening time to secure our sun loungers. It made us feel at Club Med or a low end resort rather than at SS. Not worthy of Six Senses. The other negative consequence that we felt as a family is the lack of space privacy since the Hilltop Pool is where everybody wants to hang out. Sun loungers are one next to the other etc. Maybe we have been accustomed to the amazing wild large beaches of Con Dao where we had the impression of having the entire place to ourselves and benefit from a great sense of privacy. This reflects a totally personal opinion as I am more a sea person than a pool person. Why would I want to travel to Thailand to hang out by a pool. We are lucky enough to have a 50 m pool in Singapore so we do not travel to SYN to stay by another pool much smaller and more crowded even if the view is one of the most breathtaking I have ever witnessed. Instead I expect to find a nice beach where you can swim. Again I think the crowding at the pool can be addressed by turning the beaches into desirable locations and places to hang out. We managed to escape the SYN crowd and get more privacy by hiring a speed boat and head to Phi Phi islands for the day which turned out to be the highlight of our stay. But do you need to stay at SYN to get such an experienceAnother subpar experience was the dining options. We asked our GEM to book us for the special Japanese menu at the Hilltop reserve only to find out it was fully booked again the crowd. We insisted but were given the same answer. For example places like the OneOnly go the extra mile to find a solution and never say no to a customer who is made to feel very special. The following night we headed for the beach BQ which was a total disappointment. Very average food hardly edible sushi sashimi options hardly any side orders to go with meat or seadfod no veggies salads mash potatoes string beans etc poor wine selection poor desert selection. In short a below average experience for a way above average and outrageous price. By far the worst dining experience at SS. I remain at your disposal to share more feedback if you so wish.

We booked 5 nights at Six Senses Yao Noi following 4 nights at the wonderful Four Seasons Chiang Mai and 6 nights at the exquisite incomparable Four Seasons Koh Samui. We are avid fans of the Four Seasons Brand and decided to take a chance on something different this time. Unfortunately those vastly superior properties would be our reference points for this trip and Six Senses simply can not hold a candle to Four Seasons in any category. So where to begin. I suppose I \u2019l start with the view which is what initially grabbed our attention prior to booking. This property gets a ton of mileage out of its stunning vistas of Phang Nga Bay which are truly beautiful from just about any point of the resort. The best views are certainly from what the resort calls \u201c The Hilltop \u201d the infinity edge pool and restaurant complex at the pinnacle of the hill the resort is built upon. But that \u2019s where the problems started for us and by the end of our stay we felt that the premium we paid to stay here was essentially for that view and not much else. Actually before I address the Hilltop let \u2019s back up to the prior evening when we finally arrived at the resort settled in and starving after not eating since an early morning breakfast made our way to the den for a \u201c quick \u201d bite at around 330pm. Except for one other couple the place was deserted. We walked in found a table and. nothing. I had to go searching for menus myself then had to walk back downstairs to the bar to notify the server that we were ready to make an order whenever she had a chance. We each ordered one appetizer and one entree. Rather than coming as such all four plates came out at once almost an HOUR later and my rigatoni bolognese was cold as if it had been sitting around for quite some time. An inauspicious start. The resort also charges 110 THB for bottled water. Mind you this is not Acqua Pana or Pelegrino or the like. This is just plain still water that they put into reusable glass bottles and serve. The 110 THB is nothing but it \u2019s just remarkably nickle and dimey to do this at a resort this expensive. So back to the Hilltop. The Hilltop is only open from 10am to 60pm unles you care to reserve it for a private breakfast which goes from 545am to 1030am. This is only available to one guest per day and even if no one books the private breakfast we were told that 10am is opening time. Not \u201c service starts and staff are present starting at 10am \u201d. You can not physically use or sit by the pool until 10am. I was stupefied upon hearing this the morning of our first full day at the resort when we excitedly prepared to head straight up to the pool at around 830am to enjoy the view and soak up the sun after breakfast. We were told this was not an option. Given that the seating terrace below the pool was inexplicably \u201c closed for upgrades \u201d during our stay despite it supposedly being high season and despite the notion that for guests traveling without young children this is probably in general the only quiet adult zone the 10am opening time and the position of the pool area and chairs relative to the movement of the sun effectively grants you 3 hours and 30 mins per day to sit in the sun before it moves behind a large wooden overhang. So we waited until 10am and returned to the pool area and were oh so kindly allowed to set up our own pool chairs as staff stood around near the staircase chitchatting. This was not an isolated incident we moved twice after this once to a quieter wing of the pool after a large family with young children arrived and once more to adjust to the movement of the sun as the day wore on. Each time I took multiple trips back and forth to move our personal belongings and our water glasses from one location to another and each time staff did n\u2019t lift a finger or even notice as I pulled towels from one chair to another to get the chairs properly set up. Throughout the entire day none of the staff members checked on us other than to refill our water cups maybe once every hour Even this they could n\u2019t figure out I specifically asked for plain water with no citrus and they kept pouring me water with sliced oranges in the pitcher. No one ever asked if we \u2019d like to order a drink or anything else. When we did decide to order cocktails I had to walk over to the staff members congregating by the staircase and disrupt what was. I \u2019m sure. a rousing conversation to get their attention. \u201c Oh you had to move your own water cup and lay out your own towel a first world problem if I ever heard one get over it \u201d. Well. This is where I \u2019l talk about the ghastly pricing for this resort. Our all in incl. tax. nightly room rate was about 350 THB which worked out to about 120 per night. At that price point you are competing with the truly great resorts of the world and I as the guest am paying for perfection. That is not to say I have an issue with paying that much for a hotel room IF the service offering is commensurate with the price. We paid about 400 THB per night at Four Seasons Samui immediately prior to this and it was worth every bit. There every member of the staff seemingly knew our names and our every movement within a few hours of arriving at the resort. There the staff were as warm engaging friendly and outgoing as is humanly possible. There the notion of a guest setting up his or her own beach or lounge chair was preposterous unthinkable. There the rooms are so beautiful so clean and pristine as to make you blush. The overarching theme of our stay and ultimately of this review was and is value for money. The level of service and amenities for the price was just woefully inadequate. That is not to say that there were not certain people who met expectations at a resort that bills itself as \u201c six star \u201d. At check in every villa is assigned a \u201c Guest Experience Manager \u201d GEM the equivalent of a butler or personal concierge. Our GEM was Tokyo and he was a bright spot warm friendly outgoing talented charming thoughtful and willing to go the extra mile to do what he could to make our stay as nice as possible. He was unfortunately held back by what I think are larger systemic issues with this property but he was an A for us. The issue with the GEM setup in my view is that it contributes to a bit of a \u201c not my problem \u201d paradigm for staff members who are n\u2019t specifically assigned to you. GEMs seemed to be assigned to multiple villas maybe 3 5 per person. If Tokyo was n\u2019t available other staff members would listen to or jot down a request and tell us they would forward it to Tokyo who would follow up with us at some later point. Any issues or complaints tell it to Tokyo. Any special requests run it through your GEM. In my experience it is the shared ownership of guests \u2019 wellbeing that differentiates truly stellar properties. The idea that every member of the staff is ready and willing to go out of their way to fulfill any request regardless of how big or small it is. The GEM setup conversely leads to a feeling that you only have one advocate on the property one person who is truly invested in and cares about your wellbeing during your stay. St Regis operates a similar \u201c personal butler \u201d service that has its own issues but I have never been on a St Regis property where I felt such a stark divide between the personal butler and other unassigned staff. The room. First off the water pressure in the indoor shower was so pathetic we could n\u2019t even use it. Fortunately there was a dual outdoor shower and the water pressure was much better there. Unfortunately one of the knobs was loose and would detach every time you tried to use it and in this supposedly sustainability focused resort the outdoor shower just drained straight down into the dirt and foliage beneath the villa. One of us turned the faucets on while the other walked down to the path to get a clear look to make sure this was the case. This was not just a rinsing shower the hotel places shampoo conditioner and body wash outside and clearly intends it to be usable as a full shower. Kind of flies in the face of the whole eco friendly gimmick which after witnessing this I am confident in calling a pure gimmick. The air conditioning unit in the bathroom was virtually useless and the one in the bedroom left a lot to be desired. The resort will say they are \u201c rustic \u201d and \u201c eco friendly \u201d. My view is that it skews further toward dated and dilapidated. There was a hole in the roof of our villa which was a golden opportunity for pests to get in and nest in the rafters. I informed our GEM and the hole was filled but it was too late. We found fresh droppings on the floor every day which the GEM told us were from lizards and not rats or mice. There were 3 4 lizards that seemed to call the inside of our villa home but I \u2019m still not sure whether or not there was something more than that nesting in the rafters the squeaking chirping of whatever it was was audible throughout our stay. The first day while we were waiting for the Hilltop to open housekeeping came to clean the room while we were relaxing by the in villa pool. Despite the preponderance of wildlife on this island they left the door open throughout the time they cleaned providing a wonderful opening for bugs lizards mice who knows what. We gathered our things to go to the Hilltop once it opened and housekeeping was still in the room. When we came back later in the day both the gate to the villa and the door to the bedroom had been left unlocked. I mentioned these issues to the GEM who was apologetic. Afterward the room just continued to feel grimy and dirty and I requested a thorough cleaning it helped but not much and the fresh droppings of whatever critters happened to pass through the room the night before were a big contributing factor. I \u2019m certain the hotel would claim that this is part of their \u201c unique and rustic eco friendly aesthetic. \u201d. I call BS. Holes in the ceiling roof gaps in the wood planks and sliding doors that allow wildlife easy access animal droppings on the floor I do n\u2019t care what your aesthetic is that \u2019s unacceptable when your nightly rates start at 1000 and go up from there. After such a disheartening experience at the Hilltop we recognized that perhaps the best thing for us to do would be to plan a day away from the resort so we booked a private day trip to the Phi Phi Islands on one of the hotel \u2019s speedboats with a legitimately warm friendly and service oriented three man crew. We did truly love the experience and the three guys who guided us led by Khun Oh were fantastic but Six Senses should n\u2019t exactly be patting themselves on the back for this for 320 THB 1000 a trip like this absolutely SHOULD leave us feeling happy and fulfilled. It was really a credit to the natural beauty of Koh Phi Phi and the warmth and friendliness of the specific three individuals who crewed our boat more so than any positive referendum on the hotel personally I think it \u2019s pretty damning that our most enjoyable day by far was the day we spent 50 km away from the property. We ended up scheduling private trips which were very good away from the property on two other days after thisAnd then things fell apart again. We had scheduled spa treatments to unwind after a day on the boat and we were cautiously optimistic that after a nice day around Phi Phi the spa might help continue to push things in a good direction. That was too much to hope for. We checked in and filled out our preference forms which was straightforward enough. We were then led to the treatment room and as soon as we walked in we were greeted with a blast of heat that could send a hot air balon into the stratosphere. The air conditioning had not been turned on in advance and I noted a thermostat that read 32 degrees Celsius as we entered the room that \u2019s about 90 degrees Fahrenheit. We gasped and asked the therapist to please cool the room down as quickly as possible. She turned the air conditioning unit on told us it would just be a few minutes to cool down and left the room so that we could get comfortable for our treatments. Knowing that the AC unit in our villa was inefficient at best I checked the settings of the one in the treatment room it had been set to 25 degrees Celsius with the fan on low. I dropped that to 20 degrees and set the fan to high the only way to get our bedroom slepable to that point had been to run the AC unit 24 hours a day on high at 19 degrees. That was n\u2019t the end of it. The therapists came back into the room and one of them noticed that I had turned the fan up. So she decided to set it back to 25 and put the fan back on low. I immediately popped up frustrated and said that the temperature of the room was unbearable and unacceptable and that the air conditioning would need to run on maximum power for the duration of the treatments. They did n\u2019t seem to understand this so finally I asked them to bring me a robe so that I could set the thermostat myself. When this was at last sorted out I laid back down on the table at this point dripping sweat and suffered through an incredibly uncomfortable treatment. When the treatments finished and we walked back outside I noted the temperature in the room had only come down to 24 degrees celsius. To lead guests into a 32c90f degree spa treatment room is unconscionable and the spa should be ashamed and embarrassed. That these treatment rooms are not cooled down in advance is inexplicable. I informed both therapists in the room of the issue as well as our GEM immediately afterward virtually nothing was done to rectify this. This was probably the most outrageous and awful part of our entire stay. As the therapist ran to fetch us cold water after the treatments ended I pulled out my phone to check availability at Aman and Trisara. Alas neither could accommodate us on such short notice in high season otherwise I was prepared to check out and move right then and there. Our GEM had thoughtfully requested housekeeping to draw a rose petal bubble bath in the villa to wait for ya following the spa treatments but this kind gesture was unfortunately rendered a small footnote to the awful spa experience that preceded it. We booked the private breakfast at the Hilltop one day as we felt that if the hotel \u2019s policy was that the only way to access the pool prior to 11 am was with a full buyout we would play ball. We were tended to by Joy who was excellent despite the order not coming out 100 accurate. The order is made in advance so not her fault in the slightest. We had one order of scrambled eggs with mushrooms spinach onion and bell pepper one with onion bell pepper and Thai chili. We received one with bell pepper alone and one with onion and bell pepper. I was past the point of complaining at this stage so we just made do. This speaks to a larger issue around language throughout the property. The quality of English spoken by most of the staff is just not adequate for a place that is this expensive that caters to high end international clientele. This led to a lot of consternation when basic requests were not understood things like \u201c no mushrooms \u201d or \u201c chopped Thai chili on the side \u201d would often be confusing or difficult to interpret. I will note that during our private Hilltop breakfast a number of other guests entered the area at various points and Joy had to ask them to leave while apologizing to us profusely. This was not a big deal to us after all I empathized completely with the desire to have access to pool facilities prior to 11 am but our GEM was very apologetic and noted afterward that because of this we would not be charged for the private breakfast. This was not something we inquired about or requested and was a very kind and appreciated gesture. The Food and Beverage manager Santi later sought me out and offered a sincere apology which I did not expect but appreciated very much. He was extremely kind and thoughtful and the gesture was meaningful. But this was really an extraordinarily minor inconvenience that barely registered with us especially as compared to all of the other issues we encountered. While we did enjoy the private Hilltop experience very much I felt that on balance the fact that the pool area is off limits until 10am everyday overshadowed the nice experience and made the Hilltop overall much more a negative than a positive. Miscellaneous itemsI could n\u2019t shake the feeling that the property was run down in a state of disrepair. I noticed quite a few \u201c upgrade in progress \u201d signs blocking off areas that seemed to clearly just be shut down for no good reason not under construction or renovation. the free breakfast was nice and the staff in the Living Room breakfast restaurant were quite friendly the ice cream parlor that serves free ice cream was a nice and appreciated amenity we felt that the food and beverage offering overall was mostly good. Issues in that department generally revolved around timeliness and quality of service. In particular the Dining Room was excellent in terms of taste quality and ambiance. the hotel in keeping with its eco friendly gimmick offers bug spray in the villas and throughout the resort that is made from all natural materials. The bug spray was of questionable utility and insofar as we could tell there was not a more effective option available for purchase. The insects here are absolutely vicious which is not the hotel \u2019s fault but if you are the type of person who usually gets bit up in the tropics bring your own DET fortunately we did. beaches are lacking. We had read reviews saying as much and were expecting this going in so it was n\u2019t an outsized issue. Still both beaches were quite rocky the water was murky with quite a bit of garbage and there was a lot of trash on the beach on the pier side. After our experience at the Hilltop it made us feel like staying in our villa was the only viable option. I thought for a long time about how many stars to rate this hotel. It was not all terrible and there were a few nice moments. I went back and read a lot of the other reviews trying to reconcile the overall negative experience we had with the mostly stellar feedback this resort tends to receive. For a lot of people this place might be good enough and for 50 of the price it might have been good enough for us as well. At the end of the day \u201c good enough \u201d is not nearly good enough when you \u2019re paying 1000 per night. At this price point when Four Seasons delivers such staggeringly consistent excellence when Amanpuri beckons so tantalizingly from just across the bay with the wealth of ultra luxe options in the Phuket area and Thailand in general Six Senses missed the mark severely and was an expensive mistake that I \u2019l never repeat.", "offset": [1850, 1900], "date": "2018-05-29 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "bb0c3da5-e154-4a21-9bfd-ca2894ef5201", "sentence": "Perfect honeymoon stay.

Considering the reviews other guests have left we must have been incredibly unlucky with our room or we have just been fortunate enough to stay at better properties.

Each room comes with a pool which is of adequate size and nice to have a peaceful swim in away from other guest. The main pool can get quite busy. However our room was in a state of complete disrepair. I was so surprised at the standard provided by a 5star property I took visual evidence. There were holes in our roof and parts of our roof were duck taped with exposed wires hanging above the shower. There are massive gaping gaps in the doors and floorboard which combined with the holes are a gushing gateway for lizards and other critters. As such upon arrival the room had cobwebs and continued to be festooned with lizard droppings On your bed side table on the bathroom counter near your toothbrush in your suitcase on the sofa everywhere. The air conditioning in the room does not work it is not integrated or eco friendly. It \u2019s just a standard Daikin air con working twice as hard ie not eco friendly to push a bit of cold air out. You will wake up several times in the night sweating. Considering the above I failed to relax in my room even after we had to call out housekeeping twice. After all there \u2019s only so much they can do. The rest of the property is equally rackety. The smell of mould permeates most rooms and being outdoors is your best refuge. The grounds itself are beautiful with lush gardens and a very happily situated property overlooking the bay. But that \u2019s nature doing the heavy lifting. Similarly the excursions are fantastic and a real once in a lifetime opportunity there may be equally stunning scenery in other parts of Thailand where you can pay premium for a better hotelStaf are mostly good but expect minor glitches with service in restaurants. Our designated guest experience person was good although other guests reported that theirs was always checking up on them whilst ours required a bit of chasing around. Food at the property is very good. There is complimentary ice cream all day long which is amazing. It is also one of the few things that is complimentary. We paid half board and anything other than a meal at the \u201c living room \u201d was extra supplement or not included.

The outdoor areas of the Treetop villa we stayed in need some refurbishment eg decking outdoor furniture pool outdoor shower stairs to the villa however it was still lovely just a little rustic and the excellent service and amenities made up for it. There was complete privacy and almost felt like we were on our own island. Breakfast is fantastic with lots of healthy options offerings for dinner are unique everything was delicious.

Let me premise by saying that we have stayed at Six Senses in the Maldives which was lovely and well worth the expense but unfortunately I can not say the same for Six Senses Yao Noi. Room We were room 47 an ocean pool villa. The room had a great view of the karsts. However the amount of gecko and animal feces and dead bugs detracted from the view because you were not able to sit in any of the outdoor areas. We understand this is outdoor eco friendly resort but the simple solution is for the cleaning staff to clean up when we go down for meals or are out of the room. We felt the cleaning staff was very poor and not attentive. Another example of the lack of attention and this may seem petty but we had expect the room attendant to figure out that we only wanted cold still water. However they kept bringing sparking and did not keep it chilled in the refrigerator. There were other little things that you would expect especially paying 1000 a night something that would set you apart from a Holiday Inn. Dining. we got the full board meal plan and would not recommend it. If anything do the the half board. If you are looking for 5star food Six Senses underperforms. One issue we had was a bug and gecko infested dinner at the Living Room. This was due to the table top light which attracted bugs which attracted geckos. Again this is an outdoor eco friendly resort but this is a little more than distracting when trying to enjoy your meal. A simple solution is to use more over head lights rather than table top to reduce unwanted dinner guests. Amenities one big disappointing item is the fact that the pool does not open until 11 am. The common pool has the best views especially for sunrises but you had never know because it is closed. Again at this price you had expect to be able to use these amenities during reasonable hours. Despite the view the pool itself is aging and could use a refresh. Excursions. We tried to book a shared excursion to Phi Phi Islands but we were told this was not a possibility because not enough people had signed up and they wanted to force us into their private charter. This is disappointing because you had expect better customer service for example possibly a discounted private charter. Instead we left the resort disappointed because we never saw the Phi Phi Islands and all it needed was some flexibility by Six Senses which was never offered. Overall the views are extraordinary but that is all this resort has to offer. To put things in perspective the Princess of Thailand visited Yao Noi while we were there but she stayed at an adjacent property.", "offset": [24, 207], "date": "2019-06-30 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}]}
