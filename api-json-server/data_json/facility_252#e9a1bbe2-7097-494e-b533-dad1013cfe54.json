I travel a lot and am used to alcohol in the mini bars but never had seen such a large display. I am a recovering alcoholic and wanted it removed from the room. I called the desk and was told it would be 5o to remove. I asked for the manager and was told the same thing. I had to deal with it unles I paid the fee. I was told at the desk that there was a shuttle available to me that would take me within 5 miles of the hotel for free. 30 minutes later I ask the valet about using the shuttle. He said they did not show up that day. I guess the front desk does not talk to the valet. I was told at check in that if I wanted a coffee maker to call the desk and they would provide one. I called the desk to request one be sent to my room. I was told that they were not sure if they had enough. I asked if I could please get a call if I was not getting on since I was going to bed soon. I was told I would get a call shortly if they did not have one for me. No call. No coffee maker after 30 minutes. I called back and was told one was on its way. I called again in 30 minutes and they said they ran out of coffee makers. A few other items The mattress cover is probably supposed to be down but it is feathers and feels like small sticks.

The idea was for my husband and I to have a pleasant pampering cozy overnight in an upscale Atlanta hotel. We arrived to a lobby reminiscent of an 80s disco dark walls and weird lights. At night it is in fact a bar blaring music. After waiting too long to check in when there was only one person ahead of us we then had to wait an interminably long time for one of the many elevators to arrive. No idea why so long to wait but it was that way every time we needed an elevator. Our room clearly a formerly elegant hotel that was renovated. Sadly it looks like they spent a lot of money but the aesthetic was misguideddo not get me wrong I am a huge fan of sleek modern design which was what had been promised in the website photos. This was instead like a badly done bachelor pad black plastic surfaces in some places the veneers peeling back and oddly phrased bro talk information cards. The bathroom was equally odd and not quite functional as the faucet twisted in its fixture and the shower valve was also not working right making it very hard to adjust the temperature and once finally done was only an anemic stream. At least we got a super comfortable bed thank god. But strangely one duvet cover had been put on inside out. Worst of all the walls are as paper thin as a cheap motel. We stared at the ceiling all night as someone above spoke loudly on their phone between 2 AM and 4 AM. I never write reviews but had to this time.

The hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and is under construction. That was not disclosed to us prior to arrival and was not reflected in their price. They provided no discounts even though the entrance was a dark tunnel with cardboard walls the lobby was makeshift in the hallway in front of the elevators and virtually all of the common space was closed off to the guests. Our room was beautiful and by far the most redeeming part of our experience. The beds were comfortable with nice sheets and soft pillows. Bathroom was roomy and clean. Noatably there was some marijuana on the floor of our room under the bed which had been neglected during cleaning. We had 3 people in the room so we had to request extra towels. Service was prompt and staff was friendly. Because the hotel markets towards a party image the crowd was younger and seemed to be geared towards late night endeavors. The halls were noisy late into the night but not excessively so. There was a low rent makeshift music video being filmed in the hallway one night which was annoying but entertaining.

Only negative may have been the elevators and wait times there but they were cleaning them up and renovating some I believe. Morgan did let me know that they had recently renovated the bar areas.

Reception staff are extremely friendly and certainly will go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable. The rooms are very modern and clean. Beds are comfortable and furniture is in good shape. Bathrooms are roomy and bright. Would certainly stay here again when in the Atlanta midtown area.

The people at the W were wonderful. I had a couple great bartenders at the Living Room and a nice front desk assistant who let us change rooms after I realized we were too close to the elevator to get good sleep. I did notice a few things like the bedside table needed to be wiped down but it was no bigy. The bed was comfy and the big TV was great for laying around watching a movie. My only complaint was the bathroom. I did not like the shower door which was a glass wall on half the shower that could not be moved or closed. The other half of the shower was just open. Combine that with the sliding door that could not be locked and did not really close completely and the square basin sink that splashed water everywhere it we were both not huge fans of the set up. This was a rare staycation without our kids and probably unlikely we would select the W again but not entirely as it is in a great location and a little more affordable than Loews with better bar food.
