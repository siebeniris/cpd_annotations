Base on the pictures I thought this hotel looks great and we needed a heated pool during Xmas so I thought I would give it a try. Disaster. it is cheaper than hotels on the strip of course but never again. The interior decor looks modern but it is filthy. it is hard to see because it is dark decor. Staff has terrible attitude especially the male overnight manager. Our rooms got locked out because the staff who checked us in failed to ask us for a method of payment and so they purposely locked us out of the room for daily resort fee that the room has accumulated. We were out all day and came back around midnight we went to the desk and provided a method of payment then they re key us. It was a very long walk from the front desk to our room and found out the key still does not worked after being re key. So we walked back and waited in line re keyed for 2nd time walked back to the room and the key still does not work. We got very irritated at that moment but no choice but to walked back to the front desk for 3rd time to get re key. At that time I asked for the staff to just go with us to make sure the keys would work so we do not want to walked back and forth for 10th time just because your staff or the key machine is incapable to do the right job. The staff refuse saying she can not step away because she was the only one at the front desk so we asked for the manager. We waited again took him a good while to appear at the front desk with a very very arrogant attitude thinking it was nothing wrong that we had to walked so many times because they can not seems to know how to get their key system works. Instead of a sincerely apology he thought it was to our favorite and best interest that he has waived the resort fee. I told him I wil be more than happy to pay that 25 so called resort fee than having to walked back and forth for 3 times in the middle of the night trying to get into a room that we paid for.

This access is for EXITING the pool only which makes you have to walk all around the hotel to get itit is kind of dumb and inconvenient.

My recent trip to Las Vegas included several different hotels for differing reasons. The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino was our first stop. It gave all the other hotels something to live up to. I had initially booked a room with a pool view so we would have a Strip view back of the east side of the Strip. I received a promotional email that offered suites for a lower rate. Since we would be there two nights and we knew we would have a killer view the following week seeing the Strip from HRH was not as big a deal to us. The bed was one of those Oh My kind of comfortable beds. If you want a mattress you sink into and it just wraps you in comfort this is the place. If you need a solid mattress this would not work. do not get me wrong it was supportive but it was like sleeping in a cloud. For someone fresh off of an 11 hour flight from the UK it was perfect. The bathroom was large and left nothing to want for. It was a little bit odd to have a curtain to draw to separate the bath from the rest of the suite but it was pretty much fine. We did however have a moment of difficulty trying to turn on lights not realizing there was a master switch for the suite by the door we entered through. The sectional couch was not overly comfortable for sitting but the bed made up for it. The in room entertainment system was nice to have but it was a bit out of the way controls were by the bathroom while the aux cable input was around the corner in the mini bar. Hopefully if you try to use it your volume is not outrageous or it is not late at night where you may risk waking people in adjacent rooms. The rooms were not noisy however and I never once heard a neighbor. There is a selection of restaurants but we ended up eating at Mr Luckys for the few vegetarian options they had available. Because we had a rental car its off strip location was great. Although we did not play wanted to but were too tired the Kiss mini golf is right across the street and the Hard Rock Cafe is outside the hotel but in the same parking lot. Because we were in the HRH tower our check in was quick and elegant I have never checked in the non HRH to have anything to compare it to and we even got our room a little bit early.", "offset": [705, 754], "date": "2015-10-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "394870b2-1dda-4ab3-9724-bb655af8645f", "sentence": "Okay if your trip is strictly pleasure but not if you need to use the internet at all. If your a business traveler do not stay here. For a business traveler perspective I had give this score a horrible rating. If it is only pleasure I had give it a an average. The obvious cool thing about the Hard Rock is the rock and roll memorabilia everywhere. Other then that this place is below average as far as quality. The room did not have a do not disturb door hanger so I had to request that. The room did not have a dry cleaning bag and form so I had to request that. The room did not have a coffee maker which forces you to buy a 5 dollar cup of coffee every morning. I know some hotels in Vegas do that. The mattress was okay. They charge you a 20 dollar a day resort fee. This fee is supposed to include the internet. The free internet did not work at all. So that was one rip off. Because of that and I really needed to get work done I paid the extra 10 dollars a day for the high speed internet. It would work for a while and then it would stop. I called the number in my email invoice to find out why. And it was all in french. Another rip off. so I basically could not do any work. I brought an Ethernet cable which I always bring with me when I travel. Plugged it in. nothing. I called down stairs and the woman who answered the phone was totally clueless. She said she would send somebody up to fix it. When I got back from my conference later that day they said oh that does not work any more we switched internet providers.

I was here for a conference everything was great. For people who come here to visit the city I had suggest using a taxi Uber or Lyft as the walking distance from the hotel to the strip corner of the Planet Hollywood is a good 20 minutes walk and trust me you will be walking enough through casinos and on the strip alone. The hotel was very nice the casino area is also very friendly. Make sure you get this They take 50 security deposit for each night you are staying. For example I stayed for 4 nights so they have deducted 200 from my account upon check in. If you do not make any damage in the room you will get back after 7 14 days upon check out depending on your bank. The only two suggestion I have would be to have a scale at the bell desk I am sure many travelers would appreciate it. Improve wifi around the building. The wifi works great around the casino area and up in the rooms you are staying but as you walk from the casino to the paradise towers there are 2 spots one of them is a coffee show that you can not get access to wifi. Also note that if you are not a guest at the Hard Rock Hotel you will not be able to access the internet. I had a great difficulty with that as I had to change my daily limit on my credit card and I was not able to do it until I checked in BUT I could not check in because I had the daily limit on my account.
