Stayed at Oaks on Market on the weekend and was again pleasantly surprised by the service and hotel condition. Hotel was very clean room was very generous considering the price of the room. The only criticism i could have was that as one lift was out for maintenance there was a bit of a wait at checkout time however this was minor.

My one negative experience was being told about the validated parking down the road. My partner and I arrived at about 8PM so it was dark by that time. The validated parking down the road was the suggested go to parking lot for my car over night. I parked my car and found the entire carpark as a whole to feel incredibly unsafe. The lift from the 8th floor of the carpark to the ground floor was absolutely disgusting. There were no lights in the lift. My partner and I were forced to use our mobile phone torches or else it was completely dark inside it which again felt very dangerous. I recommend you redo your parking contract or move facilities to the one right next door to the hotel.

Oaks on Market is a conveniently located hotel fairly close to the main action in Melbournes CBD. It appears to be an older hotel that has at some stage been modernised. The reception area is functional but the staff are very helpful and supportive. In particular Leigh Monika Deshan and Jodie were the ones we encountered and they were all first class. Although the others on reception are probably just as awesome we did not get an opportunity to engage with them. The room check in at the hotel was prompt and we were on our way to our room. The hotel had a bar area and a breakfast lunch area both of which were nicely presented. The interesting part of the hotel for us was the room. Nicely sized tastefully decorated with a good range of amenities microwave oven TV stereo and usual kettle iron board. The linen was fresh and crisp the mattress and pillows were comfortable. The aircon helped to stabilise the crazy Melbourne weather 28 degrees one day and maybe 16 degrees the next and was certainly a welcome addition. Why was the room quality unacceptable. To begin with the TV did not work no matter what we tried including the wall switch following the instructions on the leaflet and pressing any button on the TV to get some sign of life out of it. Needed to call housekeeping who attended very promptly and found a switch underneath the TV which was turned off by persons unknown. All was well after that. After a long trip my wife tried to have a shower in the bath and she could not work out why the shower was hot but cold. I discovered later that the shower arm had a leak and was spraying water upwards which collected on the ceiling vent and eventually dripped down onto her albeit cold as it had contacted the ceiling and a dirty vent. My immediate solution to remedy the situation was to place a small towel over the leak and prevent the water collecting on the ceiling. On closer inspection the bath had a few long black hairs on the side our hair is very short an enormous line of mould along the entire length of the baths join with the wall and along the glass shower panel. Further inspection also revealed an old crack in the bath about mid height which had black encrusted dirt in it. Heaven help anyone using the bath as the water line would be above the crack and you would be sharing the muck. As if that was not enough the cistern ran continuously if you did not blip the flush buttons to try and stop it. Hit and miss and if you did nt get it right at night the soothing not. sound of running water would keep one awake. Why did not we ask to change rooms. We were there for 2 days and had already unpacked and were not going to waste more time in room changes rather than exploring Melbourne. For the room price paid it was disappointing but this is only our opinion.", "offset": [148, 219], "date": "2017-11-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "8acdb36c-7a1e-4606-89fe-4390328c145a", "sentence": "Convenient location and basic property with nice staff.

I spent 2 weeks at the oaks on market from the 13th to the 27th April whilst working in Melbourne. I was very impressed with the quality of the accommodation and was fortunate to be upgraded from a studio to a 1 bedroom apartment the best part was the view in room 1601 a corner room with a simply stunning view across the city and the beautiful Yara river. The facilities at the oaks include a well equipped gym with 3 treadmills a bike stair stepper and plenty of assorted weight machines along with a range of free weights and a nicely heated indoor pool all based in the basement along with a laundry room with several washing machines and dryers. There is a great breakfast and dining area along with a bar and an excellent reception team who were able to help with a range of enquiries. The postitionof tbe oaks is simply excellent a few minutes from the Yara in the CBD with great tram access railway access and in a great location for simply taking in the tourist attractions the eureka building is a 10 minute stroll and five cruises along the Yara accessible in less than 10minutes.
