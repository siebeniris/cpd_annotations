Since most everything was booked for NYE around our home in Palm Springs and we were planning a big party at our favorite restaurant in January we decided to book on The Queen Mary for the New Year. The package for a stateroom and VIP New Years Eve celebration was pretty reasonable. There are also packages available without a room. Needless to say it was a large crowd. The VIP package included 3 cocktails per guest and access to special levels and deck. There is also options for reserved seating in one of several entertainment venues through out the ship. I would suggest one of the indoor venues. We were contacted by a representative regarding dinner reservations after we had booked. We opted for a moderately price prix fix menu at the Chelsea House and were mostly satisfied. In the future I would forgo the sit down meal and eat from the food carts scattered throughout the decks. The midnight firework display was superb. We left the option for breakfast delivered to our room on the door as instructed but when we called room service at the appointed time they informed us that they did not receive it.

I stayed overnight on a Sunday with an inside two twin bed room and tickets to see the Lady Diana Princess of Wales exhibit. I also dined with a female relative at the very upscale Sir Winstons restaurant. 1. Diana exhibit was incredible with they say. 200 items from the House of Windsor. There are items from Charles Diana Kate Wiliam Elizabeth her husband plus her mother grandmother as well. There are alot of static displays which are written well as well as some videos and many many physical items dresses commemorative plates invites etc. My only nitpicks are these a there was no place to sit down until the very end and i was there three hours b Dianas title is DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES NOT NOT NOT Princess Diana. She was repeatedly called Princess Diana in print. They had no control over celebrity items bill clinton got it wrong or videos TV got it wrong. but their own display should NOT have this glaring error. Overall though it was well worth the money by the way HALF PRICE if you book a hotel room so we saved 30 right there for two tickets. 2. Hotel room. all the amenities you need full bath plus second sink outside electric lights electrical outlets. My only nitpicks are these a only outlet in room was across aisle from beds so you could not have a radio in bed plugged in all night to drown out your roommates snoring just saying b the fan was incredibly loud in the bathroom and had no controls the maintenance guy put a piece of cardboard over it and it was 90 quieter. As they warn you the metal walls are VERY thin. The 6 am checkout crowd was LOUD woke me. 3. Sir Winstons restaurant. lovely view upscale ambiance. Entrees were between 35 60. Between cocktails dessert appetizer and two entrees my MIL and I spent 200 after the tip. It was a phenomenal dinner i have never had duck so tender and so flavorful. Excellent experience. I only wished the live piano player in the bar could be heard in the dining area i only found him after the meal on the way to the restroom. Altogether the two of us spent 400 once you included the 20 valet parking selfpark was 12 but we splurged. My mother in law had traveled on the Queen Mary in 1957 so she was thrilled to have another opportunity to board her.

I actually used area restroom towards the stern on the promenade deck to take care of my business and conveniently renamed it myself as the poop deck. The observation bar and restaurants were pretty good. A tour and the history and just soaking up about the ship is quite interesting and good. Overall price is not terrible.

We were schuled to sail on a Carnival Cruise so decided to stay the night at The Queen Mary and WALK across the parking lot with our luggage to board the ship. I had no idea about the history of the ship or what an absolutely mesmerizing experience it would be spending the night. Not enough time or space to explain the history of the ship but it is in the same class as The Titanic The Carpathia and The Lusitania. She is the last survivor. This ship is on the National Historic Registry so any work or remodeling they do to her has to be period and authentic. When you pay for your room it also gets you a ticket to the 4D movie of the story of the ship a self guided tour of the engine room and Winston Churchills cabin and war room. Please give yourself plenty of time to tour the ship see the movie sit out on the deck at one of the the dining rooms or bars and place yourself back in time when you would be traveling across the Ocean in 4 days. Rooms are quaint and bathrons are mostly original. I have included pictures because they will speak volumes. But everything works and is quite comfortable. And best of all NO MOTION SICKNESS.

Other complaints about minimal hot water were also correct. It was not very busy and I am hoping that there is more activity during tourist season. The food was pretty good but not cheap.

There is a lot of history behind this ship and it is displayed throughout its decks. One can not help but think about the separation of class and the different times we lived in back in the day. Upon entering one gets the feeling that the setting was quite inviting. I had heard about the Queen Mary and the Queen Mary 2 over the years and this was my chance to finally see what all of the fuss was about and I am glad I showed up. If you are in the Southern California area Long Beach I recommend the Queen Mary whole heartedly. Pictures and video just do not do it Justice you really have to see it for yourself it is quite the spectacle. On board there are a few options for food and drink.

I was in complete amazement after we spent two nights here on The Queen Mary. Yes it \u2019s old. yes it \u2019s historic but for the amount of money they charge per night you \u2019d think they could and would want to preserve this old ship. The seams in all the carpeting throughout the ship were held together by duct tape. The furniture in the rooms were torn and tattered. The rooms did n\u2019t feel clean. The shower had mold and the bathroom was literally falling apart tile missing gaps in the walls toilets took effort to flush. when they flushed linens were of poor quality. The lighting everywhere was poor. If you \u2019re handicapped or have limited movement this is not the place for you. Absolutely none of the hotel elevators work you literally have to lug your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. I wish I knew this prior to traveling all the way from the east coast. The only elevators that do work are on the outside of the ship. Sadly those elevators do n\u2019t take you to any of the floors inside of the hotel. They had one restaurant on the ship it was crazy expensive. We stopped in the on board Starbucks to grab a simple bottle of water 20 for three single bottles of plain water. None of their vending machines worked. There was a very limited amount of plug outlets in the hotel rooms which made it very inconvenient when trying to charge phones and dry your hair. The rooms had no A C so they were very stuffy warm even in mid February. There is n\u2019t much to do or see on the ship yes they have a self guided tour and parts were cool however we had to walk about 10 minutes up down flights of stairs to get to the part of the ship that was actually the museum. I was on The Queen Mary about 25 years ago and had a great time being there was so much to do. 25 years later I must say that this old ship is truly showing her age and is crying for help repair.
