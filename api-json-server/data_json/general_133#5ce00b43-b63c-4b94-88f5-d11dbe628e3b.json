This is not a place you want to stay. I read all the reviews it had and decided to stay here for a mini vacation near our home. Just to get out of the routine. Well this was a very unpleasant experience. Our first day here we checked in late do to the fact that we have a business and had to come late. When we arrived things were good until we get to our room. We realized they had giving us the wrong type of room. We booked a double suite in advanced and we are given a king. We are a family of five2 adults 3 children. We had to grabbed our tired children and walk back to the front desk. Spoke to Karla the front desk receptionist and boy was she rude. Looked confused so I showed her my phone with email prove I had booked a double suite. Got on her computer without apologizing and gave us new keys. When we walked in the new room there were two beds so we were happy. Until we saw the restroom. No tub yes no tub. This was a handicap room. Nothing wrong with it but I never requested a handicap room. We need a tub to take our kids baths. So we called front desk. Long story short she karla said she would call us back. Well we asked to speak to a supervisor. We spoke to him over the phone and was actually the manager in duty. Well Karla showed up giving us the new keys and finally apologizing but her words were. Well you guys checked in really late we are overboked and if you would have checked in earlier it would have been easier to get you guys a room. I said we booked early to avoid this issues. For my understanding when you book a room anywere you are in other words guaranteed you will have the room you noked. Apparently not here. Finally by like 930 we were able to get our room. Well just to say the rug was wet from were it appears to be the mini fridge leaking. Not good but decided to leave it that way and make the beat of our stay. Karla did try to fix things by giving our kids a bag of snacks and allowing them to pick a toy from a treasure box. Anyhow next day breakfast was great. Best service we had in the entire place were the servers. It ended there because after a long day by like 6 pm we got ready to go for a swim. Well so we thought. To find out pool was closed for maintenance ok a couple of hrs. No all day for cleaning. Wait we are leaving the next day and can not even get in the pool. We spoke to the front desk again Karla and another person but did nothing about it. Manager called to say we were going to complement the room for the night. Well that does not matter that is not the point. We kept hearing we understand you. No you do nt. Staying here for 400 for 2 nights for nothing. We did not enjoy our stay. We had to apologize to our crying kids for not being able to go in the pool. Disappointed in this place. Horrible place to stay. Not to mention the infestation of fruit mosquitos all over the walls outside by the elevators.
