Speedy friendly and informative check in by a receptionist who should be hired to train employees throughout the SPG brand in how to get guests to their rooms quickly while also giving an overview of the hotels amenities. The lobby was smallish but thought had been put into how to divide it up for maximum usefulness. I was upgraded to a studio do not get too excited. this IS NYC and it was a super small studio. The room came with a full kitchen even dishwasher. although in a room this size I wonder how many people eat their meals in. Still for those on a budget it might come in very handy. Free happy hour snacks and free breakfast were also included making this a very practical choice for budget minded travelers. As long as you keep your expectations low you will be OK with the breakfast. All in all I was pleased that this property offered practical and useful amenities rather than trying to present an idea of luxury without delivering anything of substance. Some picky notes. why keep linens in the hallway all day and night and why have a full kitchen in a room with no table only a desk on which to eat.", "offset": [821, 993], "date": "2015-01-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "9a354da3-c5f6-4624-92c9-e6c15f4f8059", "sentence": "The city view the kitchen the gym the hospitality and service of the staff front desk was very friendlyThe choices for breakfast and the length of time it took for room service neglected to bring something to the room at one point.", "offset": [0, 231], "date": "2015-03-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "1cc9c0dd-2456-4298-b432-27910f104e66", "sentence": "If you want Times Sq with some cool amenities this is a good choice.

Ok so lets get straight to the point on what seems to be the biggest issue in these reviews. The lifts. What can I say other than some people must be really impatient. At no point in the 4 nights I spent at this hotel did I have an issue. We were on 23rd floor so bang in the middle. On more than 1 occasion we turned up and pushed the call button and the lift was already at the correct floor and the longest we waited would have been no more than 2 3 mins at a push. Even at peak times such as breakfast. I also fail to see why anyone would let such a trivial thing spoil their holiday stay. The rooms are a decent size for a New York hotel. Full kitchen facility as well so if you wanted to make your trip self catered then you could. We even had a view of the Empire State which was nice there is also a roof terrace with a decent view of the city which we went up to a couple of times would be even better in the summer. Staff at the hotel are all great and do not seem to accept tips. We needed to call an engineer up as my other half had broke the safe. He was there within 10 mins and solved the problem straight away. He even waited to be invited into the room which I think shows a great level of customer service. I tried to tip him but he would not accept. I also seen other staff such as the porters refuse tips. There is always someone at reception counter and a member of staff to greet you back or wish you a good day as you leave. Breakfast is good. Basic but it will give you enough option to leave the hotel with filled up till lunch and will save you around 20 30 per person eating in rather than finding something out for breakfast. We did not experience any issues with it being too busy or overcrowded. We always got a seat however we did notice is was busier after 9 am. Overall I can not fault this hotel. The location is great. Walking distance from 42nd street train bus station and also Penn Station down at 34th. Also there is usually plenty taxis outside 42nd which is just around the corner. There is a couple of Irish pubs on your doorstep. Hells kitchen nearby. A short walk up to the hustle and bustle of the Times Square area. I would recommend this hotel to friend and family and would stay again when back in the city.", "offset": [657, 750], "date": "2016-02-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "811456a2-3c99-4abe-9d6b-831709e5bdc1", "sentence": "GREAT VALUE FOR FAMILY. Tuesday April 5 Saturday April 9. Family of 4. kids ages 15 and 1Read a lot of BAD reviews but gave this property a chance. Have to say it was a great value for our family of four and would stay here again. CHECK. IN could not have been quicker. We arrived at the hotel about 230p for a 3p check in and they had our room ready. Gave us our keys and we went right up took about 5min. NOISE. We were on the 26th floor and could still hear the occasional car horn or siren but overall the noise was not an issue from our floor. ELEVATOR. Boy were there a lot of REALLY BAD reviews about this. this hotel has 40 floors and 3 elevators. We waited about 5 minutes on average for the elevator to take us down usually leaving our room around 830a. When we would come back in for the evening there was at least one elevator on the main level ready for us to board. so no real wait going up. We did however have to wait about 20 minutes Friday morning around 90a to catch the elevator going down. I think this was because breakfast was about to end ends at 930a. and everybody was trying to get down to it. ROOM. With four adult size individuals plus their luggage it was a bit tight not unbearable though. The bath was spacious the shower was very nice and spacious. The beds were not the best a bit too firm for my liking and the sheets were a little stiff but hey nothing we could not deal with honestly we were so worn out from all the walking we almost passed out when we made it back to the room. It was clean with minimalistic decor. FOOD. BREAKFAST. They offer a complimentary breakfast 7a930a. this includes donuts bagels scrambled eggs hash browns egg whites on an english muffin ham omelet on pita coffee smoothie apple juice and orange juice DINNER. Every evening they have Happy Hour from 530p70p which had a alternating hot item chicken spring roll veggie spring roll individual cheese or supreme pizza chicken slider that was while we were there and every night a build your own salad bar plus chips and salsa free white or red wine free beer plus free soda or waterOVERAL. The location was GREAT for us. we used the Metro to get around and the 42nd Street Port Authority Bus Terminal is just 1 block away. I know it says bus terminal but the subway access is there too. This is a main stop for several of the metro trains including the E train that runs all the way to AirTrain which takes you to JFK.

My experience at this property did not meet those standards. Among other issues the rooms air conditioner knocked throughout the night making sleep difficult. In the morning I realized that housekeeping failed to restock coffee in the room. When I called the front desk to ask for coffee packets I was advised to just come down stairs and get some from the breakfast area.

So I chose this place because it was cheaper than the other NYC hotels. I should have first check my Tripadvisor for other peoples experiences most were spot on. I have mixed feelings about this place. There are 40 floors with only 2 working elevators. When we were ready to head down for their free breakfast you can watch the elevator gauge and see the elevator stops at almost every floor before you got on. My room was next to the stairs I was on the 16th floor and you can hear the door slamming since people chose to take the stairs. No that was not going to work for me with a child stroller and all. Both days I was there there was approximate 10 15 wait to get to the ground floor. And when you got to the ground floor there were mounds of people waiting to go back to their room. Hopefully it is only like this on Fridays and Saturdays. The lobby is small. Long lines and waits to check in and for the elevator. The upside to this hotel is that the bedroom was very comfortable and had a stove fridge desk and is in close proximity to Penn Station Times Square.
