The location on the strip is central and our Terrace Studio room was spacious and comfortable. Check in was friendly fast and efficient with a staff member greeting and directing us to the reception desk. The room had a kitchenette microwave fridge pre stocked dishwasher and sink. The only thing I did not like about the room was that all the lights were controlled at the entrance by one switch rather than operating by section. That required going around the room and manually turning on and off the many lights in the room not all of which operated in an intuitive manner. When we were checking out we realized we lost our ticket for our car free parking. The staff walked the garage to find our car much appreciated.

We had a great stay and found the hotel to be clean with comfortable rooms. We checked in on a Monday maybe 2hrs prior to official check in time. Our room was not ready but how convenient an ungraded room WAS ready for an additional cost. Interesting how that works. We opted to wait and checked out bags in the lobby. Small line not terrible could be that it was a Monday. We were given inactivated keys at check in and told we had receive a text with room when ready. Nice to not have to go wait in check out line again. Did a little exploring of casino and grabbed pizza and beers at Secret Pizza. Delicious and easy. Once room was ready we were happy to be on a high floor 33 in the East Tower overlooking pools. Our room was a King Studio Terrace and I was pleasantly surprised at the size. Full size couch desk sitting area small hall with closets and bench that led to bedroom and terrace. Bathroom is large with huge walk in shower connected to soaking tub. Toilet is separated from sink area behind its own door which is always nice. Room was clean. With the exception of the balcony. Stained cushions on furniture along with a cigarette burn kind of gross. Since we arrived on a Monday we were able to take advantage of the Dive In Movie at the pool which is such a fun idea. Free for hotel guests 5 for others. Really a nice alternative to other nights you have in Vegas. As for days at the pool it is not your average pool more of a wading pool. Get down early for chairs towels are plentiful staff attentive and fast. Car rental was easy from the Hertz that is located on casino level. Parking for car rental return also easy. We had a free pass each for Wicked Spoon buffet and it was good nothing extraordinary but still good. Definitely spend the extra and get the bottomless mimosas. The only other meal we had at this hotel was later one evening at Holsteins burgers boozy milkshakes and it was just fair. Nothing I had go back for. End of our stay Checkout was quick and painless too. They do charge a 30 a day resort fee that I think some other people were surprised by. Most hotels have this shop around if you do not like it.

Check in was quick and easy and we were helped to our room with 10 bags between us by a very friendly bell boy. Our room had two queen beds a desk separate seating area a gorgeous shower two sinks and separate toilet. There is plenty of room to hang clothes. The mini bar was fully stocked but we did not use it although I was charged for some items which were refunded. Amenities in the room include TV Desk telephone hairdryer glasses and bathroom products. There are not any tea and coffee making facilities but there is a Starbucks within the hotel.

Not much of a gambler but the floor was adequate smaller than most but it never felt too busy. A good hotel if wanting a more relaxing experience and geared more towards adults couples.

I have stayed at several of the hotels in LV during previous trips there. City Center hotels are my favorites and Cosmo is rapidly becoming my FAVORITE of all. Rooms are nicely appointed. Staff is accommodating. Restaurants are diverse. Everything is close by. The spa leaves something to be desired but that is another story and another review. I really do not like the hotel entrance. It gets way too crowded with all the taxis competing for entry with guests who are parking underground. People walking on the sidewalk outside where you do NOT have access to the Strip continue to try and gain access to the Strip and make it even more congested. Two entry lanes turn into three right outside the main entrance and the entrance to self parking making it both confusing and potentially dangerous. Exiting self parking you are in competition with taxis trying to rapidly leave the space. If you do not have a car this will not matter but if you like to get off the Strip it is a pain.
