We had a corner room on a high floor with beautiful views of the Modern Art Museum beside us and the city. The room was very trendy and quite spacious. The bathroom was a bit dated albeit clean so that was not a bother. One thing to note at least in our room is that the bathroom door is of the rained or muddled glass type. Hence you may be able to make out what your friend or family is doing inside. We had no issues as we are a couple but just something to note. The hotel provided the great smelling Bliss products as well. Grounds. The hotel is located in a central area and we found everything quite walkable. There were many staff members available on the lobby always offering assistance with restaurant recommendations etc. I forgot to print out a sheet for a tour we were doing on our first day and usually hotel concierge is able to help. In this instance concierge had stepped away for a moment so we were directed to use the business center on the 3rd floor I believe it was. What I did not know was that it was an automatic 6 charge to use the computer and more to print items beyond your first two bw pages. I was not expecting that sticker shock for printing a couple pages. We here over a weekend and at night the hotel lobby area transformed into a lounge type setting with loud music.
