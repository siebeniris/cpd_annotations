Very friendly staff and helpful. Concierge made restaurant bookings for us too. Big spacious room. Big bathroom. Great city views. Only complaint with the room was the bed. Have to say the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in. So incredibly hard. Was like there was no mattress at all. Location is excellent. The Sky Train is close by and the Sky Walks too. Definitely want to walk along the Sky Walks rather than the footpath when you can. Covered and away from traffic fumes. You can walk directly into the Central World Mall from the hotel. The mall is ginormous. It is Two floors of just restaurants so great when it is really hot out or raining. It is so big that even staying here for 6 days we still walked past new stores every day. Easy walk from the hotel to the other major malls too. Pool I chose this hotel for three reasons. it is location and star rating but more importantly it is pool. We wanted to be able to lie in the sun by a pool. There are many beautiful looking pools when you look at Bangkok hotels online. But when you look at the tourist taken photos you will note that most of their shots are in shade. that is because many hotels have other tall buildings all around them. Not so for the Centara Grand at Central World. There are NO tall buildings directly beside the hotel. Nothing to create shade on the pool area. There are umbrellas and trees polside if you want shade but plenty in the sun if you want it. Pool temperature is cool though. Definitely refreshing but a little too cool if you wanted to hang out in it. Hotel breakfast pretty good. Yummy pastries etc. Omelette station made to order. Coffee would have to be the best non espresso Coffee we have ever had in a hotel from anywhere we have been in the world. We were very surprised as we usually immediately order machine espresso type coffees because the brewed Coffee is so bad. Not here. They serve it in two portion sized Coffee pots. The gym is well equipped. We used it every day before breakfast. Had to work off the cocktails and food from the night before. Spa we had massages which were very good. Quite a large variety of massage types to choose from. Would definitely stay here again but I will be asking whether they have rooms with softer beds first. The hard bed and I am not exaggerating it was rock hard was the only downside here.", "offset": [2112, 2153], "date": "2016-06-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "94c925a0-b632-4854-a9d2-9821379ce31e", "sentence": "Amazing Hotel and Amazing Service. We had an amazing stay at the Centara Grand. The hotel is phenomenal in fact so good we hardly left. The views are breath taking the pool and tennis courts are spectacular and the location superb. However it is the staff that makes this truly excellent. They could not do more to help. Our bags had been delayed so they arranged their delivery to the hotel with the airline Ruji Rawat from the concierge team was so helpful booking transfers for us and some other friends who were not even staying at the hotel. He went above and beyond like all the staff at the hotel.
