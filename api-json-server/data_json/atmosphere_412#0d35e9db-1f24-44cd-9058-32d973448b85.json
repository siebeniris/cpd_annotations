I just returned this morning from a very special trip to beautiful South Beach FL. I met a friend who I \u2019ve been traveling with for over 20 years. She had never experienced South Beach and I was so excited to be with her for her first visit. Our visit was lovely however The Clinton Hotel was not it fell flat compared to what we were sold by online pictures and calling prior and speaking to the front desk staff. Our shower was broken the handheld water spout did n\u2019t stay put so we had to hold the shower head ourselves while trying to shower. Our toilet dripped so badly it woke us both in the night. Shutting the bathroom muffled the sound but did n\u2019t resolve the problem. The linens appeared clean however the room itself was not it was actually very dirty. The toilet developed a pink ring by day 2 and if proper chemicals were being used to clean it you should n\u2019t see that for 5 7 days. The elevator was very old and did n\u2019t work smoothly at all. Not to mention if hardly fit a couple people and a few bags. Felt inferior by any standard now a days. The pool area \u2026 where to start. There were 5 lounge chairs with no cushions on them and they are made of WOOD. Very uncomfortable. There were two sun beds however one of them had only 3 functioning legs and was slanted. The pool itself was a disgrace it was n\u2019t even filtering so the water of course looked terrible. It was so cloudy I can not believe it had been treated with the proper levels of chemicals. I \u2019m a pool owner myself and I know what it takes to keep a gorgeous pool and that \u2019s not it. The \u201c happy hour \u201d. oh my. My friend watched as the bartender took the almost empty vodka bottle out of the bar area and filled it with water. That \u2019s embarrassing you as an establishment anywhere let alone South Beach 3 blocks off the water. We purchased a top shelf vodka cocktail after that and for 2 very small very ice filled and much less vodka used compared to the very heavy \u201c happy hour water vodka \u201d we \u2019d received that set us back 30. I \u2019m guessing they were in a 6 oz plastic cup. Tacky. I could have had better amenities had I hosted my friend to my home and saved a ton of money. Friday evening there was a comedian on the pool deck and Saturday morning into afternoon the pool area looked like there had been a frat party. Nothing was clean cigarette buds everywhere furniture out of place just an absolute wreck. That \u2019s disgraceful and should be unacceptable by any business. The sad part is the staff was great. They are doing the best job they can with the direction they are getting from the upper management. Great location and could be making a whole lot more money if they got it together. We were disappointed to say the least. If we did n\u2019t leave this morning at 5 am I would have spoke to a manager but I certainly did n\u2019t feel after seeing how cheaply things were done that anything would have been corrected on our room charges. Save yourself a headache and DO NOT STAY here. Tacky Tacky Tacky. I am a grown up if I choose to pay 30 for cocktails it had better be in a proper glass and a cocktail straw available.

The pictures are misleading the hotel is small and not that nice the pool is TINY more like a jacuzi and lets just say it is not somewhere I would want to hang out or swim in.

The restaurant is shut down or under renovations or something so there was no breakfast.

I only used this credit card at the hotel so there is little doubt in my mind someone at the hotel made this fraudulent charge. When I called the hotel to discuss the 100 dollar charge I was given the run around. I was told they could not find my record that I stayed there two days before I called them. I was told I needed to give them my room number otherwise they could not help me. I can not imagine why they could not find it with my last name. I told them I remember seeing my last name was incorrectly spelled on my receipt at check out so they should check different spellings of my last name. They went on to tell me I must have misspelled my name when I registered online. Funny because I called to make the reservation. Once I told them that they had no response. After finally finding my name I was asked what again what I needed help with. I had already explained I had been incorrectly charged on my credit card. I was then told I would need to call back the next day to talk to the manager to discuss this. Really I spent 30 minutes trying to help you find my record to just tell me you can not help me. Needless to say I was very upset and let the person know I did not appreciate the way I was being treated. They hung up on me. I called back and was repeatedly hung up on as they probably have caller ID Finally I was able to get through to the same person and ask her what I needed to do to get this resolved. I could not believe how I was being treated but I took the managers name and called the next day only to be put on hold forever. so I called back many times to try and speak with someone but was put on hold each time. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. As for the experience in the hotel room The room was clean and had a nice design but the walls were paper thin and we had terrible neighbors who were up all night until 5 am. I understand it is South Beach but 5 am is late anywhere. I could not sleep to say the least. The 28 dollar valet was a joke. I had to parallel park my own car in front of the hotel in a space barely large enough to fit the car. Another guest helped me squeeze into the space. The next day when we gave the valet the ticket to bring the car I noticed he grabbed the wrong keys. I told him those were not the right keys. he looked at me funny so I trusted he knew something I did not. We waited 15 20 minutes only to see the wrong car show up out front. I could not believe it they brought us the wrong car after I told him what type of car we were driving. Ten minutes later our car finally arrived. What did I pay 28 dollars for.

The bathroom smelled terrible to include cigar smoke smell there was a privacy curtain in the bathroom that was dirty. The bed was sunken in and the view from the room was awful.
