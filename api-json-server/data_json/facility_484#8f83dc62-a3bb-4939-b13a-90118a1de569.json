Beautiful hotel and rooms. The lobby is like walking into an English bed and breakfast. On our first night the hotel bar was great. I had the best chocolate martini ever. Second night bar service was lacking. Took ten minutes to order a drink. We waited half an hour to order food but no one waited on us and we were sitting at the bar. The hotels location is awesome.

My sister and I stayed here in December and we had a fantastic experience. Check In. Our flight was early in the morning so we arrived at the hotel before the normal check in time. The front desk staff was very accommodating and was able to get us into a room right away. The process was fast and easy no issues. We were given our wifi password and off we went. Staff was always friendly and welcoming whenever we passed them. Room. Our room was the Superior Double Queen and was unusually large. The room was located right next to the elevator but we never heard any noise at all from outside our room so great job on the insulation. The decorating was not exactly my style but the comfort and size more than made up for that. The room features a large bathroom with a double sink and shower bath tub combination really can only be used as a shower. The toilet was a little industrial for my liking but still a great bathroom they have a hair dryer and Molton Brown products. The room features a Keurig coffee station as well as a desk area and a sitting room area in addition to the 2 queen beds. We did not have a view but I did not need one. There is an iMac tv which was a little confusing but we got the hang of using a keyboard to stream Netflix off the internet. The beds were extremely comfortable and we were provided with a good number of pillows and blankets linens. We had to unplug the some things to plug in our cell phone chargers so I guess my only suggestion would be to add some more plugs to the room or bring something that charges multiple things at once. Service. Housekeeping staff did a phenomenal job. We had forgotten to pack some toiletries so housekeeping made sure we had exactly what we needed. They touched our room 2x a day with morning cleaning and then evening turn down service. We simply turned on the room needs cleaning button by the door on the way out of our room each day. Room service was able to provide us with plates and utensils when we ordered food into our room one night and they were fast and friendly. I only wished they had a large light night food menu. When we needed to check out the bell staff was able to hold our luggage until our flight. And when our flight was cancelled everyone worked with us to get us back into the room we had just checked out of and get our luggage returned to us. The Talbot Hotel staff really saved our day when we were unexpectedly stuck in Chicago for another day. The doormen were always friendly and made sure that we had access to transportation in the fastest way possible. If it was not for them we never would have made it back to the airport in time. We were provided with a number to text if we needed anything at all. The customer service went above and beyond at every level. I would recommend the Talbot Hotel to anyone staying in Chicago. Located in the Gold Coast it is an easy walk to Michigan Ave restaurants bars groceries drug stores and transportation.

My husband and I visit Chicago at least once a year and we have stayed at a variety of hotels. I found a deal for the Talbot on Jetseter and our stay was fantastic.

We upgraded to a deluxe room which was beautiful and very large with a sitting area. Sumptuous Frete linens and Jonathan Adler toiletries added to the experience. The only slight negative was their in room coffee service. there is a Keurig setup with coffee and decaf but I had to ask the maid for tea. She was very accommodating and brought it quickly.

Where do I even begin. Check in was appalling. The Talbot had called in a young woman to work the front desk who when approached told us she did not know any of the standards of the hotel as she did not normally work there. My partner and I both had security restrictions on our cards and delayed our check in but were treated terribly by a condescending man that later came to the young womans aid. They told us they would not allow us a room without a card for incidentals which is understandable but would not even allow cash payment for our stay when we provided a working card. Not only this but when my partner and I stepped aside to call our banks the young woman at the desk then told other checking in guests that we were at that point in time unable to pay for our room. Shameful professionalism really. When we finally got upstairs the room was clean and well kept and this was great for us since we had flown over 9 hours from a different part of the world for our stay. This was pretty much the only pleasant constant that we had from our experience. We were grossly awoken the following morning by construction that we were not notified of prior to our stay. We had rigorously checked Expedia as well as the hotels website for information about the space before we booked. If we had known that this was happening we would not have considered staying here. In addition we discovered shortly after that the elevators were hardly operable. There was a single easily overlooked sign that was placed adjacent to the main elevator that advised to use the stairs if there elevator was not coming. Our room was almost on the top floor of the hotel and I am 45 months pregnant. Not to mention that there were probably a number of other guests in the hotel that faced limited impaired mobility. At times we waited upwards of 5 6 minutes to get downstairs and elevators were so packed with other guests we had have to continue to wait for the cars to come back up again. Painful. Literally. When we returned one of the days of our stay we noticed that housekeeping had used our belongings. My partner had left his cologne on the counter and when we returned our room and the hallway smelled very strongly of the fragrance. He did not wear any cologne that day and the cap was removed. Some of my makeup was missing or presumably thrown away. Wtf. The second day into our stay it became obvious that I was going to need additional pillows to sleep with to support my pregnant body. We called down FOUR times over the course of TWO DAYS to complete this request. When someone finally arrived he was rude and grumpy and left quicker than he came. No urgency in the matter a piss poor attitude and nary an apology for the delay to boot. Yikes. On the final day of our trip after an evening of trying to figure out how our Jacuzi tub which did not work turned on we decided to call for a late check out at 3 pm as our departure we were due for the airport at 4ish pm. When I called downstairs they confirmed that there would be a 30USD charge for such which was agreed to and that we were okay to go. When we went down to re activate our cards for extended stay the same man from check in was there to greet us. He then proceeded to tell us that we could not check out later because the rooms were all full for the evening and sent my partner back upstairs to retrieve all of our belongings. In this moment it dawned on me that we had already paid the charge and that we had been told we were able to extend. I sent my partner back to the man at the desk to make him aware of this and clear the confusion as we would NOT be leaving early if we had been charged. He said that our room was in fact accounted for late check out and that we would be able to leave later. Upon returning to the hotel around 2 pm we went up to our room and our key cards did not work. Yet another wtf. moment. After reaching out to the front desk team three times to resolve such a simple process this was totally unacceptable. All in all the location was outstanding for us and the food at the restaurant downstairs was delightful. Everything else which really boiled down to comfort reliability customer service and amenities were lackluster to say the very least. Leaving was the easiest part of the trip. There are dozens of other hotels in the area and I seriously wish I had booked with one of them. Even a chain hotel would have been better with standards they are expected to adhere to. This place is wildly overrated.
