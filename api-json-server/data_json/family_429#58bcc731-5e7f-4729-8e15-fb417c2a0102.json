First of all my apologies because this review for the Plaza Athene Bangkok is a little late we stayed in back in November 11 2014. I thought I had written up all our Thailand Trip Advisor reviews however we just came back from Belize and I noticed while doing my Belize TA reviews that several of my Thailand reviews are not posted so I must have not submitted themWe wanted to make sure that we submitted our review for our last stay at the Plaza Athene because it was another fabulous stay. As always from the reservation check in check out and another check in and check out. everything was handled very efficiently and staff was greatThe PA was also helpful because we had signed up for the Cooking with Po class which we also highly recommend. which is from 830 am to about 2 pm. We arrived at the PA around 730 am and the PA was able to securely store our luggage for us before checking in so that we could go to the class. When we returned to the PA after the cooking class we were escorted upstairs to the Le Royal Club Lounge to check in which is a nice perk for SPG Platinum members. Check in was friendly and efficient but we did miss Nat one of the former employees who was always so helpful but she is now studying abroad. We were upgraded to a suite which was nice and spacious. Unfortunately it was not refurbished yet so it looked a little dated but was still comfortable. There is construction going on as the PA refurbishes their rooms so we are sure that the rooms will be great when it is all done. We did not hear any construction noise during the daytime. Housekeeping staff was friendly and efficient and we enjoyed the night time turn down service and little desserts in the evening and the fresh fruit bowl during the day. Also the wi fi speed at the PA is also greatThe PA probably has one of the best breakfast buffets in Bangkok or probably most Starwod chains. Large assortment of delicious hot and cold or made to order Western Asian Indian dishes fresh fruits juices pastries etc. Restaurant staff was always accommodating and when I wanted to have an iced coffee they brought over an extra glass with ice and poured my hot coffee over. The staff in the lounge was helpful and we enjoyed the afternoon tea and evening cocktail and appetizers. On a prior stay my husband had met and spoke with the GM to compliment the hotel and staff. On this trip we saw the GM around the lounge talking with some of the employees but she seemed busy so we did not want to interrupt them. We stayed at the PA for 3 nights and then went to Phuket for a week and returned to stay at the PA for a couple more nights. The PA was able to hold two of our large suitcases that we did not need while in Phuket and brought them up to our room when we checked back in the second time. The only glitch and so minor because they figured it out and corrected it immediately in our stay was on our final checkout. We had an early 7AM flight out of BK and since we were leaving so early and would miss the great breakfast the staff in the lounge kindly offered to have two breakfast boxes ready for us at check out. But when we checked out it was not ready or there was a mixup. However they realized their error and corrected it right away and packed two boxes immediately for us to take which was very nice. Another great stay. Would highly recommend staying at the PA for great staff service rooms food and location. We will return.", "offset": [2407, 2544], "date": "2015-08-26 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "f571548d-4da6-4220-bca4-a0a22b712886", "sentence": "Very good as usual.

Firstly the service staff at this hotel is second to none. It has exceeded what you normally get from a 5 stars hotel. Room 810 We were greeted and personally walked into our room by 2 front desk staffs. The room is spacious extremely clean just like a newly renovation room especially the toilet. The room were not 100 prepared and air conditioned as it should when we arrived and explanation was that they have given us a better room in a different level which it was not suppose to be our room. That s fine. I am ok with that but if it was air conditioned and prepared with aromatic candles etc would be perfect. Shower strength is great hot water is instant one of the best we have had. Only downside is that there was a slight moisture at the entrance area of the room but you can not sense it in the room just the area near the door not sure the reason I am sure they would have given us a new room if we ask it got better over the stay. House keeping 1010 Excellent. Probably did the best job in compare to other hotel we have been to. Attention to details. Tidy the room for us without misplacing things that you have on table in the toilet. They have also fold us a pair of swan in a heart shape with flowers it was beautiful. Well done. Sorry that I forgot to leave you tips. Just want to say your team did an excellent job. Bell Service 1010 Staff were attentive helpful and courteous. I have been to 3 other 5 stars hotel in this trip the only bell service comparable is St Regis but I still think that Plaza Athene is even better. thanks to the friendly staff at the door. One highlight I must share with you all is that we had bought a painting from a local Artist and it was store along with all my other luggage in the room behind the front desk. There was a small mix up when we transfer the luggage from the room to the taxi partly my fault as I should have checked before we left the hotel and so the result is that we left the painting at the hotel and it was too late when I realised that 30mins later. What surprised me is that the hotel staff has already has already send another taxi chasing us down at the hotel to deliver us the missing painting before we even call them. A professional staff was waiting for us at the Hotel to brief us the situation and helped us with luggage and check in. Painting arrived 15mins later and brought to us safely by Plaza Athene staff. Excellent recovery and this is the moment I witness the difference between an outstanding hotel and a normal hotel. Restaurant. 6510 Buffet Breakfast is only so so. We have not tried other restaurants inside the hotel. There are rooms for improvement especially the Egg station dude needs to learn how to do proper scramble eggs. Service of the restaurant is excellent. Pool 810 Beautiful pool I would love to enjoy a few more days here at the pool if it was nt raining. Gym opens 24hr this is excellent and make sense. 1010 Guest wish to go to gym at their own time due to jet lag. This is well thought out. Location 910. There are traffic jam everywhere in Bangkok. So choosing a good location is important. Hotel is located mins walk from major shopping Mall and skytrain. it is in the middle of everything the good thing is that its close to everything else but also because it is in the middle it is not easy to get by the traffic. Wifi very fast and easy to connect. 1010 In summary one outstanding hotel.", "offset": [1418, 1564], "date": "2016-08-16 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "00dbc736-0afe-4753-a23f-21777a75e885", "sentence": "Stolen items inside my room during my stay at this hotel.
