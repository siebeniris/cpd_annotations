Arrived at the Riu Palace late afternoon and first impressions of the hotel and gardens was excellent and this carried into the reception. Check in was very quick and the staff could not do enough for you. Once we arrived at the room yet again was very impressed and was spotlessly clean and well presented and the bags arrived promptly. Having looked around the grounds this hotel promised everything in the brochure. The bar service was excellent and all staff are extremely polite and very efficient and maybe the best service i have ever had. The food in the main buffet restaurant was very adequate but very repetitive but do not get me wrong you could always find something to eat whether it be breakfast lunch or dinner. The Al Carte restaurants was very hit and miss. The Brazilian restaurant was a meat lovers delight but not for vegetarians but the best of the bunch was the Krystal but the food could have been hotter. As for the steak house it was the worse steak i have ever eaten and as for the Japanese Restaurant i would not even bother but do give the Italian a go. The swim up pool bar can get very loud and for the size of the hotel it could and should be bigger and needs just a little bit of TLC but if you do not want to get off your sunbed the pool and beach service is fantastic. now onto the evening entertainment it is very hit and miss but they do try very hard but i have been to 5 Rui Hotels before and found that the entertainment was much much better. If you are bit of an night owl you will be disappointed as once the show is over there is nothing else to do. You can go to the 24 hour sports bar but that is even quieter. Top Tip if you want branded drink you will have to ask for it or you get the local rubbish. Here comes the but i would say that this hotel is not geared up for the British more for the American and Spanish market. A few minor bits need maintenance work but this is still a great hotel and the service was second to none and you will not be disappointed. I would recommend the Helicopter trip as you will see them flying over the beach all day long fantastic trip and value for money.", "offset": [1622, 1684], "date": "2015-02-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "fbeeac5a-53ce-4b4e-aede-ec9609213798", "sentence": "Absolutely Amazing. Me and my fianc\u00e9 visited this hotel for 2 week. The last week in October the first week in November. We met numerous other couples families who were English American Canadian who ALL loved this hotel. There was so many amazing memories it would take me all day to write about them. Just let me put it this way we want to get married here in 2017The main pool and the smaller pool were cleaned every single morning between 730 830. Yes there was LITTLE seaweed on the beach they cleaned the majority but why would that spoil anyones holiday. There still beautiful. The rooms smelt like damp for the first 10mins of being in there your in the Caribbean it is humid what do you expect. They were cleaned daily checked that the clean was done twice a day. The fridge was always stocked up fresh water. There was alcohol dispensers which were always full. All the restaurants were lovely. I did not enjoy the Thai just because I do not really like sushi the Italian messed up our order so we went buffet. The matter of the fact is that did not bother us because it is not the end of the world. SAMY SOSA is the best cocktail there EVER. The weather was beautiful rained around 4nights over night but that did not bother us rained for one day but we was out for a horse riding trip so we missed it. We went to coco bongo bought it of the guys on the beach wow the night was mint. Went went to saona island this is a MUST the most beautiful island ever can pick up starfish the waters that is clear.

Now i always go to the caribbean for 2 weeks as there is no where else i would rather be. I have been to Jamaics the last 2 times and stayed at the riu palace. So here is my reviewThis place is paradise i am 23 and celebrated my birthday out there the resturant was decorated and the staff were so lovely and kind and arranged a cake for me. The romsOn arrival we was given a double bed but needed a twin they sortes this within 5 minutes and moved us to a nicer room. The supervisor even called us to check everyone was ok and that we were happy and they apologised. Yes the rooms are a bit dated but you are in the caribbean what do you expect. It gives it more of a caribbean feel to the holiday experience. The maids did annoy me sometimes as they were are always trying to clean the room at 10 am and i would be in bed but that was my fault for partying everynight so i can not complain hah. Mini bar restocked. Room service was amazing and quick. Nothing was stolen as we used the safe. It really annoys me when people complain about money being stolen when it was not in the safe. Use common sense. The food was repetitive but saying this i always found something i liked or wanted. We tried all the restaurants with the Krystal and brazilian being my fave. The WiFi is shocking the worst i have ever experienced which was a bit stressful but i managed withdrawals hahaThe bar stafd are amaze especially in the sports bar they put up with a lot of rowdy people and have to work long hours. The shuttle to pacha was always reliable and the nightclub is good yes you have to pay for drinks which cost about 5 but you just drink before you go. The staff here are so nice as well. The language barrier is not actually that bad. Just try to understand and use spanish and they will try for you it works both ways. I made it through 2 weeks with no problem at all. The beach is beautiful and a nice breeze however we spent everyday at the pool as it was fun. The entertainment is good with a lot of activities in the day and then a kids disco folowd by dancing and a show. On Thursdays the show is at Caribbean street which is really good. The entertainment team work at all 5 hotels and work hard and i think people forget how hard all these people work so that we can have a good holidayI went to the bambu a lot as well which is more or a party hotel however both hotels have alot to offer for the younger crowd. I did two trips santo Domingo and sanoa island. Both good trips and long days but it was nice to get out and see more of the island. Take dollars as they do not acpet pesos at the airport. I really did have the best 2 weeks and it is hard not to compare it to other rius however i really believe this hotel is one of my faves. I really can not wait to go back to one of the 5 hotels in the riu complex as it was a holiday i will not forget.", "offset": [1277, 1508], "date": "2016-07-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "17ebd8ea-6f08-434a-987d-0e7acbd549cb", "sentence": "Spent a week here during July of 2016. All in all not a bad place. Could use some minor tweaking and polish. A few minor annoyances but nothing that was a deal breaker. Some of them are. only one room KEY. I say key as this is what they use now instead of key cards. An antiquated room safe with a again key lock. The check in was a bit disorganized as they originally could not find the keys for our group of 20 10 rooms. It turns out they had set them all out on a separate table to do a welcome party for us. Unfortunately we were all arriving at separate times. No big deal though as once they discovered the problem more of us showed up. This is an older resort so some of the polish has worn off but still a nice well kept place. The food at the buffet was plentiful and for the most part was good. This was not 5 star cuisine but it was better than some resorts I have been to. The restaurants were good though. Again not 5 star but good. At the steakhouse do not expect a true NY strip steak even though the menu has it on it. I will not call it dog food but I have had better. I did try the Angus burger one night. Not angus but not real bad either. The bar tenders in the sports bar and the lobby bar know their job and understand how to earn tips. They were always ready to serve you and made the drinks well. The lobby bartender can not remember here name. after 3 days knew what drink I wanted when I got down there to meet my party before dinner and had it waiting most times as I got to the bar. tip her well she earns it. The pool bar is just a feeding frenzy for the most part as it is the only place at that end of the resort to get a drink. The guys hustle and you do not wait too long to get a drink. American money seems to be the currency of choice here. Most stuff in the little shops is priced in US dollars and my sister in law the negotiator was able to make some deals. Bring plenty of cash as this entire country runs on tips and the cash machines only dispense DR peso is. Make sure you have small bills too. It took me some time to figure out how to get change for a 20. The front desk sometimes has it but not always. I did manage to get 5s which I then was able to get 1s from a bartender so I could continue to tip. 1s are usually adequate for drink orders. The nightly entertainment was OK not great but OK. Different stage shows each night. Some a bit lame and some very entertaining. All in all the staff seems very friendly. Even the room maids always had a smile and greeted you of course they know where the tips come from. We brought some childrens toys and coloring books and crayons for them as well as they are a poor nation and the kids there do not have much20 worth of toys for their kids goes a long way for them and they seem to genuinely appreciate it.

My father graciously surprised us with a last minute trip to Riu Palace DR. None of us had stayed at a Riu before but are regulars to Mexico and Dominican Republic. It was 4 people in all my father my son myself and my boyfriend. After landing in DR and a fairly short drive to the hotel we were at the Riu Palace. it is gorgeous. The grounds and the architecture are beautiful. you will never see an wilting shrub. With the Palace booking you have privileges at the other Riu hotels but not the other way around. One day we ventured down to the Riu to the right of our hotel BIG mistake the pool was overly crowded the bar was PACKED and the entire pool area had a cloud of cigarette smoke hovering. It was clear to see that the Palace had a superior level of accommodations. Our rooms were nice. Nothing to write home about strong air conditioning but the bed linens were just narrowly acceptable. Always clean but not necessarily desirable flat pillows thin sheets. The cleaning women were amazing they leave the most beautiful towel designs in the room they use the flowers from the shrubs which are great however if you return to your room later they are wilted and dead can not fault their effort. The pool was smaller than the photos let on but it was great. Never too crowded and the swim up bar was never so packed that you had to stand two bodies deep and shout your order. Temperature was great and it was always clean. Beach was beautiful no seaweed and no rough waves. There are servers on the beach to take your order but a beach bar would be perfect. Note this is a resort where you MUST reserve your seats early in the AM unfortunately. There were days were I saw premium seats that were reserved ALL DAY with no one sitting in them. Completely frustrating. I witnessed other guests removing and sometimes stealing towels and taking the better seats. If you are going to place a towel down place something personalized on the seat such as a book or a hat and if you do not plan on using it before noon have enough respect to sit elsewhere. There was music as the pool and activities but it was never obnoxious. The music began around 121 and and activities were not all day there is things available at the beach at opposite times. Our favorite time was 5 pm. Calm cooler and more relaxed we could have a catch with my son over the entire pool as no one was around. Meals were good. The breakfast buffet was okay it was the same selections day after day with no deviations. There were two buffets for lunch one where breakfast was served and another right on the beach. The best aspect of lunch was the fresh grilled food at the beach bufet chicken ribs fish it was phenomenal. Dinner was great we ate buffet most nights and had some wonderful fish dishes. Desserts were hit or miss. The staff at all of the restaurants are friendly accommodating and will go out of your way for you regardless of tip but please leave at least a dollar at all meals. I loved the fresh fruit at the 247 snack bar. The other food there was fairly bland prepackaged hotdogs sandwiches etc but the fruit is perfect to take back to the room and place in the fridge for snacking. You also have acDrinks at the resort were typical all inclusive fare. From breakfast you can order mimosas at breakfast as well as bloody Marys. We all found that a mimosa was a great way to start the day on vacation. During the day while at the pool bring an insulated cup or mug to keep your drink cold as they have the thin disposable plastic cups in the pool area understandably. Mojitos are great you can order these virgin and they are just as delicious. You are not limited to the selections that they have on the menu they will make you anything. If you had like premium liquor ask for it. If you had like additional alcohol or additional ingredients lime cherry coconut ask. The night entertainment was great especially the cirque du soleil use this reference loosely lmao. night show. We did not see many as we woke up by 7 am and after full days in the sun we are ready for bed by 9If traveling with kids my son was 13 bring a tennis ball for a catch at the beach or the pool. We saw people with floats rafts which might be a great idea to bring and jettison before leaving I would not use it in the pool too intrusive but it would be great for the ocean. The staff is truly welcoming ingratiating and accommodating. Show them that you appreciate them some work 14 hours a day 7 days a week and are on with smiles at all times. If you have even the slightest complaint they will fix it.

I stayed at the Riu Palace Punta Cana for 2 weeks from the 29 05 17 12 06 17 and I have to admit I was disappointed the cleanliness of the hotel was fantastic and the scenery and pool area could not be faulted however 90 of the staff were extremely rude if you could not speak Spanish and behaviour of some staff was inappropriate. Myself and my boyfriend are both in our 20s but could not believe the activities taking place and music being played at the polside with families with young children in the pool there was constant swearing in the songs and sexual innuendos and also girls were called out of the water and were told to dance sexually At the side of the pool which I would not of been pleased with if I was there with children. I also found that some waiters and waitresses were extremely rude to you if you could not speak Spanish and made no effort to talk to you I also found that certain chefs in the main restaurant were extremely rude. And I was told that I could not have a Pitta bread with just salad it had to have Pork in it as I do not eat red meat this resulted in me not being able to have one when they were being made fresh and the meat could have been left out. I also found the room service was not great you would phone and request something and nobody would show up to deliver to the room. I found that a certain member of the animation team was very inappropriate with females in the hotel and would only come over to speak to myself if my boyfriend would leave me for 5 10 minutes and then would go again as soon as he saw him coming back. I found that the food was very repetitive and if you have allergies like myself there is no point going to this hotel as hardly any of the foods has labels on them so it is really hard to understand what you are eating and the language barrier is not great with the restaurant staff. On a more positive note. I have to say that the waiter Joel is amazing and extremely friendly and also the pool waiter who says chaw chaw I can not remember his name unfortunately.

We went here for our Thanksgiving week. We were all excited especially it was my youngest sons 8th Birthday. This is not the first all inclusive vacation we have been to. I admit I was mesmerized with the last the looks of the hotel from the website as well as upon arriving in the lobby. But upon entering our room I felt devastated our room said it is Garden view but what we have is a street and some parking lot space with grasses on the ground. The person who checked us in was nice enough to offer us other rooms which we checked ourselves without even any help from any person from the front desk nor from anyone working in the hotel. So we have to literally check a room come back to the lobby. if we did not like the room will be given a another room key and same thing On the 4th room we decided to take it upon entering dots of water coming in from the top of the door curtains are not that stained nor the ceiling fan little bit smelly but not as bad the previous rooms. We almost finished checking in before 5 pm when we ask where can we possibly eat we were rerouted to sports bar when we went inside there is a small casino small arcade and an employee who does not speak English. I have a 10 and 7 yrs old and decided not to go there because of my kids. We came back to front desk and we were told that the lunch snack is closing at 5 pm near the pool. And we realized that sport bar only offered cold sandwiches along with chips and cheese dips. We tried to walk fast so we can at least eat real food our flight was at 1050am which was delayed for an hour so we basically missed lunch. We were able to eat a decent food pizza for my kids and something else for us not cold sandwiches. But the fountain drinks were closed because it was past 5 pm already. Now for the restaurants they offer 6 restaurants but they usually close 1 each night. We almost tried the all of it except for La Bodega. My concern is everywhere you go they have SALTY food even by mere ordering an omelette. I thought of giving this supposed to be 5 star hotel a very terrible review due to a lot of reasons but we Changed our mind and I tell you why in a second. The cons for this hotel are old rooms stained curtains and ceiling fans and smelly most of the staff does not know how to speak English food is salty no huts shade in beach area personal supplies are not complete no cotton buds for a 5 star hotel our room was missed for cleaning for a day we have to call them to clean our room. I have to call the lobby to replace our mini bar as well some portion of the floors are very slippery smoking is permitted almost everywhere smells like cigarettes all over. the acclaimed Garden view is not even close. the kids camp hours are very limited not much of Kids entertainment. Now for the pros you can avail and eat in other hotels like Naiboa and Bambu but not Riu Bavaro and Macao Macao for adults only. Naiboa has a water park not as big as other places fountain drink available but no server no food no other drinks hotel has small give aways mama Juana liquor some necklace figurines the long shore from the beach which has a powdery white sand and is perfect for walking kayaking available other water sports available but not free daily activities there was a lot of dancing but I was expecting at least a zumba class. We were thankful for Raul for making my sons 8th Birthday memorable during our dinner on November 23. I was told that this hotel will be updated next year. I hope that along with it changes to other departments as well will be made like for the activities and to designate smoking place more hours and activities for the kidos and to train the employees to speak at least basic English. I think if employees here will learn how to speak English they can better serve the customers.

I found these TripAdvisor reviews helpful so I am leaving my own. My family of 6 just returned from a week stay 1229 14. Our kids are 18 16 14 and 12 years old. The property itself was beautiful crews constantly cleaning the grounds and pool area etc. Check in was painless but I know that depends on the time you arrive. Plan for a long line in the airport btw there is no avoiding that. And know your shuttle company ahead of time and do not get swayed by random drivers trying to take your luggage and help you find a ride. ROOMS. we had absolutely no complaints about our rooms. We were on the second floor with balconies looking out not facing the interior. We had two rooms next to each other which was very nice. Rooms were clean no mold bugs mildew etc that other people mention. The two double beds are not separate picture two beds pushed together that can not be separated because they share the same headboard. Might be different in other rooms I do not know. We were in two junior suites. The staff was constantly in the hallways with cleaning crew and fresh towels. etc. Be sure to leave a buck or two on the bed when you leave for the day those cleaning crews deserve the tip. do not drink the water keep a bottle next to your sink for teeth brushing etc. We covered the faucet with a plastic bag to remind the kids. RESTAURANTS. the buffet in the morning was the best in my opinion. Fresh eggs fruit cereal for the kids different juices. The workers were the best there friendly happy to see you and always there with fresh coffee etc. We ate at the Japanese restaurant our first night there and it was AWFUL. The servers were disgruntled no greeting abrupt and unfriendly. When asked for our order it was as if they were angry that we were there. It was very odd. Food was slapped on the table literally. We spoke with another family who had the same experience. Next we ate at the Steakhouse much better but it was New Years Eve so menu was different etc. The second time we ate there it was good nothing spectacular but they had a burger option which made the boys happy. The Steakhouse is the only one that is away from the property and down by the pool beach that is kind of nice. The last one we tried was the Krystal which is the one where the men need to wear pants supposedly but we saw men in shorts too. This was the best meal in a restaurant with the friendliest staff. At the restaurants just expect to sit down and give your entire order in one visit from the waiter ress. We did not try the Italian or the Brazilian. For lunches we ate at the polside buffet which was hit or miss. I hated it but the kids found burgers fries pizza etc. Wide variety a soup every day cheeses salad fixings etc. but nothing really great. If you like wine do not expect to enjoy any of the wine they serve. We actually took a side trip to the liquor store after a day or so of bad wine. it was so bad. The fruity drinks are not strong. POOL BEACH. The pool was fantastic very clean each day etc. We did not see much of the workers activities games etc. that they do ONLY because we were at the beach more but I know they did pool aerobics and things like that. we have been to another Punta Cana resort and one in Mexico and this pool bar was the best not filled with messy drunks like in Mexico and kids could swim up and get a frozen drink with no problems. The bartenders there work hard all day long. do not get me wrong. it was definitely a party in the pool just not obnoxious in my opinion. We would set up on the beach early before the towel cabana was open it opens at 8 am but the workers would always give me fresh towels when I went down around 7 am. The pool chairs filled up faster than the beach chairs when we were there so plan to get there early if you want a seat at the pool. The beach was always clean when we got there and there are workers bring drinks if you want them. The ones hawking wares cigars necklaces were annoying but did not press it if you said no thank you which was good. ENTERTAINMENT. The workers during the day that organize games dancing etc were nice and always friendly. One note is that my teenage daughter felt uncomfortable one evening when a few of them kept asking her and another girl to go to the disco with them. Uh no. The shows at night were typical and we missed a few of them so no real report there. I will say that each night it was fun to congregate up in that area before the show lots of seating and music dancing. SPA GYM. my husband had a couple of massages from Favia. Fabia. and she deserves a shout out. He said they were great and very worth the time and money. I had a manicure do not bother. Gym is minimal as is expected but had a few spin bikes which is nice. The staff did an AWESOME job with New Years Eve. it was really fun and well done. They had earlier entertainment then they brought in a DJ and there was dancing etc. before the big balloon drop. This only helps a few people I know but we searched for information before leaving and could not find any. So if you are traveling next NYE it is a fun night. All of our ages enjoyed it. DAYTRIP we did the half day Bebe company snorkeling trip and it was just so so. The staff was awesome the snorkeling stunk. We had fun but I had recommend the Marinarium Tour over this one. We did that one four years ago and the actual snorkeling is much better.

We visited after the refurbishment and it certainly had the wow factor on arrival. We travelled with our older daughters and our rooms were together which was great. We had a few issues with our daughters room during the first few days the hotel tried to rectify eventually we had to change rooms due to the issues not being able to be fixed. The hotel were very apologetic but this did not spoil our holiday as the move was quick and easythere is plenty of choice with the restaurants our favourite was the steakhouse by the beach without a doubt the best steak I have ever had. No issues getting into any of the restaurants and no bookings necessary. The food was good and if you did not want to go out room service was available. The waiters by the pool were very attentive and we have to give a special shout out to Matos who was so lovely nothing was too much trouble even ensuring we got a drink when we were in the pool. Overall all the staff were friendly helpful and attentive giving good service with a smile or even a danceThe animation team well where do I start I am not one to join in activities on my holiday preferring to watch others but this team always managed to get people up and joining in without pressuring you. The activities and pool games were great fun and I did join in. Miguel made aqua aerobics enjoyable along with Pikachu Iki Spaghetti Capuchino and special mention to Scoby Do all made our time at Riu Palace a memorable one. We met Scoby on our first day you can not fail to miss him his enthusiasm is infectious. This team work long days but always smile and do all they can to make your visit an enjoyable one. Well done to them all. We all visited the Renova Spa for a massage Maria was the therapist who treated me the treatment was brilliant and Maria worked her magic I felt so relaxed afterwards. it is a great spa they all spoke English and we were treated well.

Everyday our room was refreshed with clean towels and bedding. The variety of food was ok and the dining staff were very hospitable. I like that we did n\u2019t have to make reservations to dine at the specialty restaurants. The pool areas were clean and activity consistent. Evening entertainment left a little to be desired but our room and expansive patio were so comfortable we just lounged there in the evening.

Overall we were very happy with our stay.", "offset": [512, 562], "date": "2018-10-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "8eb73f3c-2285-4d5b-8310-917fa6a380be", "sentence": "Nice hotel Circuit workout with Jaime.

This is main restaurant for breakfast and dinner Food was average at best There were 4 other restaurants close by all which were ok Italian Spanish Japanese and kristols which we ate in on New Year \u2019s Eve New Years meal was excellent. The hotel did n\u2019t have many English guests and not many staff spoke good Englishwe tipped waiters and polside staff who were excellent at there jobs and worked very hard. During our stay it was our wedding anniversary we emailed hotel and let them know as we thought they would do something special. they did n\u2019t till we had a go then next day we had balloons towel art and gifts The beach in front of our hotel was excellent the sea was warm and drink service was good as well We spent half our time ere and other half by main pool The entertainment around pool made the holiday worthwhile the team Scoby do Jamie zigy barbie victor Romeo and girls were a credit to hotel always entertaining and fun We played darts bingo booles horseshoe volleyball polo it was great my kids loved it My older daughter and wife went to two pool parties the jungle one and neon both of which they enjoyed.

The trip was great we did snorkeling swimming in deep blue shallow waters then had lunch on soner beach food was great Trip back was fun but very wet and windy on a catermaran The trip was n\u2019t cheap but I think well worth it we booked with Tui Nite entertainment was mainly dance show then Latin music So as a whole not a bad holiday we stopped 11 nites in past we have been to SENSATORI hotels which I think do better food but not so good entertainment Would I stop again yes but not until I \u2019d been to other places I would give it 8 out of ten.", "offset": [1059, 1648], "date": "2020-01-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "1b2176b8-e437-4445-ad70-eb8b9c7d3847", "sentence": "Wow just a great get away. We took our three young adults ages 15 20. It was a great mix of everything. We did excursions two of the days went to the beach stayed at the pool kids picked up a volleyball game on the beach \u2014 it was just nice. The restaurants for evening dinners were \u201c ok \u201d. We all felt the dinner buffet was better. My husband and I would agree. The staff though \u2014 by far the nicest group of people I \u2019ve ever had at any vacation we had. We had a great group of guys who took care of us Carlos Sandy Diroche we \u2019re friendly happy and so accommodating. If you were looking for just a nice place this was it. Night life if you want it a little entertaining outside each night. I know some reviews said this was loud not really. Maybe if your room was right outside by the stage but it stopped at 11. We enjoyed music down at the beach bar at night with the warm breeze. The resort on the photos looked so big but is very manageable to get from beach to hotel. The palm trees are awesome for shade and add to tropical feelings. Water is so warm in January. once you just get in the sand is super soft. We felt safe at all times the rooms were clean and nice. I have no complaints at all. We had someone give us advice to take 5 and 1 bills to have to tip. We did n\u2019t tip all the time but we did always tip the friendly staff at meals and maybe every other drink delivery. I \u2019d go back and repeat it all again. and we just may.
