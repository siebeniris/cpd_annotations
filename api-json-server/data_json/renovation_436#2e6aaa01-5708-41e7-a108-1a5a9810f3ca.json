I attended a conference at the Hilton Rosemont Airport Hotel. This was not really the Hilton Airport Hotel which was across the street from the United Terminal. It was a shuttle bus ride away. The shuttle terminal was about a block away from the terminal. It was very confusing to find the shuttle terminal building. There are no clear directions. When you find the terminal you have to wait at shuttle stop number 3. The bus runs every 20 minutes during peak hours to this and another hotel. The hotel is close to the convention center but nothing was going on there. The discount shopping mall is a 20 minute walk away but it was very cold outside and my time was limited. There is nothing else in the area I could find out about for entertainment. The hotel was notified by the travel agent of my allergies in advance and they had pre arranged a room for me. The duvet was replaced by a blanket and the pillows were feather free. I was delighted. It is rare to find this degree of care and efficiency by housekeeping. The mattress was nice and firm and I slept very well. The meeting facilities were good. The meeting food was okay. The chicken was moist but the food did not have that much flavor. The Liberty bar and restaurant in the lobby had an excellent tender grilled octopus appetizer. The fig and prosciutto pizza was good. The wine list was good. I do n\u2019t like oak fermented wines and I hate chardonnay. There was a nice New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc on the menu. There is no concierge for the hotel and the front desk is always busy. I did not get by requested wakeup call but luckily I was still able to catch my plane after I dressed and packed in 5 minutes of panic. I wanted to take a swim at my lunch hour and I went up to the 10th floor to use the pool. The housekeeping staff that helped me the night before were alone in the pool having a romantic time. I did not want to spoil the moment for them so I left. The hotel is in good repair. The staff is courteous. This is a good hotel for a conference.", "offset": [1968, 1996], "date": "2015-06-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "dc4e33ee-d3b9-469c-b397-f004805e8736", "sentence": "A better Hilton.

Airport Hotels are tough by their nature. This one being both an airport AND convention center hotel has an even tougher road to hoe. They do it reasonably well and I had stay here again. Parking is either surface or in a VERY large garage that is shared with the Embassy Suites and the convention center. The Hilton has reserved spots and the facility is connected to the hotel via SkyBridge. Nice touch during the cold winter months. Worth noting. the SkyBridge is on a separate elevator from the guest rooms. I like this it is an added security measure. Rooms are good clean and in good working order. Shower was strong. Bed was the updated Hilton bedding and comfortable. HVAC is a little wonky do not pay attention to the thermostat numbers just set as warm or as cold as it takes to get the engine moving. Pool is above the 10th floor and has great views. Fitness Room is split in two. Not tremendously good SPACE but the equipment is new and works well.

They charge 26 a day for their garage parking lot. Third party websites list it as free parking and when I asked about the same the hotel management and the third party website blamed each other for the mistake. Even lots in Downtown are cheaper than that. Make it a reasonable 10 12 day parking lot. The rooms are great and maintenance was neat.

Stay here. The Hilton Rosemont will pick you up directly at the airport the shuttle comes about every 20 minutes so you never wait too long. The shuttle drops you off at the hotel and while only a mile or two away you feel transported to a different area far away from the dreaded airport chaos. The streets around this hotel are totally walkable at any time of day. I walked them alone during the day and at night 10 pm just to test them out. There are tons of highly rated restaurants within a half mile radius and do not even get me started about how great the Fashion Outlet stores are. there is also a conference center very close by maybe a 3 5 minute walk and a significant amount of higher end hotel chains in the area. Check in at this hotel is a breeze. The put me on a top floor and bonus away from elevators and exit stairwells. The room has a bit of a unique setup with a diagonal hall entryway. Once inside the room itself is nice with mostly updated furniture. The room had more than enough outlets score and a self adjustable temperature down to the low 60s. The room was clean and it was easy to see that house keeping pays attention to detail. Also for an airport hotel my room was much larger and much more cozy than expected. The bathroom again was mostly updated with a few older touches like a magnified mirror that was supposed to light up but did not. The water pressure was ok not great and the water temp did not get quite warm enough for my liking. Minor details. The bed was super comfy and I enjoyed a lovely night sleep. Despite being so close to the airport I never heard a single plane which shocked me. The gym is split into two rooms with the cardio machines in one room and weights in another. You need your key to go from one room to the other so be prepared. Both gym rooms were hot. However I was able to adjust the temp on my own without needing to call for help. The gym was not busy and in the hour I spent there I only saw one other person. I did come at what I would consider an off time about 430 pm on a Sunday. I am not sure what it is like first thing in the morning. The gyms along with the small indoor pool are located on the tenth floor. Take note of this since there are not a lot of signs and I walked around trying to find the location for a bit. This hotel has a great conference space and is ideal for your next meeting. I did not love the conference food but that might just be me. I was more than impressed with my stay here and loved that I was only a 10minute drive to the airport.
