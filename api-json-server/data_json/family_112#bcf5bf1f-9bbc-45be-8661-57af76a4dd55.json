Upon checking in we were greeted with friendly staff at the counter. We stayed in the lower rooms right next to a church. In the morning the church rang it is bells around 730Am. It was too much in the morning as we wanted to sleep in. My wife called the front desk on the second night and asked to be moved. The front desk was very helpful and moved us to the 25 floor. What a difference it makes to be in a high floor. Water seems to be flowing more and sheets seem to be better. The exercise room is like a normal gym. It is a very huge place with full weights and exercise machine. I wish there was a pool for the kids to swim in. The location is great. There is a target and Metron across the street and shopping in union square. We rented a car and I parked on the street basically for free during the memorial holiday. I would park on 5th and Harrison as there is a lot of parking but some homeless. We uber to most of the attractions and had a great time. I would stay here again. Just do not drive in the city cause parking is expensive.", "offset": [36, 107], "date": "2016-06-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "ee611faa-adba-488d-9048-813c3c6c96ab", "sentence": "Worth the extra.

Almost seemed like he did not want to help figure something out. Second night was looking for pizza place to deliver because it was late at night around 10 pm.

This is the 3rd Mariot hotel I ve tried and it did nt disappoint. My family and I stayed for a total of 10 days and I can say SF Mariot Marquis caters very well to families too.

The room was spacious clean comfy and well lit. A C worked evey well. We always felt like going home to our room after a long day of touring. Location also gets high marks. A starbucks Melsdiner and Target were just around the corner. Just right across was a cinema and a food court that served Fil fod. A few blocks away was Market and Powell sts with a lot of stores and shops around like Trader Joes Old Navy sephora MAC Ross and Nordstrom rack etc. Just walking distance to Union square or you can take a cable car ride at Powell st. Convenient area yet it was nt as busy or crowded as Union Square.

Just stayed here over the Thanksgiving weekend. I want other travelers to understand what is going on with the strike and the re model. Cons The re model. it is substantial and most of the lobby is blocked off. There was a handful of people leading us to checkin. Lots of over cheerful folks lol. You could tell they were trying to compensate for the weird entry and the strikersRom. ouch they are rough at best. popcorn ceiling and dirty wall room 2726Strikers ok they are really LOUD. They are there from 70 am sharp till 100 pm. The gal that checked us in put us on the opposite side of the building so we did not hear them from the room. Walking past them is no big deal. They have mega horns and beat big Sparklets water bottles. If walking past strikers makes you uncomfortable you will not like it. it is pretty obtrustiveNo room service either. They have a nice little cafe walk in place for all sorts of stufPros very close to all the shopping. There is a Trader Joes and Target across the street.

I make 1 2 multi day trips per month for business and I have stopped writing reviews because it is all become very much the same for me. So I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the service during my conference this week at the Mariot Marquis. From the front desk to the restaurant to the bell staff all were terrific. Little things like making sure there are extra umbrellas for everyone during the downpour make a difference. The hotel had all the basics the room was clean plenty of pillows and towels outlets at the desk were in the right spots if I have to crawl under the desk to plug in the computer your hotel is off my list. The tiered elevator system works well I did not wait once in a 39flor hotel. But heres why I am bothering to write the gym rocks. I have lost 25 pounds in the past six months so a good workout is a priority on the road. My first day I shared the gym with runners who were stretching out for Bay to Breakers and there were more than enough mats for everyone. I did not have time to use the spa service or the locker but it is available for an extra charge. And The View the rooftop bar is well worth checking out but be there right at 4 pm to get a prime seat. it is San Francisco so the hotel restaurant and the even the pantry prices are steep 7 for a coffee and a KIND bar. but the service is super fast. If you like a morning walk there are cheaper healthy options within a few blocks. I enjoyed watching the Warriors game with the local fans in the nearby Tap Room. Conventions can be a drag but this one was better than usual despite three days of rain.
