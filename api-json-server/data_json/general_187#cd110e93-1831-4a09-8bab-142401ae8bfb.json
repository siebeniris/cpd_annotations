We have had the most amazing experience staying at this icon of SingaporeFrom the minute we got here. where we were greeted so by the doorman offered a drink in the grand reception area as the reception staff took my passport and credit card while we sat in comfort. No checking in here waiting in line. I had to go outside to take a call and was met by Masimo Moreschini Director of Rooms. He waited patiently as I finished my call to welcome us and assured me that as we were staying for 13 days we could call on any of the staff including him for any of our needs. We were then told that our butler was ready to show us to our suite. What a start to an amazing friendship with and amazingly professional woman Dusty who would go to the extremes to offer us anything our hearts desired. We were also totally suprised by a wonderful birthday cake for Alan as we are here to celebrate his 70th birthday. The next night as I had mentioned to Dusty that it was also our anniversary we returned from dinner to find a bottle of Champagne and our bed covered in rose petals and two beautiful swans. The breakfast staff were amazing. I have unfortunately been unwell for the last four days and have not been able to accompany Alan to breakfast. We have stayed in a lot of 4 5 star hotels during our travels but I have always had to go with Alan as he is blind to arrange his breakfast. Not at the Raffles. They not only totally looked after him but twice sent a few items to our room as they knew I was unwell. Many thankd to Mina and CJ for looking after Alan so well. Since I have been sick I have been brought lemon and honey tea on many occasions. they just can not do enough for us. In Singapore you have to try High Tea at the Raffles. We came a couple of years ago and that is when I thought. I have to come back and stay here. We went to high tea on Sunday and were treated like VIPs. The food is delicious and hard to not go back for more. Never ever in any hotel I have stayed out throughout the world have I come acros such wonderful doormen concierges. The minute you arrive you are in a taxi on your way to your next destination. Even if it means tha they walk out onto Beach Rd to hail one. The housekeeping staff are without doubt the best I have ever seen. they quietly diligently go about their hard tasks as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. I can not fault the service and amazing experience that you the staff at the Raffles have given us I especially want to mention the Butlers. Dusty Jazz John and everyone else. You guys are a credit to not only the Raffles but to youselves. Thank you for a most memorable experience.

We visited the Raffles Bar one day during a stay in Singapore. The bar is reminiscent of days gone by. The ceilings are high very high and the fans hanging down are slow moving and lazy like you will find in may laid back tropical places. Birds flew in and around the open air lounge which was large airy and there was plenty room for privacy at our table. The size of the furniture and the arrangements made us feel as though we were alone and did not have to worry about anyone encroaching on our fantasy afternoon. The service was excellent and we had the famous Singapore Sling. A person must drink the entire drink before it is permissible to have the cherry at the bottom of the glass. This drink tastes like a perfect punch and is so delicious everyone will easily be in the relaxed mood for conversation and more than a fair share of Singapore Slings. To learn about Sir Stamford Raffles and the uncovering of the great temple of Borobudur on Java and his many other fantastic accomplishments is a thing of great amazement and awe.

There is probably little to say about Raffles that has not been said many times but I had like to record that our 3 night stay was everything we had hoped for and more. The combination of luxurious colonial ambience and fabulous service makes for an experience that would be hard to beat anywhere. Arriving relieved but disoriented after a difficult flight from Manchester our holiday immediately picked up when we were upgraded to the superb Chersonese suite two large bedrooms a sizeable lounge 2 bathrooms a kitchen and a long balcony running the length of the courtyard outside the bar and billiard room. This was a most pleasant environment for the 4 of us self wife and boys aged 11 and 15 to gather our wits. We began to acclimatise with a swim in the terrific rooftop pool where we also had an enjoyable lunch. Waking up early through jetlag the next morning I returned to the pool at 630 am and I have to say that a relaxing swim as the darkness gave way to dawn was one of the best holiday experiences I have ever had. The level of service was excellent throughout our 3 night stay but it was not the kind of automated have a nice day service so often encountered at top hotels. Staff were relaxed friendly genuine and helpful. My wife and I had visited the hotel for a Singapore Sling some 18 years previously and a staff member spent a lot of time helping us to re create a photo we had had taken at the time interestingly the decor and background were virtually the same. We enjoyed excellent service from our butler Alvaro who among other things arranged for the hotels historian Mr Danker to give us a fascinating tour of the hotel. The photo gallery of guests is especially interesting though the quality of guests has declined somewhat over the years you start with Somerset Maugham and end up with Boris JohnsonThe breakfast buffet was wide ranging and interesting the Raffles omelette with just a touch of chilli was a treat. My wife majored on eggs benedict and the boys were able to tuck into their regular cereals and yoghurts. The hotel is great to walk round and drink in with the obligatory Slings still a standout attraction.
