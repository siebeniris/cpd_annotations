I was on a business travel and stayed here for 3 days. First thing that I missed which was not available in the hotel was the toiletries. This is so common and essential part of service provided by all the hotels. I was surprised to not find the same. I booked for a king size double bed room but I was supplied with a single bed room. When I enquired I was told that even if it shows on makemytrip its actually single bed for single person and double for 2 irrespective of my booking. It was weird. Breakfast was good and I wish they had a bigger area for the restaurant. It will serve them well if they can have a separate section and start a bar. The staff at the restaurant were nice. Sugestions1. Make your front desk people more welcoming. A gentle smile will not hurt them while greeting a new guest2. Need to have another lift3. Have a glass facade or closed area for the restaurant4. Please give toiletries. It will not cost you much but add a lot of value in your service5. Have better mattress.", "offset": [168, 243], "date": "2016-02-08 18:30:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "a2728d69-c7c8-4301-833f-bcbb9daf5391", "sentence": "Wonderful service and great place to stay.

Rooms are compact as any other Ginger property. What was surprising is that the service was not great. The tea coffee set in our room was missing milk sachets and there was no door mat in front of the bathroom door both of these were brought 4 phone calls and two hours later.
