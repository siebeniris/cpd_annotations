We booked an Executive Deluxe Double room. Here is the room description copied and pasted from the website.

The bathroom features deep soaking bubble tub with Chromo therapy lights heated bathroom floors. built sound system with iPod docking station 26 flat screen seperate shower with surround rain heads and body sprayers. Our room has double beds and a small bathroom with a soaking tub and no separate shower. I assumed there was a mistake and called the front desk. No apparently you might get queen beds and the big bathroom but you might not. Sarah was very nice and offered to see if she could move us but no luck. And with the general manager not here there was nothing else to be done. She suggested next time we call to make a reservation and that she will note our account that I like big luxurious bathrooms. I think it is safe to say there will not be a next time. I booked this room specifically for the amenities it supposedly offered. Otherwise I would have chosen a less expensive room or we would have gone to the Netherland Hilton an old favorite. To be fair the room is beautiful with a large sitting area and a spacious balcony overlooking the hotel courtyard. The room does not have a refrigerator which would be nice.

The facilities are amazing in the sense that the bathroom had a beautiful soaking tub and it was so clean. I despise staying in hotels that have mildew buildup in the caulk on the tubs a minor thing I know but they really clean the rooms thoroughly. The hotel is under construction but it ends by 5 pm so your sleep is not disturbed. The rooms are very spacious with excellent lighting and the temperature is easily regulated and maintained. The beds and pillows are exceedingly comfortable as welI wish I did not have anything to write here but I do. My check in experience was single handedly the worst check in I have ever had at any hotel. I should lead this off by stating that I am disabled I have a traumatic brain injury and a service dog that assists me in balance and mobility think full leather harness style with the big handles similar to a guide dog. The first time I pulled by the hotel there was no valet present so I had to park in the garage across the street repack my bags in my car to include bare necessities so I could carry my bags and then drag them into the hotel. They do not have automatic doors so opening doors and dragging things through while being supported by a service animal is a difficult task. The actual check in was abysmal. The gentleman that I spoke with was very annoyed by our presence like we interrupted him. He did not give any of the necessary info like when check out time was or offer any info about the surrounding area services the hotel offered etc. Blessedly the belhop was far more helpful and set up a driver for the event at music hall so I would not have to walk connected me with room service so I could get a drink and made me feel welcome. Honestly he would do far better in hospitality behind the desk as he was so very helpful. As a side note to all my fellow service dog teams the closest patch of grass to this hotel is over 3 blocks away. They do not have a service dog relief station which is so very disappointing given how inexpensive they are to tuck away even in a corner of a garage or something they are small and compact but it made my stay miserable to walk over 3 blocks in single digit weather for my girl to relieve herself.

I fault the staff and management for not being honest about it. Then the biggest problem which still has not been resolved. We stayed two nights at The Cincinatian. We parked at a nearby parking garage not caring to pay 35 per night for valet. When we checked out 70 had automatically been added to our bill for valet parking. I went back to the front desk clerk and told her of the error. She then subtracted only 35. I had to go back to her again telling her she needed to take the remaining 35 off our bill. I eventually was given an invoice that APPEARED to reflect the correct amount of our bill. I thought the problem was resolved and my husband and I left the hotel. A few days later when I checked my credit card online I found that the incorrect amount with the additional 70 had been turned in to my credit card company. I called the hotel and I am quite certain I spoke with the same person who checked me out initially. She assured me everything was fine and that the correct amount would post to my account in the next 3 5 days. I was never convinced that would happen. I asked to speak to a manager. She acted like she did not understand my request. I repeated my request several times and then she said all the managers were in a meeting and that I could call back on Monday. This call was made on a Thursday so that is one heck of a long meeting. It also took seven calls to the hotel before anyone answered the phone.

I still had housekeeping knock at my door three times before 2 pm and all while I had the DND sign on the door. Overall it was a very bad experience probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a Hilton hotel. Next time I am staying at the Netherland Plaza Hilton.", "offset": [1209, 1316], "date": "2019-01-21", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "505106c4-b4bf-4465-b8b3-a9d25e04bd6b", "sentence": "Unfortunate experience in Cincinnati. I travel a lot. Compared to hotels in other cities in US and abroad this hotel is no better than a 2 star. When renovated cheap linoleum was installed in the guest rooms. The bathroom shows serious signs of wear. Noisy. Breakfast is quite unfortunate. Coffee was stale and sour from prolonged storage in an urn. Service was slow eg 25 minutes for a toasted bagel in a room that was less than 20 full. The Bell Captain was unable to give directions to Starbucks. But the staff at the Reception desk and in the dining room for breakfast were nice. At best this competes with Motel 6 but for the price of the room go elsewhere.", "offset": [350, 438], "date": "2019-02-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "a4b7a20a-579f-4e49-b9fc-797612b4e1eb", "sentence": "Beautiful Hotel but the Customer Service needs work. I was not sent a SALT survey to fill out even though my Hilton Honors number is on file probably to avoid a negative score. so I will do my review on here. My boyfriend and I stayed here for our 5 year anniversary on the 4th of July. Needless to say this stay was very important to us. We do not get a chance to get away often and wanted it to be perfect so we choose to stay at this hotel due to recommendations from our friends. Positives. The hotel itself is a beautiful work of art from the lobby area to the guest rooms. We were given an upgraded rm when I asked at check in which was appreciated. We ate dinner at the Brick Morter restaurant on site and the food was delicious especially the giant pretzel with beer cheese. We sat at the bar and the 2 bartenders were very friendly and provided top notch service. We also ate breakfast the next morning and the food and service was very good despite the long wait they were very busy. Michael on 3rd shift deserves a shout out as well he was very friendly and assisted us when we returned from the fireworks and needed a few things. Negatives As a front office supervisor at another downtown property in Cincinnati I expect a certain level of customer service from the Hilton brand. The check in and check out service was cold and unwelcoming. The same front desk agent checked me in and checked me out. I did not get her name but she had short brown hair and glasses older woman. When I was checked in there was literally no information given to me about the hotel. I was not told how to log into the wifi I was not told the restaurant hours I was not told any parking information. She does not even ask me how my day was going or if I had any questions. Just gave me my keys and that is about it. I guess it was the fact I am only a Silver Team member and she did not feel I was important because the 2 Diamond members that checked in after me were told plenty of this info. She did give me an upgrade when I asked I was almost afraid to ask because her demeanor was off putting. Even though I was upgraded it did not feel like an upgrade due to the TV issues I was having the whole time. The TV in the bedroom area had maybe 5 channels that were working. Majority of the channels that should be available for basic cable had the error message scrambled channel or weak signal. The small TV in the bathroom worked fine but that does not help. We waited a little bit thinking that this problem was due to the rain at the time. Later on in the night when we got back from being out it had not rained for several hours and the TV still was not working. We called the front desk and they sent engineering to look it. Engineering said that they were going to reset something but it was never fixed it or he did not even came back to check on us to see if it was working again. At check out I brought up these issues to the same lady who checked me in. I was again left with a cold response of I am sorry your receipt will be emailed to you. I was not necesarily looking to get anything but the very least she could have done was pretend to care so I did not have to waste my time typing this review. She did not say that she was going to follow up with anyone regarding this issue so the next guest is probably also experiencing this. This type of customer service is appalling coming from a 4star hotel.", "offset": [1808, 1985], "date": "2019-07-07", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "8cabf6d6-e4f6-4ebd-a71b-2085c6f8d81a", "sentence": "The room was not clean not even close to being sound proof and the fireplace was non working by the jacuzi.
