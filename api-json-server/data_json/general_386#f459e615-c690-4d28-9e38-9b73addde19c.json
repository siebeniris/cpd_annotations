Booked here a week before for 2 nights. When we arrived the young black haired Caucasian with glasses at the front was short with us and rudely spoken. We got our keys and went straight to get something to eat and bring back. we arrived 40 mins later back the hotel. When we brought our luggage up and opened the door what we found was saddening. Crumbs on the floor and stains. a bad musky smell along with stains on the beds. we went straight to the front immediately and asked if we could have our money returned and we would look for a hotel elsewhere. once again the young man at the front was rude and tried in Noway to help us he told us he could move us to another room and if we left we would still be charged 50 percent of one night and that we had been their an hour already. I pleaded with him that we had went first to get something to eat and had not seen the room till now and he would not listen. So another guy from the front desk took us to show us another room which when he walked in with us I immediately showed him a threading needle laying on the floor and once again looked like the room had not been cleaned properly and was in pot condition. And I was very upset this time and I told him please return our money and he refused. So we lost 530 dollars and we did not even stay. me and my wife have never experienced anything like this with a hotel or even remotely close to this in our life. we are sorry to post this but we were done very wrong and we would like to advise anyone else to be very cautious and check your room immediately when you go to this hotel or they will put you in bad conditions and still takeyour money and claim you have been their an hour already.", "offset": [46, 157], "date": "2015-05-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "28a83db4-d940-4c16-9894-9a59119e01ea", "sentence": "Old hotel being renovated.

First the one and only but very important positive. the hotels location is great just a few minutes from the Staples Center walkable. Being old is fine but this hotel has not been maintained for a very long time. From the musty smelling sheets and nasty smelling rooms to cardboard covered holes in the wall and strange pit like bathtub shower that is a huge risk for anyone using it. There was almost no water in the sink. it is the kind of place where every time I took an Uber to be dropped off at the hotel I had to point out the place and say. yeah that dumpy looking building in the corner that is the one. it is got the overall The Shining kind of ambiance to the corridors and rooms with floors in rooms bathrooms badly in need of refurbishment and cleaning. The service folks at reception were not bad but they were not too helpful either for example asking for a fork and a plate I was told there were none even though there is a restaurant in the hotel lobby the bellman was fine too.
