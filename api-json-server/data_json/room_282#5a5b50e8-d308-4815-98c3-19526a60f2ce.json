I recently spent the night at this hotel on a business trip. My experience at this hotel was far worst than I have experienced at most Mariot hotels. I am a Platinum Premier Elite member with Mariot. And for those that may not know what this means last year I spent 25 nights with Mariot and spent over 300 conducting conferences on their properties. This hotel is ideally located between Love Field and DFW and parking is free. This is where any compliments of this hotel must stop. This hotel does not offer a shuttle from Love Field so a taxi is required about 260. I had called ahead to see if based on my elite status if I could be upgraded to a suite or placed on the club level. I was told they would see what they could do. Once I arrived at the hotel the front desk staff was very unfriendly and unhelpful. I asked about the upgrade to my sleeping room but was told nothing was available. In addition they said they did not want to move me because my room had already been set according to my profile requests extra towels robe and feather pillows. However when I arrived to my room I found that none of my requests had been followed. I called down and ask that room service provide me with these items. I did have access to the club level but since it was so late all appetizers had been removed. At that time the restaurant manager was in the club and I asked him to see if he could have the requested items sent to my room. He assured me that he would take care of it. However after waiting an hour the items still had not been brought to my room. I decided to call down and discuss this situation with the Manager on Duty MOD. and she said she would have them in my room within five minutes. Thirty minutes the items were still not delivered so I walked downstairs to address this situation with the MOD. She was surprised that the housekeeping staff failed to follow through. While I was downstairs the items finally arrived. Over one hour and forty five minutes to get extra towels. The room itself was a pretty standard Mariot with the exception that there was no bottled water in the room. This is the only Mariot where I have seen this done. The drapes in the room were so worn that they would not pull together to block out the street lights. The mattress was spongy and leaned to one side showing wear and tare. As I was preparing to take a shower before bed I noticed in the sink a great deal of hair and whiskers where it had either not been cleaned for had backed up. YUCK. I called the manager and she appeared along with the previously mentioned food and beverage manager and he took a picture. She offered to move me to another room but since it was now 1030 PM and I was staying for only one night I opted to stay in the room. In addition there was no hand soap left in the room. The manager said she would provide me with some extra points however I just finished checking with Mariot and again a lack of follow through with no points posted. There are far too many hotels in the Dallas area to be treated with inappropriate guest services especially since I am at the top tier of elite status. I will NOT be using this hotel for future conferences.", "offset": [1328, 1456], "date": "2015-10-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "8e2d3954-cd5e-4f7e-ba75-18ae8f2dd617", "sentence": "Nice location for a business meeting. 15 minutes from DFW airport rooms are nice a little worn but clean. no mini frig or safe in rooms exercise room was the usual limited to treadmill steppers and dumpbels but clean and well maintained.

I was looking forward to staying at this hotel. Location on the map looked great. That was the best part. it is all downhill from there. Location in front of a lake with relaxing views.

The hostess cheerfully greeted us and said our room should be ready in 12 hour so we waited in the patio area. It was a nice sunny albeit windy day. So it was a good way to de compress after a long drive. The balcony lake view room is the largest disappointment of all. It felt old and dated. But worst of all it was FILTHY see pics. It must have been a while since housekeeping dusted and cleaned. We even found an ice bucket with melted ice behind the balcony curtain. I was not able to take a pic of it but my husband said the phone cord was coated with dustSince I was there for business and only staying one night we decided to stay put. But never again.
