Our family recently gathered to celebrate a loved ones birthday who has had some recent health challenges. I have never has so many mixed emotions about a hotel experience. As so many people have stated the hotel is located right on the beach and their 2nd floor balcony rooms are awesome especially to gather your family. Several of the staff members namely Maria in reservations and Bill the sales manager not only went out of their way to assist but were kind thoughtful and sensitive to our familys needs. They were nothing short of amazing. Unfortunately several others especially in food and beverage were rude hard to deal with and I would go as far as saying completely insensitive to our familys desire to gather with a small group under 18 people rigid and not creative in accommodating our requests. There were a few small requests that could have made a big difference but the restaurant staff just was not interested. There were fire alarms and flashing lights that went off the ENTIRE dinner 25 hours total. The restaurant manager and personnel never apologized nor did they seem to be bothered that it was impossible for guests to enjoy their experience. They just did not care. Several of the staff were just plain rude. The food was marginal at best. The front desk staff did a great job although 3 of our rooms were not ready until well after 40. I will say for the people that did a great job and the location I would go back.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our 2 year anniversary in mid April. The hotel is only 20 minutes from the airport right on the beach and very easy to navigate. The hotel is smaller has a beautiful deck facing the beach and is overall very serene. The pros Food Great food and drinks. Only 2 restaurants at the resort but room service runs fairly late. Beach service was excellent too. Ask for Tanya she was wonderful. Rooms. We stayed in an ocean front suite. The room was spacious and clean with a balcony that was perfect for enjoying the beautiful beachfront. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a rock and I usually have a hard time sleeping in hotels. The cons Service. with the exception of Tanya the service was terrible. From getting out of the cab when we arrived we felt like we were inconveniencing anyone who worked there. Examples none of the bell hops helped with our luggage when we got out of the cab. When we checked in we were the only people in line there were 4 people behind the service counter and no one offered to help us in for an uncomfortable amount of time. Our room was not ready which was understandable because we were there around 1230 but we were told we would be called when the room was ready. That never happened our room key was sitting behind the counter and it took us going up to the counter to find out our room was ready several hours later. And it is not like they were busy and could not call there was no one at the desk waiting to be helped. We also felt like we were bothering the beach workers when we needed something too many people distracted by cell phonesLocation there were not any bars or restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and there were not people walking around the area at night. It was more of a residential area and the cab situation was not great. It was easy to call a cab but we had to wait 10 20 minutes whenever we called. And fair warning they hate the UberX drivers there so be careful if you use it. We were yelled at by a cab driver because of using UberX because it is supposedly illegal there.

Should be even better once the remodeling noise is something of the past. The top floor construction taking place on a weekend was somewhat of a surprise.

Ninth floor was just too close to the area being worked on. Our room was excellent. Nice and roomy as we chose the city side with a single king size bed. There was a slight problem with our door pass keys not working on the new door locks on the next day in the afternoon. The first set stopped working and a second set did not work at all that we picked up at the front desk. Housekeeping then sent up a maintenance man with a third set which finally got us in our room. Had breakfast at ten of the clock one morning. It seems like everyone decided to do so at the same time which overwhelmed the wait staff. The hostess ended up taking our order which was nice and after that it seems like three different staff members came by to help in our service. It also took awhile for breakfast to arrive. My wife and I did enjoy it once it arrived though. Other than the few issues above we would go back. It is a great spot on the ocean with a nice veranda view just off the lobby.

Enjoyed two weekends in a row here. Front desk service was exceptional on the first visit during the AIR SHOW. Cody from Boston was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable. However the second weekend front desk service was a bit spotty. Enjoyed our room so much more on the first stay. During that stay we had a private balcony. On the second stay we were on the second floor with two king size beds in the room which was very spacious. Rooms were almost identical except the first weekend we had two queen beds. On the second floor you share a balcony with the entire floor. There goes opening your door at night so you can hear the wonderful ocean as you are lolled into a tranquil sleep. If you are going for the tranquility opt for the private balcony. It appears that even the ocean view rooms have great views also private balconies. We ate in both the restaurant and in the bar. The bar food was very good and the bartenders were fabulous. You are literally on the ocean. We also ate in the restaurant for one of the dinners and breakfast. Sitting outside and hearing the ocean as well as looking right onto the amazing blue water is worth every second and every penny. Food in the restaurant as well as room service was good. The coffee shop was good \u2013 great lattes. A little sparse compared to some of the other Noble House properties. I truly believe it is one of the best hotels on the entire A1A strip. Located right on the beach so you do not have to cross the street to get to the water. The pool area is great with a lazy river that was a lot of fun just to float around. The pool service was attentive as was the beach service. Lastly it would be unfair to have this wonderful hotel lose any stars for the valet service but they really need to get their act together when it comes to the valet. Call ahead and ask for your car to be waiting for you. We waited up to 30 to 40 minutes twice for our cars. There were four of us leaving with four cars and there was no method to the madness. The first one to give a ticket was the last man out about 40 minutes after handing in the ticket \u2013 a pure cluster. I was told that the valet is not affiliated with the hotel. Best to have a Rumrunner before you go down but remember not to drink and drive. Hey with the lengthy wait maybe you could have a drink prior to going down and it would be out of your system before you get your car. Recommend if you have the time to stop at Coconuts near.

We were a party of 6 who were scheduled to go on a Cruise on Saturday March 24th however with the current pandemic happening our cruise was cancelled so 1 Couple in our party thought it best to fly back home the remaining two couples decided to stay and finish out our vacation. So we began a furious search for a place to stay and finish out our vacation. After hours of searching we found the Pelican Grand and after reading the reviews and seeing the location we decided to migrate. We were in room 26 Absolutely awesome we were on the end cap of the hotel 2 King Size Beds very spacious room sun room and our own balcony. We arrived late afternoon Saturday soaked up the sun and had dinner at the hotel. FYI the Dinner was extremely expensive and really not worth what we spent we had 4 drinks and 4 sandwiches Fries and it was around 1300. After having Coffee and watching the Sun Rise we decided we may want to stay a bit longer than we first thought. All was going well until Tuesday morning when all the Beaches from Fort Lauderdale to Miami were closed. We assumed because this was a private resort we would n\u2019t be affected but that is not the case. So this is where things kind of tanked the Pool and Lazy river were Over capacity not to mention it was my understanding that the Pelican sells Day Passes to use their beach and pool. So you have a Hotel full of guest and also Day Pass guests. The Pool was so filled that the hotel decided to best serve their guests is to put tanning chairs on a hot tile Roof next to us and let their patrons sizzle in the sun while their work staff had to run up an down 2 flights of stairs then the length of the hotel to serve drinks. Very unethical in my opinion. The reason I am communicating this to the readers is because The hotel charges you for the room the use of the beach the attendants at the beach who set up your beds umbrellas the attendants at the pool for towels and some of the other amenities in the hotel. Now with the closing of the beach and the over capacity at the pool you would think the hotel would cut the rate to exclude some of the amenities you really do n\u2019t have access too or can enjoy. I get it these are extraordinary circumstances however how can you charge your guests for something you ca n\u2019t really service. I emailed the General Manager of the Hotel four Days prior to writing this review in the hopes that there would be a different outcome however I have not received any response which tells me \u2013 what \u2019s done is done.
