The weekend was everything we hoped it would be. The hotel was easy to find and the parking was underground beneath the hotel. The check in procedure was easy and fast thanks to the Travelocity online reservations. The first night we arrived late and it was too hot to be outside walking to a local restaurant. So we enjoyed a light meal in a well air conditioned Bistro really good food. Each morning breakfasts were freshly made. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The front desk staff all of them were very helpful and friendly. We had a wonderful weekend. We plan to return for more touring of the Charlotesvile area and when we do we will likely stay here again Mariot guests since 1961 Twin Bridges in Washington DC. Good Choice.

They have a car park which leads directly into the hotel and we checked in parked and went to our room. Located just a short walk from the buzzing Corner there is an abundance of good eateries and bars nearby. Breakfast was a disappointment. There is a sort of breakfast in an area adjacent to reception. The staff were clearly not coping with the number of guests needing food coffee and our promised wait of one minute turned into twenty we changed our order to go.

My father was in the hospital having surgery to remove pancreatic cancer that we had just found out about two weeks before. It was a very difficult time. One morning when I got up and was in the corner of the lobby reading my bible at 6 AM I approached the coffee bar to ask for a cup of coffee even though I knew they did not open until 630am. Carolyn Rush was busily cleaning and preparing to open. Upon my request she immediately turned to begin to pour me a cup of coffee. I began to cry just at the small gesture of kindness. She came around the bar and hugged me telling me she would pray for me. At that moment Minerva Guadalupe came from the kitchen and joined our conversation. They kindly listened to me tell them about my father as they worked. A new friendship immediately began. From that moment on and for the rest of the week I looked forward to going out into the lobby early each morning and talking with the women as they worked while I drank my coffee. The circle of friends grew to include Ame Jones and Brittany Casis among many others. They were all so kind. Brittany even wrote us a special note and left it in our room one night. They were many other kind gestures too many to mention. Minerva talked with me daily and prayed for me. She also went out and bought a gift for my nephew who was also in the hospital just 2 floors above my father. He is a heart transplant hero and was sick with the flu. Although I told them thank you several times words will never express how much I appreciate the kindness and the love they gave to me throughout the week.

I did say that we were surprised that breakfast was not included and not even a complimentary coffee in the lobby. She assured me that breakfast was included in our price. Imagine our surprise. i repeated the question thinking there must have been miscomunication. after all why would we have been told no upon checking in. I asked her if we could get a rebate. she was kindly ready to remove a charge from the prior day to make amends when Amy came quickly on the scene to tell us that was not a breakfast charge and that it could not be removed absolutely. so i asked again about a rebate since we would not have bought a breakfast had we not been told there was no comp breakfast. nope she would not budge. this would have been a positive review had she even comped a little bit. the Hampton Inn is a better choice for us in the future.", "offset": [323, 437], "date": "2018-05-11", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "6424470d-622f-4239-8ef5-e59f9e56d8ef", "sentence": "Bistro is SLOW everything else great.

One very sweet staff member Minerva prepared extra food just for my family and checked on us several times. We were the ONLY people left and we stayed after breakfast time was over. Usually in that situation staff wants you gone so they can tend to other things but not her. Thank you Minerva for making us feel welcome when really I am sure you had other things you needed to do. Another moment we needed help was when the internet on my phone was not working. I called the front desk and a rep named Aziana or something close answered. She said she would contact the department needed to check the wi fi. Instantly it came back on. But she ALSO called back in 10 minutes to check whether it had.

The rooms have been upgraded but not completely new which was not a problem for us. They had snacks and drinks in the lobby to grab buy and go. In the afternoon they have gratis fresh baked cookies. Plus it was an easy walk to the University stores and a wide variety of food choices. Very friendly and helpful staff. Last but never ever least was the little bar and cafe in the lobby.
