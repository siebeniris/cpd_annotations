I stayed at the Ramada for a week at the beginning at July. I was there for a Genealogy Conference. I can start by saying the staff at the registration desk is rude and uncooperative. I unfortunately arrived early before the check in time and they could not be bothered with me. When I did check in they did not give me the room I had requested. When I asked the girl at the front desk to change my room for the one I had requested she was very rude about it. I had to go to the manager to get my room changed. For the entire time I was there the people behind the desk never ever smiled. There was never any large bath towels in the room I had to call the front desk constantly to have them send bath towels to my room. The carpet in the room was never vacuumed and the cleaning of the room took about 5 minutes at the most. I was present when the room was cleaned. The a c turned off automatically even when I was in the room sleeping. They are strictly kosher so there are two different restaurants. They did not have enough staff for either one and there were very long wait times for food because of this. There is a very nice breakfast buffet but you are not told about it when you check in you have to learn about it from other guests. There was a coffee service during lunch time at the conference but it required payment and you had to go to the front desk to get a coupon showing you paid for it. There were lectures during lunch time at the conference but it required the payment of 35 again at the front desk for the food. The food consisted of small tea sandwiches and salads 35 really. Please note this hotel is very religious and there is no breakfast served on Saturday. The location of the hotel is not within walking distance of any restaurants.

Room. The room was filthy. Housekeeping came daily but I could not tell that anything had been done other than the bed being made. The sheets on the bed were changed ONCE in 14 days. The room was never dusted or vacuumed. The mirrors in both the bathroom and bedroom were smeared spotted and stained. The carpet was covered in inches of dust at the baseboards around the entire room. The wallpaper was terribly stained. The air conditioning vent and return were covered in dust. The bathroom sink did not hold water. The bathtub never drained. The towels were threadbare stainedand replaced inconsistently. The toiletries were replaced sporadically. There is no plug in the bathroom for the provided hair dryer. Once I found the hair dryer in the dresser drawer I could only use it across the room where there was no mirror located. The in room telephone was unusable. The pre set numbers on the speed dial did not connect you to the location you were attempting to call. For example if you tried to reach the front desk by pushing the front desk pre set you were sent to security. If you attempted to reach the business center by pushing the pre set for the business center you were connected to room service. In one instance it took being redirected by staff four time to reach the front desk. The wi fi worked well. The mini fridge did keep my beverages cold. The safe worked without issue. Front Desk. Surly. Rude. Unfriendly. Unhelpful. After check in we had to search the hotel for the gift shop. buffet breakfast coffee shop and hours. No map of the premises was given. No information volunteered by the front desk staff. Any information gleaned was learned by either self discovery or the asking of other guests. Breakfast Buffet. Large selection of items to choose from on the buffet. No complaints about the food at breakfast except that hot items were occasionally cold. Manager was very friendly. Staff were scattered. Difficult to get dirty tables cleaned. Also had to track someone down to get coffee. Coffee Shop lobby level. Ate several times in the dairy restaurant. Only once in the meat restaurant. Food was ok in both. I have had better and worse. Service however was awful. Once you located someone to seat you and provide menus it was a lengthy time before your order was taken and drinks were provided. After you meal was delivered staff was rarely seen again. Paying for your meal was difficult as you could never find your waitress for the bill. Outdoor pool. Nice except difficult to reach. Instead of being able to exit the building on the same floor as the pool you had to go into the basement and through the spa gym indoor pool area and climb a flight of stairs to get to the pool. I stayed here for a conference and had the conference not been in this hotel I would not have stayed here. The hotel is not close to the Old City.

Unsanitary and unsafe conditions of the Royal Crown HotelWe returned from Israel on Wednesday night December 30 2015. We took a tour by Cosmos. Amiel. and for three nights we were put in the filthiest most unsafe terrible hotel that we have ever seen. The Royal Crown hotel in Jerusalem. It should be shut down. See my posts on Travel Advisor. Our tour was excellent but we dreaded going back to the awful hotel The Royal Crown Hotel. It spoiled our trip. The staircase did not have access to the floors it was a fire hazard with no stairwell exit. The four elevators did not work so the wait at the elevator was up to 15 minutes. In front of the elevators was trash such as plastic bottles wrappers and other garbage. It had been there for some time. Since the stairwell did n\u2019t open to the floors we were trapped to non functioning elevators in a field of trash. See photos. We were shown four rooms that were all awful. We travel a lot for business and personal trips and stay at hotels a few times a month all over the world. We usually stay in Hampton Inns a level three to four hotel. so we are not comparing this hotel to luxury. We have never seen such a filthy hotel. It would not even be a one star. The first room after we waded through the trash in the hallway was shocking with substandard accommodation. The room floors were so dirty that it was obviously old dirt. It looked like sand on the rug. See photos. There was heavy black mold in the bathroom on the walls and shower curtain. The bathroom door was all banged up and looked splintered. There was something sticky on the bathroom shelf that had obviously not been cleaned. There was no mattress pad on the bed and the sheets were so old and thin and tady that the mattress looked bare. The blanket on the bed had something wet black and sticky on it. Gross. See photo. When we first saw the room we went downstairs immediately and asked for a cleaner room. Our travel guide Rafi was at the reception desk waiting for the receptionist. It took 15 minutes for her to appear. She came from the adjoining Ramada Hotel. We seemed to be in the back hotel of Ramada. It was very awful. We told the receptionist and Rafi that the room was not acceptable. She offered us another room across from the first room upon Rafi \u2019s suggestion. Director of Housekeeping Asad was called and I insisted that he and Rafi go upstairs with us. Rafi our tour guide asked the receptionist why the stairwells were locked. She did n\u2019t have an answer. In the second room on the fourth floor there was a large black spider the size of a bat which I thought it was. It came at me aggressively when I moved the curtain to get air in the room. Actually I thought that it was a bat or mouse the way it moved but my husband and the head of housekeeping Asad who had come with us to the room said that it was a spider with many legs. I was busy screaming so I could n\u2019t tell. It then went under the bed but Asad and my husband lifted the bed and could n\u2019t find it. Under the bed was a nightmare of years of filth. The shower curtain in this room had just been taken out of a package since you could see that it was still with folds so it was clean. The room smelled of a chemical and was very hot. The television and the table lights did n\u2019t work so Asad went to see why the lights did n\u2019t work except for the overhead. He tired to call the desk but the room phone did n\u2019t work. As he went down the hall to check on the electricity and to contact the front desk from another phone my husband went to use the bathroom and found blood or diarrhea dripping down on and around the toilet seat. When Asad came back we showed him so he washed it and the floor that was also soiled. Obviously we were n\u2019t going to stay in that room either. The third room on the seventh floor was a little cleaner. The bath did n\u2019t have black mold or blood on the toilet seat. However before Asad left I checked the corner of the mattress for bed bugs and there were many bloodstains on the mattress signs of bed bugs and not a clean mattress pad either. Asad noted it and suggested that we go to another room. Besides it would have been uncomfortable to be on the seventh floor since there was no stairwell access and the elevators were so slow. It was a safety issue in the event of an emergency. We had now been there for over two hours. It was about 10 PM and we did n\u2019t have a room. Asad suggested that we take a room on the first floor. It was a suite. We did n\u2019t need or care to have a suite. We only wanted a clean safe room. The suite was somewhat cleaner. A curtain was hanging off the wall precariously but Asad reatached and fixed it. The mattress had a mattress cover. The sheets were standard quality unlike the other ones. The bathroom did n\u2019t have mold and there did n\u2019t appear to be any bed bugs. It did n\u2019t look real clean but better in comparison to the other rooms. We were n\u2019t happy with the room but exhausted we needed to get to bed. My husband is 77 years old and has terminal illness. He was exhausted and we did n\u2019t know where to go for another hotel especially that late at night so we took the room. However again our room did n\u2019t have electricity to sockets or TV. The room was extremely hot. The thermostat did n\u2019t work. We had to open the window to breath. Asad called a technician to fix the electricity issues and heat. The technician came but he could only fix the electricity. The heat was up to 80 degrees in the room. Since my husband has kidney issues the excess heat was a health hazard for him. We opened the window and worried about something coming into the room. I could n\u2019t sleep all night from fear of bugs the heat and the filth. The next day when we left for breakfast we saw the male room maids folding the bath towels on the carpet in front of the elevators. How filthy. I ca n\u2019t make this stuff up. When we got to breakfast the salads had no sneeze guards and the hot foods were cold so we could n\u2019t eat the food. We could only eat bread and have the hot coffee since we were afraid of becoming sick. Another couple from our tour was at breakfast with photos of their room towels that were soiled with black marks and holes. They complained to Rafi our tour guide. Everyone was freaked out by the filth of the hotel and lack of quality of the food preparation. Rafi \u2019s explanation was that we were supposed to have been upgraded to the nicer part of the Ramada hotel. The Ramada was n\u2019t even the hotel that was on the schedule. We were supposed to have been at another hotel around the corner although it said in the brochure that hotels might be switched. I can accept that. We could not accept the filth and unsafe conditions of the Royal Crown hotel. On the third night yes we were stuck in this hotel for three nights when we needed to call reception around midnight no one answered at the reception desk security catering or guest services for over 30 minutes of our calling all numbers and letting each ring for over 5 minutes very dangerous. We were calling for help because there was a group of students sitting on the floor in the hallway in front of our door singing and joking until 130 AM. We were too tired to get dressed then wait 15 minutes for the elevator to go to the reception desk and report it. There was never anyone at the reception desk there anyway. I did report it the next morning in front of Rafi and asked to speak to the general manager Yacor Shari. He never appeared. There was only a very young woman at reception who was not capable of handling our complaint. She said that the manager was not working at that time. The hotel was such an awful experience it spoiled an otherwise lovely tour. We have filed formal complaints with Israeli tourism and the Israeli health department and of course Travelocity as well as Cosmos Amiel travel company for exposing us to such a below standard unsanitary and unsafe accommodation. The other hotels on this trip were fine not fancy but clean and comfortable. The Royal Crown Hotel should be shutdown by the health department. Israel should be ashamed to expect guests to stay there. What a blight to tourism. We hope to be refunded by Cosmos for the horrible unsafe and unsanitary conditions that we were exposed.

Do your family members pussy foot around telling you what to do. No they do not. Neither will the staff at the front desk of Ramada. They are authentically kind friendly and helpful. If you ask a direct question you will get a direct answer and that is that. The Ramada Jerusalem is kosher mehadrin meaning that Jewish law meets the most widely recognized level in the country. Your food will meet top standards and all of your Israeli friends and relatives will feel comfortable dining in all of their restaurants. The elevators function automatically on Shabat. They have their own synagogue services on Shabat as well. The hotel is modern bright and comfortable enough to meet snooty American standards I was happy there.
