Hilton must have given great thought to the layout and location for this hotel. I had the pleasure of staying at the hotel during a conference and a few things stood out. First the conference center at the Hilton is spread across several floors of the hotel but they are all conveniently accessible via elevator or escalator. I left a trade show floor and in less than a few minutes was two floors away in a meeting room. Second room access is convenient from the lobby bar restaurant area as well as the conference center. Elevators to the hotel rooms are right outside of the convention area. No more than a few minutes to get to your floor. Third you will likely want to access the Gas Lamp district and there is a foot bridge a the hotel that crosses the street and places you in front of Petco Park that is right at the lower end of the Gas Lamp district. Easy walking access to numerous restaurants.

I do not want this to be too wordy so I will start out by saying yes this is a nice clean newer hotel. I had really like to talk about the great staff especially bellhops Marcus and Claudia. My wife and I were checking in late Christmas eve night and after an arduous delayed flight a dying father at home and being denied a room with a better view by the front desk we were not exactly in the Christmas mood. Hearing our woes Bellhops Claudia and Marcus assured us that if there was anything they could do to make our stay special to not hesitate in calling on them. After settling into our room my wife and I headed out to the Gaslamp district for a late night Christmas eve dinner. When we returned to our room there was a beautiful handwritten note from both Claudia and Marcus welcoming us with a few days worth of restaurant vouchers as well as several Starbuck vouchers also delivered were some nice robes. We were touched by their kind gesture and empathy. I realize that vouchers get passed out to customers many times over but the fact that these two bellhops listened to us and took the time to leave us a kind note meant the world to us. Thanks for giving us our Christmas spirit back with your warmth and kindness Claudia and Marcus. During our short stay at the Hilton we had run into both Claudia and Marcus and they had always ask if there was anything we needed. We all know that it sucks working on holidays but you would never know that by the great attentive hardworking Bellhop and Valet crew during the Christmas holidays. it is refreshing to see employees who love their jobs.

In my honest opinion this is a hard review for me. I can say I am feeling disillusioned with my stay at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. But it has nothing to do about the facility or the location that is upsetting. It has to do with the service which is 100 fixable leaving me sad and disappointed. The facility and location is amazing especially the view. And a great place to stay when visiting San Diego. it is the little things that matter the most. The service was exactly right when thinking about corporate standard customer service. The front desk people were never overly welcoming but not rude either. NOT once did ANYONE acknowledge my gold member status which would have immediately raised the level of service or welcome me to the hotel. My first interaction with the front desk was the polite. Can I help you. Not Welcome to the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. Again I say it is the little things that matter. Are you okay with average or do you want WOWI had several issues mostly preference issues which I completely understand not being able to accommodate everything with my room but until there was a physical issue water pressure issue they did not feel the need to make things better giving me the standard corporate polite way of saying I can not help you until the water issue. only then was I able to get a new room. Again not overly excited to help me but in the end they adhered to the standard corporate policy of making it right. Also the next day I was going out to explore the city and asked the front desk for a bottle of water. Again instead of being friendly and accommodating I was questioned about if I received my water at check in and what room I was staying in. I understand standard corporate policy but IT WAS A BOTTLE OF WATERBREAKFAST with my Gold Member status I get complimentary breakfast with my stays. At this hotel I get the continental breakfast. And 10 upgrade if I want the breakfast buffet. They make continental menu impossible for diabetics to eat. 90 bread muffins bengals toast etc minimal basic fruit selection no berries of any type and high sugar cereals are your options. I brought this to the attention of the hotel staff though the text message service. They have me the corporate response of telling me that they would let the kitchen staff know. I thanked them for the response but did not receive any follow up about what they intended to do about it. And did not see any changes in the breakfast for the remainder of my stay. I have stayed at many Hilton hotels and had serval WOW experiences which I have also made reviews about. And what puts those stays in the WOW category is always the customer service and willingness to make sure the guest has a wonderful experience. I would stay here again if I had to because of the location but definitely not because of the service. I hope my honest experience helps you when making your travel decisions.

The room itself was nice and comfortable with an amazing view but lacked basic amenities that I would expect. I phoned guest services to request body wash a few glasses and even a corkscrew all of which should be standard items. After waiting 30 minutes I called to follow up and was told that there would be a delivery charge for these items and they would be delivered in 40 minutes. That was unacceptable so I went and talked to the duty manager and they were delivered but it should not have come to that. Breakfast was poor as the restaurant is clearly understaffed. I lined up for 15 minutes at the host stand for a table on one morning and was advised that it would be 20 minutes for a table. I was on crutches as I was recovering from an accident and pointed out that I can not stand for that long and asked if there was anywhere I could sit while I wait. At that point I was taken to a table immediately and to my surprise I was surrounded by empty tables that were not used at all while I was having breakfast despite the ever growing queue outside. Wifi was painfully slow and constantly dropped out. I had better speeds using my roaming mobile data on my Australian phone. Hilton Bayfront is just a huge faceless hotel with no personality.
