We were in the Ritz Carlton Buckhead for one Friday night where as platinum elite members and we were treated to some champaign in the lobby got an 80 breakfast allowance cheese platter in the room with full bottle of red wine free water bottles and valet parking. A real treat. The lobby bar was great fun for people watching on an upscale level with a better menu than their dining room. cost us 2 people about 100 for food and drink. The breakfast was from room service. can not wait to go back. Difficult to find without a GPS and in a high traffic area.

My husband and I recently stayed here for an overnight getaway. The Ritz is known for elegance service and luxury and they do many things well from the greetings at the door to the offer of wine and champagne at check in. Pros. service personnel are eager to please beautiful lobby well appointed rooms everything was clean and comfortable. Cons. decor was old fashioned no starbucks in lobby or screens anywhere except in the bar so this hotel will not appeal to young people or hipsters. it is a little stodgy but it is a classy place. We paid 369 on a weekend night and the rate included valet parking free Wi Fi and a bountiful breakfast buffet so for a Ritz I felt it was a decent value.

It cost 20ish dollars in a taxi to get down town to visit the Coca Cola expo etc but worth the cost to be staying in such a great area of Buckhead. Lots of places to eat drink and shop.

My stay started off very rough and it did not improve very much. I called three months prior to my stay and 30 hours before to confirm a specific room type. When I checked in this was not the room they had waiting for me. The young clueless guy at the front desk picked out a room for me that he said was quiet and when I got to the room not only was it facing a busy street within 60 seconds of being in the room I saw hair in 4 locations. In 60 seconds no exaggeration. On the bathroom floor on the bathroom counter on the desk in the living room and on the nightstand. This was disgusting and not even close to a five star hotel. They put me in another room that was more quiet and only had hair in two locations so I dealt with it. They felt bad for the rough check in sent up a bottle of champagne to which I \u2019m allergic. The ladies who work there are very nice. That is maybe the only plus about the hotel. If you \u2019re there for a convention there is no shuttle bus no it \u2019s not a wise location for the convention center. When I checked out I accidentally left my bag of toiletries in the bathroom. I called that evening and I got a very clueless guy name Brandon who was supposedly the security. I do n\u2019t know how he put his pants on in the morning. Definitely a young kid completely wasted my time. I spoke to him and described how I needed assistance. I asked him to repeat what I said and all he could remember was that I wanted to speak to the manager. Guess what never happened. A manager never called me. The bag had 150 of toiletries in it and they claim that it was thrown out which I do n\u2019t believe. Do n\u2019t stay at this hotel it \u2019s not even really three stars. Too bad it \u2019s not still a Ritz Carlton because they understand good service.

First off this is a beautiful hotel well decorated with very pleasant rooms. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was well stocked with plenty of towels. If I had to nit pick a little I would say the mini bar was conjured up average versus luxurious. Where the hotel was let down was at reception. Generally check in sets the tone for an entire stay and this certainly did. Not in the hotels favour. The lady who checked us in did not welcome us at all. Just asked for the reservation name told me our room was not ready took my phone number apparently so she could call me when the room was ready. She could not have been more dismissive. In fact I was rather stunned by the brevity and brusqueness to the point where I failed to ask her name. She did not suggest we go have lunch at the restaurant at the hotel or go to the bar. Nothing that may have helped the hotel earn a little goodwill and revenue. Further we never got a call about the room. Fortunately we were out visiting friends and did not get back to the hotel till 8 pm we preregistered at noon. Our check out was much more pleasant with the man thanking us for prepaying and also for choosing the hotel for being a Bonvoy member and asked whether we needed any assistance leaving the hotel.
