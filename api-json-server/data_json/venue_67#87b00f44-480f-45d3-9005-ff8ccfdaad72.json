Stayed here at the end of March 2015 for an event being held downtown. The location off Interstate 70 is very convenient. Had family stay in adjoining room 616 and their shower lost water pressure. Maintenance was called to fix the problem and it worked for a bit at least. My family decided to use our shower614 for the remainder of the stay and management compensated us for our troubles. The hotel was clean inside yet a bit dated on the outside. Nothing worth being put off though. Hotel staff was professional and nice. WiFi is free just remember you have to log back in every 24 hours. A big shout out to Julius at the bar and grill. He was eager to take our orders gave us good traffic advice and was a really cool guy. The only negatives were the traffic noise from the interstate and the construction on the interstate.

I was very pleasantly surprised by Kansas in general as this was my first trip there. The room was clean and well maintained with a fridge. I did not have time to use the tv but the screen was large and well placed. I booked a second night via the same discount website with no issue. The hotel staff kept me in the same room and I did not have to check out and check back in.

Unfortunately mother nature showed her crazy powers and the power was out when we arrived Friday afternoon.

Once the power came back on the next morning there was a delay but that is to be expected. They lost 1200 worth of food and it was just chaotic. once we got to our room we were very pleased. Clean and very nice and the bed was amazing. I really can not say enough great things about Trey and De De for being so patient with everyone and always having a smile on their face when they had to repeat 100 times to everyone that came in on Saturday to check in and they did not know what the deal was since 130 Friday am. you guys rock. thanks so much guys you made our messed up week end much better that it could of been for sure.

We stayed at the Four Points Sheraton because of the convenience to attend the Rolling Stones at Arrowhead Stadium. While the location is excellent to walk to the venue we would not ever repeat the stay. It would be much easier to choose a hotel and there are lots of choices and fight traffic and parking than repeat the stay. Upon arrival at 430 PM we were informed a room was not yet ready. Check in is 30 PM. so I am unsure why rooms were not cleaned and available. but we ended up waiting 45 minutes for a room. The room was far from clean. We had one clean towel and the bed appeared freshly made but that is where it stopped. There was trash from the last guest still in both cans. shower gel and shampoo were both empty bed skirt was filthy and the room had obviously not been vacuumed. At this point we were in a hurry to get showered and to the concert. Contact to the front desk corrected none of this. we could not even get another towel so made do with what we had. The entire room was in disrepair. The door would not close unles slammed very hard sorry other guests patio door had no handle on the outside. only the screws were it should have been and just general uncleanliness and maintenance issues. We also attempted to grab a quick bite to eat at the Sports Bar Restaurant prior to the concert. After waiting in line 15 minutes no wait staff. we were informed that they were not serving food. A restaurant not serving food would at least deserve a sign posting perhapsIt should be noted that the front desk staff was very nice. just seemed overwhelmed at what they had going on. But a concert should have been no different than a football baseball game and the hotel should be trained to handle the situation. The front desk lady stepped out yesterday as we were leaving inquiring about our stay very pleasant but I did not feel it was appropriate to unload my complaints on someone that has no control over the problems she is just working for a living like the rest of us. It is a management problem. Needless to say we would not ever consider staying here again.

We spent a recent weekend night here. When we checked in there was a man who announced that he was a paranoid schizophrenic yelling at one of the male staff in both the lobby and then outside while we were loading our luggage onto the cart that he should be allowed to stay in the lobby since the clerk who was on before the current one had let him. We were not given adjoining rooms as requested when we booked the two rooms. The tv had really spotty reception some local stations were so fuzzy that there was no way to watch them. We stayed on the 5th floor facing away from the highway and there was a large fan blowing in the hall the entire night the carpets had been wet washed that afternoon as we were entering our rooms. When we came back from a gathering around 130pm there were at least 8 cop cars in the parking lot with policemen standing outside something about a party in the bar getting out of hand and shots being fired in the parking lot. We were assured by the police that this was an unusual occurrence and that we should be safe if we stayed in our rooms. Our kids were ready to call friends to stay with at that point but we ended up staying for the night. Some of the partiers must have gotten upstairs no security measures for getting in the hotel or on the elevator since there were loud noises and people knocking on doors until around 1 am or later.

For our stay we ended up in a room that had a strong musty odor the minute we walked in. There was no fan in the bathroom so if there was moisture in the room there was no place for it to go. There was no bar soap provided in the bathroom either. All soap shampoo moisturizer was dispensed from a device in the shower which was tough for our youngest to reach.
