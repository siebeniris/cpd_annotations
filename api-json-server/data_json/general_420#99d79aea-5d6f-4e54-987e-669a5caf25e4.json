The hotel is is not bad it is very well located in the heart of Santo Domingo the only problem it is that has more than 50 years old and they had taken care about the property but you can see the age. The bed was a good place to sleep but the bathroom seems very old and outdated.

Unprofessional staff. Terrible service Terrible experience. Horrible service. Stay awayI was quoted a different price online when I arrived there I was told that there was a slight price difference. Since it was late at night I was tired because of the flight I did not bother arguing just said fine. At the check out day the total was completely different up by about 30 of the original quote. The receptionist did not know what was going on could not help or even understand my simple questions. I asked for somebody who could speak English the lady who came to help will not understand enough to answer either. At that point I decided to just pay leave since it was about an hour at the reception with no solution to the problem. I left very upset because of the discourteous unprofessional rude behavior of the staff. A week after I returned home there was another charge on my card from the hotel I ended up paying almost double of my original quote price. I called several times to address the issue even wrote them several e mails explaining the whole situation but no response or even an apology for their mistakes. No help whatsoeverThe lobby area was busy crowded. Food in the breakfast was great that was probably the only thing I can appreciate about that hotel. I had recommend considering any other option since it has been a terrible experience staying with them. For that price the least I expect is somebody who is willing to explain or at least listen. I never had such experience with other hotels in Santo Domingo.

This is a very good property but needs some more attention in customer service. Upon my arrival I had to wait for more than 20 minutes to checkin as there was only one person at the front desk. Faced the same problem at checkout. Rooms are newly done and really nice. There are couple of restaurants inside the hotel. Food is ok. Nothing great about it. The service in restaurants is below average. I think that there is lack of training of the staff. They do not bother to welcome you or open the door for you. This holds true especially for the restaurant by the pool side. I really loved the lobby area as the ambience is really very good. However the coffee shop in the lobby has a very slow service. Staff is inattentive. Had to remind them again and again for the order and even for the bill. The swimming pool is very good and a good place for relaxation. The SPA too is good.

We had stayed here in the past and had a decent stay but currently this hotel is not in good condition. The rooms have been renovated but it feels as if this was done with minimal attention to detail. For starters the rooms have motion sensors to sense when guests are not around. This will then turn off power when guests are not present to conserve energy. This sounds wonderful but has some unintended effects due to not thinking through the wiring in the room. The air conditioning is including in this power line. So during the night when guests are still the AC goes off. The rooms get hot. Also the room will not cool during the day either. No matter what time you return the room will be hot. We switched rooms and had similar issues in other rooms. Also the electrical plugs are included in this. So the phones would not charge over night. Third as soon as someone enters a room all lights will turn on in recognition of the person returning. Nice during the day. Not so nice when someone steps out to get ice at night and returns 3 minutes later to have all the lights turn on and wake up your kids. There is no option for all the lights not to turn on which is bothersome at night. The doorman is nice and the hotel is recently renovated. However the staff had minimal concerns over AC issues. Also though not under direct control of staff I am sure construction with hammers and drills starts at 8 am. So sleeping in will not be possible. The room service and restaurants were commonly out of food on their menus. The food served was average. It was OK though not what one would expect from a hotel advertised to be so nice. The staff mostly seemed confused and customer service is not up to American standards. After staying here 3 times before I did not think we will be back.
