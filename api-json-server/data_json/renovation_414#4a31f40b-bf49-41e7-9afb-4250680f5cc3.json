My husband and I stayed at the Excellence Punta Cana last June for our honeymoon from June 15th2nd. We chose to upgrade to the Excellence Club which I am not sure if I would recommend. While check in was quick and pleasant the Excellence Club lounge did not seem worth the extra money. We did have a lovely view from our room and I did enjoy the Excellence Club only side of the beach so if a better view and better beach chairs seem worth the price then go for it. We spent no time at the pool I did not fly four hours on a plane to lay out by a pool so my review will only be for the beach. The beach was gorgeous beautiful sand the water was incredible. My husband and I loved the waves I read many reviews saying the water was too rough and they were never allowed to swim but we swam every day granted you can only go out so far but we were perfectly content to body surf and swim around. The service on the beach was pretty good considering there was usually only 2 3 people serving the entire beach. They work so hard and for the most part were very pleasant so we tried to tip accordingly. The drinks were great very strong which I appreciated. They would bring out little personal pizzas around 2 pm ever day which was great. They would also bring around little mini desserts in the afternoon which was also nice. The bar and grill on the beach was too small overcrowded and the food was not good this is a theme throughout all the restaurants in the resort more on that in a minute. There was always a huge line and never enough seats. The food was usually overcooked and tasteless. Now I am an INCREDIBLY picky eat so I knew going into it that I probably would not love most of the food but my husband will eat just about anything and is not picky whatsoever even he complained about the quality of the food. Our room along with most of the resort was pretty outdated and old but as many have said there are tons of maintenance staff constantly working on the resort. I know that with being so close to the ocean wear and tear is expected and really it did not bother us too much as we were barely in our rooms except to sleep and shower. The pool seemed very lively and there were constantly activities going on there should you choose to spend time by the pool. There was also a massive swim up bar which we went to once and that was fine but not worth hanging out by the pool when there was a beautiful beach. The beach had huge queen sized beds with pillows and towels to hang out on which was so much fun and so relaxing. My husband and I took a nap on the beach almost every single day and there is nothing more heavenly than falling asleep to the sound of the ocean in the warm sun. The entertainment was pretty good nothing outstanding but nothing terrible. It was enjoyable although the service again for such a large crowd was slow and many times we had to get up and walk to a bar to get our drinks what a massive problem. right. The biggest negative of the resort and our trip and the reason why we would not return is the food. The food just was not good. It really really was not. I completely understand that they are cooking for massive amounts of people but even then it could have been better. We tried almost every single restaurant and every meal we had was just okay. I certainly would not paid for it in a restaurant. Now as I said I am a picky eater but my husband is not and he was not pleased by the food either. Even the Excellence Club Lounge which serves a much smaller amount of people had sub par food. I know it was not just us because I read many many reviews stating the same thing. Granted I thought they were being dramatic but no. The only good meal we had was the pizza which thank god for that. Also the seafood restaurant has an AMAZING breakfast which we took advantage of every day. do not go anywhere else for breakfast we found out halfway through the trip and were kicking ourselves for not going earlier. They serve fresh juice every morning and their selections were so tasty. Between that the pizza served on the beach and two pizzas to go every night after we forced our way through a gross dinner at one of the other restaurants was our only saving grace. We literally lived off the pizza I am not sure if it was just because the other food was so bad. we were so hungry. had been drinking all day but that pizza was amazing. They stayed open until 2 am so after you are done taking in the shows and dancing at the discotech you could stop by and grab a pizza to take back to your room and that is exactly what we did. I was incredibly disappointed by the food and it honestly marred what would have been otherwise a pretty perfect hotel stay. I have heard the Excellence in Mexico has much better food so maybe we will try there next time. Also I wanted to address the weather which not too many people did. I stressed so much about the weather in the weeks leading up to our trip especially because I would check the weather and it would say 80 chance of rain every day. I can only speak for our experience but the weather was absolutely gorgeous during our entire stay. If it did rain it was during the night time and I believe one afternoon it rained for maybe 20 minutes and then went away and it was back to sunshine. There were some mornings it would start out a little cloudy but by 11 12 it was blue skies all day truly so wonderful. So if you check the weather and it says rain every day when you go do not necessarily assume that it is going to be raining all day every day. It is tropical so there are some quick rain storms that blow in but before you know it they are gone and it never ruined our time at all. Overall I would give it 35 stars for the beautiful beach the lovely staff members who were so kind and so hard working and the strong drinks.", "offset": [1850, 2008], "date": "2015-05-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "11dd8e0d-74f2-46f9-818e-e0176e5850a2", "sentence": "3 star resort at a 5 star price. My wife and I celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary at the resort from October 12 17. We have celebrated previous anniversaries at Excellence Riveria Cancun twice and Excellence Playa mujeres once before this trip. We have always stayed at the club level. Since our first trip to Riveria Cancun there has been a decreased level of service. When we first visited the Excellence 5 years ago we experienced 5 star service. Since then we have only received 3 star at best including this visit to Punta Cana. Here is our review of this resort. CHECK IN 2 starsUpon arrival we were greeted with the standard Welcome Home cold towel and glass of cheap champagne. We were shown to the club check in and ushered upstairs because all of the attendants were occupied. One of the attendants took our passports and disappeared. On previous visits we were given personal one on one service which you would expect at the club level and at a 5 star resort. The check in was anything but personal service. We waited for about 20 minutes while several people asked our name so they could give us our room keys. It was completely unorganized and completely not personalized like previous visits. The club concierge seemed to be completely overwhelmed because there were several couples checking in at the same time. Finally the person who left with our passports returned with them and our room keys. We were given no overview of the property just sent with the bellman and our lugage to our room. Every previous time in Cancun we checked in we were given personal service which you would expect from a 5 star resort. ROOM 3 starsWe arranged for a Ocean View Suite. BEWARE some ocean view suites are ground level and there is little to no ocean view. We originally were placed in building 14 ground floor but were able to move the next day to building 1. See pictures. Bldg 14 closer to club. Bldg 1 closer to lobby. Both rooms confirmed that the property is dated and in need of repair. The rooms are clean and the staff does an amazing job keeping everything clean but repairs are needed bad. Antonio at the club concierge did manage to get us moved from building 14 to 1 the next day but make sure you are ok with ground level if you get the club excellence suite because there is little or no view of the ocean. Bldg 14 pic 1. Bldg 1 pic 2. FOOD 3 stars. Breakfast buffet and Agave were the only bright spots here. The other restaurants all lacked both in quality and service. I was told that I could not get a martini at the French or Asian restaurant but had no problem at the Mexican. My wife ordered a Diet Coke at breakfast one morning and the next there were no diet cokes available. She just started bringing her own from the mini bar each morning so there was not a problem. At a 5 star resort I would not think either would be a problem. But here it was. The food at the French restaurant was horrible. The others were ok but not spectacular. There is no habatchi grill at the Asian restaurant where they cook the food on the grill in front of you here like in Cancun. BEACH POOL GROUNDS 4 starsImaculate. Only complaint was bar service was real slow to almost non existent but we were real close to the bar in the club section so it was an easy walk to get Daniel to make us drinks. We tipped our server on the beach and at the bar but it did not seem to make a difference in quality of drinks or service. ENTERTAINMENT 3 stars. Same shows at the resorts in Cancun. No variety. If you have not seen them before then they are ok. But they are the same between all excellence resorts. DRINKS. 4 starsBeside the issue already stated the drinks were good. We tipped a buck here and there but do not think it made a difference. We never tried the drink of the day. But the drinks we had were good. ROOM SERVICE. 2 starsdid not bring our complete order and it was luke warm. We would have tried it more but had a bad experience. So we passed after we had a bad experience. DIFFERENCES. There are a lot of similarities in the properties food and amenities between the 3 excellence resorts. The beach is probably the best asset of the Punta Cana resort. There is an obvious language barrier that we did not experience in Cancun. I did use google translate to leave a note in Spanish to the person restocking the mini bar. Amazingly he she left exactly what we requested on two occasions. OVERALL 3 stars. Like I said we have stayed at excellence in Cancun 3 previous times. We have also stayed at 6 other resorts in Cancun and Jamaica and Bahamas. All 3 4 stars. Excellence Punta Cana is comparable to couples negril sun palace in Cancun and the Sheraton cable beach resort in Bahamas. All of those are 3 4 star all inclusive and are priced accordingly. I can say that since our 1st visit to Excellence the level of service has decreased dramatically. On our 1st visit to excellence Riveria we were treated with 5 star service every day of our visit. We were greeted at the club at check in with personal service. The food was phenomenal. The beach club concierge knew us by name and brought us a special dessert on the beach for our anniversary that was a complete surprise. That level of service has not been duplicated since our first visit. We do not expect over the top service all the time but a 5 star resort should be able to handle a simple request like a martini at the French restaurant or a Diet Coke at breakfast. We would like to think that Excellence Punta Cana has the potential to be a 5 star resort. But saying you are a 5 star resort and charging a 5 star resort price is one thing but actually living up to that rating is another. For anyone who has stayed at any of the resorts mentioned above in Cancun Jamaica or the Bahamas this resort is comparable to those. So for your money you would be better off staying at the sun palace or couples negril because the food service and amenities are the same at a lower price. We are disappointed because we experienced 5 star service when we first visited Excellence 5 years ago but since then the service has decreased. Suggestion save your money and stay at a 3 star resort that charges3 star resort prices and you will not be disappointed.", "offset": [1933, 2003], "date": "2015-10-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "9dac39ed-0332-4eab-a3a4-cf639695095d", "sentence": "Great Stay. Lovely people at this hotel. The staff can not do enough for you. The grounds and pool areas are very well maintained. The entertainment programme is good but they should lose the Brazilian show. boring. MJ was by far the best and the 70s show was not too bad either. The reason I have given it 4 stars is because the rooms are very tired and could do with an update. The room felt constantly damp and even when putting clean clothes on they were damp. The chefs really do try with the food but it is not 5 standard for me. The NYE dinner was a bit of a shocker. I think they got a lot of complaints. The forced fun of being stuck on a group table was a little odd. A word of warning be careful on the beach with insects. It seemed a lot of people who were chilling at the beach were eaten alive by mosquitos or sand flies. We stayed by the pool so were okay but a lot of people had huge sores on their legs. It seemed that some of the rooms on the ground floor suffered from being infested by ants. We heard this from 3 other couples.

My husband and I stayed at Excellence Punta Cana from April 4 thru April 11. We are in our 30s and we have stayed at an Excellence All Inclusive before. Check in out. The lobby is so beautiful. It blew us away how tropical and open air it was. They greeted us with sparkling wine tagged our luggage and sent us up to the reception desk. We arrived at the resort around 130 in the afternoon so it was not busy but neither did we expect to get our room immediately check in is officially 3 pm. Reynaldo helped us at reception and he was WONDERFUL. Super friendly and gregarious he called me boss LOL. and when I reiterated the room requests we had made top floor building around the cascade pool he told me they had the perfect room for us as long as we were okay with a view of the pool instead of a garden. It was perfect. We finished the check in process and were directed to the nearby Martini bar to get a drink and sit a few minutes until our room was ready. So even though it was an hour before official check in time a bellman with our luggage escorted us to our room within minutes. Check out was just as friendly and efficient. They tagged our bags and stored them while we got some lunch before our transport was due to arrive. Alexander was very sweet to us again and when I said we would be back he said \u201c When. Next week \u201d. And we all laughed. RomWe reserved a Jr Suite Garden View Non club. and we were given room 201 top floor and overlooking the cascade pool. We were extremely happy with our room. They are renovating this summer fall so yes the rooms are a bit \u201c lived in \u201d right now. They are clean they have everything you need and seriously how much are you in your room. We were there to shower and to sleep. Our mini bar was fully stocked upon arrival with sodas water beer Oreos crackers and 3 full liquor bottles that we never opened. There was also a coffee maker and supplies but we never used it. There were 2 terry cloth robes with slippers hanging in the closet and the bed was decorated with balloons and a towel cake because I had told Reynaldo it was my husband \u2019s birthday Such a sweet gesture. We were also presented with a bottle of sparkling wine and a dish of fresh fruit. They typically offer this to guests who have indicated they are vacationing for a honeymoon anniversary birthday etc. We met a big group of people at the pool one day so we brought down the sparkling wine and some orange juice and shared with them \u2013 it was a lot of fun. The bed was very firm. We slept on it the first night and were a bit sore in the morning but still able to move. We requested a mattress topper and Alexander made sure it was done before bedtime. He also told us if the bed was still too firm we could request another which we did the next day. With 2 toppers the bed was pretty good but I do hope better softer. mattresses are part of the renovation plan this summer. There are several staff who take care of the rooms \u2013 maid mini bar restock turn down service. If you are in and out of your room a lot or spend a lot of time in your room you may run into these people. I read a lot of reviews who were annoyed by this but seriously \u2013 they have 450 rooms to care for and only so many staff rooms got ta get done. sometime. I fail to understand how this is such a major disruption. When we left our room in the morning we would n\u2019t go back until late afternoon \u2013 we almost never saw any of the staff in our room. Every morning I set out a dollar or two on the mini bar and a dollar or two by the tub for the bar stocker and the maid. If we had special requests I left a note in Spanish with the tip get Google Translate on your phone and download the Spanish dictionary so you can translate without data or wifi. I also left little thank you notes when we received towel art or rose petals on the bed or what have you. Our room was cleaned every day no idea if my tipping or notes had an impact on that our mini bar was stocked every day and all requests fulfilled and we received turn down service every night. We were extremely happy with the attention given our room. There is a safe in the room and you should use it. We put our money credit cards passports IDs and jewelry in the safe and we also checked the contents at least once a day to ensure everything was still there. You are responsible for your own belongings be smart. Hot water was plentiful the air con worked. great. make sure the balcony door is fully shut or the air con will not run and though our phone did not work at first my request to have it fixed was promptly dealt with. There is a window in the shower that basically gives the bed a view of the toilet \u2013 we hung a towel on the shower door and that solved it. Wifi in our room was surprisingly good \u2013 as good as in the Lobby. BEST wifi connection at the resort was at the pool down by buildings 10 11 and 14Pols. There are 2 pools at the resort and at the time of stay neither was designated an Excellence Club only pool \u2013 I suppose that could change after renovations. Our room looked over the cascade pool a quieter area with just a few loungers and beds but also its own bar not in pool. The main pool is lazy river style wandering down the resort property along the beach you can usually hear the waves crashing from the pool. There are active sections with volleyball net or in pool bar and also quieter sections with a little waterfall so you can find a spot that makes you perfectly happy. There are blue foam pool floats but there are nowhere near enough for every guest. Bring inflatables from home if you want a guaranteed float every day. They pack up the floats every night and release them back into the pool between 8 and 9 am. We often found piles of them in the corner by the in pool bar. Please please please if you go do not take a pool float and store it under your lounger or pull it up onto your polside patio this is beyond RUDE and the main reason why people have a hard time finding floats later. It does not belong to you. Or to avoid this first world problem just pack some inflatables. We got super ticked one day because a polside patio had 2 floats tucked up behind their chairs and not a person in sight. We took one not gon na lie and we did n\u2019t feel remotely bad about it. The pool beach rules stipulate you can not reserve loungers. People do anyway. We found it very easy to wake up early in the morning when your day consists of lying or floating around. and often had our choice of loungers. We would get towels and hang out at our seats for about 20 minutes before heading off to breakfast. We were never gone more than 30 minutes and our belongings were never removed by staff. However even what we did is still technically against the rules and I could n\u2019t have been mad if we got back to our seats to find our belongings removed. Just because everyone is breaking the rule does n\u2019t mean it \u2019s not still a rule keep that in mind. The staff keep the pool very clean. We got to the pool so early we often saw them cleaning. The pool is slightly heated but the temp is uneven throughout. It is various depths as well sometimes barely 3 feet other places over 4 feet. There is drink service around the pool but the waiters may take some time getting back to you. Remember they are serving lots of people. If you want a drink now darn it now go walk 5 feet to the nearest bar and get it yourself. In the afternoon they sometimes walk around with personal pizzas to give out. Beach. The beach here is AMAZING. They keep it very clean carting away all the seaweed each morning. It is very large and the sand is tan fairly fine and soft. The surf is very rough. If you love ocean swimming and that will make or break your trip you should choose another resort. We went into the water once and jumped the waves it was fun but exhausting. There is a very strong near constant breeze coming up off the water and the waves just keep pounding. I loved it personally because you could hear the waves even off the beach and the strong breeze helped keep us from sweating to death. We briefly went to another beach that had no breeze and even in the shade we were wilting within 5 minutes. No shells to collect on this beach as I imagine the waves pulverize them. There are no other resorts in the immediate vicinity of EPC which means the beach is quiet and private. You can walk in either direction for a long time without coming on another resort. There is a lot of seating on the beach however the loungers under palapas get snatched up even earlier than at the pool. I highly suspect people go down early claim a beach spot and then go to the pool for the morning. Again there are rules against this and you should not be upset if your items are removed by staff. There is drink service on the beach also but again the waiters may take a while like 10 15 minutes. We were never dissatisfied. Spa. I got a pedicure and the service was great. I actually missed my appointment and went to the concierge the next day to find out if I would be billed for it and she just got me rescheduled for that same day. I arrived a few minutes early and ended up waiting maybe 20 minutes because a party of 3 older men were just finishing their pedicures. My pedicure was done by Libeth and she was very sweet. I think she did an excellent job and I loved the OPI polish colors they had available. It cost 55 and I felt for a resort that was a fair price. The spa is lovely and I \u2019m sure the other treatments are high quality as well. There are specials everyday listed in the Excellence Times the newsleterBars. There \u2019s something like 9 bars at this resort so you \u2019re never far from your next drink. Hence why we never opened the liquor bottles in our room. All bars are well stocked but not necessarily with the same stuff. I was able to get Bacardi Gold at one place but not another \u2013. so just be aware they have what you want. somewhere. but maybe not everywhere. You have to ask for a specific liquor if you want top shelf otherwise they will use well but they are not light handed with the pour. Some of our favorite drinks were Iceberg beer with frozen margarita float Banana Mama coconut banana vodka grenadine Coco Loco the famous drink served in a coconut and Mud Slide. The only time I felt I got a weak drink was at the Star bar by the performance stage. Restaurants. Food is so subjective so I \u2019l keep this short. We are not foodies we live in the mid west. We do have access to plenty of ethnic food of various authenticities. Overall we were very happy with the quality of the food at this resort and we never went hungry. The breakfast and lunch buffets have so much on offer you can definitely find something you like. We also lunched at the Grill once the nachos portion is huge. and Las Olas a couple of times. Las Olas has decent \u201c quick \u201d food nachos hot dogs fries pizza but the flow of traffic is confusing. It is technically a buffet but people loiter and wait for pizzas to come out of the oven which confuses things. Do n\u2019t be afraid to ask someone what to do the guests and staff are all friendly and helpful. For dinners we ate at Lobster House Spice x2 Chez Isabele x2 Agave and Dominican Night. The lobster is decent but is not sweet like Maine lobster manage your expectations. We each ordered a second lobster plate because you can totally do that. Pad Thai at Spice was far better than any Pad Thai I can get at home and husband loved the spicy bento. Chez Isabele two good choices chateaubriand was delicious but the prime rib was to DIE for. Some kind of garlic butter on top that I wanted to lick off my plate. Joel was our waiter at Chez and he was so sweet and lovely I just adored him. Agave was good Mexican food I liked it more than I expected to. Dominican Night was an interesting experience but other than the fresh veggies we did n\u2019t like much. We ended up at the Grill for dessert that night. This might not be 5 star dining but service is great there is good food to be had and you will not go hungry. There were 3 whole restaurants we never even tried because we wanted to repeat some we ate at before. If you have an iffy tummy I get Traveler \u2019s Sickness almost every time I travel I would recommend bringing Pepto tablets and pro biotic pills. The food is safe it \u2019s just a different country with different flora. Activities Shows. The entertainment team work their butts off every day from 10 am to at least 10 pm. A variety of activities are scheduled everyday around the main pool. We participated in pool side bingo one day that was fun. Every night they have a live show on their performance stage. We actually only made it to 1 the Michael Jackson show. Shows start at 930pm and we are early risers so we were often back in our room by 9 pm. The shows are average but a good opportunity to have another drink and maybe socialize with some other guests. We really liked the activities at the sports bar. It is kind of tucked away and hard to find if you do n\u2019t have a map or know where it is but it \u2019s worth seeking out. Pool tables ping pong TVs playing various sports and a 9 hole mini golf area. Everything but the mini golf is under a thatched roof so it is pretty cool in there. We liked to escape the high heat of the day there and play some ping pong. The bar has a larger beer selection plus pastries sandwiches and ice cream. Overall Service If you are kind to the staff and ask not demand for anything they will bend over backwards to make it happen. Manage your expectations. The staff work so hard but they do sometimes forget to follow through on something. Any requests we had for our room light fixture needed fixed add mattress topper to the bed etc. we made in person at the reception desk. I honestly think it made a difference. Reynaldo and Alexander were wonderful to us and they would follow up to make sure the issues were dealt with. They remembered our names for heaven \u2019s sake. 450 rooms of rotating guests and they remembered. our names. Be kind be gracious be understanding that mistakes happen. You are on vacation from work you are not on vacation from basic manners and decency. We came prepared to tip. No you do not have to tip but if you understood how hard the staff work and for rather little money and spend so much time away from their own families then you would see why tipping is such a huge kindness for them. We tipped for pretty much every drink every meal every \u201c above and beyond \u201d treatment or service we felt we received and we were happy to do it. I found the staff to be very thankful for it but not at all behaving as though they expected it. Overall Resort. We. LOVE. Excellence Punta Cana. The beautiful lobby and the fact you can see and hear the ocean from the reception desk had me babbling with joy. They have truly tried to create a paradise. It is luxurious in a tropical way not in a sleek modern way. I hope the resort retains its tropical charm after the renovations this year. The rooms may be showing their age but the public grounds of the resort do not seem old or tired they are like a lush beachy jungle. The staff are always cleaning. They fastidiously groom the plant beds the floors the sand on the beach the bathrooms everything. The WiFi was far better than we were expecting. Based on other trip advisor reviews I thought I might get online once a day if I sat in the Lobby. In fact there is very good WiFi signal pretty much everywhere but the beach. Signal strength does not equal connectivity however. I think the sheer number of people trying to use the WiFi often overwhelms the system. Connectivity is best early in the morning late at night and any time of day at the quiet end of the main pool. A note on the Excellence Club People go back and forth about whether or not the upgrade is worth it. We were non club and we had the most amazing vacation ever. The only noticeable upgrade from our perspective was the Club only beach section which had very nice shaded lounge beds but they were all crowded on top of each other. After reading hundreds of trip advisor reviews and then actually going to this resort I \u2019m of the opinion that Excellence Club guests are often the least happy people. I think they may be less happy because what they have paid for their Excellence Club room is not matching up with their expectations of what that extra cost should supply them. Manage your expectations. We paid for the cheapest room at the resort and felt like we had died and gone to heaven. We also do n\u2019t think it is a crime if a beach waiter forgets to bring our drink so we have to go get our own. The bar is like right freaking there. Maybe the Excellence Club will offer more obvious upgrades after the renovations but for now I \u2019d say most people would be happier paying less for a room and living with the standard amenities which are already pretty awesome.", "offset": [2862, 2917], "date": "2017-04-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "f0b5248d-480b-421a-9db9-3f49fab98c48", "sentence": "My vacation.

I understand the hotel is currently undergoing renovations but I hope they leave the landscaping as it is. I have enlarged and framed several pictures of the grounds I took from my phone which are now hanging in my home. The park right across from the lobby and the wildlife in it are amazing. can not wait to see the finished product. can not say enough about Andre our beach server. Always at the ready with our favorite beverage.", "offset": [236, 342], "date": "2017-05-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "8d6fb238-d7bf-4cd0-ad86-6f6dd1f6ce28", "sentence": "Outstanding. This was our third visit to the EPC and one that we introduced our daughter and her boyfriend to. Once again we had a fantastic stay in our favourite room and one of our favourite views of the ocean requested and provided by the wonderful reception staff thanks guys. Food was excelente especially in Chez Isabella with the wonderful manager Raphael and our waiter Joel who never stopped smiling an absolute joy. Also a massive thank you to the staff in the Flavor Market who went out of their way to make our daughters birthday a memorable occasion again great food guys. Unfortunately we felt that the food and the waiter in the Lobster House failed to come up to expected standards as the fish was overlooked and a refusal by the waiter to serve champagne that is on offer in all other restaurants. Big thank you to Naomi guest services who went that extra mile to make our daughter and her boyfriends stay one that they will not forget. The flowers and special touches in the room made a great stay for them. Finally a big shout out to Junior and Felix in the entertainment team who were always up for a laugh and went out of their way to make all guests feel welcome.

Some advice for future travelersWe have stayed at Excellence several times and always recommend this place to everyone we can that wants the perfect vacation. Well to our disappointment the resort was closed for a remodel when we had time off for our vacation. We decided to venture out and try another resort in the DR. We booked Barcelo Bavaro Beach adults only premium level. This cost about a 1000 more to book premium and were hopeful it would be amazing. We stayed for seven nights and wished everyday we could have been at a resort that says welcome home. Excellence resortIf you have stayed or are looking at booking a trip at Excellence resort in Punta Cana you will NEVER be disappointed. I attempted to compare resorts and could not even come close. I will attempt to break it down a little from resort to resort. Excellence resort first. Service 10They catered to our very need from the time we arrived to the sad day we had to depart. They truly make you feel like family. Rooms. There basic rooms are wonderful. They just remodeled so looking forward to see some updates. Food Very good and the best part is they require zero reservations. This is a big plus when you want to relax and take your time getting to your destination. If you wana eat at one place and try another it is encouraged by the resort. They want you going back to your room happy. and while we are talking about food the have 247 room service that is included in your price. Pools. AMAZING. huge winding pools with swim up bars that poor the best drinks. Tipping them is not required but they really deserve it. Staff They are the happiest people ever. Anything we needed or requested it was done without question. We never were without a drink or food at any time during any stay. Grounds. Beautiful and always being worked on by gardeners. Beach. Very nice just not the best for swimming. Now for the resort we stayed at Barcelo Bavaro beach adults onlyResort was beautiful the food was good but the service was the worst ever. They have no swim up bars so your having to get your own drinks when your trying to relax. Pool was small the rooms are falling apart even in the premium level. I could go on and on and hate to complain I will end with highly recommending the best resort in the DR as Excellence resort.

You must go to The Grill restaurant special thanks to Soloman. Chez Isabella is also a must. We would also like to thank the customer relations manager Yepfries what a guy he really is a credit to this hotel and we look forward to seeing you again soon.

They are extremely friendly and helpful. They made our stay extra special arranging for our tables at dinner was decorated with petals etc on both our birthdays. Our room 309 was stunning this year and far exceeded our expectations. We have just paid for our April 2018 trip and we are looking forward to returning and seeing old staff and new in the renovated resort. I think room 309 is now part of Excellence Club so we may upgrade in the hope of staying in this room again.

My girlfriend came down with the flu on our second day and confined herself to bed for most of our stay. Room. We splurged on a honeymoon suite with a rooftop area. The suite was simply stunning. Two large rooms with two bathrooms a beautiful pool ocean view from the balcony plus a rooftop area with lounges a small pool ocean and lagoon views even a bed and shower. Renovations. This was our fourth or fifth trip to Excellence Punta Cana but our first since the renovations. They made a great resort even better. There are more lounges more and larger palapas and a beachfront boardwalk with lounges under palapas. This was the first time we could sit in the shade by either the pool or the beach and we did not have to walk over sand unles we wanted to. Previously all the shaded polside lounges were reserved by 7 AMOutstanding employees Luz happy that she is still here. We know her from prior visitsSoliWait staff Eliezer Chez IsabeleFront desk Concierge Daisy WOW. Super helpful when my girlfriend became ill and Victor. Doctor Really more oriented to sprains and sunburn than internal medicine. Her suggestion was to go to the hospital for an x ray. Luckily we knew the right medicines and dosages and in the Dominican Republic many medications that require a prescription in the US are available over the counter. Daisy at the concierge desk arranged for delivery from a local pharmacy and I was able to find cough remedies in the on premises pharmacy. Communications Very good WiFi coverage throughout the campus even in the beachside boardwalk palapas. Regular cell phone coverage is poor. I have an international plan from my carrier but could not sustain a connection to the local service long enough to complete a call. Minor problems most of this review is about problems but they did not detract very much from the overall experienceNo hooks anywhere in the room. You go into the bathroom wearing the robe they provide for your use and there is no place to hang it up. I ended up hanging my hat on the the front door lever. No handle on the outside of the sliding door to the balcony. If the door is closed but not latched see below you have to squeeze your fingers into the gasket to get it open. You can not leave the door open because that turns off the air conditioning in the room. At one point we were sitting on the balcony when housekeeping came in. She cleaned the balcony and then went inside closing the door behind her. And latching it. We had no way to get back into the room. Luckily we had the room phone with us. I dialed 0 and they sent somebody to free us very quickly. If we had not had the phone we had have been out of luck as there is no cell service. No end tables next to the bed. there is no place to put a clock glasses cell phone nighttime medications water etc. there is a shelf above the bed but it is too high for easy access in the middle of the night. No handrail on the stairs to the rooftop we did not feel secure on the steps. Also there is a very low bridge support joist in the rooftop area. I bonked myself on the head and I am only 58 on a good day. Elevator For years we insisted on first floor rooms because our backs are not up to negotiating stairs several times a day and the elevators only one to a building with no upper floor connection between buildings were often out of service. This time \u2014 mainly because we knew about the recent renovations \u2014 we took an upper floor room. The elevator was iffy. Most of the time it worked fine but often it took us to our floor and the door did not open. We quickly learned to push the door open when necessary but I wondered about the long term effect of that on the elevators reliability. I did not wonder for long. A week into our stay the elevator broke down entirely. My girlfriend just out of her sick bed had to walk down two flights slowly and cautiously. Luckily the elevator was fixed before we had to climb back up thanks to Victor who got our building moved up in the priority list. Entertainment We were not up to going to any of the shows. We like the nightly live jazz but it is at the lobby bar where many people smoke and our lungs will not let us stay very long. Room service We used it a lot because my girlfriend was not up to going to restaurants. We learned quickly that you can not go off menu with room service. Food Very good but it is made with a large amount of salt in all the food except raw fruits and salads. Even the Dasani bottled water the resort provides has salts of calcium magnesium and sodium. You can ask for your food to be prepared without salt. We ate at Chez Isabele French Oregano Italian Magna Excellence Club Only. the Grill House and Spice Asian and enjoyed all of them. Chez Isabele was our favorite. Twice I had a burger for lunch. Both times I asked for rare. One came out well done. The other came our very VERY well done. I suspect that well done only is Excellence policy as it is in many chain restaurants Stateside. BTW the pineapple is excellent better than we got in Hawaii. Excellence Club. This was the first time we had a Club room. There is a much greater division between club and non club guests than there was before the renovations. there is a new restaurant Magna for club members only and a new club only pool. In addition the Cascade pool is club only and there are four club only bars. there is still a club only section of beachfront but we did not use that because our room was too far away. We were very happy with the regular beachfront palapas. One Really REALLY Good Thing No timeshare pitches. I hate those. I do go on the tours sometimes if they bribe us enough but I hate them and I never ever buy. it is a major annoyance and Excellence Punta Cana is happily timeshare freParting shots On our last night there was a severe thunderstorm with heavy rain. The next morning we found the ceiling was leaking over the entrance door and some plaster had fallen. I put down towels to soak up the water and reported it. No big deal. We went down to breakfast and on our way back we found. you guessed it. The elevator was not working. We had to walk up. The elevator was fixed by the time we had to go down. Overall I think we would have had an excellent time if my girlfriend had not gotten sick again I want to emphasize that she did not have stomach issues and based on what I know about incubation periods she was infected before we arrived. We would definitely go back.", "offset": [545, 640], "date": "2018-03-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "b6317e03-9d3d-4634-979f-70fc7479371e", "sentence": "Excellence Punta Cana gets even better. Just spent another 10 nights at the refurbished Excellence Punta Cana. We are repeat visitors to this wonderful hotel and to be honest we were unsure if the changes they had made would improve an already fabulous hotel or spoil it. We were not disappointed and to our amazement they have made our favourite holiday even more enjoyable. We had a garden view junior suite in the Excellence Club Block 4 room 412 and the room was luxurious. The changes they have made in particular the changes to the location of the restaurants has improved the layout of the hotel and the addition of the Magna restaurant for Excellence Club guests is a great improvement as is the coffee shop. The best asset both these places have is their blend of staff. They were all amazing. Yoel and his team at the Magna and Hertrudis and Amal at the coffee shop deserve special mention. I am only mentioning the additional restaurant and the coffee shop but all the other restaurants were exactly as we expected excellent quality and great choices of menu served by a great team. We can not wait to return early September and this hotel remains our perfect holiday destination.

This was only the second all inclusive resort we have been to because I usually like to do and see as much as possible on vacation but what an incredible place. Upon our arrival we were greeted with cool damp hand towels and champagne as soon as we arrived at the entrance to the resort. Our room was bright clean recently updated and spacious. We stayed in a Junior Swim Up Suite and would definitely do so again. Just a few steps from our private patio with cabana and into the pool. The staff could not have been friendlier and more helpful. They were also fluent in English. We usually had breakfast and a few time lunch in the main dining area where the buffet is. The area is large beautiful air conditioned and the food is not only delicious but there is a seemingly endless variety of options. When I booked online there was a place to indicate if you were celebrating anything special so I advised it was our 40th anniversary. There was a tray of chocolate covered strawberries fresh fruit and a bottle of champagne in our room when we arrived. They also placed anAniversary banner on the outside of the door and provided breakfast in bed on the morning of our choosing. We had dinner in a different restaurant every night and they were all terrific. The food and presentations were excellent and the staff in the restaurants and buffet area were friendly and attentive. No reservations are required in the restaurants and there is no limit to how many times you may eat in any of them unlike some other resorts. The huge dinner buffet one night on the beach with entertainment was an unexpected pleasure. The pools are large and extend through most of the resort with bars polside as well as a swim up bar. I only visited the swim up bar once because there was a polside bar on the opposite side of the pool from our suite. Waitstaf would take your drink orders and deliver them to you in the pool. It could not have been easier or more relaxing. There are hundreds of covered lounges and chairs both polside and on the beach. The beach is large and clean and yes there is bar service at your lounger on the beach available also as staff would come around to ask if there is anything you needed. We stayed at the resort the entire week which is unusual for me since I like to explore new areas but we traveled with three other couples and some of them arranged excursions or trips through the resort and all had positive experiences. All four couples agree that we would like to return here and I give them a rating of five because six is not available.", "offset": [317, 373], "date": "2018-07-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "e4bbc80e-f915-430e-b9e9-ee92b804c24e", "sentence": "This was our second time visiting this beautiful resort this time with our extended family for new years and it was an overall fantastic stay. The renovations are great the rooms are brighter and more spacious the gym is the best in any resort we have seen the restaurants offer a nice variety and the staff is superb. This being our second time we had a couple of disappointments first was the entertainment the quality of the productions and performers was not as good as 3 years ago Dining our first trip were a party of 2 and had zero issues however this time being a party of 6 it was impossible to get a table at the time we wanted as there were no reservations required we had to wait often for at least 30 45 min to be seated. we ended up sending a member from our party each day to put our name on the waitlist ahead of time. Our main complaint was the new Hibachi restaurant it only has room for 10 and you had to line up at 815am one person from each room before the office opened at 9 am if you wanted to get in for dinner that event. In the end it was NOT worth the wait. The room for this was inside the Aisan restaurant and was tiny with just one cooking table the food mediocre and while the chef was very entertaining it was not at all worth the hassle skip it.
