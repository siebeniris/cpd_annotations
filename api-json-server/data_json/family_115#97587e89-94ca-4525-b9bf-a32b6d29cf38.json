The Renaissance is a very odd property and not representative of my previous experiences. Firstly the resort is oddly proportioned. While it may work as a conference center I found it unappealing for a short holiday break over New Years. Major problems 1. Not recognized as Platinum upon arrival though I was upgraded to a corner room. 2. Room was dated with poor ventilation and the heating unit only about 3 feet from my head. 3. Cold spell and due to uneven heat in the room I wanted extra blankets. Housekeeping brought me a torn and frayed thin blanket. Upon unfolding it I found stains and hair strands which were not mine. Worried about cleanliness I checked the blanket under the duvet and found that stained as well. Very unpleasant experience. Housekeeping did apoligize and changed both blankets but they were replaced by frayed thin blankets albeit clean4. Staff seemed oddly robotic and tended to clump together. Perhaps this was because the place is so cavernous and strangely laid out. Because of the dirty bed linens we received a bottle of sparkling wine and strawberries in our room but this did no make up for our disappointment with the property. Never again.", "offset": [233, 338], "date": "2015-01-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f5d53214-9066-4aff-a2d3-ff86dab88660", "sentence": "Memorable Stay. We have been vacationing in the area for years. Our recent 2night stay was one of the best ever. The property itself is beautiful but the staff really make it stand out. The bell captain and staff were very friendly and efficient. They made us feel as if we were the only guest. We dined one night in the Sushi restaurant. Food was excellent and our waiter was superb. Also dined at the pool bar and their service was impecable. To top it all off we had a beautiful upgraded corner room with mountain views.

Two things caused me to downgrade to a 4 instead of a 5 one day our room was not cleaned when we returned from a day of hiking. Normally we would have call housekeeping but we wanted to just take showers and relax. The other was one of our sinks hot water was down to a trickle. Because we had a second sink we did not sweat it. The rooms were a good size and the staff was terrific. La Quinta was charming. We were surprised that there was no gift shop for sundries.

We have been staying at this Hyat Hotel for the past 18 summers. We always feel so welcome and well taken care of. Breakfast staff is so friendly and food is good The only draw back we found this last summer was that they allowed dogs. We had a barking dog near our room and the fact that a dog might have stayed in our room does not seem sanitary to us. You also have to time your stay just right or you might be there when they have events with large groups.

My friend and I attended the BNP Paribas Tennis Open in March. The hotel is almost attached to the Hyat so be careful that you check into the right one. This hotel shared a shuttle with the Hyat and we were picked up and dropped off first on the route. This was an advantage as sometimes we would fill the bus and those at the Hyat had to wait for another one on pick up at the hotel anyway. Checking in was very very simple and the receptionist was cheerful and kind. Our room was perfect. It faced the golf course and mountains up on the fifth floor. The room in general was quite clean in all aspects and met all expectations. The closet is unique in that you can enter it from the bathroom or the bedroom areas. The pool is spectacular and quite large with several smaller intimate areas to sit with a group. We also ate one night down by the bar area. The ambiance is just so so inside however when it gets dark there are some wonderful gathering areas just outside that gather around fire pits for conversation and cocktails. I can not say we had much interaction with staff. That is one thing that was missing. I also did not find an area to do some of my work away from home even on vacation I still would have liked easy access to a computer did not bring mine. My favorite was the little coffee shop outside the elevators. They served Starbucks coffee and had fruit and parfaits for options. Really fast service.

This is our third visit to Indian wells and our 4th hotel to visit there. This was our least favorite considering price and third least favorite if all prices were the same. Nothing is really wrong with the hotel. It was quiet and the bed was comfortable. The hotel lobby pool outdoor patio bar area and grounds are very pretty. There is a beach entry pool for the kids though we did not come with our kids. The rooms are smaller than the Hyat next door. I did not care for the tile in our bathroom it looks holiday inn quality. The drink service at the pool was poor and we ordered jalape\u00f1o poppers from the pool bar that were just gross. We like the location of the hotel.

My girlfriend and I woke up with terrible congestion. We ate at the sushi restaurant which was a big mistake. The fish was not fresh.

This was a big family trip for my husbands side of the family. Our group included 6 children and 8 adults ages ranging from 18 months to 74 years of age. We were able to get adjoining rooms that connected so we were able to go back and forth between rooms. The pool was huge with a sandy beach for the kids to play in. One small complaint was that the pool side service was very scarce. The food was good but there was not enough servers and the food took forever. Our server although very nice kept forgetting things such as the dressing for a salad a drink that we had ordered etc. the resort needed more servers at the pool. They had two decent restaurants and a small sushi bar. We ate at Cava for the breakfast buffet. They had a nice juicing station that I have never seen in any restaurants before. Only draw back for Cava was that the items for the breakfast buffet never changed. The Italian restaurant was decent nothing spectacular but be aware that the pizza is not very huge enough for two people. Went out mostly for dinner. Overall everyone was really friendly and helpful. Good place to being the family. They had planned activities for the kids that they could participate in. Fire pits at night provided opportunity to make smores we brought our own smores kit. Lawns around the premises provided kids to run around while the parents enjoyed the evening air.

Additionally they have ice cream socials and movies for the little ones in their patio area in the evenings a caf\u00e9 that serves Starbucks coffee a nice gym and On Demand television with the Cartoon Network and Disney to keep the little ones occupied.
