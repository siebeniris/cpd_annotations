The concierge floor is a joke. The staff on this floor should exceed all expectations we know this since our daughter ran the one at Fairmont Boston and failed miserably. They were rarely attentive and certainly not overly attentive or friendly. We vacation at least 4 5 times a year and the quality of this staff is at the bottom of the list. Simply smiling and saying hello is not the interaction necessary in this type of job. They rarely assisted with anything and virtually never initiated conversation. The room itself was extremely dirty and remained so even after bringing it to the concierge floor attendant \u2019s attention. Even though the hotel will be renovating its rooms in a few months we were vacationing now and paying good money. They should maintain the integrity right up to the renovations. The only person who seemed genuinely interested in our well being was the lobby concierge Paola. She should be elevated to hotel management as this is the type of person that exudes \u201c hospitality \u201d and was the most helpful during our stay and we only talked to her once. The staff working on the beach also could use an overhaul as they have been there for years and it shows. They are not what one would expect at a resort. Certainly less than friendly. Overall the entire team needs a retrofit along with the rooms. We have come here for years and have watched the quality slide. In fact we stayed 4 nights at the Mariot Stelaris before moving over to the Hyat and it was like night and day. We will probably stay there from now on.

This hotel was a bit of a letdown. Average at best i did the research and spoke to friends and family who have stayed in here and in Aruba before. Grounds beautiful beach one of the best in the high rise area. The design of the rooms even the newly renovated rooms leave much to be desired. Caution renovated rooms on 8th floor have old furniture as of July 2018. The rooms are small bad design in a few areas. Why would you put a large mirror in the foyer but no light. Attention to detail is just lacking. Carpet in hallway is old carpet with paint stains must be from renovations. Majority of rooms only have balconet barely large enough to step out on it. Get a room higher than 4th floor otherwise your view will be obscured by palm trees. Casino stunk from cigar smoke needs a better ventilation system. Restaurants were fine just very expensive drinks at bars expensive as well. Pool was ok we went in July lots of kids jumping in even in quiet area. Some adults and kids were eating in pool gross. Grounds nice but needs upkeep. They need a staff of just people maintaining resort. Elevators were filthy. Beach palapa procedure a bit of a pain but you can do online. Raul is the man.

Arrived on Oct 13 2018 for a week of relaxation. Upon check in the 1st thing the hotel desk tells us is the hotel is under renovation. 9 6 weekdays. I then tell him we were not informed when making reservation through a credit card travel program when I booked or afterwards by the Hyat. He then explains that many people have not known about the renovations and that is why he is telling us. Having been at a hotel that was under renovation before I knew the only solution was to switch hotels. So instead of paying with points we paid double at last minute for a nice hotel. While the credit card travel program refunded all the points all Hyat did was place blame on the credit card travel program. Hyat insisted notifications via email were sent to them but the credit card travel agent said no notification was received. Hyat had my reservation information and should have reached out to me before the trip. They should have also offered to find us a noise free room at another hotel according to the desk clerk they did not have any construction noise free rooms. Neither happened. It is my belief Hyat does not care about their guests and are just concerned about profit. Instead of warnings guests and losing business they just inform them when they arrive. I will say the Hyat did bring us to our new hotel. That is the only nice thing they did. Switching hotels at last minute cost us an additional 300. Thanks Hyat.

In summary Worst resort hotel experience ever will never return to this island. More detailed account Our arrival was a bit snake bitten from the go as we were fleeing the cold but the snow caught us and caused us to miss our flight in causing us to arrive at 10 PM instead of 40 PM. By this time however I had checked in electronically as provided by Hyat I question if this is by Hyat corporate or Hyat Regency Aruba as also called Hyat to alert them that we were going to be late and our estimated time of arrival. At no point did I receive any indication that there would be an issue upon our arrival. But there was. The hotel had over booked and we were shipped to a neighboring hotel. I will spare the account of the farce that unfolded as the resort staff tried to get us over to the other resort. While some might say it was good of Hyat to pay for the nights stay at the other resort the fact that the error was wholly their own and still left us homeless from 120 \u2013 40 the next day did not engender any good feelings. To compound matters Hyat would not answer the phone that morning so I could confirm our stay was back on track and it took the staff at the Barcelo whom had been hosting us to get them on the line. They then told us that we could check in at 10 pm so that is when we arranged for a pick up. When we got to the Hyat a second time we were told that nope sorry lied to again and the room would not be ready until maybe 40 \u2026 but they would email me a notification when ready. Come 40 this had not happened but we were finally able to check in. We went to get our bags looked at our bags and pointed for them requesting them only to be told they would be brought up. We proceeded up to the room and about 10 20 minutes later we got a call from the bellhops to confirm we had our bags \u2026. which we did not because they were still with them. I had made a dinner reservation at the Ruinas restaurant but had to have a discussion with the manager to ask if this was the standard of service and ask if I should have confidence their concierge could actually make a reservation. At this point I was seriously considering just getting a cab going home and demanding a full refund \u2026 but I had always wanted to go to Aruba and my wife was not quite there yet. The Room Finally we got our bags and got to lie down unpack and take a breath. The room was nice both firm foam pillows and softer ones for you various inclinations and a big TV for which I did finally find the HDMI cable access so we could play movies off the computer for movie night which we enjoy. If there was ever a resort guide with maps facilities and hours I never saw it but the chaise was a nice nap spot. The Restaurants. Turns out the concierge could make a reservation. First night was at the Runias Del Mar I have to say the look of the place in person matched the photographs which is wonderful. There is a nettings around the edge with the pond which is full of koi and other fish. The service was personable though once our orders were in he completely vanished never to be seen again. The food came out in good order from the other staff and the meal amounted to a 35 star dinner in 35 star facility allowing for raised expectations of location and price. Be warned if you contemplate going there for Sunday brunch it is resort caviar priced though I was told they had Champaign and caviar so maybe there is causeThe other restaurant we tried was the Palms. Trying to get noticed by staff and seated was a 50 50 affair. We showed up four time and got a place twice. They have some interesting and wonderful drinks some of them non alcoholic and the food was good but not impressive. We also tried some of the pool service and swim up bar selections. The drinks were okay but my wife noted they were watered down. Certainly some of the flavor was left out. The selection was also rather disappointing compared to other places I have been in the past couple of years on other less frequented islands. Other Facilities The towel hut was a relatively simple thing to get access to. We were able to get a couple of unclaimed beach chairs for one days ocean swimming. The water was blue from a distance but very cloudy up close \u2026. likely from all the traffic of every sort around the area. Many people got floating pads and just floated. The pools were busy but aside from the children throwing all kinds of balls around they were not so full as you felt uncomfortable. We got an umbrella reserved for one day and camped out whilst taking trips to the ocean pool and for lunch. The last was necessitated as the polside waiters came by once as we sat down and were never to be seen again A constant theme but given our check in experience par for the course. While I want to say the bar tenders were at least attentive that is not wholly the case that first tragic day \u2026 I tried to get a drink at the bar but after 10 15 minutes I left without a single waiter looking at me. Kind of pathetic. I played a few nights in the casino at the low dollar tables. The staff were outgoing and had a little back and forth though I am sure there are strictures. Still keeping my bets small there was a reasonable up and down. They had a number of slots sports betting horse betting roulette craps blackjack and a few different poker variants. The place was clean the stools comfortable and in good repair and the AC reasonable. Live music was not so loud that you wanted to run screaming when it came on at 100 pm. The grounds were a treat. My wife loved all the wild life and we left with many pictures. They have some kept parrots and many lizards and iguanas roaming free to go along with the Koi and Black Swans in the pond. Her sentiment was that Chi Chi the African Grey was the best thing about the whole resort. I will let you arrive at your own conclusion from that. I never got a chance to use the spa as we lost so much of our trips time and never recovered enough trust in the resort to use it so I can not comment upon that at all. I was sent a brochure for it over email but given the incident with the online check in I have zero faith in that emailed document. Summation As a home base the place is right on the public beach and did not feel over crowded even with our stay being over a Carnivale weekend. We were able to find means of enjoyment on our trip off the resort and there are many good restaurants bars and activities in the areaAs for the resort itself the experience was very often from disastrous to disappointing. This is not what I would accept from any place purporting to be high end and it was not worth the money paid in the least. I could not be induced to return and expect to be seeking out an explanation of how this is acceptable service from their corporate office.", "offset": [5392, 5476], "date": "2019-02-25", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "78a6a7ef-bc3a-4a84-894f-c2e79735f283", "sentence": "Nice Stay in Aruba was not expecting anything spectacular since this was a group trip but was very pleased with service updates to rooms and food.

My family of four came to the Hyat for spring break. We splurged on one of the newly remodeled family suites so we would have room to spread out for the week room 846. On the second day of our trip my 1year old son fell off the very slippery ladder of the bunk bed falling on the hard tile floor below injuring his wrist and hitting his head. These suites are nice and new but they do not have safety for children in mind whatsoever. I spoke to a manager asking for help at least to see if they had a rug to put next to the bed in case kids fall. He said he would do something for us and we never heard from him or anyone else again. I mentioned this again at checkout and nothing. We ended up paying nearly twice as much as a regular room to have the extra kids space but my kids were both so upset by the injury that they would not set foot in the kids room again. So basically we paid double to have them spend the week sleeping on the couch for six of our seven nights with zero response from management. Housekeeping was polite but we had no shampoo or conditioner for the first two days and ended up having to go buy it in town. Also there was no electrical outlet available in the kids room for my child who needs a C Pap breathing machine at night. Two stars are for the property. It is very pretty but very crowded. You have to pay to reserve a beach umbrella months in advance or you will not have any shade. Service in the restaurants was excellent although the restaurants on property are laughably overpriced. We quickly learned to go across the street where there are lots of equally good places for a fraction of the price. The regency club was also nice it saved us a bundle on breakfast for the family plus good appetizers after a day on the beach.

The landscaping was immaculate. Exotic bird enclosures and a pond waterfall area that was home to fish and turtles and quite a few green iguanas were all well maintained. The pools were great and had plenty of chairs and umbrellas available this is the off season. Access to the beach and ocean was very convenient. This part of Palm Beach was the home to many water sports and water adventure companies which could be nice but does add a bit more people traffic. The one negative experience unfortunately was the beach pool wait staff. The ones that will come to your chair or hut. Compared to the very friendly bar tenders these folks did bring the same attitude. It can take a little while 20 m sometimes for them to see your request for service indicator which in itself is n\u2019t unexpected. But sometimes in particular by the pools it felt more like being ignored. They would seemingly walk by your area multiple times without a look. Even worse though when you did have their attention they were not friendly like the rest of the staff. They seemed bothered or irritated most of the time. That experience was the norm and not the exception sadly. To be fair it was not every single one of the staff but it was the majority that I encountered over a weeks time. Moving on the location of this property was awesome. Immediately across the street in either direction you will find a myriad of shops and restaurants. If you like to walk around you will find plenty to visit all in the immediate area no need for taxis. One more compliment for the staff here we had an issue with water leaking in our bathroom which quickly became a significant flooding issue. Within a few minutes we had nearby house maids and maintenance and engineers all rushing to our room. Clean up equipment was right behind them.
