My wife wanted to come because we had not been there for twenty years. So we decided to make a mini vacation of it. After my short meeting we walked around the downtown area went to the 3D IMAX walked over the Walnut Street pedestrian bridge over the Tennessee river to a beer garden for refreshments then back to a restaurant near our hotel for dinner. After that we enjoyed the pool and spa at the hotel. Our room was great and the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The next morning we toured the Chickamauga Battlefield it was very moving and inspiring. On the way home we stopped at Little River Canyon for a hike and to see the vistas on the rim highway.

At roughly 2 am we were awoken by a conversation that sounded like it was taking place in our room. I woke up thinking there was a video playing on one of our phones. It was not. Only after I woke my husband up did I realize there was light visible between the ceiling and the wall adjoining the room where 2 women were discussing what a scumbag Mike was. I called the front desk and they said they had no other rooms available that they would send security up to quiet the women next door. Security never came I can assure you of this because we could literally hear everything. So 3 hours later I am awakened again by another conversation from next door. I gave up on sleep and turned on a white noise ap on my phone. It was stuffy in the entire hotel the room never got comfortable. I offer two stars still the hotel itself is nice the staff were friendly and it was fairly clean. The paper thin walls that adjoin the rooms are a huge disappointment. I learned entirely too much about our neighbors the front desk did nothing.

Housekeeping was extremely disappointing. Underwhelming stay. For the cost of the room at this former 4 diamond hotel I expected a different level of service. At check in someone with a similar last name had checked into our room. Not sure how that happened but it took 20 minutes for the front desk staff to solve. The room was average. The bathroom tile had multiple dingy looking chips and cracks surprising for a hotel renovated last year. We went outside the hotel for breakfast and some sightseeing and the neighboring area is fantastic. We arrived back at 145 hoping the room would have been serviced but it has not. I called housekeeping for additional wash clothes but after ringing and ringing no one picked up the phone. I called the front desk and they said they would be sending some up. We waited 15 minutes and I finally walked down to the front desk to see what was the issue. I would n\u2019t have been such a pest but we had to hurry to get ready for a wedding. I explained this to them and specifically asked that housekeeping come after we leave at 330. They said that would n\u2019t be a problem. Another 5 minutes and they finally arrived with more wash clothes. Fast forward post wedding we come back to an unserviced room. I went down to speak with the front desk about my disappointment and I was finally greeted by excellent front desk staff.
