This balcony room also gave us a fabulous view of the surrounding strip. The suite itself quite large was super comfortable with stylish furnishings a separate TV reading area and a luxurious bathroom. No problems at all with the cleaning service which was done each morning. The property is in a great central location on the strip near many of the other popular casinos.

I stayed here openimg week and it was glamorous and glitzy now a few years later it has wear and tear to rival the tourist traps in Downtown Las Vegas. I could have overlooked that if the service was superb but that was far from the case. After waiting 40 minutes in the check in line I went up front to ask if they were aware there was a large line. Eric working at the front desk said they were having problems and we will get to you when we get to you. Not an appropriate customer service response so I asked for a manager. John came down and was very apologetic for his employee but Eric repeatedly refused to apologize for his attitude. John gave me a small food credit but it was a hollow gesture as I was there such a short time it was not fully usable. When I finally received my room hours later it was dirty.

Even the pillow was placed on the bed backwards total lack of attention to detail.

I also was told that wi fi was included in the resort fee but when I went to sign on it told me there was a 20 a day charge for this. And I was just too busy to call and ask why. On the positive side the view was nice and the staff in the restaurants were great but the hotel experience was far from the level expected from a 250 a night price point.

This was my first time staying in Vegas at a hotel that was not owned by one of the major casino resort operators. In the past I have stayed in MGM Mandalay Bay and Planet Hollywood. Staying in the Cosmopolitan made me feel like Mariot is not ready for prime time in Las Vegas. It honestly felt kind of Amateur hour almost like they bit off more than they could chew with this property. The property is in the best location on the strip. There is no denying that. Most of the hotels casinos and restaurants are a relatively quick walk or an even quicker cab ride. This is very important given the anemic energy of the hotel itself. The hotel while not at all my taste is beautifully draped in crystal and chandeliers. I found it to be dark and gaudy but I can appreciate the work that went into the design. Just watching a team of 3 take down the crystal string by string to dust gives you an appreciation for it. The rooms were very large but awkward. For example the shower and bath are separated by glass. If you do want privacy you need to close the blinds hanging on the glass. I do not mind this I am just confused by it. The noise in the rooms are intolerable. When the unit above mine turned on the shower it sounded like someone turned on heavy machinery. Also the walls are very thin and you can hear people talking in the room next door. The views in the right rooms are outstanding. I had a fountain view king size suite with a balcony. Unfortunately the balcony was completely ruined by the overwhelming pungent smell of greasy food cooking. Most outdoor areas of the hotel had the same problem. The stench seemed to permeate most of the hotel including the pool. I assume the exhausts are jut not well placed. I do not ever remember this problem in another big hotel. Speaking of the pools the pool in my tower was closed. This left one pool open which took about 10 minutes to get to from my tower. That pool was half empty and yet you could not get a seat near the pool because most of them were reserved. This just seemed obnoxious to me and it really rubbed me the wrong way. We were there in October not July and even then its a Mariot. Give me a break. To get to the pool and most of the restaurants you have to walk through convention hell. There are 3 floors of endless convention space in the center of the hotel on the 2nd 3rd and 4th floors. I hated this layout and I hated walking past convention goers to get to the pool. I was really annoyed by the layout of the hotel in general. Once I left the pool area for a few minutes by taking an escalator down. On my return I realized that the escalator back up was also going down and I had to re walk the convention landscape for another 10 minutes just to get back. Truly terrible. The casino is bland and fairly quiet compared to the other hotels. You will likely want to gamble somewhere else. There point system is also incredibly complicated and its hard to understand how it ties into the Mariot reward system. Speaking of which there are almost no perks to speak of if you are a status member. This is just crazy to me as all the other Vegas hotels treat their status members like gold and Mariot takes their points system very seriously. So for example in the Belagio you will always see 2 lines at restaurants. One is a priority line for status members. Not at the Cosmo. The drinks are ridiculously priced even for Vegas. 16 for a drink at the Casino bar not the club. The restaurants in the hotel offer a lot of diversity if you can find them and we had an excellent meal at Rose. Rabbit. Lie. with amazing entertainment. I am both a fan of Mariot and a status member. Unfortunately I can not recommend you stay here. If you do make sure you get a great price as depending on the week rooms can be as high as 49 a night. If you want a real Vegas hotel experience I would look elsewhere.", "offset": [2194, 2282], "date": "2015-11-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "1e170fb3-74f3-406c-9b85-7507d9513a2a", "sentence": "Lots of Glitter Low on Class. We found ourselves here because of a business conference. My husband is the minority in his field young male. so despite his wanting to be in a location where the event can be professional and focused the ones who host the event go with the majority Vegas wins year after year. Much to our displeasure. This year it was hosted at The Cosmopolitan. After 3 days my husband and I have drawn several conclusions desperately hope they pick another venue in this city for the announced event next year. A few facts about the hotel It is NOT a place for children. There is partial nudity on screen in pictures through out the hotel. Including in our room got a partial nip pic in the living area. Our room also has an erotic art book on the night stands. This place is clearly set up for cheap thrills parties groups. It fails at catering to any business group so I am not sure why we are even here. Our room does not have a coffee maker. This seems so ridiculous to me. Had to hunt down a vendor on another floor selling a medium black coffee for 5. Not cool if you are like me enjoy sipping a cuppa while you get ready in the morning. Our mattress and box springs are a very low end extra firm Sealy from a wholesaler think Sams Club. Very uncomfortable and slanted badly. The pillows are feather which sounds nice but it is not. You get 2 each on a king bed. If they were standard pillows this would suffice but being feather if you have back or neck problems you probably want 3 each. They should follow Hilton Hamptons lead and give you one of eachwe have read several reviews about poor customer service so never bothered to call front desk to request more pillows. Also after realizing how dirty the pillows were in their ill fitting pillow cases see my pics. we figured we had tough it out. Just another discomfort. The housekeeping in general is fine and they have lovely toiletries. But the place needs a major deep cleaning and freshened up MEGA DUSTY. Zoom in on over bed ceiling shot. They went for glitz and glam and not quality and class here. Things feel cheap. The sofa in living area of our room was virtually un sitable especially in the middle. Tried to snap a pic of sagging. You could sit crooked on the ends without falling into the filthy thing but who wants to. Not pleasant. Also the bathroom needs TLC. Shower head was rock crusted over with lime or calcium so you get a crappy shower despite the beautiful idea of the walk in shower see other visitors pics. Our drain was SUPER slow and after a 5 7 minute shower you were standing in 3 of water. Gross. Also the spigot handle was broken and hanging by a thread in the shower area and the bath tub drain stopper was cracked. Things maintenance should be keeping up with regularly but clearly this place is not about quality in the long run. Added to the cheap feel of the place. They appear to want to woo you with posh appearances. We heard this hotel was designed for milenials who want to party and wreck stuff. That description fits perfectly. Also fits if you are too drunk to care about your surroundings and just want to sleep in a place that gives the appearance of money. It is shiny and big here for a moment you will feel classy but it does not last. And the comforts for longer term stays are pretty non existent. No coffee makerAlso note there is a mini fridge but it is filled with costly booze that triggers a charge if you touch it. There is NO room for your own water or drinks in there. Just a small Sub zero freezer compartment in the bottom is open for anything personal. This place wants to nickel and dime you to death after they over charge you for the sexy room. The only positives I can come up with are the views and certain staff members. Despite being in the cheaper eastside tower we had lovely views of the mountains and a nice balcony. Also all the cleaning staff I chatted too were very friendly and my husband said check in was easy. And again nice toiletries. If you want a glitzy showy experience at a name brand hotel you could stay here. If you are in Vegas for thrills you probably do not care about your room anyways. But if you are a seasoned traveler or traveling for business do not waste your time or money here. Try an Embassy Hilton Drury or Hampton if available.

I imagine they were created with young lovers or honeymooners in mind and not middle aged men on business trips. But lovely nonetheless. Think I was upgraded to a junior suite with a large dressing area kitchenette sink and fridge and a desk area. The architect should be applauded seriously nice job. However my particular room was a little worse for wear. I needed to call housekeeping to come vacuum when I got there as there was a bit of broken glass on the floor. The carpet in my room was well worn and their were some stains on the patio furniture that I would not want to hold a black light to. The room was quiet at night and the view was incredible ask to face the Belagio fountains if you canThe hotel itself is nice during the day with plenty of bars restaurants and some lower priced blackjack tables. At night however the place takes on a much seedier vibe. I walked through the lobby at 2 am and I do not think I have ever seen some many prostitutes in my life. Maybe it was the week I was in Las Vegas its largest convention CES but it was shocking. This experience repeated itself the one morning I was up at 545a getting coffee a coffee bar next to the check in opens at 5 am and saw a number of oddly and scantily dressed women leaving the hotel. Anyway late at night the hotel felt more like Times Square in the 70s than it did a luxury hotel.

Stayed 7 14 November celebrating OH big birthday. Arrived mid evening Virgin Holidays package was expecting large queues at check in we must have been lucky just us and another couple waiting to check in pre paid resort fee upfront to get it out of way. Was given the VH upgrade to one bedroom terrace but disappointed that it was a view overlooking Aria and not the fountains and yes I know how much time do you spend in room but it would have been nice anyway level 35 Chelsea towerRom was lovely Japanese bath. only thing I found lacking was drawer space. Had to request bath robe change as it was tiny felt like it was shrunk and I am a UK size 12. They said all robes are same size defo not with this one so they changed it for a spa robe. Bought our own kettle cups silverware as knew no facilities in room and I am not going down from 35 to ground every morning to grab a tea coffee. Never used mini bar just got water and milk from across bridge at CVS and used the second fridge. Room was always spotless and well stocked toiletries towels etc. We were one room away from lift and could hear it every minute so I dread to think how bad the lift noise was in room adjacent. Wicked Spoon buffet included in package and on day one was advised we should be in VIP lane by Michele she was the stand out employee for us does an amazing job and makes conversation with everyone who approaches. Buffet. hm everything is cold OMG stone cold hash browns vile. even the plates are cold expected better and food selection never changed for the whole week. Tipped at table. Hotel is vast and can be busy especially weekends and Tuesday onwards seems to cater for conferences so always busy. Casino good sometimes never left the hotel. Pool gets packed weekend Chelsea tower. believe they were preping other pool for ice Rick coverage. Only ate at the Henry which was very good although slow to serve meal Build a Burger massive came with fries. Staff in casino excellent plenty of drinks offered although they need to think about changing those awful blue dresses look cheap and nasty to something a bit more classy. Clientele seem to be a big range from the I am just here to gamble in my t shirt slacks to the heels sequin brigade. General areas very clean no smoke smell ashtrays constantly emptied. Make sure you always get in the correct lift lobby as they are zoned by floors they stop at. Only person we did not tip was the bellboy the older gentleman had an attitude so this unfortunately resulted in our gentleman not being tipped. Check out was easy as we had a zero bill and they let us keep the room cards as a souvenir. Would I stay again. Only if I had pre booked a fountain view and won the lotto and as we have done Vegas twice now the novelty had worn off I think and it is starting to out price us.", "offset": [1584, 1700], "date": "2019-11-15", "cpt": "3", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "055b37c0-7a5b-45d6-bd4b-392a7120d1d5", "sentence": "Cosmo is becoming popular with conventions meetings events. it is a modern looking casino and has great restaurants and bars.

No coffee pots. Despite having do not disturb sign in door housekeeping knocked 2x. As I was downstairs my daughter was resting there was a Knock at door she saw it was room service.
