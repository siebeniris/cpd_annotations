Had a last minute trip to Sydney and this was the only reasonably priced pl available. Since I had been to Chatswod previously this seemed like a good location to stay. As a hotel apartment it is good as you have cooking and laundry facilities. However the room I stayed in was looking a bit tired hence the average score. Location wise it was literally across the road from the train station very handy for getting into the city. Also Chatswod has many dining options and shopping is a short walk away.

The Quality of Service was wonderful room was great however I did not enjoy any of the meals I received. I am quite a fussy eater and vegetarian. I found that each of the meals courses I received were without flavour. I had pasta on the first night and while very edible it was flavourless. Night 2 I had the arancini balls and pizza. Arancini was without season and flavour and the Pizza was absolutely terrible unsure what one of the vegetables were but yuck. Needless to say I did not eat it. Breakfast on day 1 did not arrive although I am fairly sure it was my fault as I am not confident that I ticked a time. Day 2 breakfast as soft poached eggs and hash browns. The hash browns were potato gems not hash browns and the poached eggs were very undercoked. I did not eat it. Lastly the handle to the hot tap in room 416 needs review as it fell off when I was adjusting the water. Overall I think the accommodation is great staff are courteous helpful and friendly. I will certanly stay there and recommend to the hotel to others. I just will not eat there again.", "offset": [938, 1022], "date": "2017-05-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "a8d79ff2-d952-4bc0-b9d0-eb24c5925007", "sentence": "Little bit dated big room.

I purposely booked this hotel as was on crutches visiting a surgeon following a huge operation 3 months ago. I booked the hotel due to the pool and the gym so I could do my pool rehab and few minutes on the bike after travelling 6 hours. The gym equipment needs some maintenance to it as some of it is dangerous in the state it is currently in. I make this comment with knowledge as I own and manage my own gym and have been in the industry for 25 years. To be honest the pool is very cold and noisy and therefor not an inviting experience. The hot tub was nice and hot. We wanted to eat in the hotel restaurant that night however as we attempted to go we were informed by reception staff that it was closed on Sunday nights. The sign says open 7 days I now realise on Sunday it is obviously only for breakfast or lunchThere were plenty of food options over the road.
