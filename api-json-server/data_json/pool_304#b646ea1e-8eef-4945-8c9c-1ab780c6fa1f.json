First it is in a very good location close to the airport OSJ Fajaro El Yunque etc. Apart from the little snafu we had checking in where they gave our room to someone else and they were IN it when we arrived which the promptly fixed it was perfect. The pool area was nice but you had to hurry and shotgun a seat with your towel to get a good one in the sun even though there were sings saying not to do that. But we always found a seat. The beach was incredible. The staff who set up chairs and umbrellas were great and were willing to move chairs wherever you asked them to. They even made sure that only hotel guests used the seats and ever kicked people out who were not. There was a security guard making sure the beach was safe as it was a public beach and it was nice to know they cared about safety. There are people who walk the beach selling stuff ice cream sunglasses etc but they are not bothersome. There is a guy who for 5 hacks off the top of a coconut for you to drink the water very fun. The area restaurants were great and the concierge was quick to give their recommendations. The places they recommended were our fave. Orozcos Tijuana and Cafe Manolin in OSJ were our faves. And we also had 3 visits to the little burger place across the street BUNS. SO GOOD. Having the CVS and Walgrens was a huge plus. We got snacks and alcohol to keep in our room since almost everything at the hotel was so pricey. The tour desk was great too. We set up 2 excursions one to El Yunque and one on a catamaran snorkel tour. Spend the extra and get the Yunque trip with the hike to El Mina waterfall. It was freezing but very fun. The catamaran tour was great. Beautiful weather fun staff worth the money. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone we loved it.", "offset": [339, 498], "date": "2015-01-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "d698e95d-f821-422e-a8ba-1dc3aff4ec6d", "sentence": "great hotel but not for everyone. This was a very nice hotel in a very convenient location. The bar and entry were fancy. From what I could see of the casino it was nice. There was a big dance floor and live entertainment. There was a workout area somewhere that I never went in. Problem is that we did not need any of that and did not use it so we probably paid too much in points and money for all of it. This is a resort with all amenities. We would have done better to find a smaller hotel on the water in the area without all the perks because we wanted a clean room a comfortable bed a balcony on the ocean and the beach. We used about 2400 points but still had to pay about 80 for 7 nights to get an upgrade to ocean front and a mandatory resort fee of 30 a day if you used points so I am not sure the points were such a bargain. It made me rethink the whole point thing. The room did have a good sized mini fridge so we were able to buy snacks drinks lunch and breakfast items and save some money but otherwise dinner was out every night further adding to the cost. The ocean is fantastic in the Condado region of San Juan. The water is the color of the Caribbean with great waves and ocean roar of South Carolina beaches. The sand was soft and shell free which may be a downer for some. While you can take beach walks it will not be a very long one as there are obstacles not far each way. The beach is public but even in January and February it was very crowded with the Mariot crowd. Your resort fee includes an umbrella table and nice lounge chairs placed and put up by the staff and the area is not a huge one so people are packed together which some people like I do not. There is a definite sun pattern resulting in shading by the building at different parts of the day but I did not think it was a big deal and actually like being out of direct sun part of the day. The hotel swimming pool was very chopped up although it was very pretty. I would not use it at all because it was totally blocked off from the beach by fences and hedges. The adult pool swim up bar was in a separate area where the childrens water slide was which did not make much sense to me. Another feature I did not need or use. The outdoor restaurant and bar overlooking the beach was very nice but it closed at 6 which was ridiculous. And you could not take night walks on the beach because the gate to the beach was locked. I assume this was for safety. And I never saw one bug of any kind the whole time I was thereWe did not try the on site restaurants except that we did order lunch at the outdoor bar on our last day and it was very good. And we ordered room service one night which we thought was very nice very good and plentiful. The price was reasonable. My husband had the stew rice and beans and we shared a tiramisu. I had a very good hamburger. As for the room it was not spacious but adequate. It was not really upscale but it was nice. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. However there was a strong mildew musty smell in the room that was very unpleasant each time we entered the room until we got used to it. The closet had a safe and lots of hangers. The toiletries which were replaced daily consisted of shampoo conditioner body wash face soap shower cap. There was a nice makeup mirror for the ladies and lots of storage in the bathroom. The hotel was located close to the bus stops that go to Old San Juan although there is no real schedule for the buses. Take plenty of quarters as the rides are 75 each way per person. I found the buses pretty comfortable and clean and we used them alot to go to Old San Juan. Just down the block is a Walgrens and a CVS. We did not use the CVS but the Walgrens carried most everything including beer and liquor toiletries groceries etc. I recommend you get a Walgrens frequent shopper card before you go. You get a discount on all purchases just by typing in your phone number on the keypad. The highlights of our trip besides the ocean were the tours however which I am writing about in more detail in the attractions activities section. These included the Flavors of San Juan Food and Culture Tour tour of the rain forest and bio bay with Sunset Tours and a bike ride around San Juan and the ocean with Rent the Bike. The people in Puerto Rico are friendly and although most understand English if you want to practice your Spanish it is much appreciated and used by the populace. We ate at several really good restaurants too. We had a great time we just picked the wrong hotel for what we were looking for.", "offset": [2053, 2175], "date": "2015-03-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "4b73f214-9515-4a8d-8e9c-bceae5f82691", "sentence": "Amazing service great location. I am so used to being disappointed that maybe I am easily impressed but from the moment we arrived at the Mariot I was bowled over by the customer service. From the front door to the front desk to the pool bar to the towel girl to the spa desk to the bellman and even to the engineer who came up to address AC problems each and every person acted like my presence was the sole reason for their existence. The service and personnel was nonpareil. I had give it 6 stars if I could. The only reason they do not get 5 stars overall are non people related. They advertised having water slides at the pool but they were all down during our visit had I had children with me who were counting on that I would have requested a reduction in rate. Our room AC went down once and was fixed within 10 minutes of my call. It was also keeping me awake due to a noisy compressor and after 2 nights of no sleep I finally reported it and it was repaired before we returned to the room. The costs were ridiculous 25 for a hamburger and Diet Coke at the pool. and I can not condone that kind of gouging no matter how great everyone was. Other stuff. The pina colada I had in the beachside bar was bar none the best I have ever had. The hotel location is great but if you go make sure you journey out not only to your right as you exit the hotel where all the personnel will point you but to the left as well. The beach is beautiful but not good for swimming so if you are an ocean swimmer look elsewhere. The location is walking distance to all the shopping and dining you want although I had highly recommend doing that in Old San Juan. We did not utilize the casino but it looked like others were having fun.

We stayed at this Mariot because it is right on the beach the hotel is located in the Condado Beach area of San Juan. We stayed in an ocean view room with a balcony overlooking one of the two pools. It was lovely to sit out on the balcony at night and listen to the ocean waves. Everything about this property is top notch the room was spotlessly clean very large with a comfy king sized bed. There were robes in the closet for your use and a refrigerator in the room for snacks and beverages. Every employee went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible including giving my husband free drinks and desserts on his birthday. The hotel has a few restaurants and bars including a swim up bar in the adult pool. The food was very good if a bit expensive. If you have a hearty appetite the best deals were the breakfast and dinner buffets. For a less expensive option there is a coffee shop in the lobby and a Starbucks across the street. A good way to save money is to go to the CVS on the corner open 247 and buy your drinks and snacks there. And do not miss having dinner at Umos Argentine Grill which is two blocks down Ashford Avenue. Besides the two pools water slide Jacuzi and beach there is a casino attached to the building. If you want to travel off the property there are buses and taxis that will take you the few miles to Old San Juan for sightseeing. The hotel can arrange for other tours such as a trip to the El Yunque the rain forest. My only complaint was that I feel I was overcharged for dinner one night in the hotel. The sign in the lobby said the special was 30 but we were charged 40 it was a delicious meal with a large salad perfectly cooked mahi mahi and dessert but still.

Let me start by saying I had a wonderful time in San Juan. My boyfriend and I are a young couple 30 and 31. We were looking for the party. After months of research I chose to stay at the San Juan Mariot Resort Stelaris Casino. It was nice but I would not stay here again. I admit I am a tough critic. But in paradise close to perfection is expected. Below I will list the pros and cons of the hotel and also discuss some of the pros and cons of the Condado. EnjoyPros Mariot Staff was amazing very helpful and cheerful Checked in was quick arrived around 330pmBar in lobby was small but cute Elevators great for selfies Hotel room was small but clean Bed comfortable Ocean view from room amazing Beach area always had chairs Vendors on beach were great had homemade empanadasPros The Area Steps away from the beach Close to many restaurants and gift shops walk down Ashford Ave. The food in the area was amazing. You save so much money eating outside of the hotel. Cons Mariot Hotel rooms outdated A lot of children. The pool area was packed with children. Even close to the swim up bar. This hotel should definitely be marketed as a family friendly location. We had a chance to go to La Concha just down the beach. Much younger lively crowdDrinks by the pool were weak and expensive No entertainment on site. The bar was empty and the casino was quite. There was music playing by the pool one night but the area was empty. Walked down the strip to other hotels for the party atmosphere. Cons Area Very isolated when you leave the hotel there are homeless people lying on the sidewalks directly in front of the hotel. Lots of construction. Drastic difference just a few steps away. We went to Old San Juan and had the best time ever. I would consider staying there next time. Old San Juan has a more romantic sexy feeling. The streets are cobblestone and colorful. The area is artsy and eclectic. Many bars do not have door or windows open concept was beautiful. The nightclubs were great and people were very friendly. Over all a good stay. But you definitely need to explore if you want entertainment. The Mariot is boring. Condado is actually pretty boring. But this is not necessarily a bad thing lol. For people who just want to hang out at the beach and by the pool this is the place for you. You will definitely have time to relax. I would recommend people looking for more entertainment seriously consider Old San Juan. I also heard Isla Verde is a very lively area. More touristy but way more exciting. We did not have a chance to visit.

Just stayed a week at the Mariot Stelaris on Condado beach in San Juan. I like Mariots. I find their staff is consistently well trained and helpful. The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the facilities are usually well maintained regardless of their age. The casino is tight. We dropped a few hundred with very little action to show for it. The food in the hotel is on the expensive side. But the hotel is located in a very safe neighborhood with lots of reasonable dining options within walking distance. Cab fare to anywhere in San Juan is a flat rate of 15. The one downside of our week is that the sea was too rough for swimming. They had the beach red flagged every day due to undertow. The beach is very walkable and beautiful. The pools are wonderful. They have a swim up bar and a water slide that seemed to entertain all ages. there is a hot tub that fits maybe eight people. The grounds are clean. There is an outdoor dining restaurant with some pretty good food. Loved the marinated octopus salad for lunch. However and this is probably true everywhere in San Juan the pigeons will be quite brazen and fly right up on tables while you are eating. The hotel had live music in the lobby on weekends. Again the staff was top notch friendly and helpful at all times. In fact the Puerto Rican people were some of the friendliest and most helpful I have ever experienced in the Caribbean. The hotel gave us 30 in match play for the casino at arrival and also rebated 25 per day for every day we ate at the hotel. Much appreciated.

Room was clean bathrooms were nice beds were cozy Mariot beds and down pillows prob best hotel bed I have slept in. The view is amazing from the room. I am an early bird who loves to use the gym in the am this was awesome for me since it is open 24 hrs so I was able to go at 5 am. Watch the sunrise at 6 am. Beach. The beach is cleaned off every night the staff there does an amazing job putting out chairs every morning and sweeping the beach off every night. I had tip the guy 10 every morning to put chairs out umbrellas. The surf is rough big waves but we loved it. Dangerous for little kids so we had to be on them at all times. You do not have to go out far to have fun. If you look at the forecast do not get too upset the weather changes all the time and if you see clouds be grateful you will want the shade. Pool. The only con I had with the pool is no umbrellas because shade was needed. I had have to go sit under the bar for shade. The pool is amazing for kids waterslide plus adult swim up bar so you are able to watch kids. Dining. first couple days we had breakfast by the beach kind of expensive for us 5 it would be 100 then we found FreshMart go out the hotel left and on your right not to far down. An organic food store similar to a Whole Foods back home healthy options they have a cafe upstairs also great smoothies breakfast even lunch and cheap. 40 for us to eat a healthy breakfast. They even have a start bucks across the street. Lunch we ate mainly at the pool and one day at the pool over at La Concha. Dinner we enjoyed every place we went too. Ate twice at a puertorican restaurant I forget the name but it had lanterns hanging all outside and located upstairs from Starbucks. I keep forgetting names but if you go out of the hotel left past fresh mart on your right it has a green lights outside and swinging chairs at your table the food was great there also. There is also a CVS and Walgrens down the street. Excursions. We took Sonjourn rainforest tour it was a private tour Javier picked us all up in his new Audi took us through rainforest kind of tough with the kids all day in the car it was an all day adventure 830 430 but when we got out to walk the rainforest have lunch in town with locals. Got to swim in a few waterfalls and see some petroglyphs it was worth the experience. Overall our vacation was excellent I do not have anything bad to say about our stay the staff is always friendly people we met as well.

He apologized and said that our room had not been prepared as discussed over two hours ago. He did tell us that we could go to the bar and have a drink each on them. I think this alone is why they still get four stars. Around 515 we were given keys to our room. They did not work. We went back down and a different guy apologized and gave us new keys. They worked. 2. The room had the pool view we requested and was large however it somehow still had trash on the bathroom floor and balcony. Even though it took so long to get into our room it still had not really been cleaned3. After spending a ton of money compared to what I have to get this room and hotel they still had a 115 hotel fee once we got there. However I half expected it because I read through the website and other reviews so this was not a huge deal. Currently it looks like they charged my credit card an extra 265 though so I will have to wait and see if they fix it to the 115 or I will need to call.

For us Mariot was perfect the goal for our trip was to sit on the beach eat and enjoy night life. Beach was clean with plenty of chairs and umbrellas. There was always a man with a shovel who was available to set up an umbrella for us. Room had comfortable layout and climate control worked well. We did try breakfast buffet one morning and the food was great it was a step up from your ordinary Mariot buffet. For the rest of the meals we went out.

And that is when we also observed the skill of the bar and security staff. Many local residents stop by hotels to dance or for a drink. One of the locals was intoxicated and got a bit unruly. Security was there but the big man kept his distance. Bartenders handled the incident quietly gently and with great skill. Very impressive. Great service at the breakfast buffet beach bar and the lobby bar. We did not see anything negative to report. Check in and check out were easy. We did not play at the casino and did not use the pool sorry Mariot.

Fifty three years ago my wife and I honeymooned in San Juan. We have returned to San Juan many times to celebrate our anniversary and have stayed at most of the major resorts in the area. Our most recent trip was to the San Juan Mariot and Stelaris Casino and it was a magical experience from start to finish. Upon arrival we were upgraded to an oceanfront suite by General Manager Jose Gonzalez Espinosa who is a gem. Our room came complete with balloons a wine and cheese platter and an anniversary card signed by over 100 of the resorts employees. Inside was a certificate for an anniversary dinner. WowOur focus was on relaxing so we spent most days at the pool. At the beach or the pool there were plenty of lounges umbrellas and towels. Polside there were activities and even a large water slide for kids of all ages. Resort staff frequently checked guests to ensure they were comfortable and to take food and drink orders. We did not swim in the ocean although it was lovely and warm albeit a bit rough. The beach was cleaned every morning and was great for walking. The hotel is within steps of CVS and Walgrens and close to shops and many restaurants. Inside the hotel. LaVista Restaurant was open for all meals. There is a delicious breakfast buffet with a variety of offerings some changing daily along with the option of pouring your own green juice. Since the main dinner restaurant is still under renovation repair from hurricane Marias wrath LaVista did double duty in providing evening dining. The quality was good but the menu somewhat limited. The beach bar restaurant did a lively business at lunch. I had a bq burger and my wife had a Mahi burger both of which were huge and superb. Perhaps the greatest asset at the resort is it is staff all of whom went out of their way to be accommodating helpful and friendly. For example we had a time sensitive problem with pre paid airport transfers and 3 people at the front desk worked continuously to help us resolve the problem. Jock Gati Jean Carlos and a sweet young lady named Barbara were the three. Obviously General Manager Espinosa fosters a climate that is positive and guest oriented. By the end of our stay most were greeting us by name leaving a felilng of having been welcomed and well taken care of.

Due to the location of the hotel the surf is so incredibly relentless and we were never able to swim in the ocean. Makeshift fencing and boards was the only view from the swim up bar and beach. Very very disappointing for our first couples trip without the kids. The pool bar had only a handful of seats and the bar stools were so low you felt like a child. When we arrived in our room there was a very noticeable musty smell the carpet felt damp and where the chair was in the room there was rust stains under the legs of the chair clearly indicating water damage. While the main level of the hotel was nice the rooms were very dated.

We ended up liking the Mariot Stelaris and had a very nice vacation there but the week of New Years was clearly a very busy time for the resort and it showed. First of all check in time is 40 which I consider late and we showed up around 330 hoping to snag the room early but it was not ready until 60. The worst was that they gave us no information about when it would be ready and the lobby was jam packed. We tried and failed to order a drink and snack but the waiters were completely overwhelmed. When we raised a fuss after waiting over 2 hours the manager promised us complimentary breakfasts for the duration of our stay. We also had a nice room with a view of the pool and beach although the floor was mysteriously wet throughout our stay. The hotel has many pluses including a large well designed pool complimentary water and sunscreen a beautiful beach and friendly staff. The fitness center is also clean and relatively spacious. The spa area is small but fine my daughter and I treated ourselves to facials which were very nice. What we did not like the puddles on the floor it was not carpeted which was a very good thing. The first day we assumed it had just been hurriedly damp mopped then we thought we were tracking water after showers then we realized the puddles always returned in the same places. Probably unique to our room but so odd. My husband had to wake up early to reserve chairs around the pool. Those in the prime sunny spots were snapped up quickly and the winds are such that it is actually chilly in the shade. There was a 20 30min wait to get into breakfast each morning and we occasionally went without napkins or coffee mugs because there were not any available. The New Years Eve dinner buffet was overpriced for what it was. After 11 things calmed down and it was less crowded. I believe that guests from the AC Mariot down the street use the pool and beach facilities and day passes are available to others so that may account for the crowds. We did not use the casino. If I return I might try a smaller resort andor a place like the Villa Montana in Isabela which was more intimate and very charming.", "offset": [1444, 1510], "date": "2019-01-04", "cpt": "3", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 31, "uid": "dcb41b92-14af-411c-b950-0639b9476d81", "sentence": "Quick Stay.

We stayed there for 4 days last week. The hotel is beautiful. The oceanfront corner room facing the ocean and pool had fantastic views. Everything is immaculate. It is very close to the airport. The pools are great including the sliding board. We had breakfast each morning at La Vista. Alexis and Antonio were so attentive and did a great job. The bartenders in the lobby bar were excellent as well. So was the staff in the spa. it is convenient and we ate at many of the restaurants that were in walking distance which is a nice touch. It seemed like a safe neighborhood too. The only complaint I have is the ocean. We read reviews before the trip about the ocean being rough and discounted them because we are grown men and strong swimmers. The first day we thought it was very rough and almost knocked each of us down several times. The second day we swam near the rocks you see on the pictures thinking that they might break up the waves a little. My friend got sucked in by a riptide and then caught in repeated undertows in deep water that he could not get out of. he is a strong swimmer and I watched him scream and almost drown before I was able to push him onto a boulder. I almost drowned in the process and I am a strong swimmer and was a lifeguard in my 20s. We were banged up and bleeding. We then read on the internet about all the drownings on Condado beach. All the locals then told us it is a crisis. There are no lifeguards it is a public beach and there is no money for them. Be careful or better yet do not go in the ocean there over your knees.

This is a very pretty hotel staff very nice and accommodating. Room was always cleaned and replenished with plenty of towels. We had a great ocean front room. Room was very nice.

Bonus was being able to walk to all the restaurants that were recommended. There is also a cvs Walgrens and Starbucks right out front from the hotel. You can buy liquor beer pretty much anything you may want or have forgotten. Casino while not very large had something for everyone. Again very nice staff. Cons The bar in Lobby. Not a fun vibe. Dark and dreary. The bartender was not attentive at all and the bar was empty. We were the only ones there. It felt like once we could get his attention we were bothering him. No happy hours on property. Most resorts we have been to mainly Mariots throughout the Caribbean have some sort of happy hour. When I asked they said only ber\u200d \u2640 \ufe0f. The one and only restaurant that serves outside and inside by pool is in need of much help. 2 hour wait for dinner one waiter. Lunch was n\u2019t any better. 1 12 hr before we got our meal. They were fish tacos and a salad. Talk about fish taco and fish sandwich. Everything is fried. I am a fan of Mariot \u2019s fish tacos everywhere I have been throughout Caribbean. However never had I had them fried and had to look for the tiny piece of fish. We did bring to the concierge \u2019s attention and she did report it to the proper person so they could handle. Umbrellas for the beach. one per romwe had four in our room and only allowed one umbrella. They need to purchase more umbrellas so a guest can have as many as they need. With this said the beach staff did bring over another one after noon since most people were out and there were still some left. I wish I had his name. He was only doing his job but still cared enough to accommodate us in the end. Great customer service. General informationThis property is on the Atlantic. So water is rough and it \u2019s windy. I did not mind at all. Thought it was fun and just had to time waves. One of my friends has some knee issues and was n\u2019t able to get in because it was too rough for her. Personally I was happy for the breeze. It would have been brutally hot had it not been windy. The sand did not blow on you. It appears this is a property where a lot of locals and their family \u2019s come. It did get very crowded and loud. Very difficult to find a lounge chair by the pool unles you started there early.

When I arrived I was escorted to the back area for Bonvoy members and saw a large waiting area for people to congregate if their rooms were not ready. At first I thought it was a nice touch but in thinking they actually assume people will have to wait for rooms. Even with a pre register on the Ap it was 15 minutes to check in. It was a little painful. Of course they told me they upgraded me. They also gave me a bunch of coupons one for 5 for a snack. The lobby is an over loaded cluster of stuff. They tried to include too many aspects and it was the worst design I have ever seen. It was unclear if this was a lobby or a collection of used furniture. There was no place to just sit. The casino is off to one side and I looked in. A typical casino attached to a hotel. My room was on the main floor overlooking the pool. There were tons of families enjoying the pool and a DJ. I was informed the music was finished at 5PM so it would not disturb my sleep. I went to the coffee shop for a coffee and muffin and use my 5 coupon. Nope that is only for room service. The print size on that aspect was about 2point font. The room contained a king bed desk sofa chair with ottoman HDTV safe in the closet with a plush bathrobe and a chest of drawers. There was a balcony overlooking the pool with a couple of chairs. The bathroom was standard with a walk in shower. The major issue on my first ten minutes was the temperature was a little chilly so I raised the thermostat to 72 and there was a hair stuck to the sink surround may have been some left over toothpaste. I just threw a towel on it and moved on. Wifi was pretty fast for free and the TV channels were adequate. The other issue was discovered in the middle of the night. Even with the thermostat at 72 degrees it was freezing in the room. I did the best I could to stay warm. Breakfast is served on the ground floor overlooking the pool. It is a typical Mariot buffet cold only or cold and hot. They did have a nice selection of fruits and a large plate of smoked salmon. Checking out was a breeze and they emailed me the final bill.
