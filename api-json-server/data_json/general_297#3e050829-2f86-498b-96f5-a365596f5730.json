The Mandarin somehow pulls off the charm and aesthetics of a boutique hotel with the service resources and amenities of a larger 5 star hotel. The physical plant is delightful. Despite the hotels size there is no sense of overwhelming crowds or noise. The staff from doormen to front desk concierge to housekeeping are friendly and leave no stone unturned or ticket agency unscoured in their efforts to make your stay heavenly. For us the concierge had to track down a last minute car seat find tickets and arrange a tour guide. When our return flight was delayed by hours they allowed us the use of their lovely spa gym facilities. The dining options are amazing. You can not go wrong. it is excellent cuisine. A few asides several years ago a waiter overheard our family travel plans. My husband and daughter had to leave early while I had stay over my birthday. On his own he sent a birthday cake to my room. This visit my Anglophile college student was discussing Winston Churchill sight seeing suggestions with the front desk. Sweetly on the last day they gifted her with a Winston Churchill book.

I stayed at the mandarin oriental for two nights while attending a wedding also being held at the hotel. The hotel and the public areas around the hotel are beautiful and very well maintained. My Dad went in the pool which he also said was lovely. We stayed in rooms on the eighth floor. The floor was quite and we were not disturbed by any noise. We did not have a view our room looked almost onto another part of the building. That being said it was still a light room which can be one of my issues with hotel rooms. The beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of room for our things. The only reason I have marked the hotel down to a 4 is that our bathroom could have done with a refurb some of the finishes were not what I expected from a 5 hotel. I had to call to get my luggage brought up even through I arrived 5 minutes apart from my family. There was also no tea and coffee facilities. I understand this is a mandarin oriental thing but the hotel is in England and we love our tea. They send out a requirements form prior to your stay and I thought they may ask on there if it is an optional extra. Breakfast and service was lovely. Drinks standard prices for London hotels ie expensive and overpriced but all in all we had a fantastic stay and the wedding was beautiful. I noted someone had remarked about doormen being slightly dodgy you find this in every city of the world.

FirstlyDISABLED WHEELCHAIR USERS DO NOT BOOK THE MANDARIN ORIENTALWe stayed for 2 nights in the London Mandarin Oriental hotel. If we had done the review on the first night we would of rated it only 1 star and we would of gone home the next day if our transport could of been brought forwards. We asked for a disabled room as I am in a wheelchair we arrived and was given a room on floor 5. As we were being shown the room we were told that the whole floor is due to be renovated soon and I think peoples stay will vary depending on if you are in the new areas or the old we are not X aware of this being reflected in the priceWe got to the room and there was a little hallway between the bathroom and bedroom which was useful as my wheelchair did not fit into the room or bathroom and so stayed in the hall. It was impossible to get the wheelchair into the bedroom and the bathroom had no grab rails and a low toilet. Thankfully I am able to crawl because if I was completely wheelchair bound I could not of stayed there although I have come home covered in bruises from having to crawl and struggle. The bed was very uncomfortable and the added bed for the 3rd person even had a spring sticking out the side. I found myself reminiscing about a stay in Premier Inn which was better. We complained but were told the hotel was at 100 capacity so there was nothing that could be done. We had dinner at Bar Boulud and despite telling them when booking in advance that I was in a wheelchair I was given a table where I caused an obstruction and was made to feel awkwardOn the second day we were offered a move by a very helpful member of staff as our first room was on the back and quiet we were not sure whether to take the move or not through fear of getting a room which was even worse but we did in the end decide to move in the hope of being able to get the wheelchair into the room. We moved to the 1st floor staff kindly moved all our bags while we were out and WOW it was like being in a completely different hotel. Both the bedroom and bathroom were huge with plenty of space to move around in and I could easily get to the bed in my wheelchair. The room was modern and comfortable plus with a balcony complete with patio heater over looking Hyde park. On the 2nd day we ate in the same restaurant and asked for a certain table so I did not feel I was causing a blockage. Over all a mixed stay I would only recommend staying on the renovated floors and stay away if you are disabled. I was shocked that despite the high room cost there is no free wifi and we had to request a kettle.

Beautiful property with wonderful staff. it is not quite as good as the Landmark MO in Hong Kong or the newish one in Taipei but I was still very satisfied with it. Check in I arrived early because my stay at the Westbury was decidedly average. Even though it was well before official check in time the staff were extremely gracious and worked hard to get me a room early. I was shown to the Rosebury area and offered tea while I waited. A gentleman at the Rosebury lounge looked after me very well. Room. Warm and well decorated bathroom. I really loved that the entrance way was separate to the bedroom ensuring that there were two doors between the sleeping area and hallway for extra noise buffering of guests walking past the rooms. The bed was huge and comfortable. I loved the beautiful armoire in the room. Spa Lovely space with good facilities. Agata was my therapist and she did a great job. I particularly loved that she recommended products but did not push for sales Bad experience at the MO spa in Vegas for this and she was amenable to using skincare products that I liked which I really appreciated. Thank you AgataHeston Blumenthal Great lively restaurant with pretty good food. I particularly enjoyed my tipsy pudding. Had a bit of difficulty getting a booking in advance I was told they were booked out due to a large group. After pleading and cajoling with the staff member she said she would speak to the manager and they said that they could only offer me 145pm. This was ideal because I wanted something 130pm or after due to the my spa treatments in the morning. I am glad I got a booking in the end but it perhaps would have been better to check the timing with me before being told that they were booked out. Breakfast. Probably the least desirable aspect of my stay. While the food was of an excellent quality it seemed strange to me that my room rate came with breakfast but I was told at the breakfast that I could only order the English breakfast option. Any other a la carte option would be ordered at the full price. I was told at check in that I could have anything and if the meal was more expensive than the English breakfast which she said really only the Asian options were. then I could just pay the difference. So a bit of an inconsistency here. I really wanted French toast as I had been eating English breakfast every day but as English breakfast was included in my room rate and I was not permitted French toast without paying for it outright I could not justify deviating from the English breakfast. I do not think I have ever stayed at such a nice level of hotel with breakfast included in the room rate and been so very limited as to choice. Actually even in cheap hotels there is more than one hot meal option when the breakfast is included in the room rate this was just a bit strange and unnecessarily restrictive on guests I feel. This restriction was not made clear when making the reservation either. Also despite there only being about five tables of people in the breakfast area when I arrived I had to wait to be seated no one came up to seat me for quite some time. A couple of other imperfections were the advertisement of the concierge having newspapers and magazines. I was keen for a magazine to read but they did not have any. The actual concierge services were great though. The gentlemen at the desk and temporary exit were awesome and so amenable to helping me when I had questions. Another blemish was due to renovations my window looked out onto scaffolding and tarp with leafy paint designs. One of the most awful hotel views I have ever had and definitely the worst at this pricepoint. The imperfections are of course minor and did not detract from the enjoyment of my stay.", "offset": [3580, 3674], "date": "2017-06-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "6020761d-72fd-4e65-8b6c-b1c3fe049a7c", "sentence": "All that I was expecting.

Booked the festive afternoon tea for myself a friend and my mum who needed the gluten free version. Our amazing experience started at the front door where the cheery doorman greeted us and ushered inside saying enjoy yourself ladies. We certainly did. The hotels main decor is beautiful and the Rosebery Lounge where you have tea is stunning. All the Xmas decorations were up so that added to the festive feel. There was a real fire roaring away and we spent ages goggling at the chandeliers artwork and furniture. All the waiting staff were brilliant. We were not too happy with our initial seats on a very low banquet sofa but before we said anything the waiter at offered a table with individual comfy chairs around a square table. He took great pains to explain the menu items and made it very clear everything was unlimited. This was a first as typically you can only have one extra cake or round of scones. The Goring Hotel is another exception to this rule and also well worth a visit for tea. At the Mandarin everything from teas sandwiches cakes scones and accouterments can be ordered as many times as you like. The sandwiches came out first beautiful little works of art curled round into tear drop shapes. Fillings were so tasty that my friend and I had three rounds. The waiter was very apologetic that the gluten free versions were straight cut as wheat free bread is too delicate to fold. But my mum was more than happy as the bread was soft and she had all the same generous fillings as us no wimpy substitutes she is been subjected to in other places. She never had to ask for a refill every time we had more the waiter appeared 2 seconds later with more GF sarnies. After a much needed gap we were presented with the cakes and scones. This was brilliant as the scones were fresh baked oh that smell mm unlike other teas I have had were everything comes out in one go and the scones are stone cold by the time you eat them. The gluten free scones were also fresh baked and same cranberry and plain mix as our versions. The cakes like the sandwiches were mini works of art. There was also a stunning variety so despite sharing we did not need anymore. My mum ordered more scones and cakes then got them boxed up to bring home. We were there for 3 hours and never felt rushed. The \u00a3 60 cost including service charge was more than worth it as we were thoroughly sated and felt like royalty throughout the whole afternoon.
