It was not bad overall as the hotel did it is job. My problems started with the inside of the hotel specifically the guest rooms. There were popcorn walls and ceilings which feels heavily outdated. But besides that the rooms had nice furniture although it felt very cramped. Another problem I had was the fact that if I had to pay for wifi if I wanted to access the Internet or any services that require an Internet connection. There are many other places that give out free wifi to their guests and it at least in my eyes seems like the only reason they are charging for wifi in the first place is to gain more of a profit. I understand that a business needs to make money but when many other of your competitors are handing it out for free it is kind of unacceptable. There was this one rule where the pool was only open to people 18 after a certain time and if I remember correctly was at 9 pm. I do not know the reason behind this rule but I know it made many people that I know upset. The layout of the hotel was disorienting to me but that could just be the fault of me. Other than that everything else was fine. The restaurant here was nice. Food was tasty in my opinion and the staff seemed happy to help out. And when I was not surounder by popcorn walls the interior was very nice. Overall it is not a bad place to stay but some of the rules here are questionable and the popcorn walls of the hotel rooms are the most dated things in the world.

Amazing staff and customer service. I recently stayed here for a business trip this entire week checked out this morning and what stood out to me and made me want to write this review was the customer service I experienced while there. First housekeeping does a fantastic job keeping the rooms clean they really deserve recognition. Secondly the restaurant bar employees from all of restaurants do an outstanding job hustling and bustling to ensure everything is perfect for you and they do it with a smile managing through large groups like us is not easy and they pulled it off fantastic. I wish I knew everyone \u2019s name to call them out specifically to recognize but there were so many. Third a small blip in my room from booking King and receiving double beds I did n\u2019t complain as I know things like this can happen especially when several large groups are in town. they proactively tried to make it right to my surprise when I walked into my room on my third night they placed a box of local chocolates and Figi Waters my fav. in my rom it was completely unexpected and such a nice surprise this stood out to me among all other things I \u2019ve listed thus far. Front desk another super small blip with the coffee machine in the lobby was n\u2019t working the gentleman made it right and walked to the restaurant and got me a cup of decaf and did n\u2019t charge me again unexpected and proactive. I hope the teams at this hotel and overall hotel receive the recognition they deserve. The hotel is going under some renovations which I did n\u2019t hear a thing in my room and I was right nearby and I appreciate the hotel making the investment in making the rooms updated and enjoyable as mine was.

I have used this hotel for many years and stayed for maybe over two months in total. While the last staying I was trying to take a bath and filled up the water in the tub. I found that the water was a little bit murky and decided to filter the water with a small hand towel by draining water. You can see the result in the attached photo. My skin got really dry and itchy so I have talked to the front desk manager about my skin condition and conveyed my concern about the water. He directed me to a claims adjuster who was not well educated nor trained very rude so denied communicating with him. I had to talk to about 8 Mariot employees via phone and email but I could not have an appropriate explanation nor other proof that the water was safe to use. The director of safety and security told me to claim if I have any loss or damage but it is hard to prove that it was caused by water either it was not. I requested the water inspection report and they told me that I would have to hire a lawyer to have that information. I do not stay at Santa Clara Mariot since not just because of the quality of water but their attitude. The worst and rudest attitude I have ever experienced. The quality of water is not really good either at other hotels like Hyat IHG and Mariot family hotels in the bay area from my experiences. However the staff at other hotels and services are a lot better compared to the Santa Clara Mariot hotel.

Recently stayed here as a Staycation. We really needed a getaway but could not Get away for more then a night so we decided to check out the Santa Clara Mariot as there are not many Mariot properties around the bay area lots of hotels in the Mariot portfolio but very few are actually Mariots. We booked a 1 King with MClub access 9th floor or higher. If you follow my reviews I break them down by property service and other. In the case of the Santa Clara Mariot I am scoring it as poor and that is me giving this place the benefit of the doubt. let us start off with Service Upon checking in I was told that I do not have the status to have Mclub access I politely asked him to double check as I had purchased access to it and he simply said no you did not but I will give you access to it anyway as if he was doing me a favor. I checked my email booking I PAID for club access. Anyway I let that go and just said thank you and we went up to our room on the 9th floor. In the room features section of the website it says shower tub combination. I needed a tub. The room they put us in did not have a tub. So we had to go back downstairs and ask to be put in a room with a tub. They were accommodating with this however our room certainly got downgraded and they had the nerve to take our club access off of the keys. So we go to our new room which is on the second story next to the pool I highly recommend staying away from these rooms unles you want to be woken up by kids screaming in the pool early in the morning. By this time it is time for some bites wine in the MClub. Turns out THEY do not DO BITES WINE ON FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS. We LITERALLY got ripped off. Why would you let someone purchase Mclub access knowing that you are not offering service. I brought this up with the front desk and the answer I got was. Oh yea sorry about that. and that is it. We LITERALLY booked this place so we could have some RR and have some wine bites paid for that and they did not even have it. Literal definition of getting ripped off. I will say they did still have breakfast in the morning but it is over by 10 am so if your actually on vacation and sleep in you will miss it. So fool me once shame on me. Last time I saw a Mariot commercial it was all about the golden rule and in this case that blatantly could careless. The Valet is kind of hit or miss. We called down to have our call pulled up on multiple on occasions only to come downstairs and have to ask the valet to get our car again. Oh and if you come in late past 1ish. there are not any Valets even working so not great if you are coming in. Overall I am convinced that Mariots are a dying breed. I get better service at Fairfields and Residence Inns then I do at Mariots. it is almost as if Mariot has just totally given up on service. For contrast we checked out and headed to our next destination where we were staying at a Fairmont and it is a night and day difference. Property. A lot of it is under construction but it actually did not bother us at all during our stay. The property itself is actually pretty good. Nice pool area lobby bar restaurant etc. it is really just the service or lack thereof that makes this place not worth it. Food. I ordered a cheese burger from room service and an hour and a half later got really sick. I let them know and they offered to send someone up so I could fill out some paper work and make a formal complaint. Again SERVICE. Why on earth would someone who just got sick from your food want you to come up to their room to make a report. Overall. This property is just not worth it. There are SO many other hotels in the area that blow this place out of the water. I think this place is more for business people who are never actually at the hotel and just use it to eat drink sleep and repeat techy robots. The service here is terrible from every area front desk valet MClub room service. What really told me this place would never get better is I did bring up these issues with them and the answers I got were pretty much just sorry to hear that you can make a formal complaint about the food sickness and we are sorry there was not a Valet so they took that charge of my bill. Misc I am curious if any other Mariot loyalists are experiencing the same thing since the SPG merger. I cam over from Hilton a few years back because Mariots always had such great service. But since the merger the service has been complete trash. You either go with Fairfield or Residence Inn for a cheaper price but at least you know what you are getting or you go Rits St Regis if you want service. what is the point of even having Mariot if the brand is just tanking.", "offset": [3833, 3914], "date": "2019-10-12", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "4e973cc5-b349-4708-b4cb-656fd56a07ee", "sentence": "Good.

I was on hold for about 12 minutes before I simply used my Mariot ap and requested these items. I did send a message via the Mariot ap about my dissatisfaction of my stay.
