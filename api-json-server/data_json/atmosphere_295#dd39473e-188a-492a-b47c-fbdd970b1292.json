Both times we upgraded to get ocean view rooms definitely worth the money. My first visit was for a long weekend getaway in October. The property is absolutely gorgeous with a great beach and beautiful pools. The hotel lobby is also beautiful. With the decor the hotel has a bit of a spa like feel. I liked the hotel so much that I returned for a 4 day trip in mid December. PROS. Excellent service great staff Beautiful property Very good food in the specialty restaurants the main buffet is good but not great Nice large balconys but they seem to only come with one chair. Comfortable rooms Beach chairs are well spaced out not on top of each other as happens in some resorts CONS The personal concierge is just basically a glorified sales person. They will help you book your sightseeing trips which is fine but they will also attempt to get you to go on a Melia Club timeshare presentation. On my second trip the concierge lied to me about this more below. The resort also has a conference center during our second trip there was a conference including 170 realtors that completely changed the feel of the resort from a laid back tropical paradise to more of a Tony Robbins meets an adult spring break vibe. There was no indication when we made the reservation that there would such a large group at the hotel. THE GOTCHA The Club Melia Get a Free Trip promotion is a COMPLETE SCAM. For the record I never do time presentations I have not been to one in over 15 years. On my first trip even though my concierge was doing a relative hard sell I turned it down. On my second trip the concierge pointed out that I was staying for 3 nights. He stated that if I had done the presentation I could have been using a free 3 night certificate and suggested I do the presentation so that I could try one of the other Paradisus resorts. I still resisted stated that there is always a catch. We went back and forth for a while where I asked several specific questions he assured my that there were no hidden fees boldface lie just a 50 registration fee. Since I am a big fan of the two Melia hotels that i have visited I broke my rules and agreed to go to the 90 minute presentation to get a free 50 3 night stay. THE CATCH after the presentation when they game me the certificate they stated that the hotel room is free for three nights but you must pay an all inclusive fee each night which turns out to be at least 160 night making the free trip cost over 500 not 50. I pointed out to them that this was in direct conflict from what I was told by the concierge. To which they pointed out was written clearly in the fine print of the document which I did not have access to until after I wasted 90 minutes in the presentation. I pointed out that I had asked several direct questions about the fees before booking the presentation and after complaining to management they gave me a free massage if I would sign the acceptance of the travel certificate. The moral of the story DO NOT DO A MELIA CLUB PRESENTATION. The free trip is not free and has a series of restrictions. You can do better booking a trip with hotel and air combined on Orbitz or Expedia. The sleazy timeshare pushing is a real negative for what otherwise appears to be a high end luxury hotel. IN SUMMARY My first trip to the Paradisus in October was amazing. I travel frequently and rarely return to the same property however this was so nice that I went back. My second trip to the Paradisus in December was still nice but somewhat disappointing. Two days before the large group arrived they began building a huge stage in the middle of the beach and putting large signage all over the property. When the realtors arrived they had an event that complete took over the pool area. The zen feel that I enjoyed so much the first time was completely lost. If there is a way to check that there are no large groups at the same time as your trip I would highly recommend the property.", "offset": [1058, 1308], "date": "2015-01-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a29485c8-f2b6-4ef2-840d-d301bbf57c20", "sentence": "Wonderful waters.

My family has stayed six times at various Paradisus resorts and I would put this one at the bottom of the list. The location is convenient to the airport but away from the hustle and bustle of the city itself so that part is very nice. The resort itself sits on a strip of resorts so if you are looking to \u201c get away from it all \u201d this is n\u2019t the place. The atrium to the hotel is beautiful with a lush array of foliage that melds well with the hotel. The layout is great with restaurants and shops centrally located around the sushi restaurant which with its open concept and wood appointments sets the mood for a wonderful dining experience. The food is excellent as is typical of the Paradisus brand and when live music is playing on the stage in the center of the atrium it permeates through the halls of the hotel and sets a warm atmosphere. The pool itself is beautiful and the family area is well thought out with a cordoned off shallow area for little ones that is connected to the main pool so one does not get the feeling they are banished to the kids \u2019 table at Thanksgiving. However adequate seating is woefully lacking and despite the signs that clearly state that one may not set out personal belongings at the crack of dawn to reserve spaces this is clearly NOT enforced \u2026 so forget the lazy morning and get ready to brawl if you want a good spot. Unlike other Paradisus resorts there are few shaded cabanas so even if you are staying at a level that allows for reserving them often they are not available. Idiotically there is a row of cabanas along the pool that require 50 to reserve so much for all inclusive. so they typically sit empty all day despite the fact that there is n\u2019t enough seating to go around. Go figure. Beyond March the heat is often oppressive and the sheer cloth panels on the cabana lounges by the beach provide little relief. The riptide undercurrent is downright dangerous and the caution flags are always on red no swimming. That said the beach itself is beautiful and the water is a vibrant aqua. The rooms are well appointed although the internet is not the best. The spa is lovely as is characteristic of the Paradisus resorts. However the Kids Club is depressing and when we picked our kids up there were four kids from Boston plus my two from New Hampshire all watching the Lego Movie \u2026 in Spanish ha. The hallway to in which the Kids Club is situated was also the one through which we traveled from our hotel wing to the main part of the hotel and unfortunately it reminded me of an old depressing shopping mall from the 1970 \u2019s with some empty storefronts almost no decorations and poor lighting. The shows were great and having them in the bar centrally located was great although there never was enough seating seems to be a theme at this resort. The great sound system for the shows really stirred up excitement about the resort and made for fun nights. Importantly if you dare to rent a car beware. When we rented our car at the agency in the resort to drive to XCaret which is awesome by the way I saw three cars pulled up for prospective renters. I purposely drove at 1 Km hr slower than the speed limit to minimize the risk I might get pulled over. Despite this not more than 200 yards from the resort we were pulled over for speeding although locals were screaming by us going at least 20 Km hr faster and after being given two unpalatable options for paying the fine I was given the option to \u201c settle \u201d the matter right then and there. After continuing on our way I saw the other two rental cars pulled over further along the same road. In the parking lot at XCaret we saw many cars with no rear license plates indicating they too had been pulled over and in each case they were rental cars complete with stickers for the respective rental agencies. Coincidence. Hm \u2026 2 2Finaly of all the Paradisus resorts at which we have stayed the staff at the Paradisus Cancun were by far the least accommodating. If you are paying thousands of dollars for a well earned vacation the last thing you want to feel like is you have to pull teeth for people to do their job \u2026 and even then I got the sense they were expecting a tip. In summary the Paradisus Cancun is nice and in the crush of a New England winter it is a welcome relief but do n\u2019t expect the same level of attention or accommodation that you may receive at other Paradisus properties. Heck travel one hour south and stay at the Paradisus in Playa del Carmen \u2026 now that \u2019s a vacation.", "offset": [476, 667], "date": "2015-04-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "5d876059-78ca-4d6f-a1ba-64bb24a95601", "sentence": "Magical Week at Paradisus. We had our wedding at Paradisus Cancun with 24 guests. Planning with the Romance team went smoothly and the wedding was perfect. We had our ceremony at the wedding gazebo right in front of the beach and the reception in the pool area. It ended up pouring rain during the last hour but everyone was a good sport and partied in the rain anyways. The staff even brought us warm towels to dry off with. About the resort I was blown away the second I walked in. It smells nice everywhere you go. we have been to many all inclusive resorts and this one was by far the best. We tried most of the a la carte restaurants and they were all excellent. You can only book one day in advance so when we could not get reservations we ate at the buffet but even the food at the buffet was delicious. There was a great selection of food and desserts which I never got to try but I hear were amazing. We had the opportunity to dine at Tempo. Our waiter Florencio was excellent and very attentive. I ordered the fish and it melted in my mouth so good. The overall experience was nice very high class. We were served Moet as we entered and the men were handed a rose to give to their ladies at the end of the meal. When we wanted some late night food the Blue Agave is open from midnight until 7 am or something like that. they have only got hot dogs nachos and burgers at that hour but it is good drunk food. The dress code is actually pretty relaxed as long as men do not show up for dinner at the buffet or a la carte restaurants in a tank top it is all good. Woman can wear pretty much anything but a bathing suit. A few other things I enjoyed about the resortTop shelf liquor at all the bars not just for Royal Service guestsNespreso Bar excellent coffee and the barista Andres was really friendly24 Hour Room Service food was not spectacular but doable if you are too lazy to leave your romAvenue Bar nice place to chill and drink with large parties Thiery Mugler bath amenities Lots of goodies in fridge stocked daily When you ask for water they give you bottled water Beach was clean water was nice and warm. Seaweed problem not as bad as expectedServers going around the pool and beach area taking drink orders Bus stop right outside the resort easy ride to get downtownDecent Wi Fi connection all throughout the resort and pool area It made it easy to communicate with our large group. The connection tends to cut off close to the beachFriendly staff everywhereTurn down service had no idea what this was before I came here but apparently someone comes and closes your drapes removes the throw pillows and puts chocolates on your bed. Nice touch. A few minor cons Building 3 is pretty loud at night because of the live bands playing on the main floor and the night club bumping until 2 am. did not bother me but it might bother light sleepers and people with children. I preferred to stay in building 3 because it is where all the restaurants shops and spa are located. Also the AC throughout the resort is not very good but good enough in the bedroom. They run out of towels fast at the pool so grab them while you can or wait 20 minutes while they restock. I read many reviews prior to our trip about the Club Melia timeshare people. Actually they were not as aggressive as some reviews made them out to be. A few of our wedding guests did attend some of the timeshare presentations 15 2 hrs long in exchange for spa certificates and discounts on excursions. It was a memorable week and all of our guests raved about the resort and the food. In a way Paradisus ruined all inclusives for us because now we can not go back it is 5 star or nothing.

My wife and I always wanted to stay at this big resort. Cancun is our favorite winter getaway and we have been many times trying different hotels. The restaurants were very cool.

Gerardo Edgar and Daniel made our experience enjoyable at Enzo and at the restaurant Vento Jose Katha and Gerardo did a great job. We enjoyed the dance show every nite before we went to dinner. The rooms are a little tired and the pool water is a little on the cold side but we could not help but have a great vacation at this hotel.

We stayed in a more private building with a more quiet pool. The only complaint about the Royal service is the butler aspect he did not really do much he only booked our dinners we rarely saw him and he really did not seem to care to go out of his way to offer us anything. The entire vibe of the hotel is amazing. the atmosphere is very calming yet chic at the same time. The greenery inside the building was gorgeous. The breakfast buffet was great just was not a fan of the eggs they used at the omelette station they did not taste right. But all of the restaurants were amazing at the resort and even called up room service a few times for drunk munchies which was great lol. we love the pool staff they are very attentive Daniel was the best at attending to us at our Bali beds he is such a sweet heart we also loved Jeison at the pool bar in the public pool he was so much fun more so than the other bartenders. We wish there were more fun activities to do at night on the resort the entertainment was kind of lame it was definitely geared towards an older crowd we are 24.

This was our first stay at the hotel and it did not disappoint. I read a lot of reviews some good and some not so good. Let me tell you I was impressed. The service was phenomenal. The check in process was a breeze. We arrived around 9 am. Check in time was not until 4 pm but both of our rooms were ready upon arrival so we were able to comfortably get our vacation started right away. When you walk into the lobby you are greeted by an awesome aroma. There were plenty of plants and it was very nicely decorated. I could also appreciate the fact that all of the restaurants are located in the same area so you always know where to find food. When we reached our room we were pleased. But the outlets were a little quirky in that you must have the light on in order for the outlets to work which meant that traveling with several phones and devices you may end up sleeping with the lights on if you want a full charge for the morning. The beds were comfy enough and the bathroom was nice. I especially liked the raindrop showerhead. The temperature controls in the room worked well and we had a nice balcony of good size. We stayed in tower 3. The night club and lobby can get pretty loud in the evenings but we are noisy people so it did not bother us too much. However this may have been a concern if we were traveling with a baby or needed to get up early. Room service was courteous prompt and included in our package. The food selection was pretty good. we have stayed a several resorts and I think the food here was best. There was always a wide selection and something to eat for everyone. The waitstaf was pleasant and always willing to go the extra mile. I was never more than 20 feet away from a shot of tequila so that made up for the mini bar in the room which consisted of beer soda water and light snacks. There was not very much to do in the area of hotel but it was conveniently located about 20 minutes from the airport. We traveled for my daughters 18th birthday. This place was not too wild and we even felt comfortable allowing her to walk around the resort on her own. This is a very calm laid back atmosphere. If you are looking to party you could probably have a nice time at the club but might do better taking a trip to Coco Bongo for the night. Oh the best part was the kids club.

The Paradisus was one of the best experiences I have had in Mexico. Having stayed at other chains in Playa del Carmen Puerto Plata Cozumel and Cabo the biggest difference was the staff. They were professional pleasant and attentive. I would especially like to give a shout out to Christian Lovera who served us in the buffet and to Salvador who served us at Coco \u2019s. The rooms were clean and the house keeping on time and regular. Always fresh towels and a clean room after a day at the beach or by the pool. I would also note that the air conditioning was consistent and once we set the desired temperature the house keeping staff did not re adjust it higher a practice we have often experienced. The food was very good. The buffet provided a wide selection including meat fish pasta multiple salad choices fresh fruit and various bread and desserts. Unfortunately the Market Grill the steak restaurant was closed for restoration while we were there so we decided to eat out one night at Fred \u2019s across the street. We had some problems with our room safe and our door locks but the hotel staff was on the job within minutes to fix the issues. There were a couple of things that could have been improved. The entre portions at Mole were so small we went to the buffet afterwards. The Japanese restaurant Bana had good food but the service could have been better. It took almost an hour to get our entre. One final thing in the evening the hotel burns scented candles. I am sure they do this to try to create a nicer ambience but one needs to like that sort of thing. It mainly just gave me a headache. Over all it was a great week. The pool was excellent There were always chairs available.

Yes thos Hotel is outdated but that is not the problem. There are several major issues with this potential great place1. Infrastructure it is a mess having to go up stairs and down stairs all the time cause pyramid 1 ONLY communicates with pyramid 2 in 1 floor. And same between 2 and 3. So from our room to go to lower level and the major restaurant we needed to go down to then go up. This hotel has little real estate. Yes we were while hotel was 85 90 full but there was a line to get breakfast at 8 am. The place is designed not considered people flow so accumulates people in certain areas and makes it over crowded. There are also 1 unique breakfast place in a buffet restaurant where you need to make a line. No other options and people are forced to crowd some areas. There is also a need to grab a place in the beach or at the pool before 8AM. There are several hits left but no resting reclaiming chairs. How can you explain thatThere are two lounges one is never used red lounge and the other and open space with sort of Bali beads with very loud music electronic music not appealing to the non milenial guests. This place needs some serious musical consultant musical selection at the pool and beach is deeply needed. Were in a tropical place relaxing and all music is for electronic partying. The restaurant newley renovated is uninviting and poorly designed. People come and go again no flow so always crowded and you have to bump to everyone and different to ikea again there is not a smart flow of traffic. Did I mention wait in line. Possibly understaffed also. Too many co charges all over the hotel trying to upsel Melia Club CIRCLE but not so many servers. And some empty staples that can be rotated faster. Finally. Very important this place needs a pastry chef. Not even ice cream is good desserts are really really really way below average. Everyday incredibly in all restaurants especially in the main awful desert is a treat on vacation is important. Really poor selection not fun not tasty. Finally lack of Mexican experience. We really wanted a real mexican experience. The night we set aside for the non reservation was closed when hotel busy. Not even a quesadilla fajita kind of disappointing. Finally the Hispanic manana syndrome. 10AM can be 10 or 1030AM. This means checknin and check out are a nightmare. Specially checkin. They have credit card all info taking a copy of a passport and keys should be simple but takes for ever. Even more disgusting you are bombarded by these converges trying to trick you to give them 90 minutes it is really way more than that to listen to a sales speech to get you to purchase circle membership.

Since our trip to Melia Paradisus in December 2019 I have been debating how to write this review because when we originally stayed in Feb 2019 we stayed as not the full Royal Service but as an add on when checking in. Since both services were so different and we returned due to a previous negative experience that corporate wanted to remedy see previous review this is n\u2019t an updated review but a new review based on our second experience returning in the full Royal Service. Much better. No upsel\u2018s this time. And same great service from the staff. Daniel was there once again leading his team to victory but now there was a new fabulous addition the new manager Ramon. They are a dynamic duo and trying the highlight of both trips. Was n\u2019t worth the butler service \u2026 While the butlers are very nice they were n\u2019t really around to build that personal connection and if you \u2019re there for a week the butlers do have days off. Our butler was very responsive and very sweet and we enjoyed getting to know her but unfortunately we only had 2 days from the week with her and then we were passed off to another butler and two days later another. Also one of the big downfalls in my last review were the restaurants and how hard it was to get a reservation so most of the time you \u2019re eating in the main buffet. It was still a huge challenge this go round even with a butler to make your reservations. Again most meals we ate the snacks the Royal Lounge or at the polside Royal restaurant La Palapa. The staff was raving about the new international buffet aka. the main buffet it was newly renovated since we had been there the first time and while it was fine and offered many many many options it \u2019s a bummer that they took out an actual restaurant to make the main buffet larger. Maybe this is how they intend to accommodate the lack of reservations \u2026 AND FINALLY OMG PLEASE CHANGE YOUR TOILET PAPER TO UNSCENTED. thank God I remembered this from our last stay and brought my own toilet paper roll. but this is a huge problem. I ran out of my roll the last day and had to use a very small amount of the hotel toilet paper in our last hours and yet again both trips I encountered this from vacationing here suffered a UTI when returning home. Women \u2019s bits are sensitive and scented toilet paper is not good for anyone \u2019s health leads to UTI \u2019s and yeast infections I know bc I got one both times after returning from our week stays and had to see a doctor. All in all great experience this time and it was 100 better but I would be curious if it \u2019s only bc of our complaint to corporate or if this will be the new standard for guests going forward.

Since our trip to Melia Paradisus in December 2019 I have been debating how to write this review because when we originally stayed in Feb 2019 we stayed as not the full Royal Service but as an add on when checking in. Since both services were so different and we returned due to a previous negative experience that corporate wanted to remedy see previous review this is n\u2019t an updated review but a new review based on our second experience returning in the full Royal Service. Much better. No upsel\u2018s this time. And same great service from the staff. Daniel was there once again leading his team to victory but now there was a new fabulous addition the new manager Ramon. They are a dynamic duo and trying the highlight of both trips. Was n\u2019t worth the butler service \u2026 While the butlers are very nice they were n\u2019t really around to build that personal connection and if you \u2019re there for a week the butlers do have days off. Our butler was very responsive and very sweet and we enjoyed getting to know her but unfortunately we only had 2 days from the week with her and then we were passed off to another butler and two days later another. Also one of the big downfalls in my last review were the restaurants and how hard it was to get a reservation so most of the time you \u2019re eating in the main buffet. It was still a huge challenge this go round even with a butler to make your reservations. Again most meals we ate the snacks the Royal Lounge or at the polside Royal restaurant La Palapa. The staff was raving about the new international buffet aka. the main buffet it was newly renovated since we had been there the first time and while it was fine and offered many many many options it \u2019s a bummer that they took out an actual restaurant to make the main buffet larger. Maybe this is how they intend to accommodate the lack of reservations \u2026 AND FINALLY OMG PLEASE CHANGE YOUR TOILET PAPER TO UNSCENTED. thank God I remembered this from our last stay and brought my own toilet paper roll. but this is a huge problem. I ran out of my roll the last day and had to use a very small amount of the hotel toilet paper in our last hours and yet again both trips I encountered this from vacationing here suffered a UTI when returning home. Women \u2019s bits are sensitive and scented toilet paper is not good for anyone \u2019s health leads to UTI \u2019s and yeast infections I know bc I got one both times after returning from our week stays and had to see a doctor. All in all great experience this time and it was 100 better but I would be curious if it \u2019s only bc of our complaint to corporate or if this will be the new standard for guests going forward.

Hotel food okay staff and service 1010. We returned to this hotel for the second time in as many years. Our trip last year was cut short due to illness and after much deliberation Meli\u00e1 owners of Paradisus resorts granted us the nights that we missed to use this year. This is our fourth vacation to a Paradisus resort but the first two were at the property in Playa Del Carmen which by all accounts I would rate slightly higher than this one though both are pretty awesome in different ways. We have had two very different experiences at the resort in Playa Del Carmen with the first year being just fabulous and the second year being just OK. That is what prompted us to try the property in Cancun in the first place. The hotel is beautiful with hanging gardens and very well manicured but it is dated. There are some remodeled portions and some that are n\u2019t and we only learned by chance the difference between the two when we visited last year. This year we were led it to one of the older rooms and we immediately requested one of the remodeled versions and they moved us without much fuss. The all inclusive restaurants with the exception of two require reservations. That is no problem except they sort of walk you through your meal step by step and it is a very prescribed experience. I do n\u2019t feel like the staff is tipped consistently so at some of the restaurants the service was lackluster by comparison. That being said the staff and service during this trip from our concierge to the restaurants to the polside waiters was outstanding. We want to give a special shout out to a few in particular that helped to make this a very special vacation for our young family. At the pool Sofonio was awesome. He took extra special care of us each day that we were there and was great with our kids. A piece of advice I appreciated that the staff noticed on the first day that I left what must \u2019ve been a generous tip. They were fantastic then but took it several steps further after we tipped them well. This seems to resonate throughout the property. Tip these workers people. It is probably the majority of their income. I handed 20 at the end of each pool day after having been served many drinks food towel service and general prompt attention. To me that \u2019s a small price to pay for exceptional service and it improved each day that we visited. Our family concierge butlers Brenda and especially Gloria were awesome. There was a special treat and surprise waiting in our room each afternoon for the kids and they handled our reservations and really anything we needed including polside Bali bed reservations. That level of service is exclusive to Family Concierge and Royal Service adults only. A quick note about upgrading to family Concierge it is not quite the same upgrade in Cancun as it is in Playa Del Carmen for a few reasons. In Playa Del Carmen which for the family friendly side is called Paradisus La Esmerelda there is a separate family Concierge swimming pool which is the only pool that is heated on the property and also a separate family concierge beach area for those kind of days. Cancun has the same private check in and larger rooms for family concierge guests but the rest of it is pretty much the same for everyone other than the fact that you can reserve daybeds and get unlimited towels. We found out during the trip from another family that had not paid for the upgrade that the hotel was being very strict with towels and chairs day beds for them since they were not Family Concierge guests. Other than that they get the same drinks the same food in the same pool as we did for substantially less. That \u2019s fine and we would not have known the difference had we not already visited the property in Playa Del Carmen. All in all we will probably not visit this property for the next several years but we intend to explore other Paradisus properties in Los Cabos and other parts of the Caribbean.", "offset": [1197, 1315], "date": "2020-03-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "1cb64dc4-dade-4c0c-ad7c-e235d1d4b978", "sentence": "Beautiful property great drinks too party oriented. TLDR Very nice upscale resort. Drinks were top notch food was good and service was excellent. Constant music party vibe was grating spa felt rushed. My wife and I stayed at the Paradisus Cancun in February for a mid winter thaw. We waited too long to book so this was pretty much the only resort in Cancun that fit our budget and amenities list. We arrived very late in the evening on our first day and were immediately impressed with the lobby and reception. Everything inside the resort smells fresh and lush. At night the resort is lit with soft purple lights and looks awesome. Check in was very easy and a nice touch was the premium resort bracelets for the all inclusive. wood and cloth instead of paper. Our room was very clean and spacious with a private balcony with a jetted tub. The lagoon view was mostly of a parking lot but you could see the water easilywe are foodies so the food was an important part of our resort choice. Unfortunately we were a little disappointed overall however the food itself is good just not great. there is only one breakfast location so make sure to get there early or be prepared to wait in line. Food is above average for a buffet though. Lunch time is similarly limited with Blue Agave serving decent tacos or Malva with a lunch buffet did not try it. Fuego opens for lunch at 1 pm and has very good burgers. Definitely the best lunch option. For dinner we tried Vento Enso Mole and Fuego. They are opening a new paid only restaurant named Sal that we did not try. Fuego and Vento were good but nothing spectacular. Mole and Enso on the other hand were exceptional. The food was more flavorful and really well prepared. Note that portions at all restaurants was very small. The food was very instagram worthy but we often were hungry after dinner. This is not a resort where you split a meal. Unles you have the stomach of a squirrel. Exceptions for those who are hungry were the meat platter at Mole and the burgers at Fuego. Service at all restaurants was excellent. Lastly the drinks were great. Never got a watered down drink and they even have 180 Anejo available as part of the all inclusive. The activities at the resort were pretty good but not amazing. The best by far was the sunset mixology. it is a different bartender on Mondays and Thursdays so go twice. We got the best drinks from Giovani and it was a lot of fun. The tequila tasting was alright same with the sushi making class. We booked a couple sessions at the spa and while overall it was really nice there is a few areas they could improve. The preparation area is pretty nice with clean locker rooms and sauna facilities. The hydrotherapy pool waiting area was sort of outors and was looking a bit dated. It was not the most relaxing experience either as people would be in the hotub talking. The massages themselves were excellent very relaxing and enjoyable. We did the couples wrap treatment too which was awesome. Our only points of complaint were that the massage rooms were a degree too cold and the whole process felt rushed. As soon as we finished our massages we were handed survey forms to fill out. Once that was done we were rushed back to our separate changing areas. It would be much better if they let you sit and relax for a while maybe letting you sip some champagne or water. Lastly the beach and pool area. The beach in Cancun is wonderful and super soft. The surf was high the whole time we were there so they did not recommend swimming. They do have lifeguards though which is nice. The pool area was very spacious and pretty. However people would reserve pretty much every pool chair by about 8 am. If you want to just wander out and read by the pool that is not going to happen. The resort needs a better solution there. As a result we ended up booking a covered Bali bed by the pool two days we were there. Excellent decision and totally worth the cost. You get a spacious bed to relax on ours included a bottle of proseco it was ok and a seafood platter. Boy is it a platter too. Two lobster tails 3 kinds of ceviche and chips and guac. One of the best things we ate at the resort. The polside service was outstanding too Didier was very attentive and ensured we always had drinks or food. Here is also where we had our biggest issue though the music. Maybe this was just the wrong resort to come and relax but they have a big sound system setup that constantly blasts dance music. Most of the time you could not hear the ocean over Justin Bieber or whatever US pop artist they were playing. There were speakers at the pool and facing towards the beach ensuring you could not escape it. Similarly the Avenue bar in the resort was always playing dance music too. If that was not enough the bass from the Red Lounge was often audible in the main resort area. The music was not enough to ruin the resort but it definitely was annoying and is why we will not be coming back despite how good everything else was overall.", "offset": [2775, 2862], "date": "2020-03-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "1cb64dc4-dade-4c0c-ad7c-e235d1d4b978", "sentence": "Beautiful property great drinks too party oriented.
