Mr Curtis Petaway truly went above and beyond to ensure my stay was a memorable one.

Mr Petaway stayed in constant communication with me making sure that everything was just as he stated. The hotel staff was extremely polite and helpful and saw to it that each time we left the hotel my car was waiting outside for us with the air conditioner set \u201c. just right\u201d.

The hotel was closed after Hurricane Harvey and reopened after extensive repairs. Lobby looks great lots of reviews likely from before it closed. It reopened recently but they left the old rooms mostly as is smelly fraying carpets tired rooms etc. Worst though is the service. Omni Hotels Management. This Hotel is blighting your reputation. I am a business traveler. My company has sponsored several events here last few months. First one hot water problems made people late and grouchy to breakfast meetings. Food was poor. And service was very poor I left a breakfast menu selection outside my door before 9PM. They never picked it up overnight so no coffee at 7AM for when I ordered it delivered. They then took more than half hour for them to get me a simple pot of hot coffee but forgot the milk i ordered so took another half hour. Also no decent coffee shop in hotel. And espresso machine is only operated between certain hours no earlier than 6AM. Second business trip just today the restaurant is closed so they are serving people dinner in the lobby with only one wait person on staff for the lobby bar. As hotel is a bit isolated and none within easy walking distance you are forced to eat here when on business. So comedy of errors trying to order get your food. meanwhile the restaurant sits dark and bar area and lobby where there are tables to eat are overcrowded because everyone is in same boat stuck at the hotel for dinner. Bartender and manager is overwhelmed doing their best but not able to do much. For the first meeting incidentally we did an employee survey not surprisingly they recommended we not host events here. I will recommend to our corporate events person that we no longer hold events at Omni.", "offset": [973, 1130], "date": "2019-04-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "c4555df0-1274-44cb-a553-70dff57b72f4", "sentence": "Does the Omni brand a disservice. I had a great experience I actually planned on leaving a 5 star review until tonight. The bar would not let my friends aunt who is over 50 in.

I understand if someone under the age of 30 was n\u2019t let in without ID however this was not the case. Her card was on file as the master tab so how could they be comfortable charging her for everyone \u2019s drinks not just hers.
