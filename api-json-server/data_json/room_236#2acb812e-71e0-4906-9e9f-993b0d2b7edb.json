We stay at this Ritz Carlton every year and this was the first time we stayed here after Christmas and we got a good package rate in an Executive Suite which was very roomy. It was decorated so beautifully had 2 TVs as well as a full bath and a half bath. Our wonderful experience started with Brooke from guest relations. Not sure if it was because we are Mariot gold members but she contacted us several days prior to our stay to inquire of our estimated arrival time if we were celebrating anything special. We were celebrating our 15th anniversary so the first day of arrival we received a beautiful display of sparkling wine chocolate covered strawberries. What a wonderful surprise. Really made us feel like valued guests. Chris Who we think was the manager of Guest Services brought our luggage up to the room and was so helpful personable. House keeping was good but inconsistent. Whoever cleaned our room prior to us checking in might not have been as thorough as some of the other staff members. It looked as though the carpet had not been thoroughly vacuumed and there were black hairs on the toilet. On another day the attendant removed the used water glasses but did not restock our room with clean ones. But the staff here is so responsive and after a quick call to the front desk we had clean water glasses brought up to us very quickly. Room service was always excellent as well. Owa took our orders the mornings we ordered room service she was excellent. Very thorough patient. The food was always cooked perfectly was deliciousEvening turndown service was a very nice touch and we even had rose petal turndown service one night. Not sure if that was because it was our anniversary or not. but it was so beautiful special. The Lobby Lounge is busy but a great place to grab a late afternoon snack adult beverage. The spa was incredibly relaxing. The service was top notch. Had a wonderful massage from Natalia and THE BEST facial ever from Julie. Mission accomplished for romantic relaxing anniversary getaway.

But I felt like we should have had those placed in our rooms like before. The last 3 times we have stayed we got the cheapest room and got all those extras like bears bags cooler cupcakes champagne personal notes and tents for the kids to play in. This last stay I wanted to upgrade our room to a suite and also get club level to see if that experience was even better however I felt more pampered spending less money on the cheaper room that I did spending 300 more this time around. Its the little things that make us enjoy the Ritz like the kids club the bears for the girls the Ritz products like the cooler and bags that make us feel special and on this last visit I had to request everything bears rubber duckies cupcakes ect.

We were pleasantly surprised by our stay st The Whitely. After reading some of the recent reviews I was not sure what kind of visit we would end up having. I am happy to report that we enjoyed our stay and we will definitely be staying here again. We usually stay at the InterContinental Buckhead which is right down the road from this hotel. I would say this hotel is right on par with the InterContinental maybe exceeds it in some areas. Our room was a standard double room which had 2 full size beds. I thought the beds were a bit on the small side but they were comfortable. I will say that the bathroom was small and is in no way better than the InterContinental bathrooms. They just had a standard tub shower combo and a vanity. My favorite thing about the rooms was the espresso machine. That was a nice touch. They do have a wet bar also. The room was clean and smelled clean also. I enjoyed the robes provided in the closet as well. I loved the pool and hot tub area. They have an indoor pool with hot tub. Usually indoor pools equate to a hot muggy odd smelling experience. Not at this place they have an excellent ventilation system which makes for a more enjoyable experience. I also liked the fact that they have complimentary drink stations located throughout the hotel grounds anything from lime water to pink lemonade. I loved the fact that this hotel has a standard checkout time of 12 noon. They will also allow you a late checkout at NO charge which is at 2 pm. That is not usually the case at other 5 star hotels. The InterContinental charges 75 for a late checkout. This hotel is located across the street from Lenox Mall. It is within walking distance to shopping and eating. The only negative comment I have to make is regarding the check out process. Upon check in I did a cash deposit for the 200 incidental charge. The incidental charge is 100 for credit card or 200 for cash. That is a ridiculous policy. So instead of going to the bank to make a deposit I just decided to pay the 200 cash for incidentals. The next day when it was time to check out this caused a delay of us getting to leave. I had kept up with the in room charges that we accrued during our stay and I presented that information to the front desk lady so she could settle my charges and refund the difference in cash. We had to wait another 20 minutes for her to get someone to go verify our in room charges to make sure we were not stifing them for a 12 jar of gummy bears. The lady had me wait off to the side while housekeeping checked our room. So 20 minutes later they radioed down to confirm everything I had already told her. That was a bit embarrassing to say the least. How many people staying at a 5 star hotel steal candy from the wet bar in their room. My guess is that they can certainly afford it. All in all. we enjoyed our stay. I will just be sure to pay incidentals with a credit card next time.", "offset": [2139, 2331], "date": "2018-09-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "18e1f153-104d-4da7-a424-37c6767deac4", "sentence": "Luxury and service as it should be. I remember when I was a chief of staff at the local hospital we had to go Naples where along with other 70 or so MDs we were subjected to a series of lectures and workshops about the Ritz Carlton experience.

Upon checking the concierge clerk Will gave us a nice room however he was so nice that I believe that even if he had put us in the basement we could not have been happier.

Upon Check in I confirmed with the front desk my reservation. club level room with 2 beds. The bellman took our bags and when we got to the room it was a King bed. Apparently they have the wrong information in their system and the room given to us appears double. They did not have any other available room in the club level therefore we were placed in other floor with Club access. While in our room we tried contacting the hotel manager room was dirty and bellman misplaced our sons pillow from home. We were told they were busy and we should get a call back. they never call us back. We were tired and decided not to make it a big deal and just accept the situation. The next morning we asked for an update on the missing pillow and no one was aware of the pillow or the call that we never got from the manager. The pillow had been in placed in lost and found. We had 2 different reservations as we previously decided to book an extra night big mistake. Eventhough we told upon check in to combine or make a note that we were staying 3 nights. we were woken up by house keeping 830 am to clean our room as they thought it was our checkout date. They deactivated our keys and we had to come downstairs to fix the situation. The bellman was sent to move our bags out of our room around 4 pm. Lucky for us that we had just comeback to the hotel. Apparently we were supposed to be checkout. No communication between the staff of the hotel. We were provided with a credit for the Club level in which it was appreciated.

This hotel needs a lot of improvement. We stayed here for 1 night over the weekend to check it out given all of its latest renovations. All of my complaints and issues are with the service at the hotel. I think the service needs to be drastically improved for this property to live up to the Luxury Collection brand. For reference I stay over 100 nights a year in Mariot properties and this was by far the worst experience at a hotel of this level and brand. My isues1. Had to Ask About my Suite I requested a suite upgrade and that request was confirmed and went through. I got an email confirmation. When I checked in the receptionist was going to give me a regular room. I had to prompt her and ask about the suite upgrade and then she backtracked and said. oh yes there is a suite. If I was not semi familiar with the room layout names I would have been none the wiser and had my suite upgrade taken without getting the actual benefit. Bottom line I should not have had to prompt the receptionist to get my suite2. Room Not Ready Until 730pm ESTWhen I checked in it was 530pm in the afternoon. I was told the room was not cleaned yet and it would be ready by around 645pm. Well lo and behold it was not ready until 730pm. Given that check in is 3 pm I think a 4 12 hour delay is unacceptable especially so late in the day. 3. Hotel Front Desk Unhelpful The hotel front desk asked us when we would check out and I just gave an arbitrary time of 11 am 1 hour before the standard noon checkout. The way the hotel front desk asked about about check out though made us feel rushed to leave when our hotel room was not even ready until 730. In addition I was new to this hotel and I had to ask about the club level lounge because I heard another guest talking about it to get more clarification on where it is and what was offered there. Room. We stayed in one of the bedroom suites. The suite layout is nice with a living room and then a bedroom with contemporary furnishings. There is a Nespreso in the room for coffee and the suite has 15 bathrooms which is nice for multiple people. Amenities1.
