We stayed in the Club level and requested a view of the park. When we booked the room the person on the phone promised us a view and Disney Magic touches for such a special day. We had stayed at the club level before and last time we were greeted with an escort balloons and special buttons to wear. This time we stood around the lobby for 12 hour waiting for our reservation person. We were then told we had to check our bags another 12 hour. Upstairs we were left in the lounge until the clerk came back with our room keys. No view. And the wrong type of beds. We negotiated with her for close to 2 hours before we reached a compromise. Still no view but the right type of bed. We had early dinner reservations and the clerk thought we could get into our room by 4 pm if she requested a rush. We then spent 12 hour in the park and returned to retrieve our bags another 12 hour with just enough time to brush our teeth. Changing our clothes was out of the question. We returned to our room that night and found flashing telephone messages reminding us to be out of the room by 11. Not my idea of a magic touch. The Club level at the Grand California Hotel is ridiculously expensive. The staff is rude and unhelpful. We wasted the entire afternoon dealing with the check in process. Our romantic trip to Disneyland and a nice hotel was ruined by a greedy inefficient operation that charges top dollar and delivers nothing. Stay somewhere else where you get what you pay for.", "offset": [795, 909], "date": "2016-02-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "40d71991-40b0-42c7-9d2a-ba49725615fe", "sentence": "Perfect location and good stay but seriously expensive for what you get. We stayed here 3 nights while visiting the parks. The hotel is perfectly geared for families with little touches like a movie playing with small chairs next to reception to keep the kids happy while checking in. We were able to get a bunk room and I highly recommend this for families as it gives you more floor space. The room was comfortable and had everything we needed and we even got a partial view of the spectacular night show. The pool area is good but a little clinical. It would have been elevated to greatness if it blended more into the neighbouring forest of California adventure and perhaps a river like feature. The Napa rose was very good with the best service we have had in the USA. The food was also very good as was the wine. But at a bill of 500 AUD for 2 adults and 2 small kids it would want to be. The pool bar had some good touches like large bottles of milk etc to take back to the room. The food here was not good on so many levels. All up we had a great stay and were really happy. Would I stay here again. No way. For the cost I had stay at the Disney hotel it is not that much further or at one of the neighbouring properties and give my self another few days on the slopes at Aspen.", "offset": [895, 986], "date": "2016-03-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "1d3fc771-603b-4a20-b2e3-3ae157d6df2a", "sentence": "Convienence to the parks.

We love Disneyland and the Grand Californian is a great location for the park but avoid the Club level during its remodeling. Instead of the the regular Craftsman Club which is closed they moved things throughout the hotel. The moved the snacks and noon and later food outdoors which is okay unles it is too hot cold or raining. They do not have proper food chilling I ended up sick from food poisoning only to see a day later they were finally coming out and measuring food temperatures. The morning food is in Napa Rose which is great but the manager had know clue what was going on regular staff came over and let us know just to ask them if we had questions. Finally instead of viewing fireworks from the Craftsman Club we were offered VIP seating for one of several events. We chose world of color no one over at the world of color knew what was going on having us wait for 25 minutes in one area to be sent to another then sent back then finally taken to our seating an area just off the main path behind everyone with no seats.

The location is THE BEST. Entry right into Downtown Disney District amazingly quick proximity to the gates. PRIVATE ENTRY into DCA. As soon as we arrived we felt like we were at a 5star hotel. The staff cast were amazing clearly defining hospitality. Most details provided before we could ask and additional questions were spelled out clearly. We had ordered a stroller from one of the local rental companies and it was standing by for us. Valet service for our car paid each day was usually very quick. The rooms were being remodeled when we came. No rooms available with the bunkbeds for our boys and they were being phased out. We did not need a view but there was enough space on the balcony to sit and have some fresh air or set out damp clothes. We had two queen size beds that filled up the room. The beds were so high up my 3 year old could not get on it by himself and the 5 year old had to jump from the couch. Fortunately we had the couch and my 3 y o slept there. There was minimal closet space but the space under these high beds accommodated them. Surprisingly we had no luggage rack the escort to the rooms promised to send one but it never came. We DID have a fridge with a half hearted freezer plus a Keurig coffee tea maker. The spa products were WONDERFUL. The bathroom was very spa like but very tight in the actual space. The pools were great lots of safety points plus towels sunscreen. Surprised to see plates of food not taken away sooner. The staff were beyond AMAZING when 3 y o had an accident. My only real complaint. our rooms fire alarm went off right in the middle of the the afternoon when we were taking a break from the parks it stopped on its own after a few minutes but my cranky kids were up by now. Only our room. We called once when it happened no visit again when we left for the park and when we returned that evening I stopped at the front desk where I was left waiting for 15 min to discuss with mgmt. I had to make a scene at the front desk to force maintenance to visit so we would not be suffering a middle of the night alarm. WHY. This is NOT a family friendly hotel. The beds were my first tip off but the private balcony for World of Color got us no benefits for having kids who could sit on the floor. But the proximity to Dtwn Disney private DCA entrance PLUS the Magic Morning option might make it worth it for you. While I would consider another area hotel my husband clearly prefers the Grand CalifornianIf you have a car go to an area store to save on some meals or Yelp. the local restaurants.

The park access while staying at the resort is worth the cost alone much less the service and amenities. Only complaint was waiting for dinner at Storytellers Cafe. It was so crowded and unorganized.

If they could find a way to better accommodate those waiting for a table this restaurant would be so much more enjoyable as the food was really quite good.

I was hesitant about booking here after reading many negative reviews however I really liked this hotel. The lobby was beautiful and the room was spacious. Other than eating breakfast in White Water Snacks and having a few drinks in the lounge we did not use any of the other amenities. But I feel like the price of the room was justified as the location can not be beat. No time was wasted riding buses or the monorail to get to the parks. It was a quick 5 min walk through Downtown Disney to Disneyland and access to California Adventure was super convenient and quick as hotel guests have direct access to it.
