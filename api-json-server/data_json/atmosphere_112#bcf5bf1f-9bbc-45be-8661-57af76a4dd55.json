This hotel is located in the best part of downtown San Francisco. There are several ways to get to this location. You can take the BART train from either SFO or Oakland Airports.

If you do they allow in out privileges. I had park the car and take public Muni or Lyft to where ever you are going so you do not have to pay parking again at the destination. This Hotel is massive with a very cool vibe. The Lobby is where it is all happening. you are checking in with the very friendly staff then you head to the bellmen to help with your luggage ask concierge any question these people can answer just about any question and find you anything you need or want. Stop by the Bin 55 for a fabulous Buffet Breakfast 29 or have lunch or dinner there too. The Lobby also has a Pantry that sells Pets Coffee and many other goodies including Beer Wine and Bubbles.

I spent four nights at the Mariot Marquis last week for a conference. It was the worst business hotel experience of my life. As others have mentioned we had the one two punch of construction and a strike. That meant that many of the amenities that the hotel should have had to offer and for which we paid with even the negotiated room rate nearing 400 a night after taxes and fees were not there. Access into and out of the hotel was a pain restaurants were not open there was no room service and the hotel bar which had gorgeous view had limited selections and closed ridiculously early. We were not warned in advance. To the contrary we were told we had to pre pay for one nights stay nearly three weeks before the conference. The strikers were noisy and during breaks in the afternoon when I was trying to work from my room the bang drumming and chanting made it difficult to do so. Most hotels in situations like this would have a note from the manager and a set of earplugs waiting in the room. But there was barely even any acknowledgement. The earliest anyone came to clean my room was 130 pm I was getting ready for a work call so asked housekeeping to come back in an hour. They never showed up. I finally had to call just to get my room cleaned. And then the next night I had to call again. My conference had a dinner on Saturday night. Even by hotel food standards it was terrible. The only bright spot was the gentleman pouring wine for everyone. He was friendly and attentive and after what we had all experienced I am sure everyone could use a drink. The long and short of is that we paid full price for a hotel that did not deliver the services and amenities for which it was paid. It certainly can afford to take care of its workers. And to add insult to injury it is my understanding that given the group rate our stay did not qualify for Mariot points. Rumor had it that they were giving us I am Silver Elite points to make up for all the chaos and inadequate service but those points sure have not shown up in my account less.

I stayed at the Mariot Marquis for four nights during the recent RSA conference. Checked in and as a \u201c gold elite \u201d member am supposed to get a room upgrade. No dice. The room I received was small old dingy and the bathroom tiles were covered in mold. Want to work in your room. Sorry this hotel has no room service you have to go down to a bar which has been converted into a temporary \u201c restaurant \u201d. For breakfast in this restaurant the only option is a buffet at 34 plus tax so 40 for toast pastries watery scrambled eggs etc. Gee why not eat all your meals here. I am sure a 30 pre made sandwich will be delicious. The walls were so thin that I could hear the people next door speaking at all times which was especially nice when they rolled in at 1 am and stayed up drunkenly talking til 3I was offered the \u201c green \u201d service which turns out to mean literally that housekeeping only comes to your room every three days. No bed making no tidying up nothing at all. I guess it \u2019s the cynical next step in \u201c help save the environment by reusing your towel \u201d by doing absolutely nothing but charging full price. When my last day came I asked for the 2 pm checkout that is part of \u201c gold elite \u201d and was given that. Unfortunately the system automatically expired my keys at 11 am so I was stuck waiting on the 23rd floor for security to bring me a new key. When I pointed out that it was a long waste of time his response was to shrug and say \u201c hey modern technology \u2019. Which might have meant something if the keys had been demagnetized and not explicitly turned off. Hey why did n\u2019t you let anyone know. I did. It turns out that every day to log onto wifi you have to complete a survey that asks if they are exceeding your expectations. Each day I gave the lowest rating and gave reasons why. At no point did anyone respond. When I checked out the desk rep did n\u2019t even ask how my stay was.
