I talked with front desk they sent someone up to fix the sink and a house keeper that does not really look like she thinks the room is dirty at all to try to fix things. After two hours of back and forth with the hotel staffs almost midnight they finally agreed to change me to another room tomorrow morning due to the FULL CAPACITY. I am shocked to see a big and good rating hotel like this has completely nothing they can do for me and a couple of people I talked with does not feel like they wanted to help.

Update. I have not modified any of my original comments below but in fairness I must update my review to inform that the Cosmopolitan did reach out to me regarding my comments. I was satisfied that my review and concerns did not go unnoticed andor without concern. This is a terrific hotel otherwise. I was encouraged that they took an interest to understand and explain their position. For that I believe updating my review and rating was warranted. For the record I was not offered nor did r expect any restitution for my comments nor was I asked to update or retract anything said below. OK full disclosure. The rooms and the views as well as the service while at the hotel were terrific. BUT what separated this from being excellent is the issue I had in booking an extra night. Long story short I booked the hotel for a night later than I was arriving. I booked a 5 night stay but needed 6. The extra night that I needed We d was double the 350 I was paying for the most expensive rate for the other nights. I emailed and called to ask for consideration for the pricing for the extra night given I was booked already for 5 nights and a return customer. In the end I was given an insignificant discount after a third and final request. Needless to say I booked a different hotel for the first night as I stated to the hotel I would. I would have changed the full reservation if we were not meeting 2 other couples who were also staying at the hotel at my recommendation also stated to the reservation contact. There are way too many choices for great lodging to not be more considerate of their clients. They have lost my future business. PS The night I needed a hotel we arrived in the evening and had to be up. 6AM for a Death Valley tour again the rational for not paying 70. So at 5AM we taxied to the Cosmopolitan to leave our bags. They advised that they had a room available and we could check in immediately for 50. So in the end they had availability and a room that went unused for a client already booked can ask why.

We were craving a little romantic weekend getaway decided to book the Cosmo for 3 nights. After visiting Vegas 100 times we normally stay north of the strip at Palazo or Wyn we selected the Cosmo for its trendier scene its walkability to the main portion of the strip. While most hotels in Vegas cater to an older crowd the Cosmo perfectly captures that sexy romantic Vegas vibe with its stunning interior design beautifully appointed rooms and its amazing bars restaurants with in the hotel. Rooms. We booked a Terrace Studio Fountain View room which had recently been renovated. We found the room to be very spacious we loved having private balcony attached to the room not many other Vegas hotels offer balconies so this was a huge plus. When we checked in we requested to be on a higher floor but the hotel was super busy and they were at full capacity. They gave us a room on the 18th floor but for this hotel this considered one of the lower floors. Although we got our fountain view most of view was of the not so pretty roof of the neighboring hotel. Once you get to the higher up floors you have stunning views of the fountain. It would be nice if on their website they had the option of booking a higher floor room. Overall we loved the room and we thought they did a beautiful job with the renovations. They felt very chic luxurious. One thing that we noticed is the room does not have a coffee maker so if you enjoy having coffee on the balcony like us you will have to go to the lobby grab your coffee from Starbucks. Service. Because all the hotels on the Strip are so massive no hotel really offers boutique service because there are always random people walking in out of the hotel and thousands of guests checking in out each day. Of all the hotels on the strip the Cosmo definitely tries succeeds to create the boutique hotel feel in terms of service. After we checked in with the friendly staff the virtual concierge texts your phone where you can request for recommendations reservations etc. Before we arrived at the hotel I emailed the concierge Jese to have rose petals arranged on the bed and a trail of roses walk in to the room after we returned from dinner Saturday night. Again for such a large hotel I was extremely pleased with how personal Jese was. how detail oriented Jese was to make this surprise perfect. With an amazing concierge like Jese it really gives this hotel a true 5star boutique hotel feel. Food Drinks. Our favorite part of the hotel is their incredible cocktail selection they offer at the signature Chandelier bar. Despite how crowded the bar is the bartenders never rush in making their drinks. We kept ordering an amazing Old Fashioned with a Chai Tea Ice ball in the middle where Chai would melt out as the ice melted. We loved how fun innovative they were with their drinks. Our other favorite part of the hotel was that it had an Egslut in it. This is the perfect place to grab a quick breakfast sandwich or a midnight snack. Location Because the Cosmo is located right in the middle of the strip not too far north or too far south. it really is the PERFECT location. We were able to walk almost everywhere without having to use a taxi the whole tripAfter staying at almost every hotel on the Strip I really appreciate how the Cosmo creates that new age luxury feel perfect for romantic getaways. With its unparalleled location chic feel of the hotel this will continue to be one of our favorite hotels on the Strip.", "offset": [542, 622], "date": "2019-06-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "587eefe7-dd6c-415a-8e67-84949905ff38", "sentence": "Amazing hotel with fabulous views.
