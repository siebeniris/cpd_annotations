We had a mini getaway for the weekend came from Miami. Upon arrival the staff at the lobby were nice and accommodating. We arrived a few hours prior to the check in time of 3 pm. I completed all of the check in so when the room was ready my keys would be waiting for us. The resort is beautiful. The landscape is truly amazing full of different types of tropical plants and trees. The resort has 4 pools including one that is for adults only in a quiet zone. All of the pools and the areas are clean and offer shaded areas. The resort gives a relaxing and Zen like ambiance. This resort is not far from Duval Street and other areas. It has a shopping center across the street with a market and even a Ross. The room was spotless and had a Key West tropical feel to it. The only observation I have is the parking. I was able to secure a parking spot throughout the day we went out in the evening upon our return at 130pm there was no parking within the resort. We had to park in the adjacent parking lot between Walgrens and Home Depot. This would have been okay except there was no lighting in one area it was completely dark. We had to be looking around while we were walking towards the resort in almost complete darkness this made us feel slightly unsafe.

So honestly Parrot Key should would normally deserve a far better rating than the Poor I have given it but I can only rate against our actual experience. PK is a beautiful resort located 10 mins away from the madness of Duval St it should be a calm oasis offering a perfect stay in Key West however our stay was spoilt by poor communication which has to be down to poor management. When booking I was fully aware that PK was coming to the end of an extensive refurbishment but as an experienced traveller I know that this can mean unfinished works and therefore disturbance to guests. I enquired about the ongoing work and asked to be advised how these works might inconvenience guests and in November prior to a January stay received an email confirming that all works were due to be finished ahead of our booking date. I was lucky enough to be in the area on business in December and so decided to actually visit the site to check progress for myself and saw that most works had been completed with the exception of the ongoing finishing touches to the Bar Restaurant area near the main reception. However I was assured by Staff at the reception check in that all works were due to be finished with two weeks but they were saying by Jan 1st to be sure they were advising guests correctly. This appeared to be totally reasonable and I accepted their statement HOWEVER when we arrived 2 weeks after this deadline the works appeared to have not progressed any further and this totally changed our experience and ruined of stay at what should have been an amazing hotel. Now some may ask how work in one area might ruin our stay well let me explain. There should be Four relaxation pool areas at PK with these works going on the pool adjacent to the Bar area was closed. This is the main pool area and the one that is open to the most sun as the others are surrounded by high Palm trees. The pool next to this was open but not really useable as a relaxation area as the noise disturbance from cutting and grinding was extensive. The third pool was now being used as a Pop Up Bar Dining area but for some reason was now totally covered by temporary tenting which meant there were no loungers and actually no sun either. That meant that the fourth pool the Adult Serenity one was realistically the only one that guests could use in the intended way. Although because of the works in other areas this meant that most guests including some children choose to use this pool which takes away from the serenity intention. I pointed out my disappointment to the Hotel Management and whilst they were sympathetic to my concerns did not really approach them with what I would call a professional atitutude. They had my contact details for 3 months and were aware that I had expressed concern about the works they could have easily contacted me to to advise that things were taking longer they blamed a \u201c breakdown in communication \u201d for this I blame poor management. The \u201c breakdown of communication \u201d line seems to be the \u201c go too \u201d statement when things fail here as it was offered again when i reported glass shards on our balcony which was n\u2019t dealt with for 2 days. It really should not be down to any guest to have to constant meetings with management to ensure that a stay can be even near what was expected and booked. The Management are clearly aware that they are letting guests down and have taken certain steps to try to accommodate some issues but not really enough in my view. Upon checkin you get given a voucher that entitles each guest to a welcome drink at the pool well that is fine but single drink hardly compensates for the inconvenience they also offer a \u201c Complimentary Continental Buffet Breakfast \u201d each day which is hosted in the hotel lobby little thought has gone into this as there is limited seating no Coffee Service and the food is served on cheap paper plates with Plastic Knives and Forks. So it being complimentary has no benefit if guests consider they had booked a quality hotel and not a camping site why pay premium rates for motel standards. I personally walked across the road to Deny \u2019s to at least get a hot breakfast real cutlery and service. Now unlike other guests that simply sat around complaining to each other I decided that I expected better value for my payment. So Yes after speaking to Management I was given a so called Room Upgrade which was actually an identical room but with a better view and clearly the newly finished room fresh paint smell. was still awaiting the finishing touches like missing artwork that is shown on website images. After several intense meetings I was able to negotiate a higher reduced room rate and the 30 a day \u201c resort fee \u201d was also not charged but I felt as though I had to fight for this where in my view it should have been offered as the facilities I had booked were not available to me. I fail to understand the concept of a resort fee anyway surely hotel rates should be based on the standard and facilities of the hotel so if booking a premium quality hotel should there be an extra fee for actually daring to use the swimming pool or a sun lounger hotels should state the cost of a nightly stay that includes the use of all the facilities listed on there website or that of other hotel booking websites all these additional fees just alienate guests. Guests also need to be aware of the Valet Parking Only situation at PK they obviously trust us to drive the 150 miles from Miami to KW safely but not to drive your own car in their parking area even with a 15 a day Valet charge they still seem to expect a tip for driving your car 20 meters and adjusting your seat position away from where you left it. All of my disappointments could have so easily been avoided had I been informed that the works had not been completed within the time scale given then I would have been able to either cancel my booking or decide to accept the situation. I gave the hotel every opportunity to contact me and advise me of incomplete works which were blamed on a permit delay for a Pizza Oven. I really did not accept this as the works were clearly way behind schedule as Carpentry and Tiling was still being completed in many areas. I wanted to stay at Parrot Key as I had previously visited the site and seen it as The perfect KW hotel. So for those of you that have actually got to the end of this lengthy review. I really think you should consider and book PK it has the potential of being an amazing hotel with great facilities I just hope that your booking is after the completion of works and that all facilities are available to you and the smell of fresh paint has faded from the romsTo the Management I say this you have a beautiful venue and some friendly staff that are an asset to you. I consider that more attention to detail is required and as a team need to stop hiding behind feeble excuses and improve communications between staff and yourselves as well as with guests. I am sorry to have to give a less than positive review but this was my experience however I do hope to stay with you again when all works are completed.", "offset": [2376, 2542], "date": "2019-01-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "06f5bfc8-c15a-4c6d-885c-c4b3d34409e3", "sentence": "Freshly renovated and very clean.

That \u2019s about where the good ends. Almost every day room service would come at 4 or 5 right when we were cleaning up for dinner so we would ask for them to refresh our rooms with turn down instead. This rarely happened. I \u2019m fine with reusing towels but some in the party wanted new towels daily and would have to call to receive them.
