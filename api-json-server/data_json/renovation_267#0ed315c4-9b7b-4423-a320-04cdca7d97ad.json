We were happy to be together relaxing but greatly disappointed in the resort. My husband and I have visited some lovely properties all over the world and with the build up from descriptions reviews photos etc. we were just expecting a lot lot more. Bottom line Chateau Elan is a typical upscale conference center hotel. There is not much charm about it. The room we stayed in was extremely average. The bed was the nicest part about it. The rest nothing special at all. I have seen nicer mini fridge arrangements in newer Hampton Inns. The shower head had almost no water pressure and the windows in our room were needing some maintenance regarding some rot at the bases. I wish I could say good things about the winery or the restaurants but it was all just very very average. The winery tour and tasting is overpriced. 15 min of tour in one room and then tasting for 20. We were going to use the spa but everything else was so average we figured spending 450 yes 450 for a couples massage was not worth it. Lastly as a NON WEDDING attendee it is a bit odd how many weddings they have going on one Saturday. We counted 4 that we could see. it is a strange feeling. Well now we know. We will not be rushing back.", "offset": [649, 784], "date": "2015-09-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f9c42ea8-116d-4014-ae3a-25c60518a7ef", "sentence": "Even though the winery was closed for renovations it was still nice to tour the Vineyard and take a look around.", "offset": [0, 112], "date": "2016-07-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "0298a510-763e-4f86-a499-c5bef8a103e1", "sentence": "The first issue was during the reservation. I had to call to change it from a Sunday Million Miles from Monday to Saturday Elan Escape. The lady I spoke with was helpful but slow like she hated her job slow. She said she would send an updated email later. When I got it I realized she did not change the day just the package. When I called back the next day a different person was there. He said oh let me see what the rates are. I explained I knew the rates because they were discussed the day before and she gave me the rate and suggested the package. Well It was all wrong. Apparently she still gave me the rates for a Sunday. It was about 89 more and there was no apology or attempt to adjust it. I was at this point hesitant about even going. We arrived and check in was quick. The valet was excellent and helpful. The room was nice except for the spotted mirror. The sheets were very crisp and a strange texture. The service outside the poor was the next issue. It was around 515pm so the crowd had died down and we waited and waited for wings and 2 drinks. My husband finally went to the bar and the waitress apologized she forgot to put it in. wait what. It was not super busy. We were disappointed. That was a dreadful 66 dollars and poor service. Dinner was a better experience. With the escape package you go to the buffet. It was nice and finally we had excellent service. The buffet was nice and well kept. Most of the items were covered. The night experience was great as well. We went to the lounge and enjoyed the Jazz and DJ party. There was a wedding group there and they were fun and included us in their celebration. We decided to order breakfast instead of the buffet. It was just OK. The delivery person uncovered the food and it cause it to chill fast. It was just plain. There is no microwave in the room so no reheat option. I guess we should have got on up and went back to the buffet. The winery trip the next day and it was super cool. do not expect the staff to tell you about the wine unles you ask questions. We enjoyed the tasting. We did the 25 flights. We ended with lunch at Paddys and Service there was amazing. She was caring friendly made great suggestions and just top notch. Overall our Elan Escape was just ok. Maybe I will try again and add the spa services. I guess after all these years of driving by it I expected more for the value. We cruise a ton and I guess I am spoiled by amenities.", "offset": [208, 255], "date": "2017-08-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "29ba523f-a29f-4642-b06e-122e61ad4cc7", "sentence": "Property needs renovation.

My husband and I are here now for a short getaway. We were looking forward to enjoying all areas of the resort following its recent renovation. We were particularly anticipating trying out Louis House of Bourbon and taking in the beautifully redone space in the evening following dinner. Unfortunately the entire bourbon bar is closed tonight for a private event. There was no mention of this on the hotels website when we booked a week ago. To have such a gorgeous fun main space closed entirely and especially right after the renovation has been celebrated is a drawback for resort guests. While there are other bar options Louis House of Bourbon provides a different kind of atmosphere. Management should rethink this in the future.
