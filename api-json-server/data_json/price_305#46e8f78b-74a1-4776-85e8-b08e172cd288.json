We were nervous about staying in Oakland but were pleasantly surprised at how charming and safe the area was. The staff was more than friendly. The location was perfect. We enjoyed being waking distance to the ferry. This allowed us to stay close to the wedding location but also allowed us easy access to San Francisco. Our room was spacious and lovely. We requested a crib for our daughter which was there upon arrival. The large room allowed us plenty of space for the crib and for playing with our daughter without feeling cramped.

I have stayed at the Waterfront Hotel four times occupying rooms in three tier levels. city view balcony with harbor view and deluxe suite. The hotel is located in Jack London Square and a 5 minute walk from the Oakland Amtrak station. Restaurants abound nearby. it is a nautical themed hotel throughout and right on the harbor. The San Francisco ferry is on or nearly on the property. Valet parking is available. I strongly advise paying a little more to obtain a harbor view room with balcony. My room was spacious with every expected amenity plus two sinks and a wet bar. The view across the harbor to San Francisco is wonderful especially at sunset. The suites are worth every dollar and highly recommended. The only downside is that nearby train traffic can be disturbing to those occupying city view rooms. This is much less of an issue with those in the west facing rooms. Bus stops are across the street from the hotel free shuttle service on weekdays up and down Broadway and BART stations are within reasonable walking distance. Service is superb. I called the front desk to ask about a transportation issue I was asked where I wanted to go and within 5 minutes a gentleman appeared at my door with a map and BART schedule.

Nope I go to the front desk every day to pick up my blocks from their freezer what a hassle. I paid for a staff member to bring it to me twice. The shuttle did not take me to my seminar days out of four because they said it shuts down at 9 of the clock in the morning which seems crazy and quite insulting to the guest. The ice buckets are minuscule I guess they be okay if you were Lilliput about two fists full of ice the Max had to get up 2 in the morning three nights out of four to get more ice. I really felt insulted by that simple decision on the hotel management to give you minuscule ice bucket to save themselves three cents on the utility bills that one single issue irritated me because they do not really care about the guests.

The gas fireplace in the room was ridiculous covered in glass and did not really produce a ambient flame. The water view is primarily industrial. The staff was fine I really have no complaints there and there was absolutely nothing they could have really done to improve the quality of my stay. The night following my stay at the Waterfront Hotel I stayed at the Mystic Hotel which is right in the middle of San Francisco an older building than the Waterfront. but with a better renovation cleaner accommodations and superior amenities and it was only 195 night including taxes and fees keep in mind that this was on Pride weekend and just 2 blocks from the parade route. The following night last night. I stayed at the Tickle Pink Inn overlooking the Pacific in Carmel Highlands. I arrived to beautiful accommodations with a full private patio off my room with nice wood furniture a wood burning fireplace in my room as well as chocolates and a bottle of champagne. I watched the sunset from the porch while breathing in cool ocean air and hearing the sounds of seals birds and the crackle of the fireplace. This experience cost me the same exact amount as staying at the Waterfront Hotel. However it was one of the most important and fulfilling hotel experiences I will ever have. I imagine the price tag at the Waterfront is due to the joie de vivre name but quite frankly after this experience I will never stay in one of their hotels again. The value just is not there for me. The people who ARE willing to spend their money on such a mediocre hotel experience do not make sense to me. This hotel should be 200 a night. You can do better in San Francisco.

I would be lying if i said things did not start out smoothly the certainly did. I had landed early in San Francisco around 115 in the morning and having to be somewhere for work I called the hotel to see if I could potentially check in Early. To my surprise a room was available for me I get to the hotel and check in for what was supposed to be a 12 day stay. Now I had called two or three weeks in advance and had spoken with someone from the hotel to book the reservation AND confirm what exactly the penalties for an early departure might be. I was informed that the penalty for an early checkout was One 1 additional nights stay. After the booking I called back again now 2 days away from my reservation and still before the breaking the hotels 48 hour window cancellation policy just to confirm that the reservation was still there and that the penalty was only One additional nights stay. I informed the hotel at that time that I was not sure if it was more beneficial for me to make one long reservation or if making a few short ones would be more better for me because I knew that I could potentially be checking out early. With my line of work I know very well that I may be called at any moment to leave the country. I am a Merchant Mariner that works for the United States Government regularly tasked with making sure that our Troops domestic and abroad have their equipment delivered on time and at the right destination. I was advised by hotel staff to keep the reservation for the long trip and that only a one nights stay would be my penalty for checking out early. Well on the following Monday Day 5 of my stay I was called to report to a ship that was overseas and that I would be leaving Monday night Tuesday Morning. I went to the front desk Checked out and was handed a printed receipt balance paid in full and was on my way. See Photos. A Day later After a little back and fourth Via text messaging I was informed that I would be charged for the entire length of my stay due to the Special Rate I had received. I responded that this did not seem accurate and they did not have the AUTHORIZATION to charge my card I did n\u2019t hear back from the hotel at all about this they simply decided that it was unimportant to answer my response \u2026 mind you this was ALL via text messaging \u2026 very professional. To my surprise two days later after LOCKING my card down there is a pending charge for significant dollar amount more. I called the credit card company to dispute the charge. After speaking with the claims department the person asked if I would be willing to do a conference call with the hotel to see if we could possibly orchestrate a refund I agreed was put on hold and when the claims rep came back on the line after having tried to call the hotel She explained to me that she was bounced around and put on hold numerous times and when finally linked to someone in the accounting department they picked up and hung the phone up on her. We processed the dispute right then and there. To this day I have continuously been bombarded with text messages and emails from this establishment bordering on harassment after I have tried to opt out of these messaging services. I hope that although this write up was long it sheds some light on the way that the Waterfront hotel conducts its business. They believe in handling things via text message and when confronted feel it is ok to hang up on people. This indicates to me that it is n\u2019t the first time they have done this. Maybe this is how they feel members of our military and those that help them should be treated. None the less it was all childish and could have been avoided ultimately changing my whole perspective on the place.
