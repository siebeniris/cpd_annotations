We were there for Flip to attend a conference which allowed me to relax and wander. The property is set alongside a large lake which has plenty of activities like sailing kayaking swimming and for the kids an on water trampoline and obstacle course. The beach alongside the lake was lovely and deck chairs to sit on. You are able to hire bikes to ride around on. The only issue I had was I was not able to explore Marochydore easily as it was 35 cab fare each way. However there was a short walk to a pristine beach and it was about a 5 6 km walk to the town along the beach. Rooms. The room we had was lovely with a shower in a bath. The beds were comfortable although they messed up and gave us twin beds rather than a queen. Tea and coffee is provided and the room has aircond with a lovely sliding door out to a small balcony. The TV had a few extra channels but not the full digital compliment. Restaurants. As it will cost you to travel to the restaurants in town eating on site is preferred. There are three areas to eat along with a takeaway option. You can eat during the day up til 3 pm in a deli cafe style. There is a bar which caters for pub style meals and snacks with outside table options and also a buffet main restaurant which has themed dinners such as seafood Italian and carvery. it is expensive but being a buffet you can eat your fill. This restaurant is also the area for your buffet breakfast which is extensive and lovely way to start the day. Overall we had a lovely time but depending on your room location if they have a function you may be kept awake with music and bass beat.", "offset": [1005, 1090], "date": "2015-08-12 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "ce50f55c-78e2-4118-ace3-86ce5887194c", "sentence": "I was disappointed that you offered complimentary water to myself only not my husband who is also an Acor member. The restaurant has a large sign for free barista made coffee but not when you dine at the most expensive buffet why is that. Two nights of our stay was exactly the same buffet food why do you not offer al a carte that way you can eat as little or much as you want to pay for the average person can not possibly eat 75 food in one meal and the buffet is nothing sensational. The coffee at the Resort is not great although we did not try the small cafe we feel your coffee and food let you down there is no mid range or variety on offer and if you just feel like toast and coffee for breakfast you have to drive out to get it which we did but it takes away from the idea of relaxing at the Resort for the weekend you are to tied to expensive buffets. The location is awesome and the rooms while a little outdated and tired looking are fine except for the couch in the room we had which is completely lacking in support and not useable. I would encourage you to think about your guests and a workable a la carte menu for your weekend guests so they stay at the resort and relax not head out for decent food at decent prices and smaller quantities. oh and get a Barista no one drinks bad coffee we spent most of our time and food money on Marochydore over the weekend as we did not want to pay for food we were never going to be able to eat.

We have been to Twin Waters many times. It was the place where we became Acor Vacation club members over 10 years ago. We have seen this place grow with accommodation but not with facilities. We visited the Novotel during the school holidays which is a busy time but this time it was so crowded that trying to have a spa was out of the question. There must have been 20 kids constantly in the spa. They have added extra accommodation but they have not added any extra facilities. They have introduced a floating obstacle course but of course you have to pay 15 for 30 minutes. This has taken up a lot of space on the lake and reduces the area to do sailing or kayaking. As for the food this frustrated us. We are Acor plus members and should get 50 discount on food. This was not the case here. We were offered 15 discount on our meals from the cafe bar area. It is the only place we have seen this which is ridiculous. Acor should be more consistent with their discounts. We ate at the main restaurant for dinner and for the price you pay it was really disappointing. The food was cold and tasted very average. For a Novotel restaurant it seemed more like a cheap buffet. The service was poor as we had to stack our plates on the next table because no one would come to clear our plates. Our room was nice and close to the main area. It was cleaned efficiently but the internet was not the best. Reception kept dropping out. After coming from the Sunshine Coast and staying at Turtle beach resort we reflected and thought that we should not have travelled the extra 20kms.

Could n\u2019t swim in the pool as it was yellow from all the kids urine. food was overpriced and tasteless and our room average. Also other reviews about free water sports is baloney as the hotel charges extra for this. Furthermore we were offered a deal of 99 for two nights through the Acor vacation club. It took us 45 minutes to check in as we had been booked under someone else \u2019s name yet same surname. Being my baby moon I made a booking at the expensive day spa for a pregnancy massage however I woke up very sick and was unable to attend we called the spa with no answer by the time they called me back I was at the dr. My husband then sent a text to the lady calling to let her know. On New Years Day they charged us the total amount of 260 for not showing up. When questioned the hotel had no confirmation of our stay due to booking us under the wrong name and do not even care that I was sick and unable to attend. 260 is a lot of money for a massage I would have loved to receive and sadly was too sick to have on the day. My husband and I travel a lot for work to this area and can honestly say we would never return. We took the offer as it was a holiday we could afford it \u2019s just sad to take people \u2019s hard earned money for a service they did n\u2019t receive. I wish I stayed home and spent the 260 on my baby instead.", "offset": [158, 248], "date": "2019-12-31 00:00:00", "cpt": "4", "category": "price"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "feea939e-336f-4b53-bc26-67810ffbaa9a", "sentence": "Always a great place to stay. As usual we enjoyed our stay 2 nights just was not long enough. I see there are some improvements happening. I was disapointed the little shop sold a variety of clothing bags bits and pieces was gone but nevertheless we survived and saved money. The new restaurant we liked the layout but did not think much of the menu. We would get bored after a couple of nights eating there. Fortunately the deli was still there and that helped us on the second night.

The food was plentiful and many choices however much of the hot food was pretty standard in quality. The fruit was fresh and enjoyable. The Pizzas from the bar and amazing no need for improvement there but for price point. We were recommended to stay here by a family friend who has had a number of great experiences here. Sadly she was disappointed to hear of the underwhelming parts of our stay. Firstly she booked us a room as she knows the place well she requested a spa bath to which in email received a response not a long wait which was nice to see advising this will be accommodated with no issue and no additional cost. SHe packed us an amazing BQ picnic basket as she had talked so highly of the BQs set in the gardens of the rooms for a quiet night together. SO here we were ready for a nice bath after a fresh prawn and steak dinner. Well we arrive at the resort. Took 20mins to find the room as the receptionist has explained the wrong direction walk in the room to no bath search for a BQ for dinner to be told the management took the BQs out at the beginning of the month.
