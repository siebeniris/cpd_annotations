We got a great rate through hotelscom and were given a beautiful corner room with great light and a view of the East River. My only complaint is that they should be giving a free wifi password to every guest. They said something about signing up for it and agreeing to terms and then they would reverse the charge.

I am a returning guest at this Hotel and come back a few times a year. I always enjoy the easy going atmosphere it is not a fancy place but I feel at home and most of all I enjoy the silence at night which actually allows me to get a good night slepRom was spacious this time it is not always so and the bed extremely comfy. I had asked for a room at the back of the building as usual since those are the quite ones for the first night they gave me an extremely noisy one on a low floor and on the street so I could not close an eye during the whole night. They changed my room the next day however and for 3 nights I had the quitest room ever. Prices are increasing everytime with all the extras you have to pay not just taxes but also minibar and wifi which are not free but you are basically forced to pay use them and what was a great value for money it is no longer really so. And the rooms doors hairdryers bathrooms would need some improvement. The staff at the reception on check in and check out for the first time in years was not friendly at all. I had booked through Bokingcom and by mistake the hotel had charged all the amount in advance while it was not a reservation with advance payment when I asked for explanations they were not really helpful and nobody told me SORRY. We made a mistake ancd charged you the amount 1 month in advance. Here is a free drink for you or whatever.
