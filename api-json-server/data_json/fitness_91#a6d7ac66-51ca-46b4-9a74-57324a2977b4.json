The spa itself is ok an small gym saunas and a nice relaxing area which also had the showers in it for after the sauna which makes relaxing difficult. The full day spa included dinner as well. Unfortunately the dinner at the Qiu restaurant was a big disaster which is absolutely unacceptable for a spa day in the mid three digit price range when you want to wind down the day. First there was not table reserved for us and we had to wait close to ten minutes until we got one waited another ten minutes until we received the wine menu and I had to specifically ask for some bread. The mains were completely salty and when we told the waiter he just shoulder shrugged. The deserts which came after 25 minutes were not the one we ordered and when we asked we were told the other is not available. After paying for drinks I went to the reception to complain about the experience where the lady assured me that s not the service they offer wrote down my name told me they revert back and of course has not done it.
