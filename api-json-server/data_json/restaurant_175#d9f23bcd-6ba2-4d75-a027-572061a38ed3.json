This was the pet friendly hotel with the best prices in Phily. it is located in a great neighborhood close to a lot of nice restaurants and excellent shopping right down the block from the Anthropologie flagship store. The hotel itself was great. Extraordinarily clean and the decor is SO cute and a little funky. They really played up the Ben Franklin Declaration of Independence etc. theme. It got me really excited to be in Phily and I appreciated that it was not just run of the mill decor. It felt special like a boutique hotel. The room was large the bed was great a lot of comfy bedding. and everyone including the dog was happy. Parking is in a garage attached to the hotel which is very easy.

Check in was swiftly done. Room given was facing the Two Liberty Place building and The Liberty Place mall. Room furniture was a little old and dated. Free wifi available in the room and hotel lobby. The thing I like most about Westin is its bed and pillows very firm and comfortable to ensure guest well rested. Different types of pillow provided to suit our need. There is a gym in the hotel but the down side is without an indoor pool. The hotel only has one restaurant caf\u00e9 that is Winthorpe Valentine Bar. A little disappointed with limited restaurant in the hotel especially there is no buffet breakfast available. For breakfast you need to wait about 30 minutes upon placing your order.

My experience here started about 2 weeks before even arriving. The concierge reached out to me with hotel info and also offered some suggestions of places to go restaurants etc. Even if we did not need any info it was still appreciated to have them reach out. We did take him up on some suggestions though and the restaurant we went to was perfect it was clearly a legitimate suggestion and not motivated by any sort of compensation so I would highly suggest asking them. We also notified the concierge that we would be arriving rather early 9 am from a morning flight. They said we could drop our bags at the concierge desk and check in later around noon. While this was perfectly fine with me when we arrived at 9 they already had a room ready for us and also gave us some extra breakfast vouchers for that morning as well platinum benefitThe room was very nice it was spacious and well kept. My only complaint was that the bathroom shower seemed a little worn. There were a lot of stains looked like rust in the shower tub and the shower head sprayed a weird way. But this did not detract from the overall stay. We had breakfast both days at the restaurant and it was perfect. They have a wide variety of meals available from healthy fare to bacon and waffles so there is something for everyone. We also visited the gym. It was not as large as other westin gyms I have been too. It was better appointed than a gym at other hotels but not quite what I would expect at a westin. I still enjoyed it though and they had what I needed. Overall I was very pleased with the stay. While there may have been a few minor issues these did not detract at all from the experience. And any issues were easily made up by the great service and friendly staff.

The staff the served us were rude and impatient so not even service with a smile for the 84. I signed the check and left it for the bar lady who then marched back over to me and slapped another bit of paper down in front of me and said you have to sign this clearly I had signed the wrong bit was still getting my head around which bit to sign as we do not do this in the UK very rudely. I did do and apologised where it was snatched from my hand. The drinks were ok no nicer for being that expensive just your standard gin and tonics. On return to the UK I then realised my credit card had been charged 100.

Upon check out no staff asked about my stay offered to show me my bill and the valet was so rude. THE HOTEL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION and unlike most Mariot hotels this is not indicated on the reservation information. This Westin is not worthy of a 4 star rating regardless of the construction that \u2019s ongoing for the following reasons the requests I made for \u201c additional items \u201d via the Mariot ap were not completed by the hotel staff. I phoned upon arrival to make the requests again and when the staff arrived they forget 13rd of my requests the room was not supplied with normal supplies including but not limited to slippers cotton swab cotton ball nail file kit enough toiletries and towels for 2 people which is what my reservation was for. the previous guest left personal items in the minibar milk and it had gone off. there was heavy construction above us before 10 am each weekend day.
