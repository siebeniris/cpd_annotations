I write this review keeping in mind that the Conrad is a well known 5star hotel chain and thus expectations follow suit. But to sum it up Excellent hotel resort in the Nusa Dua area with an average beach and slightly overcrowded pool at times. I will go through my own experience in each of the review areas1. Check in out experience I arrived earlier than expected at 240pm although check in is officially at 3 pm. Overall the formalities were smooth although we were asked to wait for about 10 minutes but then our room was ready. Bags came up with us and we were promptly served welcome fruits. Check out was also very smooth we were even allowed a late check out because they were not overboked on that day which was great of them. 2. Room. The room was generally up to Conrad standards everything felt new and comfortable except maybe the door knob which nearly fell off. All the basics were there from good slippers selection of toiletries different aromas available LCD TV cups boiler toilet bidet etc. The aircon self shuts down whenever the balcony doors become open something slightly annoying but understandable although I wish they had some averaging time eg. 10sec open then cut off. Balconies are spacious and either opens up to the pool area or ocean front. Beautiful bathroom is split into 3 sub rooms toilet shower and bath areas. I did have slight problems with the not so optimal shower both a weird shower head no rain shower and inconsistent water temperature cold then very hot then hot etc 3. Hotel grounds While the hotel has a reasonably large ground half of it is technically reserved off also for the Conrad Suites program so the remaining half is to the rest of us. The beach in front of the resort is actually please note a public area. There will be peddlers trying to sell you jet ski packages banana boats rides massages etc. There will be people roaming up and down the beach front and you can walk out to the side where there are some local stalls selling food and drink a plus. While we did not have any problem with our valuables it does seem like a security risk of sorts if you are sunbathing by the beach. Secondly the beach in that area is a lagoon meaning there are no waves only during high tide. During low to medium tide the waves hit the first barrier 200 m out at sea so you have very calm waters in fact the water is waist deep nearly out that far. Third the sea in that area is full of seaweed and while I see the hotel is putting in much effort having people bury it and clean the sand it is a losing battle so lots of dirty sand in that area unfortunately just how the Benoa area is during this time of year at least. Fourth the sea in front is also full of speed boats jet skis parasailing just mainly vendors demonstrating marketing their products the hotel cordons off a small section for swimming. Large ships seem to tend to frequent there as well we had 3 military ships moored out at sea and a cruiseliner docked nearby for a day or two 4. Pool service. All the bale or gazebos in the photos will cost some 300 K IDR per day to use although you can just use them during off hours if nobody booked them anyway. Sunchairs that are either facing the beach or pool however are free. It seems that their pool service only officially starts at 11 am or so. Before that you can get towels and do your own thing at the sunchairs however there will not be any free water bottles or fruit skewers on offer. Had a mixed experience with this on one of the days it was so crowded we nearly were not able to find a spot however this was not the case the following day I suspect a Chinese group tour. We ordered lunch and getting the attention of the staff was quite a challenge on that busy day. Pool side lunch will set you back some 15 USD per dish but we really appreciated the generous portions and surprisingly delicious pizza and burger they serve this on a foldable table beside your sunchair. They have life size pool chess and a ping pong table too although was disappointed it disappeared one of the days for maintenance. Staff were friendly and profesional5. Breakfast. Breakfast service suffers from the usual large hotel syndrome meaning crowded everything and everybody trying to order their eggs with that one two guys. Having said that generally everything went smooth in the end. We were shown to our seats quite promptly and they never forgot to serve us our coffee tea or even iced cappuccino. Selection was very wide and quality was decent. 6. Location. One thing you may want to know about Conrad when comparing it to similar chains nearby such as Sofitel Hyat and co is that Conrad is on a public road area which is Tanjung Benoa which means that as soon as you exit the hotel there are mini marts just across the street metered taxis roaming the streets which can take you for 1 USD to any of the nearby choices of restaurants or cheap spas compared to the 100 spas in the hotel. Do make reservations for any of the 3 restaurants they have in advance. In particular the Italian restaurant by the beach which is very popular and had to decline us due to a full booking. Their fitness room is top notch it has nearly every machine you could want and did not seem crowded. They even have a stretch dance yoga area if you also do that. We found ads for bicycling tours they do as well but we did not opt for that due to time. The hotel has an interesting lounge called Reflections which is for guests who have checked out and need to wait around for their departing flight. It has a pool table internet hot showers at a price etc. The Conrad does not offer free WiFi service so you will have to pay some 8 dollars a day for it which is still the case it seems among many of the international chains but not all. Honestly seems ridiculous way of making money but it did not bother me too much since I just got an unlimited 1 month internet sim card for just 5 from the area. To conclude my thoughts this hotel is definitely a good choice in the Tanjung Benoa area and given certain conditions will still be my hotel of choice if I come go back to the area. What it lacks in natural beauty of the beach it makes up in the standard of its staff hotel infrastructure and smooth way it runs itself.", "offset": [1250, 1325], "date": "2015-05-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "dae3a1a2-babd-4f35-a460-c743f6244441", "sentence": "Stunning Hotel However. We stayed at this beautiful hotel for 4 nights at the end of May 2015. We were invited to a family wedding and were upgraded to a garden suite. The suite was very large more in keeping with the size of a one bedroom apartment with separate kitchenette dining lounge bedroom walk in robe and bathroom plus lanai with sunbed. Furnishings were your expected islander designer look and it was immaculately clean. The Hilton Suites for guests has its own pool breakfast and high tea restaurant. At night the restaurant turns into Japanese dining and the food is delicious. There are numerous restaurants to choose in this resort so you do not need to leave that is if you do not want to have other experiences in Bali Menega Caf\u00e9 at Jimbaran Bay a must do get there before the sun sets. There are 2 huge pools numerous bars and the majority overlook the beach and beyond to Nusa Penida. Ensure you have a hot stone massage the girls are fantastic and the spa surroundings are beautiful. ensure you take your swimmers and go for a swim in the spas private pool great in the afternoon sun. Whilst it is warm romantic and a beautiful resort there are a few things that let it down. One is the beach there are pedlars spruiking their wares and goods for sale that is downright annoying the water and beach is littered with plastic bags plastic bottles and general rubbish so I would not recommend putting your face under water if you really have to swim in the ocean. Secondly the staff are very attentive and so sweet but the majority can not understand or speak English which is surprising for a resort of this standard. I have stayed at Ayana at Jimbaran Bay and Anantara in Seminyak and both hotels had English speaking staff. With the amount of money Hilton Hotels make you would assume they would help their staff by providing English lessons as the majority of people that frequent this Hotel would speak English. Finally there is NO free Wifi you have to keep walking up to Reception. In 2015 you expect free Wifi anywhere in any hotel. I would recommend this hotel for young families older couples family re unions and romantics. Ensure you get outside the resort and take a hotel car to Uluwatu temple and The Beach Caf\u00e9 for lunch then head over to Seminyak to hit the boutiques for a half day shopping.

We spent 5 days in late April 2015 at the Conrad Bali resort as part of a trip to Singapore and Bali. The room we received had several issues and we were not happy. Fortunately Mr Anjana assistant manager at the time of our arrival understood our concerns and helped us with a replacement which we really liked. He also made sure throughout the next five days that we enjoy our stay personally stopping by to ask if we needed anything. I must say I have never seen so nice and friendly people as on Bali. We would like to thank Mr Anjana for his hospitality and support during our stay. He is an excellent manager. My son loved the big plush monkey toy in the lobby as well as the small monkey toy in our room. We had fun in the swimming pools the breakfast was excellent. We wish there was a bit more of a choice in the restaurants \u00b4 menus for the evening meals. Mosquitoes were a problem for us having in mind it is a dengue fever region. A few years ago we stayed at Conrad Maldives and were glad they took very good care of the mosquitoes there. It was not really the case in Bali but maybe the mosquitoes on a small island are easier to control. We booked a day trip from the hotel and were extremely happy with our guide. The minivan was also brand new and very comfortable. I also booked a surf lesson once and was picked up directly from the hotel.

Summary Do not stay here. This hotel caters to special event groups from Japan China and Taiwan. The majority of the rooms are sandwiched between event spaces and the dueling audio streams will make you weep and collapse into a corner while mumbling redrum to your curling cringing index finger. Staff ignored Do Not Disturb signs EVERY SINGLE DAY. The restaurant refused to seat us due to being fully booked even though EVERY SINGLE TABLE was empty we then sat in the bar for an hour after which every single table was still empty then we were finally seated. Overall Conrad gives off a whiff of Vesuvius in Vegas which feels culturally out of place for Bali. Read on for the details. Noise. Imagine you are wearing headphones while sitting on a rocky seaweed laden beach where waveruners and power boats buzz by like so much heavy industrial farm equipment powered by giant robotic bees In your left ear you hear highly amplified live wedding band music in the style of Frank Sinatra The Greatest Love of All Save the Last Dance for Me and can not Take My Eyes Off Of You these are some of the actual songs we heard but the band played special extended versions some lasting 10 or 15 minutes. Ok that is your left ear. In your right ear also highly amplified you hear a group of 10year old girls in white dresses that look like piles of whipped cream singing Taylor Swift and Katy Perry songs just 316ths of a note below the top of the human hearing range. Six of the squeaky shrieky girls are on key three are sharp and one is quite flat unfortunately Flatie seems to have been given the bulk of the solos. Parental applause is frequent deafeningly amplified and profoundly undeserved. There are also speeches that go on for 20 minutes at a time given by the same guy who was the emcee for Sabado Gigante except he is now speaking in Japanese. Now imagine that you are forced to listen to all of this for four hours straight from 6 10pm. This aural Armageddon then is my indelible memory of Conrad Bali I did complain to management about the noise around 9 pm. Dude was nice and apologetic but of course nothing was done. the dollars of the many far outweigh the dollars of the fewDo Not Disturb Rooms have a button that lights up a Do Not Disturb sign outside and the light was ignored by staff every single day. On the first day it was a dude who insisted on checking the minibar. at 130am on day 1 of our stay. On day 2 at around 3 pm they knocked and knocked till I woke up and opened the door because they wanted to hand me fresh towels I did not need. On day 3 the bellman banged on the door at 1015am to collect my bags even though I had arranged a 3 pm checkout with the desk the day before. Just go away please. Now. Room amenities The room was fine but uninspired. Balcony was nice. A C worked well bathroom was nice with double tub but toilet had slight leak bed was comfortable internet worked fine. Light switches in room require a Users Guide. If you must stay here get a room as far away from reception as possible to the far east side of the property. Beachside restaurant This restaurant refused to seat us even though it was completely empty for an hour after we were turned away the host said we should sit in the bar and have a comp drink and perhaps a table would open up in an hour and 45 minutes so we watched and sipped and waited. At the 45 minute mark I got up and took a photo of the empty restaurant they seated us 15 minutes later. Throughout our dinner and as we left there were still empty tables. The food was perfectly nice and fresh but uninspired and expensive at about 60 p without wineBreakfast The buffet had a spectacular selection of American and Asian dishes. One day the room was overflowing and they tried to send us to their Outer Slobovia caf\u00e9 on the 3rd floor. Do not fall for this the food and selection up there are sub par. Wait for a table.

Pools gorgeous sparkling pools with plenty of lounge chairs towels and space for everyone. The Balinese bales near the beach which you can rent for a small upcharge and probably worth it are lovely.

Our first and only disappointment with the resort was the slightly slow check in procedure which after traveling for 22 hours seemed to take forever. But this was all forgotten once we got to the Suku restaurant which courteously accepted us even if we came just at closing and then when the whole family went for a midnight swim straight from the terrace of the beautiful lagoon room. Next morning we were back again at Suku for the buffet breakfast and was met by a very good buffet with both western and eastern fares large bakery selection and several cooking stations \u2013 all served up by very service minded and friendly staff. Overall the staff everywhere at the resort is welcoming and service minded and make you feel very comfortable. Housekeeping did a wonderful job with the room during the entire stay and also made several nice towel arrangements looking like animals or props for the kids stuffed toys which the kids loved. Both the main pool and lagoon pool offered ample sunbed space whilst the lagoon room also offered us a private terrace with sunbeds. The lagoon pool is huge so you get a very private feel even though many rooms have direct access. Each end of the lagoon pool provides a sand bottom which the kids loved. The beach is not that great so this offered a perfect place to look for shells build small sandcastles etc without leaving the pool. The rest of the hotel has beautifully appointed grounds with several places to sit and read or enjoy the scenery flowers or numerous fountains and ponds. We tried out both lounges the adult only over Rin and the East lobby lounge with the family. Both lounges offered a decent selection of hors doeuvres and marvelous drinks but the East lobby lounge quickly became the favorite with the great ocean view and freshly made milk shakes for the kids. The polside spa and massage treatments are wonderful and the Azure bar and kiosk offer everything you need to eat and drink polside and for lunch. We ate once at Eight Degrees South but found Suku East and Azure to be better for the family and Rin better for up scale dining leaving Eight degrees somewhat left in the middle. In general there is very little to do within walking distance of the hotel and the Nusa Dua city center is not much of a destination \u2013 as a pedestrian you are somewhat trapped in a resort world. However the hotel is centrally located when it comes to taking a bus or taxi to the north for Ubud west for Kuta Legian and south west for Jimbaran and there are many culture and nature destinations within an hours drive of the hotel. The resort did offers a bus trolley going down to the \u201c Bali Collection \u201d shopping complex which was kind of dull. If you want shopping you \u2019re better off taking the drive to the shopping areas in Kuta Seminyak or any other major city anywhere in the world or just walk and enjoy the small on site shops at the resort. The hotel also offered several travel arrangements to the aforementioned sights and tourist destinations in the area but we ended up getting a local taxi driver for the day taking us to Ubud. Tegenungan waterfalls and the sights on the southwest. This was both affordable and gave us more flexibility than the hotel offering. Staying only five days there are much more of Balis nature and cultural sights left to explore and I am sure we will use the Conrad Bali for our next stay as well.", "offset": [1000, 1132], "date": "2016-07-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "5904b71f-5337-4e1f-9138-706a080dbbf0", "sentence": "Luxury redefined.

I must in particular mention Suriasa who each day did all the things which makes a family feel special on holiday. A wonderful soul of a person who is meticulous on good service. My children and wife adore him as do I Yudi for being so accommodating to our family. Nanik her beautiful smile and warmness in her service always so attentive. Mika for sharing his Barista skills with my daughters. Not only does he make the best coffee any style. in Bali its one of the best anywhere I have had.

If you are considering a visit to Bali do not hesitate. The media hype about the volcano is more destructive than the eruption. The Balinese are beautiful people and are suffering because of the grossly exaggerated risks regarding Mt Agung. The tourist areas of Nusa Dua Kuta Seminyak etc are more than 50kms away. We stayed 30kms away for 3 days of our visit and saw the volcano clearly each day.

The resort is large enough to provide all the facilities of a luxury hotel even with part of it closed. We used the pool which is I presume is normally reserved for suite guests and also had access to the spa pool we were staying in a suite on the 3rd floor which was magical in the evenings. As with any top end resort the difference is always made by the staff and service. We found everyone extremely welcoming friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and many people took the time to get to know us. We particularly enjoyed a leisurely breakfast every morning where we felt unrushed and enjoyed engaging with the excellent staff as well as with other guests sometimes.

I had three nights at the Conrad Bali the first two in a garden suite and the last in a spectacular Conrad Pool Villa. I had actually booked a Deluxe King Ocean Front room but I was upgraded to a suite with a garden view for the first two nights and I paid myself for the pool villa on the last day. First of all it has to be mentioned that the Conrad Bali is currently undergoing a very massive renovation project. This information is not provided to guests before or during booking except for a very subtle and not very informative notice that mentions that parts of the resort are currently undergoing transformation. The truth is that more than half of the property is closed until August or September 2018. To the hotels credit they managed to seal off the closed areas in a way that made difficult to notice the fact that such a big portion of the hotel was closed and for the most you could not hear construction noise. So it was not a disruption as such but it was definitely very unfortunate that so many unique features of the hotel were unavailable. The huge main pool that is usually visible from the lobby which is prominently featured in the hotels marketing material was closed along with all the connected smaller pools like the lagoon pool and waterfall. Only the Spa Pool and Suites pool was open to suites guests only. While the spa pool was very very nice it is a shame that such a luxurious hotel only had one pool available for most guests. Additionally only two restaurants were open the RIN for suites guests and Spice. The food was good at both places and I also enjoyed evening cocktails at the lounge which is available for guests staying in suites. Spice had a good breakfast buffet while RIN did made to order dishes which was ok but took a while to be served. I also had dinner at Spice which was good although a bit awkward since I was the only diner at the timeMy suite with the garden view was very spacious huge actually and with a big dining table and kitchen if you wanted to entertain guests. There was also a living room large bedroom and very large bathroom. There was even an extra fridge for your own drinks which is a good touch so you did not have to use the mini bar. The room had a bunch of amenities like a dvd player and the Wi Fi was quick and worked fine almost everywhere on the resort. The TV had a number of channels available including English language ones but the quality was not that good and it did not appear to be in HDThere was also a balcony which was nice but not much of a view except you could see the garden and some of the spa pool. The hotel is located in a portion of Nusa Dua where the beach starts becoming a bit more unappealing and the fact that there was no beach bar or restaurant available made it unattractive to stay by the beach. I actually walked along the beach to pass by some of the other luxurious hotels like the Westin Sofitel and Grand Hyat which had a much better stretch of beach. Especially the beach by the St Regis further down was perfect but presumably only for hotel guests. Actually all the other luxury hotels in that stretch of Nusa Dua were not undergoing renovation and as such they were far more impressive than the Conrad is currently with far more activities more bars restaurants pools etc. My Conrad Pool Villa was very nice though despite the fact that the pool is pretty small and the upgrade to the room was rather expensive. The pool villas interior was gorgeous and everything about it was just beautiful really such as the small garden the luxurious bathroom and the big bed. Service from the staff was great and it was really nice to hang out by the Spa Pool and at the aforementioned Conrad Suites Lounge in the evening for complimentary evening drinks and canap\u00e9s between 5 pm and 7 pm.

The gym was large and had lots of equipment that is not always standard with smaller hotel gyms. They also had another studio where they hold different fitness classes. Had I been staying longer I would have taken advantage of this as the facilities looked wonderful. The pool area for the villas was beautiful and we enjoyed hanging out in the Cabanas. We were brought water and refreshments while at the pol totally awesome during the heat. Prior to leaving we had one of the best meals of our trip at the Japanese restaurant overlooking the pool area. The Spicy Tuna Roll was unbelievable as was the tempura.

Check in at Conrad was n\u2019t as welcoming as expected. As we were staying in the villa it would have been preferable to be taken to check in in the comfort of our own villa rather than kept standing at the front desk. Welcome drinks and towels were given but our experience would have been improved it we had more of a \u201c premium \u201c welcome. There was a quite a long walk from reception to our villa. The villa entrance is a bit grubby. Adjacent to the area is a maintenance area with workers fixing sunbeds. This should be shielded from view again not what you expect from a premium suites villas. As villa guests we could use the suites pool and cabanas. The setting was serene and verdant. We were greeted with cold towels and water on our arrival and checked on frequently by the restaurant staff. This area was reserved to those 12 years and older however on some days children who were clearly under12 were allowed in the pool and not asked to leave. In the afternoon high tea was served in Rin. Sandwiches cakes and scones were served on an elegant cake stand. You had a wide choice of teas coffees and shakes and juices. The portions were generous. We were always offered more the staff was more than hospitable. Staff in the Rin restaurant lounge were lovely charming and warm. Snacks accompanied a wide range of cocktails beers and Balinese wines. Once finished our drinks were quickly topped up without asking. Hors d\u2019oeuvres were offered and explained in detail. The hospitality was warm and friendly and a charming start to the night. Breakfast had a wide choice of buffet favourites as well as a la carte. We were told breakfast for villa guests could sometimes be taken in Rin during our stay breakfast could only be taken in the main restaurant. It could get very busy. Outside seating is less hectic especially if you choose to sit in the bale. Get there early to avoid the rush. It would also be sensible if the hotel did not schedule loud work. grass cutting hammering use of circular saw etc to be done at the same time as prime use of the restaurant. We always asked for our villa to be cleaned when leaving for breakfast each day. Unfortunately most days on our return to the villa circa 25 hours later the villa had not be cleaned and as we spent most days lounging by the villa pool the villa was not cleaned until we left for dinner. If you have stayed at other Conrads Maldives Koh Samui etc do not expect the same level of service comfort etc. However the price point here is much lower especially for entry level rooms.", "offset": [873, 1027], "date": "2019-01-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "f4c23de4-5f4f-4e5d-b75f-fedf660ea8a7", "sentence": "Nice and quiet friendly staff great food.

The staff were helpful and friendly. All the restaurants provided high quality food even for the breakfast. We went the Rin twice at the same day the wagyu beef meals were amazing. Specially all the restaurants provide different themes of kids meals. That was an awesome ideaNot always fish and chips for kids meal. Also its free with adult meal. We like the idea of bali element in kids club. Not much place has it. The kids club is small but comes every thing you need. The kids pool area only a step from kids club.

We tried the restaurants in the hotel I personally recommend The Eight Degrees South where you can just relax at the beach enjoying an ocean breeze. The food was amazing and the breakfast had a very good selection of local and international products. I have never seen nicer hotel staff in my life before. Everyone starting from the airport pick up through the waiters in the restaurants up to the Spa therapists was taking a great care of every detail happy to assist at all times. The only drawback I have found was the beach as there are many water sports in the area and therefore there is a very little space for swimming in the ocean. It is only ok to swim when the tide is high which might be a problem for someone but we have still enjoyed the nice clear and calm water.

This hotel is called Conrad but the grounds rooms service and staff do n\u2019t even equate to a typical Hilton property. While everything looks good on the surface the quality is lackluster and the service leaves much to desire. During check in we were offered an upgraded room which was more expensive than what the Hilton ap was offering prior to arrival. We decided to try the upgraded room which had a nice pool on the balcony and was ocean front. The small plunge pool was cold and dirty. Even after asking for it to be cleaned it was still cloudy. 2 days into our stay water mysteriously started coming from under the wall by the closet. After calling maintenance and waiting around for someone to check it out they informed us that they were going to have to tear apart the shower and drywall to fix the issue. They needed us to move rooms but the room was n\u2019t ready. So instead of enjoying our holiday we were stuck waiting around to change rooms. The room that we were eventually moved to 5 hours later was a Conrad Pool Suite. Which is supposed to be the second best room in the entire resort. As soon as we turned on the Air Conditioner the room smelled like mold and mildew to the point your eyes hurt. When walking into the bathroom hundreds of sewer drain flies were everywhere. There was a yellow liquid coming out of the drain in the corner of the bathroom that I was not brave enough to investigate. The moisture mold problems were so bad drywalls nails were popping and rusting from the ceiling and most of the trim was falling off the walls doors etc. The staffs response was let \u2019s move you to another room but it is n\u2019t ready and you need to wait around for another few hours. The manager said that they would remove the upgrade charge from the initial check in. But they never did and when we went to check out the receptionist pretended like she did n\u2019t understand and they would not help us. You can tell that the management at this hotel is non existent and undertrained. Every room we were in had many broken itemscofe pots phones dressers etc. and there were bugs insectsflies cockroaches etc. The staff always responds \u201c certainly \u201d they will fix it but never do anything. I found hair in a pastry at breakfastTo celebrate my wife \u2019s birthday we booked the Conrad Penthouse with points. While the Penthouse is the best room we experienced at the Conrad Bali it still leaves much to desire. The standing water under the deck attracts mosquitos and insects. Inside we found flies spiders. Broken fountains doorbell phones etc seems ridiculous for the equivalent of 1000 USD per night. We also were left a arrival gift of a bandaid on the side of the pool. All the pools are very cold temperature and do not have heaters on them. The ocean is pretty from a far but riddled with seaweed trash and filth. The water sports that they allow on the water poisons the air with the smell of gas and exhaust which means even if you pay for a cabana you will hear jet skis all day long and smell gas.
