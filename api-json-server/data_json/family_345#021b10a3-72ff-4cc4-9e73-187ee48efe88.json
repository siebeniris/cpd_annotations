Will be back. We had a lovely time staying at the Melvile Mariot. From the minute we walked in we were greeted with genuine smiles from staff at the reception check in desk. It was a special surprise anniversary trip weekend for hubby to go to the Barclays Cup. Jhanet and Ria were just wonderful they made sure we had a memorable stay and we can not thank them enough for the complimentary extras that made our stay amazing they were just lovely. Thank you so muchWe had a concierge king room on the 4th floor it was a very quiet floor considering the hotel was full with people staying for the Barclays. The view of the sunset was just beautiful. Our room was very quiet and clean. Very comfy bed. I want the pillows and linens. The resturaunt was totally our style modern contemporary with a very relaxing atmosphere menu had a good variety service was a little slow at first but our waiter sorry I forgot your name was great he was attentive did not keep interrupting our dinner. We enjoyed our meal and when friends came to join they were warmly welcomed. We love the style in this part of the hotel. The lobby was very nice too however the atrium was just strange I think it is the carpet it did not quite go with the style of the front desk and lounge resturant. The pool looked very clean although we were too late for a swim as it closed at 10pm. Breakfast was of the best we have had. Fresh cooked omelette to order and the hot buffet was delicious our waitress Maria was so attentive and made us feel very special. We are happy to have found a really nice hotel with staff really committed to making our stay a fabulous one it made our anniversary trip that much more special. We will definitely be back for the next golf tournament.", "offset": [1536, 1697], "date": "2016-08-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "e8cd85a6-84dc-40a0-b286-04f2b732bb19", "sentence": "Wedding Weekend.

Stayed at this hotel on Saturday night. Hotel was filled with families of sport tournaments. You can imagine the activity of 10 12 yr olds running through halls lobby and at the pool.

By tailgate I mean coolers full of booze throughout the pool area and lobby corn hole set up in the lobby beer bottles can all over. The noise was ridiculous. Hotel knows it \u2019s a problem as they have these policy signs made and placed all over. but they do zero to enforce. Worse then the hotel were the parents.

I was in town for a week dealing with work where I was spending 8 10 hours a day in a dirty warehouse. the one thing I am looking in a hotel on these trips is for it to be clean quiet a easy to get in and out of and hopefully good food. I have to say this hotel had all of those really what surprised me was the quality of the food the hotel is a bit remote so after a long day I did not feel like driving 15 minutes to get food and really enjoyed the options at the lobby restaurant. The hotel is a large wide U shape so if you have a far room plan on walking for bit but I am fine with that. Staff was great very helpful when I had an issue with my TV it was fixed quickly.
