The location is great for the Union Sq area is 2 blocks away with shopping in all directions. The main reason we stay here is the mellow atmosphere and the indoor pool our kids love.

I waited for a shuttle bus for one hour at the airport and could have easily taken the bart instead. The reception needs to have a better idea of the current traffic situation to give guests more options. I asked in reception when I checked in what the rates were for phone calls explaining I was trying to work out whether a call to California would be better from the hotel phone or from my Norwegian cell phone. I was advised that there would be a full list of prices for calls next to the phone in my room. There was not and I ended up with a big phone bill and when I questioned this the receptionist was totally unapologetic. The area by the pool was being renovated and I could not use it.
