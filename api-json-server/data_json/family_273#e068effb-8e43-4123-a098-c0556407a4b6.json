The Hotel is old 1919 and could be played up as historic but that was lost and was just bland. I paid for a king sized bed and they put me in a full then questioned if I was sure that the bed was the wrong size. The second room I got to had a perpetually leaky shower that soaked the floor with its splashing. If it were any less clean I would have complained but it was just barely passable. The rooms are very small. which was fine for a 1919 building in manhattan but I would not recommend if you had small children this is a neutral point to my stay but other travelers should be aware. Old large TV does not help the square footage any. There is a 6 wide shelf in the bathroom to put your stuff no real counter. They also charge for every little thing internet use of fridge etc. 3 star is a stretch it is a solid 2 star hotel.

Hello thanks for reading my experience at this Toilet I stayed in in the Hotel Pennsylvania 7th Avenue at 33 street. I booked a 10 night holiday with Cruise Deals online from an advert in the Daily Express. This included a 2 night stay in New York in the mentioned hotel in a Superior room. And travelled on the 1916 having returned yesterday 1916It was a long day when my wife and I travelled getting up at 330 to take the hour drive to LHR so with a 7 and a bit hour flight which took off at 0840 and a 25 hr transfer to the hotel we were whacked when we got to the hotel and checked in with a pleasant female receptionist. Our room was on the 10th floor which we thought would give us a good view out we made our way up to the room taking our own cases as no offer was made to provide this service. On reaching the room we entered and found a functional room which seemed dated. We were two very tired seniors so cleaned up after a 17hr day and retired to bed which was again was clean and practical. On waking the following day we got up and showered ready for a days trip around the Big Apple. It was then we noticed that the room was not just old but old and dirty there was dust along the skirting in the vents of the heater and just about every piece of furniture. You could smell the dirt in the very old tatty threadbare and wrinkled carpet. Looking toward the window I thought it is a bit misty today oh well it is early so will probably clear later and went across to the window for a look out and noticed the window was filthy not just outside which would be excusable but inside too with the curtains torn and dirty toThe complaint was met with well it is old and no offer of another room so as we were there for one more night only decided we had better not eat there to avoid possible tummy upsets and ate all meals around the many restaurants and fast food places in the city. We wanted to leave our cases 2 on the day we checked out as we had about 5hrs to kill and asked what appeared to be an elderly Indian or Asian man at the dest who is name I can not remember was initially rude and arrogant until I reminded him of his manners in no uncertain terms this service which I have found free anywhere else I have stayed in the world would cost 10 dollars. Many of the staff are polite and helpful especially the two lads who looked after the cases but several have no people skills. The hotel is in the Manhattan area by Madison square gardens easy walking distance to the Empire State Building and hop on off busses had a fantastic time seeing as much as possible in the time there.

The woman at the front desk told us to come back the best day and they will put us in the right room. The next day we went down at 90 in the morning and they said that they sold out of the rooms we were suppose to be in. So then they told us to come back later and they would try to put us in a room. We went back later and they put us in one room and the bathroom was disgusting. There was stuff all over the tub and it looked dirty. After looking at three different rooms they finally put us in a Penn 500 that had two double beds. The tub was still disgusting we had to put a towel in the bathtub because we did not want our feet touching the tub. We asked if we could get a discount for the first night because it was not our fault that they gave our room to someone else and that they did not have any other one clean and they told us no because they put us in the right room the next day.
