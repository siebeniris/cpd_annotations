We stayed for one night over a weekend and when we arrived things seemed a little hectic with two weddings in progress. The reception staff seemed a little hyper obviously dealing with the wedding guests and in your face but very friendly. We had a double room which was modern and clean with free water wifi and robes for IHG members which were very welcome. On our evening return we used the bar which was staffed by three very friendly and efficient bar staff. The weddings were still going on and we were worried our nights sleep may have been disrupted it was not. We had a bed breakfast package which I believe was very good value. Breakfast was excellent variety of cold meats cheeses breads pastries cereals juices and a very good hot buffet. Staff again were very friendly. The only hiccup came when I wanted to use Express Check out. I accessed the bill via the TV menu and discovered I had been charged \u00a3 10 for parking even though I declared we were car free on check in. I phoned reception and a flustered sounding staff member said it would be sorted which it appears to have been.

There is an in room safe and a small refrigerator mini bar. Although there was a wardrobe there was no dresser a slight disappointment. My only other complaint about the room was the lack of an accessible HDMI port on the television. The TV was mounted on the wall in a surrounding frame. Many travellers bring their own entertainment devices with them and use these ports to connect their iPads laptops etc. However I am happy to report that there were plenty of power outlets and some also had a USB charger port including the two by the bedside. The hotel is going through a refurbishment so the restaurant on site was closed. Not a big concern as the hotels location is only a short distance from a lot of local eateries. Breakfast was being served in one of their ground floor conference rooms which was a bit snug during the busy times in the mornings. The food quality and variety was good.

I went to Leeds with my husband as he had business there and I had a day off. We picked a central hotel so I could go off and explore while he worked. This hotel is nicely located in the city centre with an easy walk to the main shopping areas and places of interest. The desk gave me a map as I had never visited Leeds before. There was some work going on in the foyer but nothing to disrupt the service. We arrived very early for check in 10 am which I knew and never expected a room to be ready but I had to be dropped early because of my husbands job that day. I thought the man on the desk was a little snipy we were so early not letting me explain I did not expect a room before announcing there is no room. I left my case there and went off into the city. I returned just before 2 pm and there was no rooms ready so I had a very nice lunch in the bar area. I had expected someone to maybe just give me a nod when a room was ready but I had to keep checking and watching others get their rooms while I still waitedRom 207 was a little tired and assume it is still to be refurbished. But it was clean and nice with plenty of room for us to move around etc. Bathroom with bath and shower also clean with toiletries provided. I went to the spa area and spent a lovely hour swimming going in sauna and steam room and whirl pool. All clean and well kept. Remember to take a \u00a3 1 coin with you for the lockers though. I had forgotten as took nothing with me other than my costume and clothes. The lady on the spa desk leant me a coin with me leaving my room key so they got it backThe biggest down side of our whole stay which stops me giving more stars was the noise. There was a wedding in the hotel the same night we were there and I think room 207 must be directly above the dance floor. It was almost like being there I could hear the lyrics to the songs so our TV was up quiet loud so we could hear it. The music stopped around midnight I think as I was so tired after an early start that morning I just lay in bed trying to get to sleep and stopped looking at the clock. I expect some noise from the corridor at hotels etc but not a full disco in my room. The bed was also too hard for me so not a brilliant night sleep but pillows were comfortable. The buffet breakfast had a good selection of what I had expect from a buffet breakfast at a hotel like this. Although the pastries and muffins had run out by 100am when we were eating. Also having a tea coffee station to help yourself would be better than waiting to be offered served by someone walking round. We waited nearly 10 minutes before someone finally offered hot drinks but not decaf so I asked for hot water to put my our decaf teabag in which took more time to arrive and I chased it. Most hotels I stay in now have a station with an urn or coffee machine to just get the drinks yourself.

The female changing rooms have no changing cubicles so you disrobe in front of everyone right where people enter the changing room.

The pool area is tiny you can not swim lengths properly. The jacuzi is filthy with ground in dirt and grime covering the outside. The steam room is also filthy in a poor state of repair and covered in grime it also stank of drains we could not sit in there for longer than 5 mins and in that time another pool user complained to us about the state of the steam room to which we agreed.

The wine was n\u2019t great but still a nice gesture sadly the fridge we now had also did n\u2019t work properly the light inside did a laser show flicker and it never got cold inside brilliant.

The shower head was cheap and the water pressure was pitiful also the bathroom sink took forever to drain out I dread to think what was blocking the flow of water. It appeared some sort of cover up cheap coating had been painted onto to bath enamel around the top and it had started to bubble and flake off see attached pic. this made a ridiculous mess in the bathroom and gave it a dirty unprofessional look. One of the beds had a horrible dried white stain mark on the bed base see attached pic. again my stomach turned thinking what the hell it could have been and probably was.

I called room service informed them about my missing drink and requested a free replacement soft drink they apologised and sent one with my food order. Breakfast at this hotel was ok nothing special not a huge choice of foods and not much fruit to choose from and the tea never stayed warm for very long.

On our second morningSunday the pastries had been given a sticky glazeit definitely was n\u2019t on them on the Saturday to try and convince guests they were fresh. They so obviously were not fresh and were from the previous day they were dry and tough and I could n\u2019t eat the croissants big disappointment. The day we left I was all packed up and ready to go when I realised a pair of my shoes had gone missing I emptied my case to check I had n\u2019t accidentally packed them. They were quite expensive and very unusual so I started to panic that they were in the same place as my can of Tango. I looked again under the bed they had been put under there really far under. who does thatNever have I had my footwear hidden under the bed before by the hotel maid. I \u2019m guessing someone was hoping I \u2019d forget them and not notice till they had been back to claim them as their own. This really was the final straw for me I can safely say I would n\u2019t ever stay at this hotel again and I love Crowne Plaza hotels but this particular one needs a shake up. On check out the receptionist took our key card and never even asked how are stay had been there is no opportunity to give feedback no forms in the room it \u2019s not hard to work out why really is it.", "offset": [1959, 2218], "date": "2019-06-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "8a711a5b-619a-40ac-952f-653031270230", "sentence": "Was OK. Stayed whilst Ed Sheran was in Leeds. Receptionist was very helpful and informative. The parking was a total rip off I havestayed in a lot of hotels but have never had to pay for parking definatley not \u00a3 17 shocking. We settled into our room which was nice well layed out and nice decor the bathroom smelt a bit damp but not such a bad thing. We ate in the restaurant before getting an uber to the concert. The room service menu is tiny like three things to choose from. I asked for a pizza without cheese and was told it is not possible a clear sign that the pizza is bought in frozen so ordered the linguini which was tasty. The restaurant was quiet but after waiting 30 minutes for a pasta dish some garlic bread and a steak sandwich i had to pull up a waiter and ask how much longer. Meh. The hotel provided huge plastic bags for our dirty welys when we got back from the concert quite a nice touch as our car did not get mud up either. Would defo go back if it was not for the parking charge but becaue of this we will not be returning.

Poor service throughout. Stayed here at the weekend. I was really looking forward to a 50 th celebration in Leeds with good company. The hotel I \u2019m afraid lacks due to lacking staff. Check in was average. We booked club rooms. Room was ok. Shower poor. I had to run around the bath to get wet. Poor pressure with damaged shower head. Door frame damaged in bathroom with rusty hinges. Bed was a double rather small with a poor mattress. Breakfast was continental in the club lounge. My card did n\u2019t work for entry so friends let us in. Coffee machine issues. Not much left when we arrived. I had to go looking for staff so as to get a breakfast. Spoke with male receptionist and asked for tables to be cleared as no tables available. He just looked at me and picked up the phone. Poor breakfast. On checkout again poor. Handed key card in and receptionist just grunted. I will visit Leeds again as I enjoyed the City.

I stayed here on Saturday and as I have stayed in a lot of corporate hotels. know pretty much what to expect. The price of this hotel for room only was pretty expensive but it had a spa so that was important for me. However only after using the robe hanging up in my room. did I notice a sticker on it. It was someones name so had been used before without washing. I took out the second bathrobe only to find the same thing another named sticker. In addition to this I ordered a bar meal in which the bagel was so hard I could n\u2019t even cut into it. At breakfast the eggs beans and tomatoes were luke warm and bread rolls rock hardIf I was staying in a budget hotel this would n\u2019t be acceptable but for a \u00a3 17 breakfast expensive room and a supposedly higher end corporate hotel this was total disgusting. We did complain on checking out and did get some money off. But that \u2019s not the point we would rather pay the full amount have food food and clean bathrobes.
