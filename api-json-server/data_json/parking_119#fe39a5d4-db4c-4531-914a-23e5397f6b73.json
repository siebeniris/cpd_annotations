I have stayed in a lot of Hiltons and I was not disappointed. The hotel staff was very accommodating. We were there for business. So there was no sleeping in. But when I tell you room serve was the fastest i ve ever had it was super fast. It was like as soon as it was off the griddle it was in our room. One thing I did not like was parking. It was a AKA cluster event going on and it was a lot more people there than regular guest. It would have been helpful if the staff would have informed that their were events going on in the hotel that weekend so we would have been better prepared to walk a distance in the parking lot. I also ate in the restaurant had the catfish poboy. Man oh man that was a really good poboy. If you happen to stay there try it. It was not on the room service menu but if you go to the restaurant it will be there. Other than the parking the hotel was great. It was clean. Housekeeping cleaned like they were suppose to.

The food is worse than airline and priced through the roof. Here for a conference and conference staff were mostly inept and unconcerned. Had guards at meeting room due to expensive antiques on display. Guards nodded off and paid no attention to people coming and going. Can only imagine overnight coverage.
