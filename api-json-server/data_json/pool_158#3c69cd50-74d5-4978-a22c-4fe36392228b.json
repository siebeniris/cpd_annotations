Whenever I travel and I want a place to stay where I know what to expect I almost always choose and Mariot brand hotel. And this is no different. I have stayed at this particular Courtyard Mariot many times I have actually lost count. And every time I have had a terrific stay. This time was just the same. When we arrived which was quite late we were met with a smile and great treatment. The gentleman at the front desk at this time was a man named Renick I hope I spelled it right and he has been there for some time. As soon as we came in he recognized us as he does every time we come. I wanted to make sure and mention him by name because he is one of the best front desk staff members of any hotel I have even gone to. Very pleasant and accommodating with a good sense of humour. Other than that the stay was just as good as every other time I have stayed here Like I said very dependable. Rooms were clean and comfortable. As I have always said the food is no gourmet restaurant quality but that is not the type of place it is. It is however very tasty and certainly hits the spot. I have had issues before with food taking a long time to come out but this time it was no time at all. Before I had a chance to get through a drink food was there. The selection on the menu is decent and the prices are reasonable. There used to be a TGIF right next door that closed some time ago but a new place seems to be just about ready to open in the same spot now. I am not sure when but looks soon. it is directly in front of the hotel so will also bring some other options as well for dining I am sure. This trip was also actually the first time I have used the hotel pool. Which as pools go is nice. it is a simple rectangular pool fairly shallow so it is nice for just lounging in. it is also quite long so if swimming is your exercise of choose then you should be pretty OK here. Word of warning though it is narrow so if there are a lot of people at the pool do not expect to be able to do laps. A lot of people complain saying that the hotel is not very Barbados. that is true it is not. If you want a hotel more Barbados go for something else. This is a Courtyard Mariot and as such it is just like every other Courtyard Mariot. To me that is what is so good about it. No matter where in the world I go when I stay at a Courtyard Mariot hotel I know what to expect. All in all this hotel has maintained a very high standard and quality over the years I have been coming to it. As I said I know what to expect and it is always the way I remember it. I will definitely be staying here again on my next Barbados trip.", "offset": [1725, 1807], "date": "2015-05-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "f6c47ea2-d4d8-4ba2-8186-433eff956283", "sentence": "Ok for business but not pleasure. In my opinion the hotel is ok and you could in fact be anywhere in the USI would have been disappointed if I was staying here on holiday. The hotel is not on the beach and you need to cross the road to access the beach. Currently its invaded by seaweed so we used the pool area instead. The pool area is ok but not the prettiest.

What I really enjoyed was the friendly and helpful staff tasty buffet breakfast nice gym and the pool is nice but needs some shade. During the day it can get quite hot and unbearable to be in the pool. Especially if you can spare your lunch time to be in the pool. Now beware even though a late checkout was requested in advance at a cost the room keys automatically stop working at 2 pm. This caused me some grief but thank God I spotted a housekeeper so I could have gotten access to the phone to call the front desk. You can be looked out in the pool area or out of your room. This should be addressed for advance requests or guests should be advised to come to the front desk in advance before such fate. The room I got seemed to be for the physically challenged the problem with this is that a nice warm shower can create a huge puddle in the room which is not safe. Water was everywhere when I stepped out of the shower. Maybe a shower door should be put in place instead of a shower curtain. The bathroom was flat I guess to allow for wheelchairs etc. the extractor on the toilet side seemed non functional. I hope never to get this room again. The sheets and 2 pillows also had a bit of a weird scent and I also found some hair strands around the bed when in checked in which I advised housekeeping. It was not the best feeling seeing this as I deem this hotel of good standards usually. They removed the hairs but they advised the sheets were already changed before I got into the room. I like this hotel and did not have the issues with the room on my last stay. This should be reviewed.

Our family stayed here for 5 days and what a great vacation. This hotel is located in Hastings if you are looking for it on a map. We had a suite so we had plenty of room. It was on the top floor so we had great views and breezes. The beach is right across the street. You do not have to go down a ladder. There is a gate that you access with your room key then very large steps that go down to the beach. The beach is shared with the Coconut Beach hotel which is great because they have a tiki bar on the beach. Say Hi to Antonio the bartender. The drinks are great and a fair number of locals hang out there too. There is a lady that sells crafts and souvenirs as well. There is some snorkeling from the beach. The surf looks rougher than it really is. The boardwalk starts a little south of the beach so you can walk to some bars and restaurants. Next to the hotel there are some very good restaurants to walk to also. We had fun trying them all. The Blue Room a pizza place a boutique restaurant at the driveway of the hotel. There is also a convenient store you can walk to that has all the staples you will need. We also had breakfast at the hotel which has a buffet and a la carte items that are more reasonable. The staff was very nice. We had a car and went all over the island so the hotel was in a good location. You can take the bus or the local taxis which are the ones with the crazy horns. The hotel pool looks very small on the website but there is plenty of room and we loved it. The gym was one of the best gyms we ever seen in a caribbean hotel.
