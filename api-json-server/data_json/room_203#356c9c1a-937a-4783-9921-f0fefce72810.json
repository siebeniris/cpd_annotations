We took Ubers the entire weekend but they were always willing to call cabs for us give us recommendations for places to eat and things to do and see. They must get asked to take pictures often because they were more then willing to do it and seemed to pay particular attention to lighting and focus. Our rooms were excellent though our view was terrible oh well can not complain for 28 night.

I think the price was comparable to similar hotels in the area but one thing that sets it apart is the friendly and helpful staff. Any requests were immediately responded to and everyone was very welcoming. We had a 2 queen room as we were traveling with our 2 kids and the room was large and well appointed. With all the surrounding buildings you can upgrade to a lakeview room but you can only see a sliver of the lake. The rooms show a bit of wear but the beds and pillows were comfortable and the air conditioning unit could be run with a continuous fan so it provided nice white noise to muffle any traffic and city noise. There is an outdoor pool on the 5th floor which is nice. You will pay for parking in the hotel ramp to the tune of about 55 a day.
