With our early morning flight we turned up 5 hours before check in and even so we were greeted and seated by happy faces and very efficient staff. We were walked to our room by a lady who on route explained all about the services of the hotel. She asked us what we were looking to gain from our stay and made her guidance and information client specific. The room was spacious the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. We had a balcony looking out onto the water which made for good people watching. On touring the hotel complex we encountered many staff of different origins and each and every one met us with a smile and as much information as we asked for. The buggy service as well as the abras shuttle boats were excellent and without a doubt made travelling around much easier. We dined in Trader Vics Leftbank MJs and the best night we ate at Pai Thai. Each restaurant had extensive menus and for the quality and portion of food you get it was well worth it. Wild wadi was a highly entertaining day and an excellent addition to the hotel services and the beach afterwards with buzzers on the Canopus is an bery clever touch as service is much easier. My one and only suggestion would be to lower the drinks prices as that is the only thing I thought to be unreasonable.

This was our first stay at this hotel. When asking our friends and doing online research I was very surprised how everyone loved this place and was somewhat hesitant about our expectations. But the reality matched and even exceeded all high praises about this place. We had wonderful 8 days there. It was somewhat overwhelming how hard the hotel and everyone there are trying to impress their guests and take care of every possible need or request. this really makes this place very special. Our great experience started upon our arrival when we were offered a free upgrade from a one bedron suite to a presidential suite. Huge and beautiful suite with great views. Weather was not perfect for several days during our stay so we enjoyed being at our suite a lot. As mentioned above the best part of this resort is so many little things of everyone working hard to make you feel welcome and take care of everything bottles of chilled water on the beach beautiful beach with a lot of space and everything you need a guy bringing free ice cream around the pools and on the beach another guy offering to clean your sunglasses fresh fruit in the room perfectly organized transportation boats and golf carts around the resort etc. You really get spoiled very quickly. This quality of service is especially surprising as the whole resort with all the hotels is huge with so many people but you do not feel lost at all and you never feel that the place is too big to take care of its guests. We went to a couple of places outside the resort but I can easily see spending a week in the resort without leaving it. it has everything for relaxing and doing nothing. What shocked us somewhat was how expensive food was but this is not the issue of this resort but of Dubai generally we just did not expect to have such expensive food and wine but this is the reality of Dubai. Getting a suite at this hotel gives a lot of free things breakfast access to the water park transfer from and to airport etc. so this felt as a great deal for us.

We booked this property for the final 2 nights on our holiday as somewhere special and luxurious to complete our vacation. The property and facilities are beautiful if a little opulent to my taste our room was well appointed. The real problem here is the quality or service a consistent language barrier problem and the inability for staff to resolve issues the way they need to be resolved in a 5 star property of this calibre. My view is the property can be impressive and beautiful but IF the people working there are not warm welcoming proactive and competent it all counts for nothing. I travel very frequently and this is the worst service I have ever received in a property of the calibre and price point. We arrived from Istanbul at 2 am in the morning. The only ones in the lobby at that time. We eventually located someone to check us in theY were expecting us at this time noted in the booking. It took over 30 minutes to check us in and get us to our room there was so much mucking about. We were clearly tired and just wanted to get to bed there was no awareness of recognition of this. The chap checking us in moved at a glacial pace and when I questioned him twice about the delay he brushed me aside and said everything was fine. We eventually got to our room to find it was a king bed smoking room we had booked a twin share non smoking. Needless to say we just put up with it as we were so tired. I mentioned the next day to the concierge about the experience and that is was not good. he told us to take it up with from desk. We raised it again with the Front Desk later in the day and they apologised and said a manager would be in touch they send a fruit plate to our room. nice thought but only provided one plate and 1 fork for the 2 of us. just poor attention to detailWhen we used the concierge to print our boarding passes and confirm our limo pickup time. it was a comedy of errors and took more than 30 min to explain and organise. Which baffles me. surely people staying here need Emirates boarding passes printed and pick up times confirmed all the time. We thought we had get our over first world problems and go for a swim. no where in the room is any info on where the pool is located or it is operating hours. I called the service line and they eventually confirmed after much waiting on hold that the pool closed at 8 pm. More bafflement. Why in a 5 star resort full of pools with a private beach would the management want to deny a guest a swim in Dubai in the middle of summer at 815pm when it is actually cool enough to be outside for a period of time. Some random housekeeping things. Bathroom large and luxurious. Shower has taps not a mixer so hard to get the temperature right. We were allocated for our 2 days a box of tissues with 5 tissues in it. we also were provided with 3 towels. no problem. I asked for more and when we came back they where all waiting on the bed I would have thought again in a property of this calibre and price point the bathroom would have been reserviced the wet towels removed and the new ones hung up. At check out this morning the manager finally made an appearance and apologies for the slow check in. no apology for the wrong bed arrangement or smoking room. So here is my advice. If you get an AWESOME super cheap deal under USD20 per night. stay and enjoy all the incredible architecture canals abras etc. Try the Mexican restaurant at the hotel next door amazing. But if you are paying the normal rate as we were move on you can get much more for your money in other hotels in Dubai and around the world. Until the service and capability of this hotel matches the price point avoid. The inability of hotel management to deal with feedback was woeful.

Where to start I have just returned from a 7 night break to the resort of Al Qasr by Jumeirah. I usually take a week to reflect on my holiday before reviewing but there was no need with this place. Truly Stunning. From the moment you pull up the driveway and are greeted by the golden horses you know this is no ordinary hotel. Upon arivalare luggage was whisked away and we was taking to reception. You do not que like normal hotels. You are sat down given a free ice cold refreshment and the staff check you in at your sofa much better than standing. We upgraded to a sea view. \u00a3 300 for the week it was well worth it sitting on the balcony at night listening the waves lap onto the beech with a view of the palm and the Burj AlLarab sorry ca nt spell itOnce you have handed your credit card over you are walked to your room and given the low down of the features. The beds and pillows are unlike anything I have experienced before we have stayed in 5 hotels in London Miami and Orlando non come close to this. Location. Sat in front of the Burj about 20 minutes from the airport on the beech nested between the palm and downtown this is the perfect location. Beech The beech stretches for about a mile or so. Golden white sand water as clear as those in the Bahamas in my opinion better and water as hot as a bath. The beech has lifeguards every 100 ft plus one constantly Kayaking in the sea incredibly safe. Pool. Each morning once you have found your loungers the pool attendants will make up your bed for you with towel and ice cold water topped up throughout the day at no extra charge. Every hour or so waiter will pop around with cold towels ice cream and fresh fruit all complimentary. Food The Al Qsar shares its grounds with two other hotels combined there are 40 restaurants we went half board. You can use about 30 of these restaurants with your half board lunch or dinner and get 3 courses. The quality of the foot is exceptional. we ate out of the hotel a few times at SeaFire on Atlantis and one downtown. Both where very good but with dinner costing 150 plus for mains and a drink it seemed silly not to use what we had paid for. Breakfast is buffet there are 2 3 restaurants you can eat at by the pool in the main hotel. They have just about everything you can imagine from fresh salmon full English pastrys the egg stations are fantastic the guys will make you anything you want. On your first day you are given a full tour of the buffet from the wait staff they explain everything. I proposed on our trip she said yes. I hired someone to do a beech proposal the hotel where fine with it. After we ate at Pier Chic its expensive 2 glassed of Moet set me back \u00a3 55 but the food is exquisite again not cheap but for a special occasion you just have to accept the priceBoze is expensive when you arrive in Dubai where you collect the luggage you can get Duty free wine 6 bottles P. We stocked up and used to sit on our balcony pre and post dinner and drink and just had a glass with dinner. This is perfect as below us was the Bahia Lounge and they played live music on the terrace each night which we could hear from the comfort of our balcony. Getting aroundAs the hotel is massive so they have a waterway system and guests and hop on a little boat and they take you where ever you want to go. On the beech front there are golf buggies they take zip you around as far as Jumeria Beech and Wild Wadi water park free entry for guest of Al Qasar. Overall a FAB experience.

Had a week sans child and so spent the extra few quid to try this out usually. with our daughter it becomes silly money for a quick sun fix in Dubai would rather spend big bucks somewhere exotic. So it is another opulent and perfectly serviced hotel this is done up Arabian Palace esque with fantastic views to the Burj Al Arab something that we have missed for a while I really think that to be in Dubai you should be able to look up and see it when you are sitting on the beach. The waterways Abras while stunning aesthetically can be a little annoying when trying to get somewhere. We took a full tour on the first day to sort out locations of restaurants etc and then found routes on foot to get everywhere afterwards we were waiting for ages once nobody had told us that we should of been on the other side of the water to go in the direction we needed. Very pretty surroundings. Not necessarily good for those of us who like our evening heels and shorter dresses or even long dresses when disembarkingWe got a Jumeirah Flavours dine around deal which is amazing value when you realise that you can eat in something like 60 different restaurants this is appealing when situated among several other Jumeirah properties we did not leave the Zabel Saray on the dine around deal before because of being on the Palm. They would let you use the vouchers for lunch instead of dinner. We found that the portions everywhere were massive a starter and a main for the two of us would easily have fed four adults and possibly a child. Our favourite evening meal was the Mexican Tortuga they serve street food style starters and proper mains again way too much food. Being by the water and not too dressed up was nice. The Thai was ok. we are big on Thai food and cook a lot at home so for us nothing to write home about though it was very popular and very smart too. Again by the water round the back of the hotel so a quiet location. We ate at the beach bar in front of the Mina a lot big portions and yummy. Same at the JBH lovely setting and quieter up that end. We loved a drink on the jetty as you walk up the Pier restaurant but it was always dead due to the chilly evenings. To be out on the water like in the Maldives is a delight and right under the Burj. In all food is as always perfect. Service perfect. They broke my husbands medicine bottle and seamlesly found the same medicine and sent a bouquet the the room with massive apologies. Beach was too crowded for us. We ended up walking to the end where it is blocked and tried to not look at the endless full sunbeds behind us. There was a quiet beach bar and restaurant there so still got that amazing service. We went to the Souk Madinat a few times once for a general enquiry. We found the food and drink available there far cheaper than in the hotels but you noticed a drop in some of the guests suitability also. Having said that we went to one of the bars above the Italian as you approach by abra and it was buzzing with lovely looking food and quite upmarket. Breakfast in Al Qasr was a normal buffet experience get food eat get out quick. Very big selection as always. Drinks are nice and expensive as always and for some reason we were limited to 4 bottles of water free per day. I am sure it is normally unlimited at Jumeirahs unles that changes with the heat. We were lucky to get the first week of dry weather after another bout of rain. Cold nights though which we hate but not the hotels fault. This is a fantastic hotel the whole resort is amazing. We will definitely return with our daughter but may stick to BB as we really do not eat as much as you pay for with the half board optioncanot beat a Jumeirah property and this one was perfect.", "offset": [613, 886], "date": "2017-04-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "c4465a76-e86d-47e1-8609-d39c03bdb947", "sentence": "One of the best hotels.

Visited for over a week in August with the wife and 2 Kids. After staying in other locations in DXB on previous occasions we thought this was the time to stay in the Madinat resort. Expectations were extremely high but unfortunately they did not live up to it. On arrival the front of the Hotel was been refurbished which was not a nice welcome. The check in process was abrupt with no warm welcome. We arrived early morning and booked via Emirates Holidays who had guaranteed check in early morning but on check in it was felt that they were doing us a favour. As we arrived early we asked where the breakfast could be taken and the answer was \u201c you need to pay \u201d. We were staying Half Board and even so this was during off peak season still paid a significant amount to stay at this hotel and money was not the issue but the manner the check in agent answered was at least disrespectful. To note in many locations we have visited around the world would have never ever had such reply and the majority of the cases breakfast would have been given out of courtesy. but not here of course by the way was not expecting a courtesy breakfast just where the breakfast room was. This is a large resort overall the facilities are nice with plenty of options part of your Half Board but bear in mind some of these are closed during the summer months. It is extremely hot in August which means the beach area is deserted and you can only enjoy the pools. The kids club was nice but maybe in need for a refurb. The buggies abras that take you around the resort were a hit and miss in terms of waiting times. The staff customer service was what I was most disappointed with no consistency in the service around the resort. The breakfast at Arboretum was at times hectic. long queues and staff unable to cope. This is not what you expect in a premium hotel. We shifted to the Lebanese restaurant for breakfast by the pool as the early morning experience was actually stressing us out not good at all. Clearly during the off peak season this resort is not interested to provide the service that probably provides during peak season however our experience put us off visiting the hotel again even during peak season. Already planning a stopover in DXB and our travel consultant had already suggested the Al Qasr which we refused. Think twice before splashing your hard earn money here during the off peak season.", "offset": [75, 196], "date": "2020-02-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "f98ad34c-755f-4595-8131-729f988fffba", "sentence": "Too many changes. I have written a few reviews of Al Qasr over the years and they have always been positive. My Husband and I have been staying here since 206 often 2 or 3 times a year so I feel that I know this hotel well enough to comment on the changes that have taken place. Firstly I would like to say that I still love this hotel the staff and the facilities however the changes that have taken place over the last couple of years have maybe gone too far now to ensure that the enjoyment that you once got may not be the same going forward. As a regular guest of Club Executive we were deeply upset to lose this facility last year. The Club Exec guests now share the Premium Leisure lounge which is the family version of Club Exec. The lounge and staff are equally as good absolutely no issues there but it is open to children rather than adults only and this can be a huge problem at times for guests who do not want to spend their quality quiet time with children. So many people look for adults only so we really did not understand this change aside of course from the fact that it saves money. This hotel has always offered us a hotel within a hotel where we knew we were going to get peace and quiet. A place where we could enjoy our breakfast without the noise and chaos that can often come with a large breakfast room. A place where we enjoyed the cocktails and canap\u00e9s where we would sit and chat with other regulars before heading out to dinner and we always called in after dinner to have a nightcap before going to bed. The staff get to know you so quickly and know your preferences likes and dislikes and always work hard to ensure your stay with them is as perfect as it can be. Unfortunately now the staff are no longer able to do this. We now find ourselves trying to seek out a quiet spot where we can try and have a quiet relaxing breakfast or rushing it to get out of the lounge quicker than we really want to. They have also changed the times of the lounge too which does not work. The cocktails and canap\u00e9s used to be a sensible six till eight whereas now it is five till seven. The lounge also closes at 10 pm. None of these times consider the actual users of the lounge and for me merely consider costs. All this creates is an empty lounge until just before seven pm where it then gets really busy and puts extra pressure on the staff and guests are waiting longer to be served. Disgruntled guests and stressed staff who are doing their utmost to look after their guests. We have noticed that the hotel has lost a lot of its regulars and this is such a shame. do not get me wrong we have no issue with changes but when they are constantly against the guest and not for the guest we totally understand people voting with their feet and there are plenty more hotels available now to enable you to do this. There are a lot of other changes that are clearly cost cutting measures. As a Club executive guest you got transport to and from the airport now that has changed however there are cheaper rates available for other rooms that offer this facility which does not make sense. Other changes include differences in your room on the beach and around the hotel. Little touches that used to be in your room have now disappeared. Little touches that made this hotel stand head and shoulders above its competitors. As I said earlier I still love this hotel and I am hoping that the management realise and do something about the complaints that you constantly hear now and bring this hotel back to its former glory. For us we do not want to rush off the beach to try to fit in with unreasonable times. We do not want to have nowhere to go for a nightcap because we can not get back to our lounge for 10 pm. Yes there are other places but they are Al Faroz bar which is a little bit staid or Kouba Bar where it is full of ladies looking for business. We and other guests would be much happier retiring to our own lounge and paying for our drinks there instead of feeling we have nowhere to go other than your own room. I feel the management need to look at the changes as if they were staying at the hotel as a guest and actually on holiday rather than from a cost point of view.
