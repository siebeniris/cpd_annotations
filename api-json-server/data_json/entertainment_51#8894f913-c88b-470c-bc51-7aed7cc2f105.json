I had seen this hotels review 3 years ago when I first decided I wanted to go to Curacao. It appealed to me because of the location and the salt water infinity pool and beach in particular. I was not disappointed at all. Jenifer at the front desk welcomed me warmly and took the time to explain about amenities of the hotel gave me brochures and maps and offered to answer any questions. All of the staff were very friendly welcoming and helpful offering bottles of water nice to have when you are walking around though the tap water there is tasty and safe to drink. When I could not find the Curacao Museum on the map Deidre drew a map showing 2 possible routes for me and told me advantages and disadvantages of both routes. I had no problem finding the museum and felt safe going there on my own. Sometimes it is hard to know where and when it is safe for a single woman to walk alone. The room was clean the bed very comfortable and there was plenty of hot water for showers at any time of day. There was an adjustable thermostat for the air conditioning that gave the temperature in F and C It was set at a very comfortable temperature so I just left it there. WiFi worked without any problem. Also had a safe and refrigerator in the room. I enjoyed the beach nice and sandy though artificial and the salt water infinity pool which was clean and a comfortable temperature also man made. I also had to try the fresh water pool which was nice too. There were plenty of lounge chairs tables and towels available though this was not their busiest season. Nice not overwhelming music. Location in the Otrobanda was within easy walking distance of shops on both sides of the bay and 3 museums. I would go out for a couple of hours sightseeing and taking photos then go back to the hotel for a bit before heading out again. There are computers located on the 2nd floor where you can print out your boarding passes at not charge. A nice touch. It was a wonderful vacation everything I had dreamed about and the Renaissance Curacao Resort Casino I did not go to the casino though they issued me a 5 credit when I checked in was all I had hoped for and more.", "offset": [1961, 2173], "date": "2015-06-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "60e00733-ac31-4aca-a0b1-3a2adeafdaf2", "sentence": "Very good. staff very friendly great casino.", "offset": [11, 44], "date": "2015-06-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "2cfec231-f947-4713-83de-3a3e9bcc1cf2", "sentence": "Excellent Casino and fine shops.

I really enjoyed this hotel. it is got so many wonderful qualities and only a small handful of minor issues quirks that prevent me from giving it a 5star rating. First the location. let us be clear this hotel is not on the beach but do not let that deter you. The hotel enjoys a very convenient location near the cruise ship docks which means there are numerous shops mostly upscale and restaurants very nearby and in the historical Rif Fort which is practically joined to the Renaissance. there is even a movie theatre and a Starbucks across the street and another Starbucks inside the hotel along with all of the sites in the nearby town. it is a 5minute walk to the Queen Ema floating pedestrian bridge which leads to all the shops restaurants and sites on the Punda side of the harbor. I really enjoyed being close to all of these city sites as well as having my own beach oasis at the hotel more on that in a minute. The hotel does not offer an airport shuttle but the hotel is about a 20 minute cab ride from the airport which was approximately 2530 USD one way have cash ready the taxis do not accept credit cards. I had an ocean front ocean view king room on the 4th top floor and the extra cost was well worth it. I had a private balcony that had a panoramic view of the pool beach ocean cruise ship dock and even a small bit of the Rif Fort and entrance to the harbor it was lovely. My room was large and comfortable with a cushy bed sitting area work desk flat screen TV which I never turned on mini fridge and a safe large enough for a laptop and other valuables. The room was decorated tastefully in bright Caribbean colors which I loved. I especially enjoyed the large bathroom which was painted in a soft Caribbean blue. It had updated fixtures plenty of counter space upscale toiletries and soft towels. I also appreciated the soft bathrobes in the closet the clock with iPod dock next to the bed and the multiple power outlets on the work desk they have two prong square US outlets with 10V of electricity. The WiFi was easy to use and was fast I never had any issues with it and very much appreciated having it even at the pool. Note that although the hotel website says there is a fee for the WiFi there is not it is complimentary. All in all the room I had was extremely comfortable and I am very happy I chose the ocean view. Be aware that there are numerous rooms in this hotel that face inward and by that. I mean inward toward an enclosed ballroom or interior area it is an odd setup. So if you choose one of those cheaper rooms you will get NO view. I did not have the all inclusive plan and I did not eat in any of the restaurants. I ordered room service a couple times and the food was just fine nothing extremely amazing or inventive but fine nonetheless. It was also delivered on time with a smile. I also ordered some food and drinks from the polside restaurant bar. Yes all of it was a little pricey this is to expected in a name brand hotel chain on an island where many food items have to be imported. One thing that I loved was the full service Starbucks on the second floor above the front desk or just around the corner from the entrance to the pool. It was convenient to get my breakfast there every day or pop in to grab a Frapucino for the pool. Now about the pool. As I mentioned before this hotel is not on a beach but that does not mean there is not one. Because of the hotels location near the entrance to the harbor there is no beach nearby so they created one. On the second floor yes you read that right above the shops in front of the hotel they have created a beach for you. There is a large sand bottom saltwater pool and a smaller chlorine pool next to it. Both have infinity edges and both are bordered by a large sandy beach complete with palm trees shade palapas and many lounge chairs. It was actually quite awesome for me as I am not a big fan of crashing waves or creepy ocean critters. The saltwater pool is large enough that it does not really feel like a pool and the sand bottom was awesome. It was all actually quite brilliant and I loved having the restaurant bar right there with staff wandering around bringing you food and drinks you can charge them to your room. Soft beach towels are provided for guests so no worries there either. It was also interesting to watch the ships come and go through the entrance of the harbor almost like free entertainment while sitting in lounge chairs on the beach The staff at this hotel was also amazing. Every single person I dealt with seriously was kind and helpful. They all seemed to be genuinely happy for my business and made my stay very pleasant. I was also surprised that the front desk staff remembered my name every time I went down there even though this was my first time there. There are only a few minor things that prevent me from giving this property a 5star rating and they are not in my opinion deal breakers but here they are1. Whereas I am sure the casino brings in a lot of revenue for the hotel it was annoying. I disliked hearing the ding ding dinging of the slot machines when I was on the first or second floor and the smoke was disgusting. it is hard to sit anywhere in the lobby without smelling the smoke and that is the reason why I did not eat any meals in the restaurant on the first floor. One time when I was down in the lobby very early in the morning I noticed that some tall glass doors were closed between the casino and the lobby. this was lovely and it would be nice if they kept those doors closed all the time2. As others have mentioned the electricity does flicker now and then. It was not a problem for me but be aware it hapens3. Similarly the water in the shower was odd. There was barely any water pressure the three days I was there and the water was lukewarm at best. It would be nice if there was better pressure and warmer water4. Literally every time I returned to my room after being gone my electronic card key did not work. And it had NOT been near a credit card or cell phone to de magnitize it either. One time I had to go back down to the front desk 3 times until I got a key that worked. The other times I had to try the card up to 10 times before it worked. I am not sure what the problem is but this is an inconvenience and it should be fixed. 5. It would be really nice if there was some sort of a sundries shop inside or near the hotel. There were many times when I wanted to buy a bottle of water a small snack or some sunscreen and there was nowhere to buy them. There are plenty of stores nearby but they are tourist shops t shirts and souvenirs or upscale clothing and fashion shops nothing like a grocery or convenience store. Overall though these were minor issues and did not detract from my enjoyment at this hotel. It was a great property and I would highly recommend it to others visiting the island especially those who are interested in staying near town. If you had prefer a hotel that is on a large andor secluded beach or one that has access to diving andor snorkeling I had look elsewhere.", "offset": [4331, 4537], "date": "2015-07-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "4798793e-21ca-4508-8bbb-f5815e182053", "sentence": "Impressive hotel.

The room was colorful and a nice size. The balcony was great and very private to the neighbors. We really enjoyed the location of the resort which is close to downtown Wilemstad and attached to the Rif Fort shops. Despite the location not offering natural beaches we loved having the large man made beach with the infinity view of the sea. I am not a big ocean swimming fan but I enjoyed the ocean feel of the pool. The beach was not crowded and the palapas provided nice shade. The beach bar was enjoyable even at night.

We visited this beautiful resort fro Jan 29 Feb 5 2017. My husband and I were one couple of 4 on a weeks vacation. We had visited this island once before while on a cruise and just loved it. Our room was very clean and cleaning staff were very friendly and always willing to help. The resort location was convenient to shopping and so close to many other restaurants and shops. The planton bridge was very neat. We routinely had breakfast at Nautilus restaurant and it was very good. Offered a variety of breakfast choices. Look out for Juwela and Rushendly very friendly staff. Of course having Starbucks included was fabulous every day we would have a few coffees treats. The man made beach is very interesting and so nice everything you could ask from a beach but without the seaweed and little creatures fishies. The Infinity Beach Bar was also were we had most of lunches drinks. Bianca was so sweet and she always kept us well hydrated. Now for the dinners all dinners but one night the night we arrived we ate at Xquisit. What an experience from the first night we ate there until the last evening. We were so fortunate to have Giandra Gigi serve us. We can not say enough about her. She went out of her way in making sure we were happy in our meal choices. We asked for her for the entire week. On our last evening 2 days before my birthday. Gigi even had flowers on the table that she purchased and made a centrepiece very sweet. As you can see our experience was amazing. There could have been a couple of things that could be improved. There were no entertainment in the evening after 9 930 pm. other than the casino. It would have been nice to have some live entertainment. They did have some but it ended too early and we were only able to listen to them for a short while because we had dinner reservations. We did enjoy a late night cocktail up by the beach infinity beach bar. but it closed at 10 pm and we had to go down to the Blue Bar to get our drinks. This is were we met Piet. he always served us quickly and provided us some guidance on drinks. You can not miss him because he wears a vest with flags of the world pins that guests have given him.
