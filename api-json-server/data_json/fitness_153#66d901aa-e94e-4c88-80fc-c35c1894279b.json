First impressions of the hotel were good. The lobby was elegant and peaceful. First impressions of the room not so good. It was more like what you had get a mid to low cost western chain like Ramada. The carpet was worn and stained both in the room and in the hallway. The room was small by western standards but large for Japan as was the bath. The bedding was above average and we liked the kimono type robes. The room was warm so as other reviewers have noted we had the housekeeping open the locked windows to get some fresh cooler air inside. Mini fridge kettle and TV all worked fine. Shower had excellent pressure but the stall was a bit small. Toiletries and towels were high quality. A helpful clothes line was provided above the bath tub. It had the basic version of the fancy Japanese toilet seat. Several restaurant restrooms in Tokyo actually had nicer more advanced toilet seats than this room hadThe restaurants all looked mediocre and the prices were high so we never ate in the hotel. Instead we bought groceries at a nearby 7 11 and had breakfast in the room. Breakfast cost around 25 person in the hotelLocation was pretty good. Across the street from US embassy and very close to key government ministries. It was about 15 minutes walk to the Imperial Palace saw the cherry blossoms and about 5 or 10 minutes to the nearest subway station. Internet wifi worked well. It required us to repeat the login process frequently though. Housekeeping and other staff were nice and helpful in general so we are considering this for our review. The hotel is large and it can be hard to find your way around at times. Not something we enjoyed. So we found the best route in and out and stuck to it all week. The main negatives The carpet was stained and worn. There was also some mold in the bathroom stall. Rooms safe was medium size and too small to hold our little laptop. Also it was in one of the bedside drawers which took up important storage for a book etc. This seemed to be a renovated room but there was not an electrical outlet bedside. So if you are like most people and want to charge your phone bedside you can not. Who wants to stumble across the room in the dark if the phone rings or an urgent text arrives while you are slepingAlso during our second day we decided to use the gym as we usually do when we travel. I was completely shocked to find out at the gym that it would cost me 370 yen about currently 32 USD to use the gym for one person for one visit. And that is the LOWEST rate it might cost more to use the pool etc. I have stayed in dozens of hotels around the world some of them nicer than this and none ever charged a paying guest to use their fitness center if they had one. I still laugh out loud thinking about it that price is just insane. Does a massage come with that price. It beterThis hotel was nice in some respects but not in the 5star league. So I had be tempted to check alternatives if we ever return to Tokyo.", "offset": [2251, 2451], "date": "2015-04-15 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "c1e5a63b-fd7a-47df-a10f-66f35b505e6c", "sentence": "Very good.

After reading the reviews of this hotel I believe it does not get the credit it deserves. From the moment we arrived at the staff could not do enough for us nothing was too much to ask or trouble. The service of all the staff was above and beyond if only all hotels we stayed in adopted this approach. Our room was upgraded when we checked in the room and bathroom were both very spacious. The bed was huge. It had the usual amenities that come with a hotel room free water newspaper however they added a little extra touch of lady amenities which included a hair brush nail file hair band etc which were replenished daily these were really nice touches. We joined the one harmony membership so we has free access to the gym which we used regularly. I saw that they had signs to reserve machines but we went between 6 8am and no more than 5 people were in the gym at a time so I would not say it is necessary to reserve anything. We went during their Easter break and the hotel was quite busy but the gym never was thankfully. Our only critique of this hotel was the lack of air conditioning throughout the hotel our room had the old fashion thermostat which did not go below 14 degrees celsius and the gyms temperature we read as one day as 26 degrees celsius. I know the hotel is going through renovations so I think this problem will be rectified. On a whole we would highly recommend this hotel it is in a great location close to several tube stations and in walking in distance of Ropongi.", "offset": [1044, 1278], "date": "2016-04-14 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "0c2a8513-e9b3-4c2c-a9a1-a0e0bbb77c3d", "sentence": "Mad Men style meets Tokyo Service. it is literally like walking into a very upscale hotel on the set of Mad Men. In case you are wondering \u2026 that is a good thing extremely classic and picturesque. The first thing you will notice is the service. The staff at this hotel is incredible. You are literally treated like royalty the moment you step on the grounds. The concierge the bell staff the reception all go out of their way to accommodate you. My wife my daughter and I shared a double room. We requested an extra bed for an additional cost after hearing that the doubles were more like twins. However when we arrived we quickly found out that was not the case. This left my wife and I with a giant XL King sized bed the two doubles pushed together and my daughter with a double. This certainly speaks to the size of the room. Bathroom was a nice size with cool little features like a clothes line and a steam proof section of mirror. Of course like the majority of the bathrooms in Japan the toilet was equipped with the on seat bidet. I do not know why these are not common place in the US. Location wise the hotel is fairly ideal. it is in affluent Ropongi Hills. you will quickly see just how affluent when you see how many 100 K plus automobiles come to and drive past the hotel. You are a short walk from lots of restaurants and convenience grocery stores including a 7 11 which is important because it is one of the few ATMs that will allow you to get cash with an international card. Sen Oku Hakuko Kan Museum is right across the street. you are also about a 15 minute walk from the main Ropongi bar club strip. The hotels Highlander Bar is expensive but definitely worth having a least one drink \u2026 super cool. I was always too underdressed to go to the Orchid Bar but from what I saw nice. The gym is large with a decent array of equipment including the old school vibrating belt machine and a large white hypobaric chamber which I was explicitly told I could not photograph not sure why. There is also a luxury shopping mall in the basement of the hotel. My only complaint would be no iron in the room. We would have to call to the front desk to have one sent up. No matter how well you pack your clothes will have serious wrinkles after 13 hours in a suitcase so a readily available iron would be nice. That said I would certainly stay at the Okura again and would recommend it to others.", "offset": [1801, 1999], "date": "2016-07-21 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "c923de7a-b548-4d91-ad39-9fee917dd249", "sentence": "Somewhat tired but undergoing renovations. The Okura is a bit of an institution it still attracts overseas government officials and famous Japanese as it has done for many years but overall it is feeling dated nowadays. Yes it does feel more local and traditional than some of the international hotels in the area but the dated 60s feel decoration does not do much for me and the attraction remains the convenience if you work in the area and the usually competitive room rates versus the Hyat or Ritz Carlton etc. However that is not always a guarantee in recent times since hotel is undergoing a major much needed rebuild right now ahead of the Olympics and only the South Wing building remains open. Room availability is therefore significantly reduced meaning that they ramp up the prices if demand is high so check your rate and shop around since this place is nothing special. Rooms are ok but have not changed much in the 15 years or so I have being staying here. Having to pay extra to use the gym is always an annoyance too I can not think of any other hotel I have stayed at in recent years that still pulls that one. Overall if you like the more traditional feel are working close by or can get a decent rate then it is worth a stay but do take a look around as there are other decent more modern options in the vicinity.", "offset": [971, 1127], "date": "2016-08-19 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "d8bf4326-a3b4-46b1-a1f8-4f1645b5b470", "sentence": "I love the hotel but did not like a couple of things. I stayed Hotel Okura in Ausgut for a five nights for vacation in Tokyo. Stayed in the South New Tower as the Main Tower is under reconstruction in time for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 although many of my friends are sad that the beautiful and historical main tower was demolished and is replaced by moden but probably boring building. Being one of the most celebrated hotels in Tokyo with rich history usually it costs a bit more than competing hotels 9for me but this time the deal was reasonable. Overall I love the hotel Decor is fantastic with Japanese taste but not too much. The service was fantastic although this is true for almost all excellent hotels in Japan. The location is in the center of Tokyo convenient to go to Akasaka Ropongi Ginza Marunouchi Otemachi area but a bit far if you want to go to Shinju or Shibuya area. Either case the area ia surprisingly quiet for the central location which I love a lot. One thing I really really hate which is why I give 4 stars intead of five is that they charge 20 for using the gym pool just because I booked the hotel not directly from them but through some third party site because the room I wanted was sold out on Okuras website. And the price was not that different. This is really disappointing for a hotel already on the very expensive side. The second disappointing thing was thet they had the dress code at their bar. I was not aloed to enter because I was wearing flipflops. Anyway usual pros and cons Pros1. Fantastic building. Fantastic decor. The decoration in the room is also very good. You can really feel that the hotel is rich with history and you are really staying at once of the great hotels in Tokyo2. The room was spacious for a hotel in the middle of Tokyo3. Service of the staff is outstanding. Very nice helpful and knowledgleable in the Japanese way4. Free wifi in the lobby and the rom5. Great sushi restaurant in the building of course expensive6. In the middle of Tokyo and convenient to go to many nice neighborhoods but still quiet. Cons1. Charged 20. for using the gym swimming pool If you did not book through their wensite. This is unacceptable for me2. Dress code to enter bars and propbably restaurants. Overall if they did not have the stupid policy of charging for using the gym pool this would have been one of my favourite hotels in the world.
