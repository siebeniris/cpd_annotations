The OrdealOur 10 hour car trip from Atlanta to DC turned into a 14 hour ordeal when our car which had been repaired twice stopped working properly hours into the drive. With the Greenville South Carolina Airport up ahead we came up with the idea to park our car and rent one for the remainder of the trip. From a Subway we called Budget Car Rental. The agents accent was so heavy I could barely understand him. To be clear I made sure to repeat spell out words. We put Greenville SPC into our iPhones GPS and headed out. We arrived at our destination only to find out it was the wrong airport. Apparently this happens all the time as they have printed directions to the correct airport all ready. Arriving at the right airport there was NO reservation and they were not taking walk ins. It turned out the phone agent booked us for Greensboro NOT Greenville. Thank goodness Budget Agent Kim was able to arrange a car for us. Problems Solved. On Our Way. Thus we arrived at the Hyat Regency Bethesda after midnight exhausted and spent. Lucky for us the sweet Yasmen the Front Desk Clerk was there to greet us. After hearing about our ordeal Yasmen took pity on us and generously offered to provide us with a daily Diamond Level Breakfast. Her lovely gesture took the chill out of the air and made us feel warm and welcomed. By going above and beyond Yasmen turned our day around starting our stay at the Hyat Regency Bethesda on a friendly and positive note.", "offset": [1157, 1285], "date": "2015-04-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "d7ce72dd-38f7-46ca-a02c-33c6db68ac97", "sentence": "Recent trip to md.

Everything you could ever want to eat and drink can be found within just a few blocks of this hotel right on the Red Line in the heart of Bethesda. If you are lucky Miriam will check you in with that great smile and then you can stop at the bar for a quick drink before heading up in the classic Hyat glass elevator to your spacious room. We like the terrace and balcony rooms so we can do yoga in the mornings and check out the sky before hitting the wonderful beds. After a day of meetings we walk to one of our two favorites the amazing Cesco or Pines of Rome for Italian fare although there are restaurants serving every kind of food imaginable within a few blocks. Afterwards we take a stroll to listen to street musicians who are incredibly talented maybe head into Barnes Noble for a look see and then have a drink at one of the outdoor patio restaurants. there is a cushy modern movie theater where you can also grab a nibble and a drink cocktails. and see the lastest showing. The Bethesda Hyat puts you in the middle of so much to do after a long days work that you will forget that bureaucratic nudge from earlier in the day and enjoy a relaxing night.

I have stayed at this hotel and left my newly purchased White Noise Bluetoth Capable speaker in the safety deposit box. I did not notice it until after a week and I called the hotel right away. The first person who received my call Stella was not very helpful. Rather than conveying the message herself she insisted that I call again as she claimed that she does not have access to the \u201c Lost and Found section \u201d. The next time I called I asked to be connected to the Lost and Found Department right away. My item was handled by Neil Suan right away. At the same time I filled in a form at ileftmystuf and my case was handled most efficiently. Mr Suan followed through my item and was in contact with me via email throughout the process up until I received the item back in Toronto. I used to work in a 5Star Hotel as a guest relations officer and have a pretty good idea on what a good service is akin to how Mr Suan had dealt with the situation. The item I nearly lost is not available in Toronto for purchase and to have it back is certainly appreciated \u2013 for this I am very thankful. On another note I find Hyat Regency Bethesda a very nice hotel. I was part of a tour group and we always had breakfast at the lobby. The breakfast has a good selection of mini quiches boiled eggs oatmeal coffee tea fruit and various pastries and yogurt. The servers were all very helpful. Our room was clean regularly.
