The grounds are meticulously maintained the pool and ocean view are picture perfect and the rooms are spacious. Everything I would expect of a Ritz property. However the most amazing thing about my trip was the way they helped out with my lost luggage. I arrived with literally nothing but the clothes on my back. Deidre who checked us in was amazing and after checking us in took me to the hotel boutique where the resort provided me with clothing for a reception I needed to attend that evening. That was above and beyond anything I would have expected. The hotel also provided me with a toiletry kit which is pretty much expected from any place but housekeeping then came to my room with 4 different types of deodorant for me to choose from so they could be sure I was satisfied. Again above and beyond. They then called several times to check that I had what I needed until my bag arrived. Amazing amazing amazing customer service.

While there are many perks for traveling to the Virgin Islands in the off season you take the good with the bad. Staff is typically down in Aug Sept and the island people are not very eager to move at your fast or faster pace. Right off the bat it took over an hour for us to check in. We did arrive on a Saturday and it was a little busy compared to other days but after being on a plane and a car ride to get there I just wanted to get to my room. The check in lobby is open air and the view off the balcony is AMAZING but there is no air conditioning and it was hot. We were offered a place to sit and wait as well as a iced tea with or without rum while we waited our turn. HINT wait in the spa if it is busy. Each check in process is unique to the guest and while I appreciate the details getting to our room to way to long. We were not told until a week or so before arrival that the infinity pool was closed for renovation but had full use of the Ritz residence next store. Shuttles ran all day to get you over quickly but they were not always readily available. I did not miss the pool as much as I thought b c the beach loungers and rafts were abundant on the beach. We ate at almost every place at the resort but highly recommend venturing off the resort to nearby Secret Harbor or Red Hook. Out of all of the meals we ate while at the resort I would definitely say the Sea to Sail meal was the best. The literally bring the days catch right off the boat and up to the restaurant. As you expect the resort pricing is crazy but the food was very good. Something always seemed to be open for lunch between the 2 restaurants by each pool but service was a low average at best. Despite the service most every staff person we met was very courteous and eager to point you in any direction you wanted to go even if they could not immediately help what you needed at the time. The room as nice and spacious upgrade due to pool being out and a lovely ocean front view. Highly recommend booking an excursion through the hotel to visit the BVIs or St John or any other activity.

We have found that the level of service at this Ritz property is not up to Ritz standards not even close. Ritz keeps a comprehensive database on their customers so they know how to attend to them. The concept they push is that if you have to ask it is not service. Currently at this property you have to ask multiple times. Our safe did not work. It had a battery issue. We called Wednesday morning asking they replace the battery. Nothing happened. We called Wednesday evening asking they replace the battery. 30 minutes later someone shows up and then has to leave to get a battery because he did not bring one even though we reported the error. At the same time they elected to fix a light in our hallway that was broken. When we returned from dinner the light was working and hanging from the ceiling. Nice touch. Today we left at 730 am to go on an all day boat charter. We returned this evening to find that neither our room nor our kids room had been cleaned. I called the concierge to get housekeeping but instead had the phone answered by in room dining. I ended up talking to the in room dining manager and he was simply no help. I called and requested to speak to a manager and then got fed up and walked to the lobby to see him in person. He was in a meeting. He did come to my room shortly afterwards and once again promised to make things right. I told him that I was not looking for any special treatment. I simply wanted the service I expect from a Ritz property. I explained that thus far I have received much better service at many Mariot Courtyards. I am not looking for freebies I am not looking for discounts I do not mind paying for service. that is why I have been a Ritz customer for years. However at this property that service is not remotely close to what we have become accustomed to at Ritz Properties. The staff is poorly trained. They do not have enough personnel working in some roles to handle guest volumes. The property is under construction so key facilities such as the elevators are not working. Ritz Carlton should have never opened this property in the condition it is in and they should have been much more extensive in the training of their staff. I can site a myriad of small examples as well but suffice it to say this property is not close to Ritz standards and every guest we have talked with agrees. They will lose business at this property and potentially lose long term Ritz customers like myself thanks to this experience. I plan these Christmas trips for my family and try to make them special.

Construction is going on all over the property and they expect their guests to tolerate the noise. They have hired someone to play music all day long at the old pool and beach to try to cover up the noise but they have to keep the volume too high for some of the guests comfort to accomplish that feat. We have found that the level of service at this Ritz property is not up to Ritz standards not even close. Ritz keeps a comprehensive database on their customers so they know how to attend to them. The concept they push is that if you have to ask it is not service. Currently at this property you have to ask multiple times. Our safe did not work. It had a battery issue. We called Wednesday morning asking they replace the battery. Nothing happened. We called Wednesday evening asking they replace the battery. 30 minutes later someone shows up and then has to leave to get a battery because he did not bring one even though we reported the error. At the same time they elected to fix a light in our hallway that was broken. When we returned from dinner the light was working and hanging from the ceiling. Nice touch. Today we left at 730 am to go on an all day boat charter. We returned this evening to find that neither our room nor our kids room had been cleaned. I called the concierge to get housekeeping but instead had the phone answered by in room dining. I ended up talking to the in room dining manager and he was simply no help. I called and requested to speak to a manager and then got fed up and walked to the lobby to see him in person. He was in a meeting. He did come to my room shortly afterwards and once again promised to make things right. I told him that I was not looking for any special treatment. I simply wanted the service I expect from a Ritz property. I explained that thus far I have received much better service at many Mariot Courtyards. I am not looking for freebies I am not looking for discounts I do not mind paying for service. that is why I have been a Ritz customer for years. However at this property that service is not remotely close to what we have become accustomed to at Ritz Properties. The staff is poorly trained. They do not have enough personnel working in some roles to handle guest volumes. The property is under construction so key facilities such as the elevators are not working. Ritz Carlton should have never opened this property in the condition it is in and they should have been much more extensive in the training of their staff. I can site a myriad of small examples as well but suffice it to say this property is not close to Ritz standards and every guest we have talked with agrees. They will lose business at this property and potentially lose long term Ritz customers like myself thanks to this experience. I plan these Christmas trips for my family and try to make them special. This year is a disappointment thanks to a sub standard hotel. Ritz promotes their properties by asking Let us stay with you. I can promise this experience will indeed stay with me and it will not be a positive memory.", "offset": [1668, 1793], "date": "2019-12-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "04d903d4-4ad3-467f-9c4f-d81bd624b5bb", "sentence": "Not a lot good to say unfortunately. Good news. I was only there for one night. The property is under significant construction. I understand given the storms but this should have been made clear up front. The beach has seaweed all over it and has to be cleaned daily but certainly not a pristine beach. The prices for food etc are ungodly. Breakfast for two people with coffee Oatmeal water and two poached eggs on avocado toast was 65. Lunch we had to send back the Cerveche not even close to edible tasted like their was dish washing liquid on it or some other chemical. I have stayed at Ritz properties in the past.

I really do not like giving average or negative reviews especially in this case because the staff is super kind. I just feel like the hotel needs to be aware of some things. First of all we had a very welcoming greeting when we arrived. We were brought drinks immediately upon our arrival while we checked in. After check in they gave us an additional. It was a sweet gesture to start our stay off right. During check in we were told that we would be given a 200 resort credit per night because the hotel still is not completely finished. This was a great surprise and a very kind gesture. We were in Puerto Rico staying at the St Regis over Christmas before we came here. it is hard to not compare the two. We read TripAdvisor reviews on this hotel and our expectations were not very high so being told we would be credited was a very nice surprise. We arrived at our room and while it was okay it was not anything fancy. Much smaller than the room we stayed in at the St Regis. Beds were comfortable and we had a deck which was nice. Although the Ocean View room we had was more of a view of the construction of the pool. We did not spend time out there since it was mainly construction. As for the shower in the bathroom it seems odd that it is frosted glass that you can see into the main room. So you can see someone showering or at least the shadow of them. There was also light from the shower so if others are still sleeping in your room its not dark. Being a Ritz I would have expected better. The first night we ate at Coconut Cove. Nakita was our server and she was very friendly. My husband ordered a seafood pasta with Lobster mussels clams and shrimp. My daughter and I had the chicken pasta. The chicken pasta was absolutely delicious both my daughter and I loved it. As for the seafood pasta there was no lobster and barely any mussels or clams. It was mainly shrimp. When my husband questioned it the manager asked the chef and he said he was out of lobster. That is fine but they should have told us that because it was 14 more for the lobster. They offered to take it off our bill but my husband said no it was still good and since he ate it he suggested to just charge him like it was a chicken pasta which they did. I am only pointing this out because of what happens a few days later which I will talk about below. The guys and gals working the pool were super friendly and helped get your chairs set up. Christmas is a busy time but we never had issues finding chairs. There were plenty. Lunch at the pool took over an hour to receive which seemed like a long time so just order before you are too hungry. Most restaurants require reservations before you arrive because when we got there they were all booked for dinners. The breakfast buffet restaurant near the pool was good although you could tell the wait staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The second day we ate here there was quite a wait. We told them we would be waiting outside and they said they would come out and let us know when our table was ready. As we saw people behind us in line getting seated my daughter went up and questioned and the lady was not very kind and said we have been calling your name for awhile. My daughter quickly reminded her that we told her we were waiting outside since there was no room to wait inside and that she agreed to come out to tell us when our table was ready. They sat us next. New Years Eve lunch we decided to eat at Coconut Cove again because we wanted the chicken pasta. Nakita was our waitress again and we were happy to see her. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She asked what kind of cheese and he said swiss. She came by our table shortly later and my husband questioned if saw that it said bacon on the cheeseburger. She said he was accurate and there would be bacon. So out comes his cheeseburger and my husband jokingly said this is the orangest swiss I have ever seen. Nakita felt bad and said she would take it back and fix it immediately. My husband told her no it is not a big deal he likes cheddar too. She leaves and my husband realizes there is no bacon. So when she comes back he tells her and you can tell she is completely embarrassed. She brings the bacon. My husband then started eating the burger and after a few bites he realizes there is something in his burger. Sure enough it was the wax paper that divides the cheese. He calls Nakita over and she looked mortified. She asked to put it on a plate to show the chef. My husband was done eating at this point. When our bill was brought to us we thought for sure they would take his meal off especially since my husband did not have them take off the pasta off the first night like they asked. We thought it was only fair since he had wax paper in his burger that he be comped that. So he scratched off that part of the bill and did a new total. When we received our final bill we saw that they did make the adjustment on their end which was good however it should have never been on the bill in the first place. That night we went out to eat in town. When we came home there was a bottle of champagne and a very kind note from Nakita. That was great customer service and they definitely tried to right their wrong. We were thankful for that even though we do not drink champagne. On our last morning there we had to get up early for our taxi and when I went to shower I realized the staff that serviced our rooms forgot to leave us any fresh towels. They took all of our old towels during turndown service but forgot to leave new towels so we did not even have hand towels. It was about 7 am and I called housekeeping and they never answered I called the front desk concierge and they never answered. Since we all needed to be up and showered it was quite frustrating no one answered their phones. I had to call the bell desk to ask for towels. They said they would be right up. They arrived at 830am. Luckily our flight was delayed by several hours so it was okay it took them so long for the towels to arrive. I do feel there should always be someone available answering phones for guests though. We were eaten alive by the sand flies so be sure to use the Off they have for you near the pool. My daughter stopped counting at 100 bites on her body. Red bumps welts that were super itchy. Ok back to the good. The water is beautiful there is coral and rocks in the water but we still got in and my son and husband did some snorkeling. That was fun for them. The sand is super soft and when you are not looking at the pool construction the view is stunning. I loved looking out to St John. I would return. I just hope they get some of these kinks worked out soon especially when I had to use more than the usual points for our stay for a hotel that was not quite ready. Once the family pool is completed it will be great.", "offset": [3470, 3566], "date": "2020-01-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "a9d08e0d-aa95-4bbe-9634-1ea089893c00", "sentence": "There was an horrible doubling problem on two credit cards and a lost credit to someone else.

We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas staying in an oceanfront queen bedroom. With Bon Voy Ambassador status and previous Ritz stays my expectations were high but tempered by recent reviews and understanding that they are still recuperating from the hurricanes. However we were extremely disappointed with the consistency of service offered. We take this special trip every other year and were extremely disappointed with our stay. From the beginning we were not able to reach anyone at the hotel via phone or email to answer questions related to the reservation. One time that I did talk to someone it took over an hour on the phone to attempt to change our room type. After leaving several messages and emails for a concierge no one ever responded. Eventually our Mariot Ambassador was able to confirm everything for us before we arrived. While the check in process was simple through the ap and the welcome lovely after several calls to the front desk we were told that we would need to pay an additional 350 night for access to the Club Lounge regardless of the lifetime status. We made several requests at the concierge desk the pool deck and over the phone to reserve a pool cabana and never received any response. Half of the time when we would call for reservations or room service no one would answer the phone at all. While lounging at the beach the service was spotty and inconsistent at best. There was an issue with the Sails kitchen which prompted a very limited menu for lunch and food being prepared next to the pool beach on grills under a tent. I was not expecting just one restaurant on property to be available for meals. Our room was on the 5th floor of building E and with only one elevator on the other side of the building I would not recommend this hotel for anyone with mobility issues. There are stairs everywhere throughout the main building to and from the pool and the beach etc. The construction of the family pool was very disruptive. It was visible from every room and the hotel attempted to disguise with music that started early each morning on the pool deck with the same playlist each day. The construction definitely cuts into the pool deck and you need to reserve your pool loungers early in the morning if you want a place to sit. At the beach you need to reserve a chair early in the morning if you want to sit in the front row. The attendants were friendly but not helpful even with tips. There just did not seem to be any focus on the customer experience at this resort. A couple of staff members were very friendly Lisa from in room dining was a delight each morning but not able to hold the rest of the resort to the same standards.", "offset": [1163, 1300], "date": "2020-01-29", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "f19f09f5-ff43-4f37-a964-298fcc2bd337", "sentence": "Massage plus amenities minus.

Our room was not cleaned completely and no ice was available on the hall or anywhere near. Had to call several times for pick up service as well as room service.
