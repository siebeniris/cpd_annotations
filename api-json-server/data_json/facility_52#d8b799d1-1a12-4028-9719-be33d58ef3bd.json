I am writing this review as a warning for Kimpton loyalists like myself because I wish I had read an honest review of this property before choosing this particular Kimpton in DC. I love the brand and am usually happy with their unique buildings and cool design choices. but this hotel does not meet the usual standard at all. BUT I do want to say upfront there is a happy ending to my review thanks to the exceptional customer service provided by staff there particularly the manager Sara. She was great. When I first arrived I was surprised how small the hotel lobby is with no real restaurant or bar contrary to advertising. I was immediately put off by the very dated red sparkle floor tiles and niteclub vibe they were going for and then stepped into an elevator with a damaged floor and a moldy smell. The hallways were the same a musty smell and dark stuffy feel. Then I walked into my Exec King room where I notice 1 the furniture is old and beat up frayed couch nicks and dents in all the tables nightstands etc. 2 the bathroom is TINY with no counter at all motel size with a door that had water damage and had been repainted MANY times did not even want to touch it 3 a 32 old TV not even flatscren. which looked like an ipad relative to the room and distance from the bed AND they have NO TV smart services like movies or hotel functions just a few channels from DirectTV. not ok with me 4 most rooms have a less than great view of the back of the hotel not vital. but you should be aware of this i kept my blinds down the whole time 5. the room is huge but there is just lots of unused empty space with no chairs table or anything useful placed in thereI was depressed thinking of staying there three nights one night i could have survived. so I called Kimptons main number online they connected me to guest services who were very nice and told me to talk to the property manager on duty to request they find me a room at another Kimpton property nearby. I did this and Sara the manager tried to help but said all the rooms elsewhere were booked up for my nights. BUT she then offered me a prototype renovated room they had which was FANTASTIC. The renovation will be fabulous wood floors dining table BIG TV still no services FYI cocktail bar setup HUGE glass walled bathroom with gorgeous freestanding tub huge shower counterspace for 2 plush couch etc etc amazing. My stay from that point on was all good and I applaud them for managing my situation so well. And the little bar they have is really only to service guests and for breakfast wine hour NOT a place to hang out at night or bring people to and they have no restaurant while other properties do.
