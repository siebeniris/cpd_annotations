I have a lot of allergies and dietary restrictions. I called weeks ahead of our stay here to notify them of that. I requested a defeathered room and refrigerator. We arrived yesterday November 6th just before noon fully expecting to put our luggage in storage so that we could go shopping and have lunch. There was a good bit of confusion over a new system they were using but they went ahead and checked us into a room. I asked 3 times about the room being defeathered and the refrigerator each time I was told that it was taken care of. Upon getting to the room I found that all of the bedding had feathers. We went back to the lobby waited in line again trying to resolve this. We were told they would get everything taken care of and would move our luggage for us freeing us to leave the hotel for lunch and shopping. We returned four hours later only to find it still has not been taken care of. We waited another 30 minutes. The girl we were now working with at the front desk tried to blame it on us for trying to check in early. We were never told the checking in early was a problem and also watched many folks checking in during our long chaotic wait. After finally getting checked into our new room we once again had to request the refrigerator. This morning November 7th I stop by the desk to speak to management. She offered 2 free breakfasts which I could not take advantage of because of my dietary restrictions is anyone listening here. Finally she offered 25 off our second nights stay since that was coming out of our pocket instead of the conference sponsor. My last request before walking away from the desk was some silverware to use to eat the food I had purchased and had up in the room. She said she would have several sets sent up. Hours later I had to call and request the silverware again. we have stayed here before and enjoyed it.

My guest room had 3 features that I find particularly annoying in hotel rooms. 1. I hate showers in which the controls can not be reached except from under the water when it is turned on. This is only problematic when turning on the shower but that is kind of a major function of a shower is not it. 2. I hate trays of snacks in a room for billing on consumption that can not be put in a drawer or closet. In this case the tray was plugged in apparently to sensors. Not willing to risk getting charged for anything I put a pillow case over the whole thing. 3. If there is a fridge in a room a guest ought to be able to use it. In this case again beverages to be billed on consumption filled the fridge with sensors so it was not available for guest use. One other thing to note was that the HVAC in the room was loud enough to create troublesome background noise on a conference call I needed to take from the room. It blocked any outside noise and served as white noise otherwise but it was unusually loud. On the other hand the room had one of best hairdryers I have ever seen in a hotel bathroom and the furnishings were certainly comfortable.

My wife and I booked the Madison pretty last minute for July the 4th weekend as the prices here were inexplicably low compared to everywhere else that was comparable. She is an Amex Platinum cardholder so we booked with that through Amex Travel which meant we received a 100 Hotel Credit and free upgrade if available. My wife also used the Amex Platinum to get Hilton Gold status which may have factored in. Anyway sure enough we got an upgrade to the Executive level or whatever they call it. In reality the room itself was exactly the same as a normal room as far as I could tell except that it was on one of the highest floors but across from another tall building so not a great view. The real advantage of getting upgraded however is that everyone on that level gets complimentary lounge access which for us meant free breakfast every morning which was excellent and snacks in the evening. However apparently DC regulations do not allow them to offer free alcoholic drinks in the lounges. For the 100 Hotel Credit we were disappointed it was not as useful as we had hoped. It was valid for pretty much everything except the restaurant and bar. If we had not had breakfast included I think we could have spent it on the fancy lounge breakfast but we ended up just spending it on 9 canned beers from the little coffee shop marketplace which was not great value. It was also valid on the self serve wine machine kinda cool in the lounge but we found this to be way over priced at 14 for a glass of wine. The location was great within a third of a mile of a station for any of the metro lines and walking distance or certainly a quick Lyft or scooter ride to most of DCAl in all we had a great stay the hotel felt luxurious and new the staff was helpful and it felt like a steal considering it was well cheaper than even any of the nearby Hampton Inns or Hilton Garden Inns.", "offset": [523, 717], "date": "2019-07-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "2b2835e7-03af-4ad9-9690-89318be46d9e", "sentence": "Family vacation.
