I received an email where I can check in express but end up only 1 room can be checked in. Even I gave an authorized for my friend to check in. They still end up make him wait for me to arrive for him to checked in. I was in the line for 30mins waiting for check in for the rest of the 2 rooms. The process of checking in took about 30mins so is mean I was at the front desk for 1hour. 3 rooms in 3 different building so it was inconvenient for us. The room in bayview my friends said is nice but the one in harbor town. They told me is old and the king bed is small not like the king bed size and also is old and dirty. With my room at water front is so dirty. You can see dust flying on the air. The bed is too old and soft to the point it hurt my back. Honestly their floor is very dirty or else I will rather sleep on the floor then the bed. Bad pillows maybe is so old so the pillows does n\u2019t give any support. When the house keeper clean my room. Honestly nothing is really clean beside she made my bed. Sugar I accidentally drop on the table it still there when I got back. The room does not have a fan where they can suck the small out. So when someone have to use option 2 in the restroom the smell can stay there for long and when around the room. Got the room smell real bad. The hall way is old dirty and smell like someone is smoking marijuana all the time. When I booked the hotel I ask them beside the adults pool do they have a poor available for kids. They told me yes. But when I got there. The family pool was n\u2019t open. They told me the pool wo n\u2019t open till after Memorial Day. Then why are they telling me is available. All the kids ca n\u2019t swim so we decided to play at the game room. Not many option there and also the game machine kept on breaking. Buffet foods is ok only honestly. I do n\u2019t think is worth 50 at all. I talked to their front desk about they pool. All they can said to me is \u201c I ca n\u2019t do nothing about it just call customer service \u201d. omg is that mean \u201c suck it up because we \u2019re not going to do anything for you. Everyone go somewhere else you will get better room and better service and at least your kids will get to swim in a better pool too.

This made me very happy. I guess ventilation is better than the usual PA casinos we visit. The reason for giving 5 circles is The temperature of pool water. It states it is heated but was chilly. We wanted to experience the pool and go relax but the water but too darn cold. It is the northeast we like warm pool water when swimming indoors. The other reason for not giving 5 circles is the price of breakfast at Coastal. The average price is 20 p. This was crazy. We ordered bacon eggs tea and pancakes each. The bill came to over 50 thank goodness we did nt have our kids or breakfast bill would have been over 100 ugh ridiculousHarahs shines with their selection of slot machines. It was exciting to see so many options. The slots do not pay out. Our luck was not good but it seemed like no one around us was winning. I will never understand why the slots are so stingy. I played them all pennies nickels quarters dollars even 50 just uneventful. Note to Harahs the hotel is very nice but the food prices need to come down a bit. We are already gambling a small fortune the last thing we need to do is spend another fortune on meals.

We were given a room on the fourth floor of the Bay tower. It was an upgraded room and yet when the kitchen opened the room smelled like shrimp and garlic because it was right above the air vent from the kitchen. Well we were waiting in a 2hour line at the buffet for Thanksgiving dinner they moved us to the 10th floor that looked like there was some kind of wine stain or somethinh bad thing happened on the wall not very upscale or classy especially since I paid for the upgrade. The front desk was attentive but not very nice or courteous about the whole thing. The buffet although the food good dirty serving dishes were not promptly refilled serving counters not wiped clean. I know it was busy but they expected it and for 40 a person it should have been presented and looked a little nicer. I used to go years ago and I do not think I will be coming back anytime soon. The pool seen dirty and worn even though it recently went through a renovation. It was also very cold in the solarium and the pool water was also on the cold side not very comfortable at all.", "offset": [1005, 1116], "date": "2020-01-07", "cpt": "7", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 78, "uid": "7fe2771f-43c0-4c0d-be81-85f051f8d48e", "sentence": "Restaurants offer plenty of choices and ranges do not have to leave the resort if you do not want to. Easy trip up to centrally located Bayview Tower. Starbucks and the pool are flanking the hallway and bars and smoke are far enough away so to not be an annoyance.
