It took over 2 hours to get WiFi connected with the assistance of their technical support people and it was still very slow and sporadic after that and 2 you can hear everything going on in the hallway as well as other rooms in the vicinity of your room so it is not a quiet hotel.

We were not sure if we chose a good location when we booked but once we went to New Orleans and were there for a week having stayed part of the week on Bourbon St also we know we chose the best hotel for many reasons. First It is on the river has a great view and does not have other big buildings blocking your waterfront view. It is located just steps away from the waterfront parkIt is close enough to walk to everything. The French Quarter Financial district etc. but far enough away to be out of the chaos of the French Quarter. The rooms were very spacious. The beds comfy and the air conditioning great. The rooms were very clean. They could stand to be updated a bit but in general on par with most other hotels in this class. Staff very friendly. Concierge extremely helpful and knowledgeable.

This hotel has recently undergone a management change and it shows. Incompetence reigns at every customer service level. The valet is understaffed unhelpful and rude. It took forever to get someone to take my vehicle because they had ONE employee working valet at 120 on Saturday. and then he chased me down because I stole a bellmans cart to transport my luggage because no one offered to take it for me. In doing so he left my car unattended and running in the middle of the street. Check in was a comedy of errors. They did not have the room ready for hours failed to call me as promised. when it was ready and then gave me the key to someone elses room who I barged in on unannounced. The staff could not tell me where their ATM is where the gift shop is etc. It was like they all had been bused in that morning from another hotel. The gift shop turned out to be an absolute joke. They had a candy bar a box of staples and a plastic comb. No medicine. No personal care items. God forbid you wake up with a headache or need toothpaste you will have to walk across four lanes of heavy traffic on Canal to buy it from an overpriced bodega where a six pack of Tylenol runs 99. Check out was also a blast I have at least 3 different 100 charges pending on my card with no explanation for what they represent. I have been calling trying to get an answer for two days.

Unfortunately we did not really love the view and when we said that we would wait for another one Brice had it ready as soon when we got back from the best breakfast spot ever The Ruby Slipper Cafe 5 min walk. The beds were so comfortable and our view was gorgeous. When we headed out that night to hit Burbon street 7min walk we asked Param about a late check out and she made sure we had enough time to sleep in. Everyone was so friendly. As my mother and I did our tourist thing we actually saw Param again outside of the hotel. We spoke and all laughed at the running into each other. She was just as friendly then as she was behind the check in desk. And I can not forget the valet Don. He was so friendly and funny.

So I tried 4 times it never locked so I called the desk and said what was going on and she said give em 10 15 mins maintenance should be up to the room. So it was a wait because I was not gon na leave my personal belongings and valuables in a unsecured room. Maintenance came up and fixed the problem it took about 20 mins. So I left to enjoy New Orleans had a blast. Next morning got dressed headed out and the same problem occurred lock not working so I called downstairs again reported the same problem. Another 15 min wait for maintenance so more of my time wasted. mind you this is not a huge problem for the hotel but a huge problem for me. I thought management should have reached out to me but they did not. And then that second call I asked about the pool that is when I learned the pool was under construction.

We luckily had a river view room and decided to order some romservice desserts and a bottle of wine to watch from there. They told us our food would arrive in an hour. 90 minutes later we still did not have our food and were advised they had changed the delivery timeframe but nobody had ever notified us. During that time they had run out of one of the desserts ordered and rather than contact us to ask what we had prefer they swapped it out for another dessert on the menu which they told us was more expensive it was not and charged us for the dessert we had not ordered.

The service is fantastic from the front desk concierge and especially the restaurant. Here is just one example of the concierge. I wanted a bottle of pino and a carrot cake delivered to my room. I sent one email with the request BEFORE my arrival. I did not have to follow up on the request at all and within 10 minutes of checking in and arriving in my room the wine and cake were delivered. I have done this at other hotels and I have never had this level of responsive service so quickly without follow up ever. The second fantastic experience was in the restaurant. My server Jinky was outstanding. She went above and beyond for me to ensure that my needs were met. Even though the restaurant was out of the chicken apple sausage Jinky made certain that I would have a suitable substitute.
