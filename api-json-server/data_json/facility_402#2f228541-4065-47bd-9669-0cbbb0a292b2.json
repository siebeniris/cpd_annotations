When we checked in the man at reception asked for a my i d and card standard check in he then proceeded to tell me there was going to be a bond of 150 which I was unaware of when I booked. He also did not tell me when the bond would be refunded or why they were taking it. A week later I received the refund for the bond. When we arrived at our level all we could smell was Indian food not sure if all levels had this problem but it was very unsettling. Room layout was nice and has a decent sized bathroom. We booked a queen bed and ended up with 2 singles it did not bother us enough to call reception as it was NYE and we were only staying one night. Beds were extremely uncomfortable my friend ended up with knots all in her back the next morning. Would only really recommend as a last minute option which it was for us and if you are not going to be in the room much.

The size of room was satisfactory and the bathroom was tired but clean. The bed however was extremely hard. I like the bed to be firm but this was as if I was sleeping on a wooden plank. I wonk up the next morning with excruciating back pain and neck pain from the flat pillows. I asked at reception to switch rooms and they told me that all beds were the same so there would be no point switching. After several attempts I got reception to have a doner put in my room that maybe I could lie on like a mattress topper. When I returned from work that evening the doner provided was 2 blankets and a white sheet. The thought of sleeping on that bed again was too much and I checked out early nobody asked why or if they could do anything to help. I checked into a hotel down the road where the bed was much more comfortable and the staff upgraded me to a suite when I explained what had happened here.

We definitely regret not paying a little bit extra to stay elsewhere in Melbourne. Mould in the bathroom along the tiles and glass dated decor rude staff at reception and curtains that do not close due to being broken does not quite allow for a sleep in. The bedding was just a fleece blanket between a few sheets and did not even cover the length of the bed leaving our feet cold until we had to remake the bed with an extra blanket. No ventilation system whatsoever in the bathroom or room and windows were unable to open. We had to leave the aircon on the whole trip to try and circulate some fresh air. With no bathroom ventilation we understand why there is mould.
