We stayed here for the first time for one night with two small dogs on Wednesday. We were looking for a dog friendly hotel just north of Jacksonville and found this place listed on bringfidocom. We read all the reviews along with several on tripadvisor before booking. Our usual routine. Aside from 1 review we only review lodging. Pulling up were were pleased with the modern look. The location was good. Relatively easy to find using our gps. Lots of options nearby for dining shopping fuel. The parking lot was empty out back aside from 2 vehicles so we parked there and were able to walk next door to Outback Steakhouse for dinner. Our room was not on the top floor nor the end as requested. We are very light sleepers. The room was small and had a sleek sparse feel but good for travelers and particularly those needing only a nights stay. The lobby and lobby bar were very cool looking but we did not get to try it as the menu was very limited so we walked next door. There is a lounge fireplace that you can also see and feel in the modern seating area next to the pool. Smokers were utilizing it occasionally as they hotel is smoke free thank goodness. Music was being pumped out there too. There were plenty of grassy area for walking the pups and the landscaping out back and near the pool area was very cool. More about the room yes small but the king size bed was comfy. However the pillows looked cool as they were nice and long but the linens were very scratchy and the pillows turned out to not be comfy leaving both my husband and I with headaches the next am Also around 245 am a heavy footed stomper started making noise on the floor above us. They continued the rest of the night and I laid there with earplugs and our ocean sleep track playing until we finally got up in the morning. People can be so rude. We never heard any other dogs. The bathroom was interesting and sort of cool. There is a light wall with a frosted glass panel that emits or received light from the bedroom. The shower and toilet area can be closed off with a giant mirrored door which gives privacy to those showering and a awesome mirror to those dressing or putting on makeup. One corner of the shower had black mildew running down the seam. Also because its only a shower no tub or spigot turning on the water is interesting. In order to not get wet you have to first take your hand and turn the shower head into the wall away from you then turn the water on all the way so it gets hot. You will get a little wet but not as much if you do not turn the shower head away. Other than the mildew and shower head placement its a big open modern shower. I like it that they place shampoo and body wash in the dispensers. less waste and better for the environment in bulk. OH. if you stay more than one night and do not use housekeeping they give you 5 to use at the bar or extra stay points. cool. Other than that the only bad thing was the coffee prep station was not very clean. I hesitated to use the coffee maker. There was a stir stick left by someone too. The plastic on the cups was torn and there was soap smeared on them. We did not watch any tv because we were tired from the drive but it was a nice big tv easily viewable from the bed. The bed lighting was muted enough for reading but not glaring. It was sort of romantic. The window blinds were great for keeping out the morning sun andor parking lot lights at night. I would give this place a try again. However I want to know why we could not have received an end room or a top floor room to help with noise. Maybe checking in at 7 pm on a Wednesday is too late to get requests. Some places only place dogs on certain floors but that should be stated on the website. It is about 2 hours from here to Savannah. A straight shot pretty much.

Staff untrustworthy. I normally stay at the Aloft because I like the room setup and the beds are comfortable. This Aloft experience was different. The room was clean but the shower could be re grouted. First let me say the front desk staff was welcoming. However I do feel the maid staff should be credited the same. I ended up getting the flu during my stay. So I only had the staff come in a couple of times during the week since I did not want to get them sick. Anyway one day I left my watch in my room. I normally put it on before I leave but this time I forgot to due to my illness. My watch is now missing and I filed a report with the hotel. Never heard back from them. I am not sure if it was the maid staff or someone else within the hotel staff that took my watch. I know that there is a safe for valuables but I never intended leaving my watch behind. It would be nice to not have to be concerned about your things within you room.

Well I stayed here last night and once last week and really wanted to rate this property higher then a two. First the staff members are great very friendly and helpful that \u2019s the main reason I \u2019m not rating it a one. The property is old and needs a refresh it \u2019s a bit of a mess. No towels in the gym back patio unkept and a mess random paint cans in the gym elevator mission lower panels random stuff around the hotel as if someone was moving in or out. After checking in and after a long flight I wanted a quick nap. Nope the fire alarm sounded and the hotel was evacuated. Once cleared by the fire department hotel staff allowed us back in false alarm. After going to sleep later that night I was woken again my the fire alarm around 1240am yup same thing standing in the parking lot waiting for the fire department to clear another false alarm this time the hotel staff could not reset the elevators so up 5 floor I go to try to get a little sleep before needing to be at the airport at 4 am. No I \u2019m sorry or what can we do to make you happy. How about a free cup of cofeBoth stays I requested a wake up call and both times I did n\u2019t receive one.

Knowing I was departing early I confirmed I could use it for granola bar and some oatmeal in the morning. At checkout the guy checking me out tells me I ca n\u2019t use it because breakfast has not stated yet. Yet the little food pantry that is open 24 hours clearly had the two items I wanted.

I \u2019ve been a Mariot member for many years stay at a Mariot owned hotel once a month on average in various locations. And while the \u201c fun \u201d and \u201c funkines \u201d of the Aloft lobby yes there is a bar and game tables and pool area is unique I was sorely disappointed in the basic care and amenities. First the hallways were not clean. I \u2019m assuming this is due to rare vacuuming and the pets. Secondly the only blanket in the room is one on the bed so thin that you can see through it. Even turning the heat on yes it gets cold in FL it did not make for a comfortable sleep. If you request another one it \u2019s the same kind so ask for twoThird. if you like to enjoy a glass of wine in your room but need access to an opener they do n\u2019t keep one at the front desk or with the concierge or even housekeeping. The only available wine opener is the single one behind the bar. So you will have to take your battle to the bar to be opened by the bartender if they can find the opener. which they could n\u2019t. and there is only one. Finaly while someone came into my room and made the bed and took the towels used and unused they did not clean wipe down anything vacuum restock the coffee nor did they replace any of the linens. Which is really inconvenient when you return from a 12 hr work day start to undress for a shower only to find all the towels and washcloths are gone as was your spare see through blanket. One would think that they could just contact housekeeping to bring them towels however in the evening and night hours Aloft only has 2 people on staff the front desk and shuttle driver. So if driver is out your happy but has to get redressed and go to the front desk to pick up towels. Thank god the single persons that worked the desk are so nice as they are having to handle so many customers and needs all aloneOh and just a travel tip note \u2014 no reheating of food is available in this hotel. And bath products is soap and shampoo only no conditioner lotion etcI came away feeling as if all the bling and \u201c fun \u201d in the lobby is to distract you from noticing the missing Mariot standard.
