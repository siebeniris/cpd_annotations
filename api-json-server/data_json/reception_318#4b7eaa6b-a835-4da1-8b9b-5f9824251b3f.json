We had maintenance problems in out hotel room. The sink and shower had a foul odor. It took them two days to come and fix it. We were not did not stay in our room for an entire day for that reason. They never followed up and then finally when I kept complaining the sent the housekeeper with some odor deodorizer to pour down the sink. They never apologized for not showing up. The elevators were dirty and they were quite scary. The doors would open before the elevator would stop or even worse if you put your hand up to open the doors it would close on you they sensor would not open the doors or keep them from closing on someones head. The bell hop never said two words to me and my party. Everywhere we walked in the hotel it was stinking. I understand they were remodeling and everything but signage would of been nice to say. Parton our dust repairs and or smell we are remodeling Apologizing in advance would have been acceptable. The rewards card was not explained. Valet was backed up and there was so much construction there was not enough safety tape and signs. Best part of the Flamingo was that it was close to the LINQ Hararahs. Planet Hollywood Hard Rock and especially Ceasars. I really gave it the benefit of the doubt but the Total experience staff and customer service was horrible. The room smell worse. The customer service poor. I wish I would have been room comped or give some kind of perk as I gambled and I have may points on my Rewards card. I left feeling like I did not have any rewards.

Not planning on spending much time in the room we really did not care what the room was like. We arrived way before check in and we decided to pay extra for early check in. Very wise decision because we could see the crows congregating waiting for check in time. We were given the last room in the hall on the 27 th floor which was nice very nice view. The room was huge but very simple the bathroom needed work but it served its purpose. The elevators at least for the Habitat wing were very old but they always came fast. Some parts of the hallway smelled like garbage but our room was clean. Would I stay here again. Maybe. Unfortunately it was too cold and rainy while we were there so no pool time but I did peek in there and it looked nice. The staff was always courteous and we had no issues while there.

Some what ridiculous. However within 15 minutes after opening EVERY chair was reserved. This was even at the family pool. They do not check room keys so anyone can enter. Not desirable for people actually staying at the hotel. However the pool is enjoyable but not relaxing. We want to Legends one night and it was just okay.

My husbands and I thought it would be a great idea to visit Vegas for the holidays. Within the past couple of years we laid our beloved daughter to rest at age 32 while she was in the prime of her life. As result we stopped celebrating holidays birthdays and more as they became difficult without our daughters presence. This year as we vowed to regain a sense of life we thought it would be wonderful to stay in the same hotel where our daughter married 8 years prior and enjoy some of the festivities of the holidays. Well this trip turned out to be our worst trip ever a nightmare of sorts. 1st we were assigned a room on the 17th floor that was down for construction we then had to go back to the VIP check in to be reassigned another room. After getting our room we retried for evening. After waking the next morning we set the heat and proceeded to shower to find NO HOT WATER after jumping out of the cold shower we then realized there was NO HEAT. Upon calling VIP services were asked if we contacted maintenance to report the issues for a room we had only slept in. Absolutely not that is the hotels responsibility PRIOR to our arrival. In addition we were on the 17th floor for both the first and second rooms and construction could be heard almost the entire night and all morning. Needless to say back to VIP check in for another room and we were given a room that someone else has already used. Yes we had stood in the long line at check in 3 times prior and even after bringing it to the attention of the manager Mike who was not moved by our horrid story. He started one of the agents at the front desk will assist you so you need to stand in line. Others that are in line may be in line for the same reasons you are. Totally disconnected and unwilling to assist the staff in getting us in and out of VIP. We contacted to VIP irate noting that they have given us yet another bum room and we were not willing to move ourselves and demanded they do what was necessary to resolve this situation. This entire event in addition to our mental and physical state of being during a time we were seeking to regain life only deepen our pain. Sad they Mike missed a great opportunity to play a significant part along our journey of healing after the loss of our daughter. All we can do now is imagine what it would have been like had only taken ownership or pride in their job. How much better off we would be in our grieving through the holidays. On a positive note I was able to speak with Mikes boss operations manager to voice my concerns. He was very sympathetic to my concerns and showed more empathy and was more than willing to remedy the issues which was greatly appreciated.

Flamingo HotelWe were at the Flamingo for five nights to attend a Muscular Dystrophy Convention. One of our party has very weak legs but we did not reserve a handicap room to save one for those at the convention who needed onemore than us. The hotel wants you to use the kiosk to check in. It requires you to insert your drivers license or passport so hope that they have adequate computer security. We had a Flamingo \u201c Fab \u201d as in \u2018 fabulous \u2019 room. Pictures will show you what that gets you. The room had only one luggage rack so we immediately called \u201c Guest Services \u201d to have another one delivered. We were in the room for about 4 hours unpacking and preparing for our conference. We called Guest Services 4 more times and also the front desk to talk to a manager. Everyone said \u201c it \u2019s on the way \u201d every time we called. No delivery. We finally went out to eat and when we returned the extra luggage rack was in our room. So it only took about 6 hours 6 phone calls and a manager to get one delivered. There is no fan in the bathroom. We needed to open the door to clear the bathroom of steam. With one person disabled we call \u201c Guest Services \u201d again to ask for a mat for the bathtub so he would n\u2019t slip. About an hour later a runner showed up with a terrycloth mat for the bathroom floor not a rubber mat for the tub. Called Guest Services again and they then decided that one was not available. Tub is slippery with soap so be careful when you use it. Every day the maid short sheeted the end of the bed where your feet are. We had to readjust the sheets every night before going to sleep. See pic. Rooms are not soundproofed. Easily heard the person in the next room snoring and constant foot patter from the room above us. Furniture looks like they may have purchased it from another hotel. Dated and in disrepair and a bit dirty with grime. See pics. Pepsi machine was located right in the hallway. Apparently they never hooked it up to the refreshment room that most hotels have. See pic. Staff was rude. They had someone directing foot traffic in the chaos of the registration area and she was very impatient with us. Also Concierge blew us off when we inquired about a conference room location saying we should check with the conference organizers. Windows were very dirty and the view from our \u201c Fab \u201d room was a joke see picsThe hotel has two banks of elevators. The last 3 days of our conference one bank of elevators was closed for repairs. No warning sign of any problem for the first day so some guests stood there forever waiting for an elevator. Of course that created a bit of heavy traffic with the one remaining bank of elevators. Long waits and long walks for half of the hotel. If you \u2019re in you 20 \u2019s the pool might be to your liking. That seems to be the demographic the hotel is going for as the loud music from the pool made a pleasant swim in the family pool nearly impossible. It was LOUD and others at our conference complained that they could n\u2019t use the pools because of the loud rap music. Also some who had rooms near the pool said the thumping of the bass permeated their rooms. We used the kiosk to check out. The bill was about 200 more than the amount we had in our email from the Flamingo before our trip. So we had to wait in the registration line and then speak to them about our bill. It was corrected but that process took us about 45 minutes to check out. Now we \u2019re home and checking our online credit card statement. The statement has an additional charge on it from Flamingo of over 100. Called the hotel and got hooked up with Guest Services. It took them over \u00bd hour to figure it out and said they would add a credit to correct it but it would n\u2019t appear for a couple of days. Note. All calls on the hotel phone to any hotel services are recorded. Conference food was good and Suzane from Detroit at the front desk and the person we spoke with on the phone to get the billing corrected were very friendly. But that \u2019s it. Using the kiosk standing in line getting bill corrected with desk staff calling billing for their error to get it corrected \u2026\u2026. about 2 hours. We will never stay at the Flamingo Hotel again. It is part of the Caesars Hotel network and makes us reluctant to book any future stays at any of their hotels. If you \u2019re as foolish as us in booking the Flamingo make sure that you print your confirmation with displayed total cost before you leave for your trip and make sure you check your kiosk and credit card billing when you check out and get home. By the way other conference attendees has similar complaints.

The room was so newly renovated I could smell that the carpet was new. Since the hotel is undergoing renovations during the day you will hear the noise from the construction which usually starts at 8 am and ends around 7 pm. If this is something that bothers you you may want to stay elsewhere. Prior to coming I had a free drink birthday coupon from Caesars. I tried to redeem at the kiosk it did not work. I went to guest services to redeem it did not work. I think the main theme of my stay at Flamingo was that the kiosks and some technology did not work. Another downfall of my stay was the new carpeting. The smell made me cough all day and all night. I called guest services to see if I could get another room an older room and they were not accommodating. They said that they were booked however my friend was able to get another room during our stay. Overall the price was great the location of the Flamingo is great. Aside from the allergic reaction to the new carpet and the kiosks not working all was well. I was able to check out online however my friend was not able to do so and had to stand in the long line at the reservation desk to check out. One thing that I would like to see updated is the kiosk.
