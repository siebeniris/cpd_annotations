What got this hotel five stars from me is the staff. They were great very friendly and helpful. From delicious cookies at check in to a super smooth and quick check out. Our smoke alarm started chirping around midnight and I was sure we would have to wait for maintenance to come change the battery. Nope. Within a couple of minutes the amazingly nice woman working the front desk came up herself with batteries in hand. She changed out the batteries waited and pleasantly chatted for a few minutes to make sure everything was ok. She apologized and bid us a good night. I wish I had gotten her name so I could let the hotel know. hopefully they will read my review and know who I am talking about.

The good reviews must be from family and employees this place is horrible. Our first room had no running water in bathroom sink and the carpet was soak. They had a big hole in the wall that was just recently patched so I assumed there was a leak. Why would they give this room to anyone. The girl at the front desk said she would give me extra towels to throw on the floor and we can use the bar sink by the desk to brush our teeth. No discount offered. I requested another room. After making myself and another customer stand there for 15 mins they somehow pulled a room out of their hat when they said they had none. We changed rooms and noticed an awful foul odor how the carpet had rolls in it. But we had running water so we were ok with it. Next day we noticed the AC was not working. It was 104 outside. We asked for a fan and was told no they do n\u2019t have any. By now I did n\u2019t believe anything she said. They again said there was no other rooms.

Despite everything the employees here were incredibly friendly welcoming and supportive. They got us a room set up quickly and the entire experience was lovely. It was one of the cleanest hotels we have ever stayed in and the room was massive and beautiful. we have stayed in Holiday Inn Express locations elsewhere before but this location was the nicest by far that we have seen. We were not looking for anything more than a clean safe room bed for the night but the extras here were great for while we were here to enjoy it.
