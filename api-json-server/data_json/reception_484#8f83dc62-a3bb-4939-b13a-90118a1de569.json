My mother daughter and I just got back from a three generation getaway to Chicago and we could not have asked for a better hotel than the Talbot. Every single person on the staff greeted us warmly and it felt like they truly cared that we enjoyed our stay. My mother celebrated her 82nd birthday while we were there and they sent a small gift to the room in addition to mentioning it to one of our restaurants. Our room was quiet despite being next to the elevator I did not hear a sound from any of the other guests. And the free wifi was very much appreciated. The location was perfect. The hotel is just steps away from Le Pain Quotidien and so we started every day with a wonderful breakfast. It was easy to hop on a bus and travel almost everywhere we needed to go without calling a taxi. In addition to all the regular sights in Chicago staying in the Talbot made it easy to visit the Newbery Library and Driehaus Museum both just a few blocks away. The hotel is well priced and its location and staff mean I had love to stay there again.", "offset": [0, 40], "date": "2015-05-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "5acd109a-ccb5-4d89-b11f-9a1a26f630c7", "sentence": "Perfect location in Chicago clean friendly staff.

Bathrobe was so tight I could not wear it I am not at all overweight for those who might wonder. No hooks in the bathroom to hang towels. Lobby is very small and the elevators are almost a joke.

Only one employee behind the counter.
