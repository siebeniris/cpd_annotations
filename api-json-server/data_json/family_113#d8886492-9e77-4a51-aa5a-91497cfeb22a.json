The rooms were quite big and ours overlooked the pool and the Sky Bar is also a really cool place to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night.

The Mondrian is located in right off of the trendy Sunset strip in West Hollywood. Situated near loads of great restaurants bars music venues and tourist attractions it is fantastic for tourists and party goers alike. We rented a car from LAX and had an approximately 30 minute drive in moderate traffic from the airport. Last time we stayed here we took an Uber from LAX and it was about 65 and 30 minutes as well. This trip we stayed at the Mondrian for a few nights during the week of the Gramy Awards and it was loaded with celebrities and party goers. The night we arrived there were parties being thrown in the Herringbone and SkyBar which our room overlooked. Since we were travel fatigued from a cross country flight and had early meetings the next day we were a little concerned about the noise but the build out of the hotel and rooms is of such high quality we barely heard a sound. All in all it was a tremendous hotel staying experience once again. A place I highly suggested if you want a stylish classy experience with a touch of edge. Here are a few highlights. The Great 1. Location. Location was fantastic right in the heart of West Hollywood near Beverly Hills Shopping Restaurants Bars Music Venues 25 minutes from the beach Runyon Canyon and lots of other great sites. 2. The room. The Room was simply amazing. Great design stylish yet comfortable plus the fixtures and amenities from the bathroom to furniture to the d\u00e9cor all was second to none. In addition the room was surprisingly quiet which is always a huge plus. On my last visit we did have some balcony partiers that were a little loud but they settled down. 3. Internet. Unfortunately I was there on business so the internet was crucial and it did not disappoint. It was lightning fast and worked throughout the building. 4. The Staff. Staff was extremely professional attentive and on point across the board. I travel a lot and was impressed. 5. The restaurants and bars. The Herringbone Coffee Shop and SkyBar all impressed. The service was good and the so were the drinks and the food. My only complaint is things in LA close too early being from NYC it is just odd but that is California 6. The View. I have always stayed in high floor rooms and the view is spectacular. Most rooms face out over the Skybar to the North or West but none disappoint although I am not certain what the lower floors look like. The Good 1. The Parking. The parking situation was a little rough as sunset is a busy street and the driveway to the hotel is hard to find. During both of my stays I have had issues whipping right in because of the line of cars waiting to valet 2. Valet. While dropping off was rough so was retrieving. I waited every time I took the car out during both of my stays. It may just because I stayed during busy times but it happened multiple occasions.

I recently completed a business trip to Los Angeles. I chose to stay at the Mondrian because its location was central to the business I had to conduct and I enjoy West Hollywood. I asked for and was given a quiet room away from the pool scene overlooking Sunset. I stayed in a Deluxe Studio room and I loved the clean but luxurious design. The flat screen was hidden in a large swivelling mirror and I enjoyed the use of sheer curtains to provide more separation between spaces in the generously sized suite. I also loved the hardwood floors in my room because carpet in hotel rooms ew. The bed was very comfortable I really enjoyed the powerbar embedded in the nightstand no hunting for outlets to charge my iPhone and iPad. and the room wifi was more than adequate for my business needs fast and constant. The bath amenities definitely kicked it up a notch with generous portions of Malin Goetz products. I ate at the restaurant a couple times and was pleased with the service and ordered take out from the bartenders super busy and super nice guys twice as well as the room service menu is limited. I had drinks at Sky Bar and enjoyed watching folks navigate the chaise lounges drinks and pool. All of the Sky Bar servers were attentive and beautiful. In fact every single person who worked at the Mondrian was unfailingly polite and helpful. Always going the extra step to make me feel cared for. The most extreme example of this was that my room though perfect in every other way lacked something vital for me. A coffee maker. I wake up very early on business trips and having my first cup of the day in my room undisturbed as I begin working on East Coast business is pretty important to me. I called to front desk to have them deliver machine to my room. I was told that the hotel did not have any machines for the rooms but that they brewed an urn of coffee in the lobby starting at 6 am. I was not particularly happy about it but went about my business. The following morning I awoke at 430 am and suffered uncafeinated for 1 12 hours before I was able to get a cup of adequate coffee from the urn. I decided to write a letter to management just to let them know my feelings. I kept it light and polite. I am fully aware that my coffee situation is a leader among first world problems if there ever was one. I sent the email of and went about my day In between meetings I received a reply from the hotel. They had gone out and PURCHASED a Nespreso machine and wanted to know when a good time would be for them to put it in my room. Amazing wonderful and responsive.

Stayed here as part of a multi stop Los Angeles Family holiday. Hotel is very popular and on sunset strip in a good location. Room was amazing. After that I will say that it was poor. Reasons were treatment by hotel management after we complained that on our 3 day stay the pool was closed early on 2 of them. The whole reasons for our choices of hotels were to have a decent location and a pool as we had children with us. Our holiday rep had to get involved and although front of desk management did try and resolve the situation as did a pool attendant higher up management were snooty abrupt and did not care for their guests.

This is the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Never heard of a hotel where you have to pay over 450 night to compete with the public that they charge a fee for to use the hotel pool. The staff was completely incompetent and unfriendly. The room smelled of sewage because the shower would not drain properly. We should have known why the room was filled with room spray chemical the minute we walked through the door. The closet door was a sheer curtain and the bed was uncomfortable. The bad experience started with the check in process when the staff clearly did not understand the request for a quiet room. After waiting for an hour for our room we were told it was the wrong room. When we spoke to David Lozano on site manager he proceeded to tell us that the hotel is known as a party hotel. This is false advertising on their website since it was portrayed as a romantic get away destination. We contacted our concierge at RocketMiles and this is what we heard back from themWe spoke to Keith from the front desk who said that they tried to offer you compensation at the time of your stay both in terms of room upgrades and complimentary breakfast but all of their offers were turned down. Furthermore Keith mentioned that you had written a number of negative reviews online and he was unwilling to offer any compensation. David Lozano never offered us an option for a room upgrade. He did offer us breakfast which I declined since I had a breakfast meeting ofsite the next morning. Also I have not written any negative review on any social media outlet except for contacting the hotel and the hotel group directly but after being falsely accused of writing bad reviews I take the opportunity to write one now. I do not know who Keith is since I never met him during my stay but he was ill informed. Also his lack of passion for customer success and satisfaction tells me a lot about the Morgans Hotel Group by not employing the right talent to not just generate revenue but properly represent their brand. So this is to Keith and David your customers and their needs should come first when you run a hotel business. If you are looking to stay at a 4star hotel this is not it. I echo the sentiment of Jason H who had wrote a similar review to mine about his experience at this hotel. The Mondrian Hotel is half a step up from Motel 6.

At check in the hotel produced us with a letter to say that the pool area would be close for 5 days which was our entire stay to say this was distressing news was an understatement we were offered the use of a neighbouring hotels pool and an apology. What was most frustrating was that prior to our trip we were not provided with any information of the pool closure nor given the option of making an informed decision. Had we of been given the option we would of chosen another hotel at half the price with a fully working pool. After much complaining i was finally offered 200 back which did nt even cover one nights stay and the promise of some drinks tokens that never materialised. The room looked nothing like pictures and we were given a room that overlooked a building site we could hear construction from early in the morning which meant we could lay in on our vacation. The cool looking TV only worked on a few stations and the maids barley made our beds and replaced the towels. All in all this hotel is completely overrated and not worth the money.

Where do I start. We arrived at the Mondrian hotel after staying a week in Vegas and 10 days in Cancun. We had a 3 night stopover at the hotel before flying back to Australia. When we arrived we were told that on top of the 781 that we had paid that we also had to pay a 200 bond per night for any damage that we cause or the minibar that we use as it was the end of our trip as you can imagine the funds were running low so we managed to convince the very serious man at the desk to drop it to 300. So off to our room we went as we opened the blinds it looked straight out to a building site. Finally upgraded us to a room with a half decent \u201c view \u201d. 15 minutes later after relaxing in the room one of the staff came into our room and completely wiped everything from the mini bar and left us only 2 bottles of water. No safe in the room after 2 hours a staff member came in and used his drill to mount one in the room. Finally walked over to a mini mart and grabbed some drinks only to find that our fridge did NOT work. They Finally bought in a little white bar fridge turned it on and that \u2019s where it sat in the middle of apt until we left. Then we were hit for six. we were told that on top of our 781 we had paid for 3 nights and a 300 \u201c security bond \u201d that we would have to pay a 20 US fee per day plus taxes to access the \u201c 24 hr gym \u201d \u201c free wi fi \u201d which was not free we could make a \u201c coffee \u201d in our room and to access there \u201d business centre \u201d. 73 in total just to use there facilities that I have already paid forThen the fun really started the next morn at around 730am the constant banging and drilling from the \u201c renovations \u201c that they were doing on some units above us. It went on all day for 3 days yes even Sunday morning. I did complain to the housekeeper who told me that I should have been advised of the works going on above. Level 5 looks over the pool which the skybar is open until 1 am music pumping. Did manage to go to the skybar for a drink but only had one each after paying 36 US for 2 vodka sodas.
