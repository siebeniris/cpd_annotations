Perfect Location. This was my first trip to Key West while my boy friend is a frequent Key West flyer. We went for Memorial Day weekend and stayed at the Reach after taking the Key West Express great idea I reviewed them as well and high recommend. My BF was initially worried that the location of this hotel would be too out of the way and that we would not enjoy our selves as much and I was worried after reading some of the reviews. I have NO idea what people are complaining about. So let me being with this. 1 it is KEY WEST. Everything is laid back everything is on beach time and luxury is redefined in a beach town way. If you are looking for big city luxury perhaps Key West and the Reach are not for you2. HOWEVER this IS a great property. It has more character and charm than I anticipated. A very attentive professional kind staff. We were vacationing and planning on a wedding and upon hearing this we not only received a generous upgrade to a beautiful room with a view but champagne and chocolates delivered to our rom3. The property is an outdoor open air concept that is very key west. We stayed in a Jr suite with a kitchenette and a large patio. The room was typical but upscale and the bed and shower were comfortable and luxurious. 4. The location is off the beaten path but nothing takes long to get to at all. We actually enjoyed the walk every day and it gave us an opportunity to see all things Key West not just Duval street if we so chose. Which we did often. We also got a break from the craziness if wanted it and had our own pool and beach to enjoy. It let us have a party and romantic aspect to our weekend retreat. Very close to Southern Most point. 5. This IS STILL a Hilton property so room complaints etc are pretty normal. The front desk was more than accommodating and would be happy to address I have no doubt. I would recommend this to any couple or family wanting to enjoy Key West for a multitude of reasons.

False advertising on the Ocean View rooms. Rude staff. More like an overpriced Ramada Inn. This place is really just an overpriced Ramada Inn that can charge a lot more due to it is location on the limited beachfront in Key West. Many of the staff were friendly and helpful but some were unfriendly unhelpful or flat out rude see below for more details. Our Ocean View Room had no view of the ocean. The hotel itself is poorly designed takes very little advantage of it is ocean front location and is clearly in need of renovation. Most of what you would expect a luxury resort to just take care of without you the guest having to think about or even notice was not taken care of. We would never stay here again. This hotel certainly fails to live up to the Waldorf Astoria reputation. Staff We met plenty of staff who were helpful and friendly including the bellhop who after we saw the lack of an ocean view from our room took us around to view other available rooms and the front desk clerk who moved us into a new room and the concierge who booked us a great jet ski tour of the island. But some staff were unhelpful or even rude. The H20 concierge one of the glorified towel boys was rude to our children twice one time telling them in a very harsh tone of voice that they could not grab a piece of fruit from the tray he was passing around the pool until they dried their hands off and another time telling them that they did not get a drink because he only had alcoholic drinks to pass out to pool guests. One day I overheard him talking to another towel boy about a guest who had asked him for some hot water for tea. While standing not more than 3 feet from me and having seen me standing right there next to him as he spoke the rude towel boy said to the other towel boy that expletive asked for hot water. I will get her some expletive hot water. The fact that thus place has such an obviously rude and inappropriate employee working as their H2O concierge really sums up the overall lack of focus on customer experience that we felt during our stay. I also ran into unfriendliness when I spoke to the front desk clerk the morning after our check in. I came down to ask about the fact that our first room had no ocean view although I had booked one and that our new room only had an obstructed view. When you are at the hotel you can clearly see that there are about 12 15 rooms that have very nice ocean views. Then there are another 20 or more rooms with obstructed ocean views. Then there are many with only courtyard views a city view or no view at all. The hotel only lists ocean view rooms courtyard or city views. I booked an ocean view room. I was told that an ocean view room means that you can see water from the balcony. that is just simply not right. An ocean view room means that you can see the ocean from the room. I do not care if they have fine print defining it otherwise which they do not. it is just false advertising to claim otherwise especially when there are at least 12 15 rooms with full ocean views. If we had been placed in an ocean view room to begin with them things would have been fine but we were not. Instead our initial room had no ocean view. If you stepped onto the balcony and leaned out to the right you could see a bit of water. If we had been switched to one of those rooms with an actual ocean view I would have been happy but we were not. Our new room had a view of water but only partially and it was through a grove a palm trees. When I raised this issue the front desk clerk just kept giving me excuses like explaining that ocean view room did not mean a view of the ocean from the room silly me. Finally after flat out telling her that I was unhappy with her excuses. that I felt like I was being ripped off by the hotel and asked her flat out what she would do about it she reluctantly offered me a slight discount. Bad customer service. The cleaning staff also had problems like the fact that they came into our room and did some cleaning but left our bed a complete mess. I had to call the front desk and have them send the cleaning staff back to our room. They also took some of our extra pillows and sheets that we had specially asked for the night before for our kids to use on the foldout couch. Restaurant staff charged us for 4 adult buffet breakfasts when we clearly had 2 children under 10. My wife later noticed the discrepancy and we had to ask the manager to refund us the difference. Groundskeeper was using a gas powered leaf blower by the pool from about 10am130am. Very unpleasant especially when a rake could have done the same job with little or no noise. The hotel itself just feels old in parts. No AC in the elevators or public restrooms which makes for some very unpleasant experiences when it is 98 degrees and super humid. Cracks in walls. Small pool with no flair. Small seaweed covered beach that was unusable for us and our kids for any sort of ocean activity other than getting on and off the jet skis that we took a tour on. One super huge design flaw is that one of the best views of the ocean at the entire hotel is from the elevator shaft which happens to partially or entirely block the view from dozens of rooms. Why an elevator shaft was given such an amazing view to the detriment of actual rooms I have no idea. And that same elevator shaft takes hotel guests down through a dark unpleasant section of the parking garage in order to get to and from their rooms another major design flaw. If you have a chance stay elsewhere on your trip to Key West. Their sister hotel the Casa Maria seemed much nicer and there are tons of really charming looking inns and B and Bs all over town that would likely be a much better use of your hotel dollars.", "offset": [4697, 4827], "date": "2015-08-27", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "4d28f7ab-9136-4167-b023-155267f8f3b5", "sentence": "Nice hotel in a great location.

The gift shop carried a wide variety of sundries and name brand clothes and all the gift shop employees were amazing. I was allowed to take some clothing items to my room to try on and return to purchase or put back on the rack which was very courteous and delightfully unexpected. Our room the main building restaurant and grounds were pristine clean. The outside hallways to get to the rooms were in disrepair but safe. Some elevators were broken but not all. The most irritating experience was the incredibly INATTENTIVE wait staff at the restaurant Spencers By The Sea.

We were completely spoiled as the H2O Concierge brought chairs chair covers umbrellas and buttons to press for service from the food and beverage menu. Awesome. This comes at a cost of 35 night resort fee in addition to the room charge. We also paid an additional 35 night for valet parking but never used the vehicle after check in.

I did note that not all rooms had balconies all at The Reach do and you would need water shoes to walk from the sandy beach into the water as there are rocks just in the tide line.

As a Hilton Diamond member I have stayed at many many high end Hilton group hotels all over the world. After 3 nights at The Reach I have come to realize this really is a gem. Yes the TripAdvisor feedback is all the same a rather dated hotel with a loud kitchen exhaust stack and an even louder roof air conditioning unit the latter so loud that it overpowers the sound of the surf hitting the beach 20 yards away. This is all true but it does n\u2019t tell the whole story. This trip was to celebrate our wedding anniversary and also share our first visit to Key West with some family visiting from Scotland. We had booked 2 Ocean View King Suites for 3 nights using rather a lot of Hilton points. Pulling up outside the lobby the experience began. From the valet check in desk concierge housekeeping restaurant and bar everyone was so genuine smiling all the time and really caring that we were enjoying ourselves. Absolutely nothing seemed too much trouble and it is clear everyone took an immense amount of pride in providing the best experience possible. More on the \u2018 experience \u2019 word later. An infrequent traveler might think this kind of service is normal but as a world traveler I can say it is not. Many new build Hilton group hotels have state of the art buildings but generally the service is cold and clinical. Sure the staff may smile and say the right things but there is a big difference between someone doing their job and someone who loves their job and really cares about providing the best service possible to guests. To be honest the first night was n\u2019t great the corner suite 534 seemed to channel and retain all of the noise but next morning we moved to 539 which was better. Much quieter with the balcony door closed and tolerable with it open during the night. Again the attitude of the staff was simply superb.
