We booked this resort with great hesitation based on the great discrepancy of reviews on Trip Advisor. Now we see why. During our one week stay we had experiences that were both horrible and wonderful but our overall take on this stay was disappointing. We arrived after dark tired and just wanting to get situated. When given our room 024 on the ground level we were overwhelmed by the damp and musty smell that hit you as you walked in. I was prepared for this based on some of the other reviews. We unpacked our bags and settled in for the night. In the bright morning of a new day we awoke to a much better view of the room. I was shocked and aghast at the mold that was building around the a c venting the ceilings and all over the walls. The mold appeared to have been painted over but was again permeating out through the paint. The shower stall looked like a science project in various stages of mold muck and crumbling ceilings. The shower head was caked in mold looking like it had not been cleaned in years. I went down to the front desk asking to see a manager. He asked me to return after 1 pm when he had more rooms available and we could look at another room. We went down to the pool for the morning and returned as requested. Armed with pictures of my moldy room on my I phone he did not want to look at them. He said that a replacement room is being provided and that it was just about ready and that we could take a look at it. Our new room 2069 was on the third level. The room was slightly smaller than the previous one but it had a spectacular view overlooking the lush gardens and pool area. The bed in this room was a true king sized bed vs 2 full sized beds that were pushed together in the previous room. The cleaning lady was putting the finishing touches on the nicely assembled towel arrangements which were loaded with hibiscus blooms and petals as were the bathroom vanity. A couple of balloon arrangements decorated the headboard of the bed. I returned to the front desk and told him that the room was like night and day and we appreciated the switch up. We were a bit surprised when he asked us to not take too long in relocating to the new room as they had to get our old room ready for the next guests. Really. That room needed to be condemned. On the food and restaurants it is spotty at best. We ate at both the Specialty restaurants and in the buffet. The worst was at La Altagracia Steak house. This is the same location where they serve lunch polside all day and the service was the worst. The menu is pretty much pre set. Our Seafood trio appetizer was supposed to be three different seafood dishes but they were all the same. When we mentioned this to our server he did not understand more on the language difficulties later. When we pointed to the Seafood trio appetizer on the table right next to us with three different dishes as they were supposed to be he says to us all the same. A few minutes later he returned took our Seafood appetizer and that was it. No seafood appetizer for youMy steak like was like all of the steak that I had here overdone thinly sliced fatty and grizzly. My wifes lobster was surprisingly godLa Bodega Rodizio the Brazilian style restaurant with a wide variety of meats carved fresh from skewers had the potential to be good. Unfortunately everything was way overdone and dried out. What a disapointmentKristal the gourmet fushion restaurant was very good with the best wait staff that we encountered. This was 5 star dining with interesting taste combinations. The waiters were personable and fun and we enjoyed our dinner here. We also enjoyed Luigis Italian restaurant on two occasions. They had a great salad and pasta bar which served both hot and cold pasta meats cheeses and soup. You then get to order your entr\u00e9e off the menu. We both ordered the OsoBuco dish and it was wonderful. There were three great desert choices available and we were uncertain as to what to choose so they brought us all three. Dinner was topped off with shots of Limoncelo or Sambuca. Very niceWe had to try the Buffet for dinner as everyone said that it was great. In our opinion the menu was not much different than the lunch menu with the exception of adding a carving station for meat. The night that we were there they were carving lamb. We prefer to be waited on for dinner and our preference was the Specialty restaurants. Keep in mind that reservations need to be made in advance and these are taken in person at Luigis between 8am1am each day. You may make reservations for up to three days. Men must wear slacks for dinner. Ladies wore skirts sundresses slacks or jeans. We did have breakfast each day and the menu did not change. Be sure to try the fresh made juice bar with 7 different juice choices made fresh before your eyes The omelet station was my usual choice as I prefer my eggs prepared fresh to order. The breakfast was good with a nice variety. The grounds of the property are expansive and beautiful. They are well maintained and a pleasure to walk. Out of all of the Punta Cana RIU properties this one was the most photogenicThe beaches in Punta Cana are amongst the most beautiful that I have ever seen. Tall palm trees abound and they grow right to the oceans edge. The beaches are wide and the sand is spotlessly clean almost like sugar. You can walk for miles in either direction and just enjoy the view. The water is the most beautiful turquoise blue you have ever seen. The ocean was fun to swim. Yes the waves can be aggressive at times but the water is very clean. Ok that is the good now for the bad. The language barrier. there is definitely a problem in communication with the help at this resort. do not get me wrong they are pleasant and most of them work hard. But if you do not speak any Spanish you are going to have a hard time getting through. The staff understands most one word requests beer water coffee spoon. But try to string 4 or 5 words together in a sentence and they will look at you like you have three heads. If at all possible try to learn some brief conversational Spanish before going you will be less stressed out. The drinks are very inconsistent. Depending on the time of day who your server is whether you tip or not and what bar you are at will all depend greatly in the quality of your drink. The best drinks hands down are in the Martini bar in the resort lobby. This bar serves signature and good quality drinks with top shelf liquor. Tip nicely here and you will be well taken care of. The drinks at the pool bar are best when you go to get them yourself. When served polside they often are weak and service can be slow. We tipped usually a dollar each time and the help did remember us and came around more often. The drinks were better too. We were surprised how many people did not tip as these folks really do work hard to serve you. Make sure that you bring plenty of sun block sun tan lotion and all of your toiletry products. For northerners like us the sun is intense here. We started with SPF 50 and had to move up to an SPF 80. The price for this small bottle cost us 28 on Caribbean Street a small RIU operated shopping district. I enjoy working out and the gym facilities are pathetic. The gym located in the Spa area had just a few treadmills one bike and a Universal weight machine with 2 of the 5 stations broken. The facility was worn and dirty. There were no towels no disinfectant supplies available and the water cooler was dry. The second facility on Caribbean street was worse. It is second floor above a store front. This one had some free weights. The bars weights clips and everything was very badly rusted and smelly. The universal weight machine was well worn with tattered and broken benches rusted chains and pulleys and it just looked hazardous to use. One of my biggest concerns this whole trip was of the safety and quality of the foods and drinks that I was consuming. It was most difficult to remember that all of the tap water in the resort is not potable. Yes bottled water was widely available but it is hard to remember like when you are showering and brushing your teeth. Regardless we were careful and did not screw up. Regrettably I write this review sick at home for 5 days now with a bacterial infection. My doctor says that I likely caught this in the Dominican as the symptoms that I suffer do not compare with what he has seen locally. I should have trusted my intuition on this one unfortunately I wanted to give it a try. We will never return to the Hotel RIU Palace or even to Punta Cana for that matter.

These 2 gentlemen went out of their way to deliver top notch service to both young in old. Had the pleasure of observing Raul entertain a toddler as well as go as far as feed him lunch. His southern charm would rival any of those back in the US. Wilie was always attentive and go above and beyond for all those who sat in his and Rauls section. De Paula the general manager listened t guest feedback followed up with each guest to ensure that they had a pleasant dining experience and would ensure better service was given in areas that needed attention. Yosaury Ramirez was an exceptional guild and listen to everything the wanted to get accomplished during our stay and made great suggestions on excursions that tailored to our request. She also gave us a taxi voucher to take us ofsite to purchase souvenirs at a reasonable price we converted 484 pesos to 1 USD prior to heading to the shop and went paying their exchange rate was 45 pesos to 1 USD when the current exchange rate was 4613 pesos. She made sure our stay was pleasant and always gave my friends and I first class service. Private beach and pool was well maintained. Plenty of lounge chairs were available for guest to sunbathe or just rest and relax. Cons. Our suite Rm 2126 was warm the AC never cooled us off the 2 nights we slept there and the fridge leaked water everywhere on the first night. We had to repeatedly ask the hotel front desk to place us in another room in which they finally did yet no compensation was given even though the hotel was at fault. The hostess server at Yokohama onsite Japan Restaurant was the rudest restaurant personnel I have ever encountered and even after she picture included of her was made aware of her actions by De Paula she did not accept fault nor did she apologize to the guest she had offended. To make matters even worse the restaurant as infested with termites pictures includedBeware of the crooked onsite gift shops on this whole entire resort. They all are cheaters and scammers. Riu Gift Expressions was converting 50 pesos to 1 US dollar when the exchange rate was 4613 while the hotel was converting it at 484 pesos. Another shop clearly marked an item for 185 pesos and when we went to pay for our items she was asking for 6 USD which if converted to pesos be 27678 at a conversion rate of 4613. I personally went to a t shirt shop on my own to purchase souvenirs and upon paying the cashier stated it was a cash transaction when she clearly had a credit card machine visible.

We booked Riu Palace because we thought that Riu properties were held to a certain standard of service and cleanliness. NOT THIS PLACE. It was dirty dated and the desk staff and management were anything but helpful and friendly. We booked a room for 3 adults and one child since one of our kids is 20 and the other is 10. They stuck us in a room that would only accommodate 3. As I came back to the desk and asked them to give us the accommodations we payed for to accommodate 4 they kept sending me to different rooms to check out for 2 whole days of our vacation that were all the same just located in different areas of the hotel none of which were able to accommodate 3 adults and one child. Later I found out that they really had no rooms that could comfortably accommodate 4. But they finally did give us a larger suite that they were at least able to throw a couple mattresses on the floor into so everyone at least had a bed to sleep on. After I talked to the manager and we had to pay an additional 140 for our stay. Manager acknowledged to me that he has been aware of our problem for a couple days now but refused to do anything. When I asked him why he allowed his staff to keep sending us on a wild goose chase then he just laughed. But accommodations aside the food at best is gross to mediocre but plenty of it. unles you miss their meal times then you need to go their sports bar and grab a stale hot dog or hamburger out of their fridge and microwave it yourself that is their 24 hour food availability. Bartenders and wait staff are always nice and friendly but could not make a decent drink for the life of them. Frozen drinks were always too watery and alcoholic drinks were lacking any alcohol. All in all the attitude of the management here completely ruined our vacation. And the much needed alcohol that would help us thru this trip was extremely lacking.

I could still smell it on my clothes when I unpacked my suitcase. The food at the buffet was better than most of the specialty restaurants. I did not bother with the Italian since it had so many bad reviews online. The Brazilian steakhouse I tried because I loved the one I had been to in the past. This was a complete disappointment. The meats were all dry the salad bar was sparse and overall unsatisfying. The steakhouse is good but their idea of fries and dessert with every meal gave you no variety. I do recommended the steakhouse. The Japanese restaurant was delicious. I was completely satisfied with this experience there was a wait for the table. But others in our group did not like it. They usually do not eat sushi and were not familiar with the cuisine. We did one excursion while there and it was the Jeep safari. This was a great way to experience the real culture of the Dominican. do not be disappointed when you do not really get a real jeep to drive. The zip line included was sketchy but I still did it. The horses for horseback riding look like they could use a good meal but I am used to seeing livestock in America. The experience of seeing the sugar cane fields coffee growers beauty of the countryside authentic lunch and another beach made this excursion well worth 99 per person.

We returned from a 2 week holiday 23 June 2017 and whilst we had a good time we both agreed we would have liked to come home at the end of a week. I have never felt like that about a holiday before. We originally booked to stay in the Rui Bamboo which is now bring refurbished apparently we were upgraded to the Rui Palace Punta Cana it just did not feel like it. We would have liked to have been advised originally of the Bamboo work and to be given the chance to choose an alternative rather than be allocated and then told of a change we had no control over. This hotel is looking tired and really must be in need of an upgrade. Our room 0102 was clean it is however in need of repainting and the bathroom needs replacing it would appear that there had been a leak in a room upstairs the bathroom ceiling has been patched up and paint badly applied over the bath is very worn. There is a fridge in the room which does not get refilled with what is used it was impossible to get 7Up or coke so it is a bit pointless if the drinks you use are not filled up. Our vodka optic also ran out and was not replaced so these are not checked. The maids were good towels replaced daily although there must be a shortage of bath mats as they put small towels on the floor instead. The maid helped herself to chocolate we had in our fridge we did not report it as it was not worth causing trouble however it made us check our belongings every day. If you speak Spanish you will be very welcome if you are American particularly black and flashing dollar notes to tip you are next in importance. English well you are generally just not welcome. There are a handful of waiting staff who were lovely and friendly but on the whole as we were English we were ignored. All prices in the shops spa and even Thomson excursions despite Thomson advising us to take pesos are quoted in USD if you ask to pay in Pesos there are special mark up buttons on their calculators to rip you off with exchange rates. We did the Dr Fish excursion very expensive for what it was and not very relaxing. The spa ladies wander round the pool trying to sign you up for massages they are very pushy and make what should be an enjoyable experience less than restful. The prices in Pesos is a big rip off we were quoted 750 pesos which was a lot more expensive than the USD amount quoted when I said no it is too expensive the price dropped to 50 Pesos that is how much they were trying to rip us off. We booked the massages at the lower price when we turned up at the shack on the beach they tried to make us pay more the lady in charge was rude and agresive and they 2 masseurs lady in charge random man with calculator taking money all talked loudly amongst themselves in Spanish whist we stood there wondering what was happening. I asked for my money back and said we would leave they refused and we eventually had to have the massages they continued their conversations in Spanish throughout the massages. Whilst the masseurs were clearly good at massaging the experience was anything but relaxing and so we did not book anything else. We have never had such a bad experience in a spa abroad or at home. There is one main pool with a swim up bar and a small round pool which soon fills up. There were plenty of beds and umbrellas but although there are signs saying beds can not be reserved the bar staff were reserving beds for holidaymakers presumably for a tip which often meant prime position beds were reserved all day and not used. The afternoon entertainment takes place in the pool some is quiet and pool side some involves swimming races quite a lot involves twerking and sexy dance competitions the music is very loud for this and it is impossible to escape unles you leave the pool area. A lot of people are in the pool a long time at the bar we saw some water sample checks done but generally the pool looked quite scummy later in the day and judging by the bad eye infections we both came home with and other people were also experiencing there could well be a problem with the pool water. Alternatively it could be down to the actual tap water which ever it is it is very painful and uncomfortable and lasted over a week. The drops obtained from the pharmacy were apparently anti biotic drops the cost was USD47 on return home the doctor advised there was no anti biotic in the dropsEvening entertainment was generally quite good particularly the circus night the games nights were amusing too. Food wise the buffet was good however it would be helpful to have more labels to know what the food was as a non meat eater I could not always tell what was in what they were cooking so felt quite limited in choice. The Italian al la carte was nice the steakhouse was good they serve salmon. when we eventually got our meal the tables around us all got their meals before us even if they ordered sometime after us but then we were the only English table.

We returned from a 2 week holiday 23 June 2017 and whilst we had a good time we both agreed we would have liked to come home at the end of a week. I have never felt like that about a holiday before. We originally booked to stay in the Rui Bamboo which is now bring refurbished apparently we were upgraded to the Rui Palace Punta Cana it just did not feel like it. We would have liked to have been advised originally of the Bamboo work and to be given the chance to choose an alternative rather than be allocated and then told of a change we had no control over. This hotel is looking tired and really must be in need of an upgrade. Our room 0102 was clean it is however in need of repainting and the bathroom needs replacing it would appear that there had been a leak in a room upstairs the bathroom ceiling has been patched up and paint badly applied over the bath is very worn. There is a fridge in the room which does not get refilled with what is used it was impossible to get 7Up or coke so it is a bit pointless if the drinks you use are not filled up. Our vodka optic also ran out and was not replaced so these are not checked. The maids were good towels replaced daily although there must be a shortage of bath mats as they put small towels on the floor instead. The maid helped herself to chocolate we had in our fridge we did not report it as it was not worth causing trouble however it made us check our belongings every day. If you speak Spanish you will be very welcome if you are American particularly black and flashing dollar notes to tip you are next in importance. English well you are generally just not welcome. There are a handful of waiting staff who were lovely and friendly but on the whole as we were English we were ignored. All prices in the shops spa and even Thomson excursions despite Thomson advising us to take pesos are quoted in USD if you ask to pay in Pesos there are special mark up buttons on their calculators to rip you off with exchange rates. We did the Dr Fish excursion very expensive for what it was and not very relaxing. The spa ladies wander round the pool trying to sign you up for massages they are very pushy and make what should be an enjoyable experience less than restful. The prices in Pesos is a big rip off we were quoted 750 pesos which was a lot more expensive than the USD amount quoted when I said no it is too expensive the price dropped to 50 Pesos that is how much they were trying to rip us off. We booked the massages at the lower price when we turned up at the shack on the beach they tried to make us pay more the lady in charge was rude and agresive and they 2 masseurs lady in charge random man with calculator taking money all talked loudly amongst themselves in Spanish whist we stood there wondering what was happening. I asked for my money back and said we would leave they refused and we eventually had to have the massages they continued their conversations in Spanish throughout the massages. Whilst the masseurs were clearly good at massaging the experience was anything but relaxing and so we did not book anything else. We have never had such a bad experience in a spa abroad or at home. There is one main pool with a swim up bar and a small round pool which soon fills up. There were plenty of beds and umbrellas but although there are signs saying beds can not be reserved the bar staff were reserving beds for holidaymakers presumably for a tip which often meant prime position beds were reserved all day and not used. The afternoon entertainment takes place in the pool some is quiet and pool side some involves swimming races quite a lot involves twerking and sexy dance competitions the music is very loud for this and it is impossible to escape unles you leave the pool area. A lot of people are in the pool a long time at the bar we saw some water sample checks done but generally the pool looked quite scummy later in the day and judging by the bad eye infections we both came home with and other people were also experiencing there could well be a problem with the pool water. Alternatively it could be down to the actual tap water which ever it is it is very painful and uncomfortable and lasted over a week. The drops obtained from the pharmacy were apparently anti biotic drops the cost was USD47 on return home the doctor advised there was no anti biotic in the dropsEvening entertainment was generally quite good particularly the circus night the games nights were amusing too. Food wise the buffet was good however it would be helpful to have more labels to know what the food was as a non meat eater I could not always tell what was in what they were cooking so felt quite limited in choice. The Italian al la carte was nice the steakhouse was good they serve salmon. when we eventually got our meal the tables around us all got their meals before us even if they ordered sometime after us but then we were the only English table. On the night we went the manager was called as people were queuing for ages to be seated and getting very angry as it was so disorganised I do not know if they were just short staffed. One family received their meals and pointed out to the waitress that the burger did not have a burger on the plate she shrugged and walked off eventually the lady had to go and find someone in charge to bring back to the table to show him the plate without a burger.

On arrival the entrance lobby certainly has a wow factor. Very large and airy and greeted with a very friendly helpful guy on the reception desk along with a welcome drink of refreshing orange juice. Luggage was left with one of the porters who delivered it very promptly to our rooms. The rooms are plenty big enough with his her sinks and walk in shower very large bed lounge area and balcony. An all inclusive minibar and selection of beers spirits and soft drinks is also in the room along with a coffee percolator. Food generally within the hotel we found to be very good and the service from the staff on the whole during all mealtimes was good. As with everything some are better than others some were simply excellent. The themed restaurants were on the whole excellent particularly the Spanish and Japanese ones. Krystal restaurant was a little disappointing as the main course dishes were a little bland quinoa and steak gets a little repetitive on the palate after a couple of mouthfuls. but it was beautifully cooked and presented. There is a first come first served basis for these themed restaurants but if they have no tables a pager type device is issued when your table is available. This only happened once in our stay and our wait was around 30 mins which gave us time to go have a drink before our meal. Pool area was good and kept very clean. Beach area is vast clean and tidy palm tree lined and was n\u2019t overcrowded with sunbeds aplenty at all times of the day. One or two local vendors were mooching about but they did n\u2019t hassle you unduly. The early morning sunrise over the sea was something to behold quite a memorable moment. My one and only complaint would be that some but not all of the entertainment staff who are also evening entertainment staff are surly ignorant and selective about who the speak with and invite to participate in games dancing etc. Some do n\u2019t even have the decency to say hello. Do n\u2019t expect anything remotely \u201c entertaining \u201d from a lot of these guys unles you \u2019re blonde with large breasts and a pretty face.

My husband and I along with our 9 month old and 25 year old returned from a week long stay at this property and we had an awful experience. We are Platinum members at Mariot and had planned to go to Aruba for the past 10 months using points but decided a month before to switch to Punta Cana because we decided it would be better for our family. My husband has stayed at Rius in Europe and Panama for work so he was familiar with the brand and thought it would be a good choice. We realize now we shoudl have stuck with our original plan First off i want to tell you about OUR ROOM. We had lots of different issues within our room. First the patio door broke so we were not able to get outside it took a few days and a few visits to the front desk to get that fixed. Our TV never worked. What is the point of having a TV if it was not going work. They finally came to fix it on the second to last day. Our safe broke. they had to come fix that. Most important our telphone never worked. This is a SAFETY hazard and should never happen. We went up every day multiple times a day to tell the front desk staff and they said that had been an issue for the past two weeks. They had some story about a reset and things going wrong. If there was a fire or an emergency and the phone lines were down that would have been a huge liability on the hotel. Besides the legal part it was a pain for us to walk all the way from room 0148 every time we needed something. From towels to ice to water. That was such an inconvenience. Plus we were not able to order room service which apparently was 24 hours a day. We had two little kids that would have made our lives easier. This leads me to the next part of my disappointment. THE FOOD. Myself and my daughter both have a dairy allergy. and my husband has a shellfish allergy. These are both very serious. We have traveled all over the world fro Asia to south america to eurpe and never had a problem. But for some reason the hotel could not accommodate us. We tried to meet with the cooking staff to discuss it but they did not speak English well enough. There were very few options for us and we had to be very careful what we ate because we did not want to be sick. One out of every ten items in the kitchen is labeled but there needs to be a sign on everything not only saying what it is but what is in it. Again if someone gets sick another huge liability. We tried ordering special stuff at the specialty Italian. restaurant for our kids and the waiter said we can not do that for you because if someone sees that we have to do it for everyone. We were trying to order plain noodles and fruit. Who says that. You should accommodate guest especially the kids. We did get plain noodles one night there but for some reason a different waiter would not allow it. It makes no sense. Speaking of restaurants we arrived on Xmas eve and when we went to go to the restaurants for dinner we were told that we needed reservations. That was not a very welcoming feeling. We should have been told that ahead of time not when we walked down to eat. And getting into the specialty restaurants was a process in it self. Apparently if you go later than 635 they are full and only have tables for people who give them tips. we watched it unfold before our eyes and it is not a way to treat guests. Everyone should be treated equally. I did not want to eat in the buffet 3 meals a day. A few of my other issues center around THE KIDS. We felt that you advertised as a kids friendly resort but you did nothing special for the kids No little thing when you checked in no special activities and no kids menu at the restaurants. How is that family friendly. There was a show most nights but it was one or two people from the RIU dancing on the stage and then one game. There should be a show for the kids each night and a participation things. it was boring. The kids pools were nice but you had people smoking in them. I know people smoke but there should be a no smoking in the kids area. That is a health hazard. Lastly the bathrooms are way too far away from everything especially the kids pools. I had to run from the kids pool all the way to main building or by the buffet every time my daughter had to go the bathroom. it was inconvenient and annoying. Not to mention that the bathrooms were disgusting and never seemed cleaned Furthermore the food we had was not good at all. As we saw on the wall of the hotel you got a 1 star in 2015 and as someone formerly in the hotel industry we know that is not good. A few other things to mention is that we had to walk up to the reception desk 2x a day to get fresh towels because our phone was not working and most times we were only given 2 towels a day and we had 4 of us. our kids are on the reservation and they shower and bathe as well. Also every time we asked for change the cashier never had it and told us to come back later and still never had it. Lastly and probably most important is that I fell one night walking back from the kids show while holding my daughter. We were right in front of the outdoor stage on the 9 black tiles. I hurt my wrist really bad and my daughter bumped her head. Yes there were yellow cones outside but they were in the same place outside our entire visit. It had rained and i had slipped. Those black tiles need to have some sort of carpet or other thing placed on them to help people walked after it rains. A few of the employees rushed over to help me up but no one got us anything. My husband helped me back to the room and then had to walk all the way up to the front to get me ice and report to the management. If our phone was working we could have called. So he went to the front and got ice sent to the room and asked for someone to come file an incident report. They said they would review the video and then come. No one ever came. I know for a fact that would never happen in the US. Luckily neither my daughter or i had a concussion. We are still waiting for some follow up on that so we can decide how we want to proceed. I tried contacting the hotel and they gave me RIU points as a consolation but i am not sure why they think i would want to stay there again. They should have given us money back. overall the experience was not good. I am extremely disappointed in the RIU hotel brand and will never visit their properties again.

The bad The rooms were nice but our group had some problems with clogged toilets and sinks and maid service showing up at 11 o\u2019clock at night. Kind of odd. The specialty restaurants could n\u2019t seat a whole lot of people so there were long waits so we only went to one of them and the food quality was kind of poor so we stuck with the buffets. The liquor quality was poor they obviously specialize in rum drinks and they had one Dominican beer which were good but if you want anything a little higher quality it \u2019s not there. In fact they do n\u2019t have any bourbon when you asked for bourbon they fill the American bourbon bottles with something different. Like a dark rum. It was n\u2019t even close to Bourbon and the bartenders admitted it to us. The vendors on the beach are not overly intrusive but if you lay on the beach all day 20 to 30 of these people come by to ask you if you want to pet a monkey or buy cigars or hold a bird or buy sunglasses. It gets a little old. Overall I think we had a good time but we will not go back.

Traveling with another couple and he assigned us rooms right next to each other which made the week so convenient for coming and going with them.

Awesome time with love and laughter throughout the whole class. Thank you Jimmy. The food was amazing. If you like seafood you are in for a treat.

There was no notification about what the show was each evening therefore good shows were not seen. The swim up bar activities became most unacceptable in the afternoon. These were generally started by the animation team. Bearing in mind there are children in this hotel the activities were of an adult nature. The complex has recently installed a party pool for adults only these kind of activities should be contained to this area not the hotel.

First off the resort is large beautiful and clean. The gorgeous beach is really why we booked this resort. We loved it. There is a lot of palm trees and quite peaceful on beach. You can walk miles and the water is fantastic. I have to say we have been to Mexico for many years and love the Riu resorts on the Mayan Riviera. It was hard for us because we were always comparing to Mexico \u2019s resorts. They are definitely a step up compared to Punta Cana. In Mexico if you stay at a Palace you have access to all the other Riu resorts. The reason we love that when you vacation for two weeks you need to roam. We felt quite isolated there. We still went into the other resorts to compare and check everything out. They really should change that in Punta Cana. We had a great room. We slept like babies. The A C and fan worked great. The bed Was good and bathroom clean and nice. The housekeeping kept our room clean but what irritated us almost everyday there was something forgotten. Towels etc. It was n\u2019t huge but enough to get on your nerves after two weeks. One night we came back to have a shower after being on beach all day and no towels at all. We waited an hour for towels. They gave us a bottle of wine for our room on our anniversary but no opener. We asked twice for an opener but gave up and just left room to have wine. One morning we were on our way to breakfast and there was a broken glass on the ramp to main walkway in courtyard. It was there all day with a yellow caution pylon there. Next morning it was still there broken glass and all. We went on an all day excursion and came back and still there. next day and it was still there. We saw young kids walking through the glass. It was unbelievable to us. We complained to front desk and it was finally cleaned up. The one thing that was very apparent to us is the tipping. If you want good service you better walk around with a wad of money in your hand. They are a very tip oriented resort. Trust me we tipped but they are not shy of showing you the kind of service you will receive by tipping. We found Mexico more respectful how they received their tips. What really turned me off one night they were asking guests for feedback reviews at dinner time. We were filling them out and the waiters were all walking around us looking over our shoulders as were were filling out our reviews. Wow. I do n\u2019t even know what to say about that. The entertainment is ok but it is kind of boring. The live music was great. We liked the piano playing and one night listened to a violinist which was great. There was no real schedule posted that we were aware of when they played. This resort has so much potential but it was just the little things that just did n\u2019t sit well for us. I loved the beach etc but unfortunately I do n\u2019t think we will return. We just love the service food and resorts better in Mexico.
