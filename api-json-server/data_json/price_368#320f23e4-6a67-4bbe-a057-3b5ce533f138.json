Along with 2 other couples we booked a stay vacation in Beverly Hills perhaps 20 miles from our homes. We selected it because it is a Starwod property and we are Starwod owners. It was the strangest hotel I have ever visited. The decor was extremely eclectic with no apparent overriding theme which was striving for edgy and trendy. I found it too busy and distracting. One example a floor lamp in the concierge area had a base in the form of an silver assault rifle. Nearby there was a gas fireplace which had a glass stags head illuminated from the interior hanging over it. You have to see it to get the full effect. The check in counter was located in a very dark area with spotlights over the employees strange and somewhat disconcerting. Just to the left of this was the elevator lobby which was completely bathed in red neon light. I felt like I was in a high rise bordello. The bar area was better. The bar itself is contained in a stainless steel lined room where servers go up to a counter to get your drink. The Bar where you sit was removed from the bar service area completely ie no friendly bartender to chat up and consisted of several high tables with stools on both sides all in a row with several feet between them. This was actually pretty good as our group could sit on both sides and have a conversation in which all six of us could participate. The rooms were quite nice although not particularly big. Very modern trendy decor but done much better than some of the common areas. The bathroom was all dark marble and mirrors with too little light. I felt a little like I was in a fun house as i kept running into unexpected reflections of myself. There were a number of foreign guests on the property and I suspect this is the target market. They were mostly in their 20s to 40s dressed in self consciously trendy clothing. 40year old men wearing baseball caps backwards or angled off to the side a little much for me and over the top shoes red with orange laces and so on. And given the room rates pretty affluent. One of our party claimed the target was Euro trash trade which I felt was a little harsh. But the clientele definitely were broadcasting a rich trendy vibe that was a bit much to take. There is a restaurant bar located in the hotel called The Bazaar. We did not eat there but went in after dinner elsewhere. The bar club scene seemed to be very active with lots of younger people mostly in couples or groups lounging around in a decor that was obviously designed by the same people who did the hotel. It all tried a little bit too hard to be edgy. But if you are of that age it looked like it might be fun. Again there was no bar at the bar. Drinks were brought out to tables and other lounge areas but there was no place to belly up. Overall the experience was okay. The beds were comfortable the rooms attractive and the staff very accommodating. But you have to be really into the edgy scene to really like this place. We are not and we did not. And at the prices you should really want to enjoy it.", "offset": [3009, 3062], "date": "2016-01-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "deb8732c-d319-4b8b-9e64-885b977448a1", "sentence": "No Just No there are many better places to stay in Beverly Hills. I have stayed in Starwod Luxury Collection properties in Mexico and have been blown away. SLS in Beverly Hills was a massive disappointment however I booked a balcony suite on the top floor under the apparently silly assumption that we had have a view of the Hollywood Hills. Nope. I was also impressed by the Philipe Stark design as shown in the website photos but the reality is that the rooms are very poorly designed. My suite had the bed a chaise and desk crammed in half of the room while the other half was essentially empty but for 2 uncomfortable pecuniary chairs. The television is built into a wall on this far side of the room from the bed so forget about subtitles absent binoculars. I could not sit at the desk without leaning back and hitting the wall. The bathroom was bizarely totally walled in black mirror and again the space arrangement was horrible. Half the bathroom was empty but for a towel shelf unit reflected in the black mirrored walls while the shower door itself was 8 inches in front of the toilet and again you have a beautiful reflection of yourself on the toilet in black mirror and the shower controls were far removed from the door so that you alternately froze or scalded yourself while trying to adjust the temperature. it is difficult to put on makeup in black mirror and the mirror above the sink was 1\u00bd feet away also virtually impossible to use to put on your makeup. there is free wifi but if you want a decent speed wifi you have to pay extra even if you are a Starwod member. The room service menu is extremely limited not very good and in addition to adding a gratuity normal these days includes a taxable administrative fee house fee. whatever that is and 9 tax our two burgers and half bottle of wine cost 120. I hate nothing more than being nickeled and dimed and in a suite that cost 80 a night I am downright offended. As far as the vaunted skills of the staff I wish I had seen that when we were leaving for a Cedars Hospital appointment and my husband in a walker was not redirected to an exit ramp but left to hobble down stairs with me helping balance his walker. It was an altogether disappointing experience and we will never stay here again.

When you do walk into the lobby you see the other restaurant and two concierge desks and then you have to make a left to get to the super dark and dingy dimly lit front desk. Rooms decent size suite with seriously bad floor plan. No outlets for charging devices bedside or even at all near the bed. You walk into the bathroom which was a bizarre set up more on that in a minute. the outlets were all on one wall in between the dining room and bedroom like as if you are going to leave your devices on the floor charging five feet away from you. Just poorly designed and planedBathrom the oddest design ever. The standing shower was in a corner of the bathroom near a steel piece of furniture. Yes. Furniture. Stacked with towels that gets wet when you turn on the shower. The tub is squeezed into yes squeezed. the same corner so it \u2019s hard to get into the tub for the over head shower head and also really hard to squeeze yourself into the corner for the wall shower. Both very awkward and crazy that the water flows all over the floor so our walk all over the water on the floor after your shower. Not to forget that your towels are wet now from the wall shower because the towels are literally in the same corner. Seriously. Who designed this. Back to the room the drapes were super old and heavy and so were the windows. The a c was loud and thumped all night long. WiFi we complained about this after the second day. Each day and each time you need WiFi you need to do a survey. Ridiculous. Sorry to admit that I can not recommend this property to anyone. The location alone does not make it worth it. They need to understand that they are in Beverly Hills and not in some hick town in Rochester NY. It \u2019s shameful that SLS would be so behind the times with basics like decor amenities and other basics like drapes and outlets. It \u2019s almost unbelievable to me that. I would even have to mention things like this for a review in this day and age. Even budget motels have things like automatic drapes and USB ports bedside these days. The restaurants decor was awkward as well in terms of seating and set up. The furniture is dated and the menu is definitely lacking a reflection of the California cuisine. They do n\u2019t have a good menu that is varied or caters to the ubiquitous allergy sensitive people. I was surprised that I was not even asked if the kitchen should know about any food allergies which is now standard practice in all higher end establishments. But then again I was not asked that question anywhere on the west coast so it must just be a east coast progressive trend. The rest of the country has to catch up I guess. Well I think I said enough. I think it \u2019s clear enough that I was disappointed especially for the price.

I returned to the SLS after its room suite renovation was completed in August for a 4 night stay the first night of which I was joined by my husband and our dog to celebrate his birthday with a fabulous dinner at Somni. In recognition of that special event and of my Ambassador status the hotel graciously upgraded us in advance to one of its SLS Suites \u2014 the second best suite category in the hotel. The SLS Suite was glorious very spacious well appointed and with a huge living room dining area a huge bedroom with tons of natural light from huge floor to ceiling windows and a massive closet. The bathroom was surprisingly small and had but a single vanity reminding us of the exact same bathroom with single vanity we had last year. The WiFi was blazing fast at 115 120 Mbps down and 185 200 Mbps up. Shower pressure was a bit weak. Air con was amazing and cooled the bedroom down to 62 F after I asked them to VIP it so it ran constantly for me. Ther actually were 3 separate air con units one for the bedroom and closet and two for the massive living room. There was some slight traffic noise that could wake one up in the morning so that \u2019s a factor to be considered when selecting a room category. In the future I might prefer the courtyard facing rooms or suites so as to avoid street noise. Service again was extraordinary as good as any St Regis. Everyone was extremely friendly always trying to help and always handling things in a very prompt and efficient manner. Even the air con engineer was a delight. Even my request for housekeeping to keep the bedroom doors closed so it would stay colder was honored throughout my stay. Service again was extraordinary as good as any St Regis.

A small welcome amenity bottle of red wine chocolate and card were left for us once my husband and dog arrived.

I had driven my Tesla and the hotel valets charged it every night of my stay. Another nice service touch. Kudos to the entire team for exceptional service. Dining was incredible. Somni was phenomenal see separate review for my first night with my husband and the Bazaar by Jose Andres was almost as amazing on my last night with 2 friends. My in room dining breakfasts were wonderful if a bit pricey and my in room dinner burgers and fries were great and a bit more reasonable at 38 total. Sunday breakfast with my husband was fine even if the Plat Benefit was a bit more measly with only cold continental included. Sunday brunch was 65 and a very high quality affair even if the offerings were not particularly generous in variety. We \u2019d not return for brunch. Overall it \u2019s a very impressive hotel. The renovated rooms and suites have a fresh lighter palette that \u2019s far more inviting and feels a lot more comfortable. Service is as stellar as always.
