We booked this hotel through the Secret Hotels option at Lastminutecom so did not know where we were staying until we had completed the booking. As soon as I knew I went straight on their website and then came on here to read the reviews. I was a little nervous about what to expectWe checked in early around 1230pm and although our room was not ready we were able to leave our luggage in storage and the reception staff took my mobile number to call me when it was available for us. This left us the time to then go off and do what we had planned with our day. When seeing the room for the first time it was as I thought quite trendy and unconventional but clean and I actually quite liked the quirkiness of it. I am not sure about putting up with the separate shower and toilet cubicles. for more than one night but the lovely rainfall shower made up for it. However and call me very British I really missed not having anywhere to make a cup of tea or coffee in the room. I thought this would be as standard in any hotel romWe were unfortunately woken up during the night due to a fire alarm and also a very loud angry neighbour trying to get in their room which actually only lasted a few minutes and was then turned off but it was enough to disturb our sleep. Other than that we did not have a problem with any noise. Overall I thought the hotel was a little pretentious but the staff were friendly the room was clean and it is in a very good location. I would not pay full price as I do not think the experience as a whole warrants paying that much money but I would stay there again if it was at the discounted rate I paid.", "offset": [285, 529], "date": "2015-03-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "0ed45696-122f-482b-a59f-7970fddecabd", "sentence": "Over hyped this hotels needs to get the basics of hospitality right. We booked this hotel using Expedia in order to combine our airline tickets with our reservations. Although I was a Platinum Spg guest upon check in I was given a lesson that room types can not be guaranteed when booked with a third party and they will see how they will accommodate me. I asked for a king size bed and they told me only twin beda where available and they will do me a Favor by giving me a room that has a king size bed. Although I paid 485 usd per night although I was staying there for 4 nights. I had to just be grateful that they will give me a basic room. Forget about the platinum upgrade because when you book through Expedia Aprently Starwod hotels do nt appreciate your businesThe rooms are just a disaster. They want to look and feel modern but the reality is the architect wanted to save space so the bathroom was designed in the room with zero modern fixtures. The toilet behind a mirrored door kind of in a closet and if some one uses the bathroom at 30 Am good luck not waking up to the sound of a leak. There was nothing modern about this poorly designed pretentious and dim hotel. Needless to say that for four days the housekeeping cart was outside our room door to add to the slick look and feel. Although I stayed in Starwod hotels for more than 50 nights in 2014 I did not not spend one night in 2015 because they made me feel cheap by asking for the platinum guest services simply because I booked thru Expedia this one time and the reason was to combine air fare I did not not underpay or get any sort of discount and this behavior was unwarranted from the W.", "offset": [1299, 1665], "date": "2015-04-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "6b3e7093-02d1-4df1-be6a-8b65f4f87278", "sentence": "High energy and glamour feel.

I can not believe that Starwod allows them to operate under their name. We enjoy staying in any Starwod property all over the world but this completely misses the mark. The good shower was awesome. We requested early check in and they were able to accommodate. The bad the room is small and feels more like a nightclub than a tranquil space to rest after a busy day of exploring London. We checked in and immediately noticed that our room was dirty. The floor was not swept the chair was filthy and the washroom was not clean. The mattress was very uncomfortable and made worse by the lumpy mess of a pillow that they offered. We could not see out of our window something tourists like to do and for certain we do when we pay for a cool corner room. The entire building is covered in a layer of spotted glass so you can not see a thing. The cordless telephones did not work so we had to use speakerphone just to dial the front desk. The washroom was laid out nicely but had a television that was hard to turn on and did not coincide with the regular one so you could really watch a program anyway. The towels were ALL dingy and old and not soft at all. And my biggest complaint is that there was no light you can not see anything when trying to get ready. Pitiful. And after hunting down the hair dryer when I found it in the closet in the hallway it was locked in the cupboard so you needed to use it right there. And the cord is not long enough to actually see in the mirror while using it. And for those of us that need a flat iron you need to plug that in by the writing desk which has no access to a mirror unles you count the one behind the bar area. The lighting woes continue in the actual room where it feels like you took a wrong turn into a nightclub and we struggled to find sufficient light to do anything. Yet when we turn off all light to get some sleep a glow of purple light illuminates the room for the entire night. Turndown service did occur however our free bottle of water was never replenishes only one robe was ever put out despite the fact that they had both our names and the bed light that was turned on was burnt out for the entire time. No ice is available to retrieve on each floor so when we requested it it took over half and hour to be delivered. Not one time during our stay did anyone ask how we liked our room until we checked out something that I always found Starwod hotels was great at doing. Whatever whenever is whatever you want whenever they feel like it. Public spaces in the hotel were also dirty and far too dark. When you can not see the colour of the carpet there is an issue. When we finally were checking out we had the front desk staff hold our bags for a short time and also had them arrange a car service to the airport. When we showed up they could not find our bags and when they did they sent them down in an elevator on their own. And the car service was never called. We ended up taking a regular taxi. Despite the bellman promising that we were still getting the flat rate the taxi driver turned on the meter and we paid the higher fare. What a final impression. The restaurant ties to the hotel is the Spice Market which I have ate at many times in NYC. We did have dinner here one night and was great. However eating breakfast in this space that operates as a bar restaurant in the evening leaves a great deal to be desired. We ordered a la carte the buffet was 27GBP. and a simple poached egg on toast with bacon was cold and rubbery. A complete let down that we washed down with our cold cup of coffee. The Ugly I would have to say that the entire experience was ugly. We will never return. For the amount of money they charged us we should have received so much more.

I do not even know where to start with describing what all went wrong on my four night stay at the W London Leicester Square. To put this review in context I travel 100 nights per year for business have the SPG Gold status and generally love the W concept where I have had amazing experiences before Barcelona Singapore Dallas. This was a mixed business leisure trip. So heres what went wrong Asked for a quiet room got one right next to the elevator no other available where I had drunk people passing along and discussing their marriage problems etc. It was better than your average comedy show. did I mention that the W is basically a club bar with rooms attached drawing a quite unique crowd Asked to remove the Green Choice after one night for the rest of the stay room still was not cleaned staff at desk just said will make sure you get the points the other agent did not put you in the system. no sir I would have preferred a clean room that day not points Asked to have the leaky shower head repaired did not happen for another day front desk did not care that nobody showed up Asked to print a boarding pass while passing by the front desk after 15min waiting right next to the front desk I asked again. she forgot and said huh well forgot about this. Absolutely while you were high fiving your passing colleagues and talking about the last night Asked for an HDMI cable as advertised in the room Sir we do not have cables where did you read that. Spechles Ordered something for in room dining and did not get what was on the menu paying 24 GBP for salmon I expect to be delivered what is written on the menu. I called the front desk to ask if the menu had changed or I have misread something. The Whatever Whenever rep did not really care and only after I asked if she could check with the kitchen she grudgingly did so. After a few minutes she called back and said that they do not know what my problem was half of the sides were not on the plate that was my problem and she sent someone to the room. The guy came two minutes later and just said this is how they cook it no beetroot puree for you today sir and only after some discussion with everyone I got some salad on the side. You should have seen his rolling eyes when he left my room. that is what I call true customer service After 6 pm the hotel turns into a huge bar club and there are bouncers at the front. It all feels like you want to enter Berghain here in Berlin. not very welcoming Luxury comfort is a bit of a stretch when your Sunday night starts after 1 am because the loud beats from below are hammering in your ears On a side note while you get all amenity kits quite quickly why do not they provide the basics right from the start shaving kit detal kit shoe sponge. like many 4star places already doSory for this long and probably over the edge review but I am really disappointed in what was delivered vs what W usually stands for. This is a five star hotel that charges five star prices \u2013 a customer can expect five star service for that. After this terrible experience I will definitely go back to the Sanderson where I usually stayed before trying out the W similar style but less obtrusive.

This has been by far one of the best experiences we \u2019ve ever had at a hotel. This was a surprise visit for my 30th birthday and my partner had spoken to the team at W to create something special and they did not under deliver. Shana and Susana were absolutely amazing. They both looked after all of our needs organised all of the surprises and ensured that we were happy with everything. When we arrived Shana personally welcomed us and gave us an early booking and option of late check out and took us to our room where we were greeted by \u2018 30 \u2019 balloons and some surprise gifts which were completely unexpected they left very personable and endearing notes giving their best wishes which I thought was a lovely gesture. Susana went above and beyond asking my partner what I loved the most and incorporated my favourite things into our room. We went for our massages at the spa with Amy and Michela who were nothing but professional and warm. Both Catered to our needs and helped us to start relaxing. When the massage finished the Hotel once again surprised me with cheese crackers strawberries and grapes my favourite snacks with a mocktail complementary again lovely personable notes. It was completely unexpected and heartwarming I felt well looked after and valued as a guest. When we returned to our room the team placed a delicious chocolate birthday cake with raspberries again my favourite. They really did go above and beyond and that was only within the first 2 3 hours of arriving at the hotel. Requesting extra pillows even the housekeeping staff were lovely who noticed the balloons and wished me a happy birthday. Sulia served us for breakfast another example of how amazing the staff are. She showed genuine interest in our plans during our stay nothing was too much trouble. All the staff at this hotel showed excellent customer service. They made this stay special and unforgettable. We will not forget this experience and highly recommend and already have to my parents to stay here. it \u2019s surpassed all expectations and was worth every penny.
