I chose the Tampa Mariot Waterside based on two reasons great ratings and a super location. My wife and I stayed for one night Friday prior to a cruise leaving Saturday. Although it is stated that check in began at 4 PM we arrived early and there was a room available. When we arrived at the room the door was ajar and there were several staff inside addressing some sort of issue. The Head Housekeeper came out and was very very apologetic about the room being worked on and she had get us another room immediately. Additionally she asked if we had like a bottle of wine for our inconvenience. Although we were not inconvenienced at all it was a very wonderful gesture on the part of the hotel to do this. Our new room was up one more floor 6th and was an upgrade river view as opposed to city view. For this great customer service gesture I had love to give a 10 rating to this property for their over and above actions. The room was huge. My wife works as a hotel housekeeper and said the cleanliness was an A and she is an expert on that. A HART trolley stop was directly across the street.

Anyone who reads reviews on this site will see that I have heaped much love on this property overs the years. Well the love affairs has ended. I check in for the weekend 1 night Saturday Sunday and the challenges began immediately. I had called the day before to order champagne and strawberries to be in the room when we checked in. The front desk told me that they could not have them in the room when I arrived since they did not know which room I would be placed in. Okay fair enough. When I checked in I found a Concierge and told him what I needed. I tipped him well and he was off to handle the request. I fumbled around the lobby for 30 minutes and simply said our room is not ready yet it will be a few minutes. After a half hour we wondered up to the room. nothing. I called and was told it would be there shortlynothing. I called again this time a man showed up at our door to check the phones. Check the phones. I called again this time a man showed up with a cart and then delivered some items I had not ordered. I told him the items were not ours and was told they were compliments of the hotel. okay nice. The items I HAD ordered were also on the cart. but those were not for us heading somewhere else. ours would be up in 15 minutes. 45 minutes later I called AGAIN and was told that the items delivered were a substitute for what I had ordered. I am ready to check out at this point. my romantic weekend was shot with over 3 hours of chasing what should have been ready when I checked in. This is now the 3rd stay in less than 4 months and in a row that were not even close to par for this property. The saving grace is the SPA. We had appointments on Sunday and the Ladies were great. Keli is very pleasant at check in and I really enjoy talking with her. Rhonda and Denise are excellent and the massages would melt butter. Judi has always done the manicure and could not be more pleasant or professional. Another stand out moment was the Valet service. FINALLY I was able to get my vehicle in a reasonable amount of time at check out. Every person I spoke with during our stay was extremely pleasant and professional the challenge was in the extreme lack of execution that issue is on the management. The Lady that took many of my calls Vanessa or Virginie I think was also becoming frustrated. I hope these folks get their game together soon unfortunately it will be a long time before I do anything with this property besides the SPA on a lazy Sunday especially a visit where I have expectations or needs.

Normally most people are away from their rooms at that time but not senior citizens who spent the day at Busch Gardens and want a nice afternoon nap. Not to pile on but our room was not cleaned for 3 of the 4 days we were there. 6 of their 8 hi tech touchpad controlled elevators stopped working and the huge crowds including a wedding party waiting for the elevators forced many to take the stairs. The drinking glasses in the rooms had some kind of blue slime on them.

First I want to say I have stayed at this property several times in the past and always given it top marks. When I learned that it was one of the two host hotels for the Gay World Series September 2 8 I was thrilled. The hotel went out of its way to make us feel welcome by among other things adding two bars in the lobby and adding a food station in the lobby since Champions is closed for remodeling. Additionally they gave us 25 off valet parking 21 vs 28 and took the unusual step of offering self parking usually valet only for 20 a night recognizing that a large number of participants would leave at the same time each morning. Anyone who is a Gold or Platinum member knows that the Concierge area at a Mariot can be hit or miss. This one is and has always been a total hit. The main reason is that the morning representative Carl Fuller has been there for over 18 years. He is a delight and remembers everyone and takes his job very seriously. Joyce Brown in the evening has been there about 15 years and is also sweet and wonderful at her job. The food day and night is plentiful and delicious. The Concierge level is closed after breakfast on Friday until Sunday night but if you are platinum they give you vouchers for a very extensive buffet in the restaurant and you can bring one guest per voucher. As to the rooms a total score. Very comfortable beds beautiful furnishings and an upscale bathroom. Safes and refrigerators in every room. Due to a situation beyond my control I ended up in four different rooms as the one I was promised in advance was accidentally given away prior to my arrival. But eventually I scored Room 2401 which has a balcony about five times the size of the room with sweeping views of the water and surrounding area. Besides Carl and Joyce I want to recognize Sabrina Bracken and Martin Watson who is a Guest Experience Supervisor. Sabrina went to great lengths to ensure I had a great time and Martin did everything he could to make my stay enjoyable. One quick tip. At booking request a room facing away from downtown. They are currently constructing a JW Mariot virtually across the street and my friends that had rooms even numbered said that it could be loud at times.

Wonderful Hotel. but a dog hanging over the desert buffet. Ew Have stayed at this hotel 4 times over the years. It is a wonderful property in a fantastic location. Directly on the River Walk which is beautiful. Stayed 4 nights over the 1st. Our room was very nice spacious and comfortable. The size of the TV the very comfortable beds the wonderful bathroom oversized shower. all amazing. Very very pleased. The breakfast buffet on the first floor is very good and has a large selection. The servers were very friendly. Pool area was nice. Check in went well. Valet parking went well. The room was perfect. Two small items I noticed. I am not a coffee drinker but saw the Keurig coffee maker so thought I would check it out. There was a used pod in it is chamber which was kind of gross and it appeared the pods in the box were not restocked. Again I am not a coffee drinker so it was just an observation and had no impact on my stay or to my rating. While laying in bed I noticed that the bottom two feet or so of the door to the balcony was all smudged. We noticed several dogs in elevators and areas of the hotel and heard one bark once when we were in our room. I do not know what the dog room policy is so I do not know if someone would have had a dog in the room before that smudged them or what. The concierges lounge was nice but was very very crowded and they appeared to run out of food every night. The desert buffet started at 730 but by the time we got there at 745 there was nothing much left except empty trays and used plates. Went back to check it out another night to see if they had anything. A man was carrying his small dog and hanging over the buffet line with it in his arms. While I am a pet owner myself had the dog been on the floor on a leash I would not have liked it but being carried and hanging over the desserts really really grossed us out so we left. The dog did not have service dog gear on. The attendants did not seem to care. The lounge breakfast attendants were exceptional. Would love to give a 5 because I feel a 5 represents the property and the staff but the dog hanging over the buffet line really grossed us out. Look forward to staying there again in the future.

The rooms look like they have been recently renovated and are relatively spacious and well designed. The bathrooms are nice with a large walk in shower with new fixtures. There is no tub which was fine with us. The service was excellent and the room service was not as expensive as I have seen at plenty of other hotels. You have the option of picking up the food at the front desk if you do n\u2019t want to pay a 5 delivery fee. There is a good sized nice pool and accompanying bar on the third floor which has a nice family vibe. The elevators are modern and fast with touch screens instead of buttons. The front desk staff was very helpful friendly and polite. There is a full service Starbucks connected to the lobby which is a nice touch. The hotel is located downtown near the hockey arena. The river walk is very close and the free trolley to Ybor City is right across the street. There are several restaurants and bars in the area and the convention center is across the street. Also it \u2019s a short drive to Hyde Park which has nice shopping and dining options. Some warnings a JW Mariot is being built across the street and wo n\u2019t be done until late next year so there is quite a bit of construction noise. Also the hotel is a popular place for weddings and galas so contact the valet well in advance if you do n\u2019t want to wait long for your car.
