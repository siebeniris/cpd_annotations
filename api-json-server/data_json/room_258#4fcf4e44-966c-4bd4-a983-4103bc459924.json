Had the opportunity to stay at Orchard Hotel for the second time this past week. The first time during a business trip last year by myself. Now with both my wife and son. We booked a Premier Room with King Bed. The bed and the room itself provides a cozy setting to come back to after a long day walking around. The downside is that the hallway leading into the room is a bit cramped you really feel it when you \u2019re pushing a stroller and carrying multiple shopping bags. The hot water in the shower and bathtub also takes a long time to warm up. Breakfast was great and I have nothing to complain about. There \u2019s Continental Japanese Indian and Chinese options available all of which tasted great. The egg station is in the hands of a robot which takes a while to get used to. You can choose to have omelette or sunny side up with the robot. The robot cooked omelette tasted pretty good. Did not really get to try out the facilities though I saw a pool and a gym. In line with the hotel using robots there are 2 robots patrolling the lobby that you can order bottles of water and towel to get taken up to your room. After the experience of the cooking robot I was n\u2019t quite ready to use this feature. I feel that the main plus point of this hotel is it \u2019s strategic location. It \u2019s located just as the road turns right into Orchard Road. It is also located next to a small shopping center called Claymore Connect. Though it does n\u2019t offer much in terms of shops the small shopping small has a supermarket for you to buy items you \u2019ve forgotten to pack or that you \u2019ve run out of during the trip.

We had two two day stopovers when traveling to Australia in this hotel in Sept 2019. We stayed here before but that was about 8 years ago and loved it and booked it again because of this experience. There were problems but in fairness to the staff they went out of their way to resolve it. My husband and I were traviling with our 11 month old son and booked premier club rooms in the orchard hotel to break up the trip to Australia. on the way to Australia we arrived early 9 am before check in and in fairness to the staff they advised that would have some rooms ready within a couple of hours which they did and we we are in a room by 11 am. The only problem which was a significant problem was the building works in the room next door where they were stripping the room back as part of the refurbishment programme. The banging and noise was horrendous. So we called recpetion and they immediately and without question moved and upgraded us to a signature club room which resolved the situation. The club rooms all come with access to the club lounge for breakfast afternoon tea and evening drinks and we can not praise the staff in the lounge enough for the way they looked after us particularly with our baby boy. They were attentive knowledgable and very helpful. The lounge is quiet with great views of the surrounding area as it is based on the 17th floor at the top of the building. The swiming pool area is a great area a really large pool and fairly quiet but great for us with our baby. The return journey we arrived late and booked a paid for late check out at half the room price to 6 pm. The room was a premier club room which is a great sized room and well equipted and on the 15th floor with great views. The staff again in the club lounge were brilliant. The only problem we encountered was on our last day with the late checkout. We had asked for our room to be tidied expecting bins to be emptied and bathroom cleaned but instead got locked out of our room by the hotel despite the preagred late check out. I would also note the holding deposit on my credit card which would have easlily covered this. So we had to get the room keys reactivated and then got some teas coffees and toilet rolls from house keeping which were on the floor. When finailising our bill we raised that we were disapointed with this part and they agreed to omit this charge from the bill.
