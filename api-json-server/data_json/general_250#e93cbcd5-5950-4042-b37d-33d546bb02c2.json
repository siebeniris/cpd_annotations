We have a winner bar none \u2026. I recently stayed again at the Four Seasons Vail. I should say that I decided to move out of the Arabele even though I had already paid for a 7 night stay. I will elaborate on that shortly. In many years visiting Vail we have stayed at The Lodge Ritz Carlton Arabele Four Seasons Sonenalp and private homes. Each of them had its charm and special benefits and perks however only the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton are fully devoted in providing the best service. If the size of the room and furniture is more important for you or walking to the lifts gondolas is a must you might have a different valuation but if you want to really feel at home FS and RC are the best. RC Pros. This are not rooms but condos. 23 4 rooms den kitchen etc. Huge as opposed to a hotel room. excellent service great valets and transportation. Cons. No restaurant just limited breakfast and lunch limited \u201c room service \u201d from Mariot. FS Pros Fully staffed hotel ski valet is the best in Vail perfect room service super attentive personnel transportation service good restaurant. Cons Have n\u2019t found one yet. If last year experience was great this year was just perfect. Ok 1 single issue the guest next room was snoring like a train. I turned on the humidifier and the gentle noise kind of washed away the bear \u2019s growl. The hotel is both classic elegant and modern in a mountain type of hotel. The room we have gotten last year and this year were excellent since I need a sofa bed for the kids in an adjacent room and half bathroom too. I understand all the rooms have a fireplace too. What really sets the FS apart is the focus they have to make you feel right at home and to provide nothing less but the best service. From the valet to the front desk the concierge the in room dinning ski valet restaurant housekeeping spa \u2026. it \u2019s just part of their DNAExamples1. We used the sofa bed. The girl from housekeeping brought 3 soft mattresses to make the bed as a feather bed. My 13 year old was so pleased2. The guys at the ski valet sent our skis to get waxed. They carried the skis all the way to the gondola every day helped my daughter getting her ski boots off and so on3. Last year a friend \u2019s spouse got injured. They lent me a wheel chair for 3 days at no cost4. Almost all the staff remembered us by name from last year visit \u2026 5. In room dining would always bring a perfect table even if it was just a juice and coffee \u2026 I could go on and on \u2026. I stayed in recent months at other Four Seasons locations including Costa Rica and Washington DC. All great but Vail FS have set the standard for all. Rafael Pazini the Director of Rooms and Residences has this hotel working like a fine Swiss watch. Do n\u2019t hesitate to ask for him if you have any special request he \u2019s always there for his guests. I left the Arabele and switch in a blink because they are so short on understanding the concept of service but still charge very much the same as Four Seasons if not even more. You \u2019d have to be on drugs to pay more for subpar service and attention. For details you can review my post on Arabele. Rafael please do thank all the staff for such an excellent work.

I really do not like to give bad reviews. We try to look for positives. But this hotel missed a chance to turn a negative into a positive. Everything was great to start with. Even the very mediocre and over priced breakfast was tolerable. I am sorry but 4 for one egg and 7 for 2 slices of toast. They should be life changing. Instead it was institutional food at best. I would not have written a review to complain about the food. What really ruined the experience was the housekeeping staff moved my flat iron. It was on the bathroom counter with all my toiletries so I knew where it was. They put it under the counter with the hotels hair dryer. When I packed up I did not realize it was gone. I got 3 hours away from the hotel and it dawned on me that I did not remember packing it. I called the hotel and they found it. First they wanted to know if I was coming back for it. I had already told them I was 3 hours away. Then they said they would send it and wanted to know if I wanted the credit card on file to be charged. If they had not moved my personal property it would not have been left. But they are charging me to send it back. Terrible customer service. Not what I would expect from this hotel. There are a lot of choices in Vail. Next time I will make a different one.

I am used to very good service being a Mariot Platinum Premier and Platinum for Life member. Mariot properties treat me extremely well. So I was looking at the little things that would rate the Four Seasons above other higher end properties in Vail and these are my observations1. The lobby area is nice with comfortable furniture lots of wood and a western feel. I liked the way the lobby area wraps around the bar area and spills out onto the gorgeous patio. The location is nice in the summer but not sure about the winter2. The romOur basic room was very large with a huge bathroom. Loved the shower head. This may have been the best hotel shower I have ever had. There was also a small bar area with an empty refrigerator which I enjoyed having to put water bottles diet coke diet Red Bull etc in. I dislike hotel mini bars and not because they are so expensive but because they only have crap that I do not like in them. For example I like sugar free Red Bull instead of the sugar Red Bull they always have. I did like that this bar area was well equipped with wine glasses and other essential items. Each room seems to have a little balcony with chairs and a table. The balcony was small but it was nice to be able to sit outside for some fresh mountain air. There was also a gas fireplace in the corner of the bedroom which would be nice in the winter. The bed was so so. Nothing special but at least it was not a beat up ski lodge bed. It did not sink down in the middle like many ski country beds do. Disappointingly my pillow flattened the minute my head hit it. I should have called and asked for a replacement but did not want to bother because I had already laid down for the night. The air conditioning would cut off in the middle of the night and it would get hot in the bedroom. I had to get up several times so the sensor would detect me and allow the air to turn back on. Another item we were a little short on electrical plugs in our room. Make sure you bring a power strip for all your devices because there is not enough3. The hotel areaThe hotel was in good condition with nice fixtures and furniture but I did not get a sense of luxury. Coming from the Mariot world I was hoping for some nicer furniture. In the morning I went down to get coffee at the coffee shop a little before 10 and they either did not open or were already closed. So I had to go down into the main restaurant to get a latte for my wife. A little inconvenient. When we went to the patio bar around 1or 2 pm everything was immaculate clean and pristine. When we went back later in the afternoon to sit down and saw that the cushions and firepit tables were all dirty. And they were not just dirty but filthy. We tried to clean them off but gave up and went to find another table. Which by the way was not entirely clean either but was by far the best. When we looked around we saw that all the tables and chairs were dirty on the balcony. At a Four Seasons I would expect that the chairs tables firepits would never be dirty. The wait staff might have been a little understaffed but at a Four Seasons I would not expect the wait staff to ever be understaffed. I expect superior service at a Four Seasons and would expect a table to be cleaned right after people left. I would never expect the table to sit there dirty for any length of time. Each one of the tables were empty when we walked up nobody had been sitting there for a while and they could have been cleaned up promptly. How could this happen at a Four Seasons. I realized then it was just another hotel. Additionally when we did find semi clean chairs it took 15 minutes to order a glass of wine. The wait staff just all walked by and no one asked if we had been helped yet. Way different from our earlier experience there when we were greeted immediately. The pool area there was a very small area and there were quite a few kids there when we went in the late afternoon. They were not unruly just a little loud for the small area they had at the pool. I did like that the towel guy helped us find a seat and set up our towels for us. that was a nice touch. The beautiful patio bar was full of families in the late afternoon. When we went to the pool there were two waiters but nobody ever stopped by to ask us if we wanted anything. It was very close to their closing time but they continued to serve and help all the other people there. They might have just been leaivng us alone or we might have been ignored. Not sure on that one but again this was a Four Seasons and I had a super high expectations for service when I walked in the front dor4. CheckoutWhen we were ready to check out I called down and asked Valet to pull the car around. We got our bags went down the elevator went up to the front desk and checked out. Took our time strolling through the lobby and then went out front. Our car was not there. Flagged down a valet guy and asked him to check on our car. There were two of them and they were obviously very busy running hard and were backed up. They went and got the car but it took a while. And the odd things is we were the only people outside waiting for a car. Again this is a nit picky thing but this was a Four Seasons and my expectation was for incredible service.

We were spoiled by the Four Seasons Teton Village with its 2 easy chairs and end table in front of our fireplace. The room we had at the Vail property could have easily accommodated this same arrangement but instead there was an awkward desk and an easy chair with ottoman stuffed into the corners.

I would have given this hotel 5 stars if it were not for the terrible WiFi. It may be harsh to dock them 2 stars for this but it is 2017 and when a luxury resort can not get WiFi right like any run of the mill roadside motel then they should be severely punished. It should be a basic amenity like a TV and phone. The WiFi was free but extremely slow. The bandwidth is throttled 09 MBPS and the hotels Director of IT even admitted that it was only useful for checking email. So forget about viewing pictures on your social media accounts or watching a YouTube video or using Netflix. They do offer enhanced WiFi for an additional fee. it is disappointing that the 170 night rate could not get me decent WiFi. Not to mention that the 45 night resort fee does not cover usable WiFi like most hotels that charge such a fee. Ironically enough for a hotel that offers WiFi from the dark ages they have quite an active social media team. They were eager to repost a photo of the resort from my girlfriends Instagram travel account that has 1610 followers. If we had decent WiFi she would have been able to post more photos and garner free publicity for the hotel who only has 690 followers. The team also quickly responded to my tweet about the terrible WiFi and put me in touch with the Director of IT for the hotel. After talking to him he was able to unthrotle my WiFi but I had to provide the MAC address for every device I wanted to use. Certainly not a workaround that is viable for your average guest. Even after the workaround however the WiFi would still stall intermittently. The director stated that the reason they throttled the WiFi was because it was not password protected so that the general public can use it as well without consuming large amounts of data. So basically I am paying 170 night and getting the same WiFi as the general public. Make a login page for hotel guests like most other hotels. it is very simple really just have them use their last name and room number. Everything else about the hotel was great. The ski concierge was fantastic. They had lockers with dryers for mitts and boots. Hot chocolate coffee warm cookies soup and other snacks for after skiing. Keep in mind however that the ski concierge is one of the amenities that they use to justify the mandatory resort fee. The regular concierge was great as well and was able to secure a table for me at Matsuhisa when it was fully booked on OpenTable. Housekeeping took care of little details as well such as leaving a little cleaning cloth for your glasses. Requested a toothbrush and they provided a whole dental kit that included toothpaste mouthwash and floss. They have a shuttle that takes you to the ski hill during the day and in the evenings they will drive you to Golden Peak or Lionshead in the house car. Vail Village is within walking distance. The suite had 3 TVs including one built into the bathroom mirror. The nightstand had a charger with connectors for about a half dozen different devices but was missing an Apple lightning connector. Fireplace was tricky to start instructions would have been helpful. Spa services were friendly and facilities were excellent. Really nice outdoor pool heated to 85 degrees.

The Vail 4 Seasons is an extraordinary hotel. We were greeted when we pulled up and escorted to the front desk to check in. Bryson Diamond did an excellent job getting us checked in and even escorted us to our room. The rooms are immaculately clean and very spacious. We had a double fireplace and double balcony room with an amazing view of the fall colors. They brought us a dog bed and dog bowls for our pup along with some treats. This staff is so accommodating it is like staying with family. Mathew Vega was The manager at the car valet and he was so helpful when we wanted to wander around the village after checkout. Me wife needed to get in the car to grab contacts and he politely escorted us to our car. They even loaded our bags up for us while we walked around.

The staff made a substitution of services that ended up being much much better than the massage could have ever been. Next I had champagne and fruit with a card in the room upon arrival.

Kind of. I ca n\u2019t believe I am writing a 3 star review of a Four Seasons. Jackson Hole Maui Las Colinas ORLANDO. All magical. Vail. Not so much. First they really should tell you at check in that renovations are ongoing on the property. This is totally understandable. I am in the Hospitality Industry. I have a degree in Hospitality. I \u201c get \u201d this business. But I have never NOT told guests about construction on a property. I moved rooms twice in this hotel. The first move was due to me asking for s balcony. To be fair our room category did say a few rooms did not have balconies. I called twice to emphasize how important a balcony is to me. I have never not had FS not fulfill a request. We go to our room no balcony. I was accommodated with a balcony for second room. 715 am we are awakened to the sound of steal piles being dropped over and over outside our balcony. I see a large group of construction workers preparing to construct a scaffolding in front of my balcony. I called to inquire about this and Shayna at guest services questioned whether or not that work was on the FS property. I further inquire as to another room location. I am told she can do this but I have to vacate my room at noon. The spa is very nice and Carol is a lovely person. The front desk person for the spa is very nice. An employee standing at the spa desk when my husband and I are trying to return our locker key after our \u201c relaxing \u201d massage. was loudly complaining how she met with \u201c the bride \u201c and she \u201c can not possibly do 7 bridesmaids \u2019 makeup by 130am \u201d. I assume at first. this woman is a guest so I waited. And I waited to not be rude. When I finally realized she was an EMPLOYEE I stepped up to speak to the other girl working the desk so I could return my key. She ignored me completely spoke over the top of me and continued to monopolize the spa attendant. I do n\u2019t know her name but she was white with blonde hair. I could not believe how rude she was. We finally get checked out and return to our room so we can hurry and have our bags out by noon. At 145 I called the desk and spoke to Shayna again. She said the bell staff was too busy to come at that time but would come in 15 minutes. 30 mins go by. I finally walked to the front and found out the bell staff was never informed to come to our room. I am extremely frustrated and hungry at this point and honestly had a bit of a meltdown. Thank GOD for the wonderful bellmen and concierge at this hotel. They saved the day. I ca n\u2019t say enough about Drew and Autro. The bellmen too. Very nice. We finally were given a nice room and I appreciate that. But I can not give THIS Four Seasons a very good review. I felt a general lack of urgency to accommodate the guest. I wanted to love FS Vail. I was rather shocked it seemed more like Hampton Inn. A few bright notes. Peachie at the pool was super great. So was the room service staff. Food was a hit and miss the white bean burger was delicious but a veggie wrap I got during our meetings promised feta cheese and contained goat cheese.", "offset": [1224, 1274], "date": "2019-07-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
