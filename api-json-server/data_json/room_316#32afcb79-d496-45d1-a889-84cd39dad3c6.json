Rooms not as snazzy as Palazo but nevertheless pretty darn nice and spacious too. can not think of another hotel with balconies on the Strip people have been known to jump after a run of bad luck and this is generally frowned upon. Nice to be able to open the doors for some fresh air. Check in very unusual for LV in that it only took a few minutes guess I was lucky to arrive between rushes. Check out was done on the TV for which there was no queue at all. Everything was clean the beds and bedding very nice though our housekeeping guy made them the wrong way around very good water pressure and there is even a microwave.

I am a Mariot Gold Elite Member and this place was wonderful to visit as such. It was my first stay at an Autograph Collection branded hotel. I could not be more pleased with my experience staying here. First off we scheduled our transfer from LAS airport through the hotel prior to our arrival. The limo was on time clean and a great way to start our Las Vegas weekend. Secondly the Autograph Lounge is where Elite Members can check in to the hotel without waiting in line with other guests. They also serve free coffee for the Elite Members here in the morning. This experience was great. The staff welcomed us and made a special note in their system that this trip was celebrating my sons birthday. From that moment on whenever we went to the restaurant or had any contact with resort staff they wished my son a Happy Birthday. This was a wonderful touch for my son that made him feel a little more special throughout the trip. A little extra recognition went a long way. And believe you me if you make my kid feel special you make me happy. The staff upgraded our suite upon check in. I have read many reviews on this site that have stated that Mariot Elite Members did not receive upgraded rooms upon checking in. I suggest that Elite Members pay for the initial upgrade from a standard room to a room in a higher category this action shows with their wallet that room quality matters. We did this and we were handsomely rewarded. I paid for the suite that I would be happy with and the resort rewarded me with a suite that I was thrilled with. We were upgraded to a large angled suite with an awesome view of the Belagio Fountain the largest balcony of any hotel suite that I have ever stayed in and there have been many two full sized bathrooms with the master bath being very large with a Japanese soaking tub and a second closet. It should be noted that many travelers who trek to Vegas spend very little time in their room and this hotel is very busy I recommend letting the resort know by booking a better room that you had appreciate a better room. Mariot Elite upgrades are based on availability. It would not make much sense for the resort to upgrade a traveler two tiers because they cheaply booked a room expecting an upgrade based on elite status. The fact is that lower end tier rooms book up and limit upward mobility via upgrades. I have had great success getting upgraded when booking above the budget traveler. My sons who had just turned eight years old birthday wish was to see Jef Dunham live. Planet Hollywood is directly across the street and a foot bridge connecting the two properties made it a safe and easy street crossing to see the show. We also arranged for cars to see shows at the Excalibur and the Rio. Charging the car service to your room adds to your Identity points and I earned enough points in one weekend to be comped one additional night stay for the year. Identity points are different from Mariot points and you will earn both for different types of purchases at the hotel. Everything spent in the room including room service will be credited as Mariot points all charges at the resort for spa treatments car services restaurants shops and gaming I do not gamble are credited as Identity points. Dining in the hotel is great. I had breakfast here twice and dinner once. I made it a point to eat at the World Buffet at the Rio as there is no better buffet in Vegas than the World Buffet. Holstein at the Cosmopolitan is AWESOME. A must try for a burger and alcoholic or not Milkshake. The Belagio is just to the north and the shops their Caesars Palace the Venetian are all an easy walk from the Cosmopolitan. The room entertainment system is great. We had two TVs and the selection of on demand movies was great. The in room entertainment system also made it easy to track charges to the room and to check out. This place is great and I can not wait to go back. This travel was during Super Bowl weekend and this place had great offerings ad venues for watching the game.", "offset": [2168, 2322], "date": "2015-02-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "6b65502d-5dd9-407c-9d64-a8867f4024fa", "sentence": "Beautiful Hotel. We stayed here for three nights mid July. When we came to check in we were offered an upgrade for an extra 28 per night. We took it. We had a terrace and a jacuzi plunge tub in the bathroom of our 55th floor room. We could see the airport from our balcony. Despite its central location we found it surprisingly quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful. It had complimentary wi fi which seemed fast and had no restriction on how many devices could be added. Unlike all the other hotel on are stay in the States the Cosmopolitan does not have in room coffee machines. We bought one for 16 across the road in Walgrens and brought it home with us. As it is a casino like most hotels in Vegas we could not linger in the casino area with our two children which was good as smoking is permitted indoors in Vegas. There are two pools one more for leisurely sunbathing with wicker in pool loungers and lots of around pool loungers and the other a little deeper for more activity although neither allow for much swimming. The bathroom was gorgeous with a spacious walk in shower lovely complimentary toiletries and twin washbasins. My only complaint would be that the door does not lock except for the door to the separate toilet inside the bathroom and there is a blind in the wall looking into the bedroom which is operated from the bedroom side so not much privacy if that is what you want. I would say this hotel is mainly for adults or families with older children ours are 14 10 and they loved it. Touches such as the stone statues giant shoes in the lobbies and the huge chandelier make for a very spectacular hotel. The Cosmopolitan is very large the lobbies are the size of shopping malls and there is a walk from the lifts to the pools or to the walkways out on to the strip. Whilst being large there are plenty of lifts to the different floors and we only had to wait a couple of minutes each time. We had a lovely stay and enjoyed this leg of our trip very much.

Stayed here in July for a conference. The lobby entrance is impressive. It is enclosed from the glaring Vegas sun and air conditioning is piped overhead however there is no relief from the heat in the area designated for people waiting for the airport shuttle. There are two pool areas and many restaurants and shopping. There is a connected walkway to Walgrens. Tip. Walgrens has a nice selection of wine and beer. We asked for a mini fridge for our room. We had a high floor with a balcony. great sound proof in the rooms we never heard sounds from the adjoining rooms or the street. Loved the walk in shower but the deep tub was too small. Nice too look at but the square shape offered an awkward semi standing position. The only negative is the smoke in the lobby and casino. It permates the restaurants.

Recently returned from a 7 day honeymoon trip to Vegas was our 3rd time to Vegas but 1st time stay in the cosmopolitan the hotel is lovely defiantly one of the nicest in decor and choice of bars restaurants is also very good we booked and paid for an upgrade of room to a strip view over looking belagio fountains only to be told upon check in that it was not available having paid an additional \u00a3 250 remember there are 300 rooms in this hotel. this did not go down to well but we just wanted to get settled in after a 10 hour flight we went up to our room which was ok not a patch on trump towers where we have stayed the last 2 times in Vegas. we found no bath robes loose light fittings and took pictures to show staff how dirty it was in various places we told them we wanted a room change and the room we originally paid forThey agreed that the room was not to an acceptable standard and we got moved eventually after having to contact them again to see if the room was ready after cleaning the views where amazing and were worth the wait to see all in all I would not stay again maybe we were not expecting the place to be so big and busy after staying at trump which is a non gaming hotel and much quieter with a much higher standard of customer service it was expensive to drink and eat in but I guess all hotels on the strip are the same when it comes to cost. If you do not mind noise and a 10 minute walk to check in and reception then maybe you will enjoy this hotel. it is is located very centrally on the strip so it is noisy and very very busy I personally would not stay in a gaming hotel again in Vegas as there is literally no getting away from hustle and bustle of it all. Ps do not move the stuff in the mini bar they tried adding on 120 of mini bar costs to our bill they are censored so any slight movement triggers and gets added to your bill they did remove these as they knew nothing had been replaced from the bar. Also remember nearly all hotels have daily resort fees that are an additional cost and at 30 a day Cosmo is one of the dearest and for the standard of cleaning house keeping and use of gym not really something I would do in Vegas anyway. and wifi it is highly priced but there is no getting away from it I am afraid.", "offset": [677, 1400], "date": "2016-05-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "4d75f663-2066-4262-8c8b-c059d6eed02c", "sentence": "21st Birthday Life Changing Experience. There is no other place to celebrate in Vegas. I am going to try and break this down into sections to make this as comprehensive as possible but the Cosmopolitan gave me the 21st Birthday of my Dreams. Location you are smack dab centre all access to everything there is no better location on the las vegas strip than this hotel. Check In Lines were long but moved quickly. We were able to pay our incidentals deposit in Cash helpful when travelling international not wanting to charge large sums. However I will note that due to this fact it gave us problems every time we tried to charge something to a room. Just a note. When he saw it was my 21st birthday the next day. he upgraded my room to a view of the Belagio FountainsRom I had a room with two Queens that could have easily fit 5 people. The Rooms all have modern TVs with internet access for Netflix Hulu Youtube etc. Sleep quality could nt be compared. I had no thermostat problems and no problems with shower pressure. There were not any handles in the shower and it was a little slippery though so do be aware if you are injured disabled. Customer Service Everyone at this hotel casino will go above and beyond for you. My mom arranged ahead of time for a cake balloons to be delivered and according to her everything went smoothly with the execution. Everyone the whole weekend wished me happy birthday and asked how they could make my stay better. It made me feel so special. Casino. The table minimums are higher. BUT if you come down early around 11 am you can catch them at a 15 minimum before they go up. I found the Wily Wonka machine and Wheel of Fortune machines were very loose just a tip. Had an amazing dealer named Calvin who said we should call him robert or the opposite. haha. who kept us at the table laughing for hoursMarque Night Club. We booked our table very early and got a 50 minimum and when we said it was my birthday offered us a bottle of champagne with the vodka of choice. We requested to be sat outside however due to weather were placed on the first floor. This is a smaller room with RnB and Hiphop. While I was having a good time I stated I had requested specifically not to be in this room and my host said he would do his best to accommodate me. Our server was really great and beautiful. Around 2 hours later my host came and said a table had cleared up upstairs next to the DJ. It was an amazing table and DJ Carnage was so good. I was glad we got VIP because it allowed us space to dance whereas the entire danceflor was genuinely sardined. Players Card Sign up AS SOON AS YOU GET THERE. I believe once you hit 500 points very easy. you get free brunch at Wicked SponRestaurants. EAT AT THE WICKED SPOON EVERY DAY. That is my biggest regret. Amazing food selection and service. I can not speak higher about it. We arrived late almost to closing and it was deserted. Egslut Also eat here every day and get here early because there will be LINES. We usually ate here in the afternoon. I think this is everything I wanted to cover but above all enjoy it. The hotel is everything and more everyone deserves the treatment they give you.
