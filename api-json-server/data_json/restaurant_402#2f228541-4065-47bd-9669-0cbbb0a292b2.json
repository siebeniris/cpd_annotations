Very insecure room charging system. I liked location of the hotel. It was walking distance of city attractions shopping malls Yara river etc. The view from the room was stunning. Breakfast was also very good. The staff. When I was checking in the girl that was working that day embarrassed me telling me that my credit card is not credit card and that they can not accept it because it is refused. She tried several times to use my credit card but she was confused and it seemed that she did not know how to use the POS machine. She was persistence telling me that my card is refused and that I should give the hotel my family members card number so that they can charge for their card my family was 18 0 km away. While she was doing that to me the line of the waiting guests was behind me. In the end I told her that I want to speak with the manager because my credit card was CREDIT card I showed her my booking confirmation I booked the hotel with the very same card. Finally she tried to write my card numbers manually and it finally worked. She did not even apologize. Very rude and very unprofesionalAlso when I was checking out I was in hurry taxi was waiting from me outside and I was waiting 15 minutes for someone to serve me on the reception. They told me there were some extra charges on my room number and that I had a drink in a bar on the second day of my stay. They wanted to charge me 30. The truth is that I was never in the hotel bar and I was never ordering anything from the bar in my room. I think the reason for that is very insecure system in the hotel where is enough to say your room number for everything but they do not actually require you showing them proof of your room number. I guess someone had a drinks in hotel bar and told my room number for charging. I still do not know if hotel is going to charge me for that but if they do I am going to sue them and request for security camera video tape of the day when I was apparently in the bar having drinks.
