This has been on our bucket list for some time so we were really anticipating our stay at Raffles. It was magnificent. The staff are among the best trained and helpful we have encountered anywhere we have stopped. Nothing was a bother and any request was done with the utmost care and attention every time. The greeting upon arrival was friendly efficient and caring. Within 3 minutes we were seated in the lobby with a Singapore Sling in hand after a 10 hour flight most appreciated. Check in to the room was handled as if we were going on a tour of the hotel and when we arrived in the suite it was worth every moment planning and waiting for. Time had stopped in this place and replaced with a beautiful suite of classical dimensions and modern finishes it was like stepping back into the pages of Singapore history. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary so the staff went to a great deal of trouble placing rose petals and towel swans on our beds thank you once again. The breakfast was of the same standard just exemplary name it and it would appear all types of breakfast and an incredible range of every food we could think of. The bakery is something special though especially the bread served for breakfast. Every possible item to make our stay enjoyable was supplied by the hotel. Sitting in the portico in front of the room listening to the hustle and bustle of Beach Road was made another experience by the water being sprayed onto the grounds truly memorable experience. I will not review the restaurant here but in another review as it was worthy of its own listing. I can only reiterate that this was a fantastic experience that we intend to duplicate next year.

This was the stay of a lifetime and totally worth it. From the minute I stepped out of the taxi welcome Ms we have been expecting you through the check in where I felt I was just sitting in the drawing room and not actually doing a hotel check to being escorted to my room. I knew that this was going to be special. And it was. My room was unique as all the rooms are and while I am not exactly sure which dignitaries have stayed there I felt like one myself. A large parlour fruit basket lovely and comfortable bed giant bathroom with tub and shower. And the mirror in the parlour that with the press of a button became a TV it was invisible until then. As a resident of Raffles you feel as if you belong to an exclusive club and you do. Access to the interior grounds are for residents only. Speaking of the grounds they are just beautiful. Marble walkways gorgeous plants and yes the travellers palm. it is a world unto itself. I had breakfast at the buffet in the Tiffin Room each morning and dined at the Indian buffet in the Tiffin Room one evening and the Long Bar Steakhouse another evening. Every meal was exquisite particularly when you realize that I am a vegetarian. you had think that naturally the Indian buffet would easily satisfy a vegetarian but the chef came out to check to see if the meal met my expectations yes. The Long Bar Steakhouse was able to accommodate me by converting a lovely salad and rearranging the salad so that it was beautifully arranged into the shape of a rose so delicious that I have returned home and have created something similar several times nowService is stellar. From the doormen the Singh brothers who are world famous in their own right to Rosle the concierge my butlers and everyone who touched me while I would expect nothing but the best I received over and above excellent service. I could barely think I needed something and there it was. There is a shopping arcade surrounding the main grounds with a unique variety of stores so there is no need to venture far to shop. The gift shope itself had interesting gifts including the ubiquitous kaya jam so delicious. and t shirts touting the Singapore Sling. And yes the Singapore Sling in the Long Bar is not to be missed. Lawrence the bartender in the evenings creates a magnificent Sling and does so with such flare sorry I could not make time to investigate the 24 hour shopping mall later onTake the history tour if you have time with Rosle. He is the perfect ambassador of Raffles he is enthusiastic knows everything there is to know and loves to share his knowledge of Raffles. The old world charm and elegance is even more enjoyable once you learn all about the history did you know it was originally beachfront propertyI highly recommend staying at Raffles.

There are many luxury hotels in Singapore. Among them Raffles Hotel which is said to be synonymous with Singapore is an awe inspiring hotel that people from all over the world would like to stay once they come to Singapore. We get the title of the best hotel from many groups every year and of course it is a 5 star hotel. Recognized not only in Singapore but throughout the world the hotel receives international celebrities each year. The Raffles Hotel which opened in 187 has received many celebrities such as writers celebrities and politicians as well as royalty and royalty including Prince Wiliam and his wife Cambridge for many decades. Yes. Located in the heart of Singapore this hotel is a huge favorite with guests and tourists alike. The white covered white chalk building is a colonial style with good old colonial relics creating an excellent contrast with nearby skyscrapers. Now it is a very popular Raffles hotel but from the beginning this building was not open we opened a bungalow with only 10 rooms as a hotel. Facing the front of the hotel is the Beach Road which at the time of its opening was called the beach house because it was by the sea. Later in 189 the current prototype colonial style building was completed and has received high praise from European countries as the finest facilities east of Suez.

We had a spacious and comfortable suite. the service was excellent. We liked te historic charm of Raffles. We had one excellent breakfast in the Tiffin Room. However at our one dinner in the hotel at the gourmet Chinese restaurant. the service was inexperienced and the food was poor. I ordered sea bass which arrived strangely on a bed of boiled egg white and was about the size of a silver dollar. also the room was frigid. A truly disappointing experience compared to our wonderful dining in other Singapore restaurants.", "offset": [328, 442], "date": "2019-09-18 15:16:51", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "b6b0e7da-00cb-41e0-a03f-140f4de1db5c", "sentence": "Second time at this hotel wanted a trip down memory lane 24 years have passed. What can I say Raffles. I message the hotel in advance of our stay advising them we would arrive around lunchtime. We had a specific request as one of our party suffers from mobility problems so needed a room on the ground floor courtyard suite. We arrived around midday it was nice to see Mr Narajan Singh I thought Wow things have not changed. We went through to the guest check in area I stopped to look around and at first I thought it looks good the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Once in the check in area at the back of the lobby Keith came over and welcomed us to the hotel he started to check our friends in first and I was pleased to see they had accommodated them near the hotel lobby and ground floor. Once he had finished with them and they were being shown to their room he came over to us and started the process. All was going so well deposit paid for both rooms paperwork completed he then announced to us that our room would be ready at 140 not a problem as we could go to our friends \u2019 room and sort out our stay over a drink. Once we arrived at our friends \u2019 room their butler was given them the orientation. She then brought the signature drink to the room Singapore sling for us to enjoy. Still on a high I asked if we needed to make reservation for the long bar as hotel guests in the past did not have to do so. She informed us the long bar had moved from its original position and now it \u2019s advisable to make a reservation. We promptly booked for our first night. I asked if we could make a reservation for four at the Tiffin room for the first or second night as we were only staying for 3 nights. I had eaten there in the past. As it was coming up to Diwai I wanted eat their again. She returned to inform us the restaurant was full booked for 2 nights they had group bookings. I was surprised as we are only four guests and it was only the 23rd of October. I let the other discuss what they wanted to do and I went off to see what has changed around the hotel. While looking around I passed the Tiffin room and went in to ask if they could squeeze us in sometime before we leave the manager was very helpful and explained we could eat on our last night as they had group bookings pressing for more information i found out the groups were not hotel guests. I understand the hotel has been closed for renovations and they have only just fully opened to the public so they need to pay for the renovations but not at the expense of paying guests staying in the hotel. This was an eye opener and slightly upsetting as it never used to be like that. By this time it was approaching our check in time. We went back at just after 2 to see Keith we sat down he came over and said our room was still not available and we were looking around 150. He kept apologising which was not what I wanted to here I said is this how you treat returning guests the hotel check in time is 140 so why is it we have to wait. I asked if the hotel was at fully occupancy he did not answer. I said so you have no room available to check us into. He replied No sorry I asked to see the manager time passed he eventually returned after I said I was thinking of checking out and returning to Marina bay sands. He said we do have a room ready and was going to take us to a Palm Court suite. it is now 3 hours after arriving at the hotel. I was very disappointed as this shattered all my memories of the lovely iconic hotel and the impeccable service offered. Once in the room we could unpack and start to enjoy our time here putting all the disappointment behind us I went to the pool and relaxed. CJ the bar man made sure we were looked after big thank you to him. We enjoyed the facilities of the hotel and we did eat in the Steak and Lobster restaurant in the hotel complex. While at the hotel the lady with mobility problems took a seat in the lobby while we waited for out sightseeing guide to arrive. This was for approximately 10 minutes mid afternoon. She was asked if she had booked afternoon tea to which she replied no just waiting for the rest of my family to arrive she was told she could not sit near the entrance as the tables are all reserved for afternoon tea. A few minutes later we were on our way out for our trip around Singapore the lobby is reserved for afternoon tea visitors to the hotel with no additional free seating for paying guest of the hotel. This hotel has definitely changed in the way they are so money orientated putting paying guest behind visitors Shame on you Raffles. I did visit the Writers bar very nice staff helpful and friendly good selection of drinks and a relaxing environment. The ballroom has completely changed losing its old worldly charm it \u2019s now so modern you could be eating in a restaurant in any city in the world. I used to love this place having dined there when I was not staying at the hotel for the atmosphere and food. The only original thing left is the oak stairs leading down to the restrooms. Everything else has been ripped out and replaced. I am so sorry to say this will be my last time staying at Raffles. I think the makeover of the hotel has taken away the old worldly charm it had they had a unique selling point which in my eyes they have lost trying to create what chain hotels do so well modern and characterless. I am thankful I have the memories from 24 years ago of the amazing hotel and how it used to be.", "offset": [3137, 3297], "date": "2019-12-29 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "c48e12e0-ae7f-4d25-b2e5-678a3511f9ca", "sentence": "Over priced and over rated. I would not waste money on this grand dame. The newly renovated hotel is beautiful but service is lacking. I called ahead to ask when I could check in and was told 2 pm. I arrived at 130 pm to test and sure enough I walked into my room only at 230 pm. If you are a regular at this hotel you would get great service. A table near the buffet was available and I did not see the Reserved sign. When I asked if I could sit there I was told that the table was reserved for a couple. A Regular they said. The rest of the dining room was full so we opted to sit in the courtyard. Food was adequate. It was not unbelievably good but very decent. Our room was on the ground floor near to Beach Road. The first night we could hear people above us walking back and forth at 2 in the morning. It was not a restful sleep. Overall I would not recommend staying at this hotel. Use the money for something else. Something more tangible and long lasting. For me once was more than enough.", "offset": [666, 718], "date": "2020-02-03 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}]}
