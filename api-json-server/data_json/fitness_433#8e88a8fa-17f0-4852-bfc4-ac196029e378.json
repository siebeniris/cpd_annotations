First you are greeted by the doorman with a huge smile many more of those to come. Then we are brought to the front desk area where we are asked if a rum punch would sound nice why yes it would we reply. What a fantastic way to be introduced to Barbados. When at our room we find a lovely and spacious suite. We open the glass doors to the rear and walk outside stepping right onto the beach crystal clear blue and magnificent. During our stay the staff could not have bigger smiles on their faces always making us feel welcome. I must say the property was amazing but the staff really makes this place extraordinary. The property has numerous activities on premises the best being the daily afternoon swim with the turtles. You are brought out by one of the staff members to the location can not remember their names both were great and all equipment is provided. It was literally just a 5 minute walk down the beach. It is very difficult to say what would be the best part of our trip considering how many fantastic experiences we had but having numerous sea turtles mom size all the way down to baby size swimming around you as you float there is at the top They were friendly and curious swimming right up to you to say hello. We even tried paddle boarding for the first time. Afternoon tea was totally enjoyed and complimentary.

If you are booked for here relax and ignore some of the negative reviews. We are pretty picky and we thought his was great. Good things great setting. we have never had a bedroom closer to the sea beach and sea are picture perfect. We walked for miles in bare feet swam in the sea every day. Just a joy. Swimming pool is not enormous but we did not have a problem getting beds and the pool service was just fine. Have to say the staff seemed to get around the beds by the pool more often than the beds on the beach. Concierge was great at getting dinner reservations taxis etc. Taxis are expensive. But the reggae bus during the day is not it is easy to use and frequent and certainly something different. Seemed perfectly safe to us. Gym was well equipped and the wifi worked well everywhere. Both essentials for us and so often neglected areas in lesser hotels. Why I have no idea it costs peanuts to have a working gym and wifi. it is a service industry for goodness sake. We ate out most nights but really enjoyed the night we ate in a buffet with a reggae band. It takes a bit to get me on my feet and dancing but not that night and the staff likely to be seasoned judges were obviously enjoying the band too. I could go on and on. The gardens and birds humming birds monkeys. the cheery chambermaids. swimming with the turtles. even a little Premier League foty discretely done in the bar this is not a sports bar thank goodness or in the room if you want it. Well done everyone. So what would it take to get from excellent to outstanding. Well if I am honest while every other member of staff was above and beyond we felt service at breakfast and afternoon tea in Taboras lacked smiles never mind warmth. there is something wrong there and it is an area I had be looking at as a manager. do not get me wrong. it was not a dreadful experience but we did feel that the staff had the attitude that they could run a really good breakfast if all these guests stopped coming. A shame when everything else about this place was SO good. We loved our second visit to Barbados. it is under our skin now. there is lots of the world left to explore but I reckon we will be back here for a dose of winter sun regularly. Direct flight a few hours longer than the Canaries and a time difference but better weather beach sand architecture and with lovely people and general ambiance. it is no contest.

This is our 2nd visit to the Fairmont however this time we have a tiny human who is nearly 2. The hotel itself is located on a fantastic beach on the west coast. Simply step out of your room and you \u2019re on the warm golden sand and into the stunning turquoise bajan sea. Put your snorkeling gear on and swim with turtles and rays. Plus Ryan in the water sports department does a daily activity taking guests out to swim with turtles and feed them. The hotel itself is wonderful. A boutique venue small enough to make it special but busy enough to have atmosphere. The team at the Fairmont offer a great service and have a warm and friendly culture. It was nice being welcomed back by the same people we met on our 1st holiday there. If you can afford it I highly recommend getting a beach front junior suite. There is nothing better than stepping out of your room onto the beach and into the sea. However all rooms have oceans views and the hotel is only 3 stories high. There is plenty to do nearby. You can walk down the beach to the Lone Star restaurant highly recommend eating here get a taxi into Holetown 5 mins away there are boat trips etc. and the hotel offers various free water sports. Plus turtles nest on the beach and we have experienced both watching a turtle lay her eggs and babies hatching. Our toddler who is nearly 2 really enjoyed being there and the hotel catered well for him. There were other families with children of a similar age.

Even before we arrived the staff at the Fairmont had started to take care of us we had emailed in advance asking about transfers to and from the airport. The Concierge contacted us promptly giving us details about price etc. We were driven to and from the airport in a smart clean large BMW saloon with professional and courteous drivers. Once at the hotel we were greeted promptly and made very welcome. All the staff were very friendly always. The hotel and grounds are kept spotlessly clean by the plentiful staff. The gardens are worth a closer look as the staff are so obviously proud and knowledgeable about the plants and will gladly take you around and show you. The main advantages of this hotel are 1. it is location on a really beautiful beach home to turtles we consider ourselves privileged to have swam with them on several occasions thanks to Ryan from the watersports. We were also so lucky to have seen baby turtles hatching and making their way to the sea2The rooms are spacious and well apointed little things making big differences like comfortable loungers on the balcony where we enjoyed our morning coffee and sundowners loving the spectacular sunsets. 3Special touches in the bathroom like loofahs good quality toiletries mouthwash etc. Plenty of storage space 26 hangers. I counted. Cotton bathrobes etc etc. My husband has cautioned me about waxing lyrical about this hotel as he says he had prefer it to be kept like a secret so that we can always return and not be disappointed by it being full.

Michael was proactive in spotting our favourite sun beds and offering to reserve them and put towels out each morning which he did. it is easy to completely relax here in the humidity it was hard to do much at all. However do go swimming with turtles as that is stunning they have several and one is huge and you can touch them and swim with them completely brilliant. Ryan on water sports is fabulous and if you go swimming with turtles with him it is even more extraordinary as he feeds them and plays with them and helps people get good photos etc. Ryan also taught us to paddle board which was fun. Restaurant Cafe Taboras had great breakfast buffet with fresh cooked eggs any way you wanted smoked salmon huge range of options get this included in the room rate for best value. Afternoon tea a nice touch too. Ate there for dinner and one lunch and food consistently very good. My daughter is still craving their Caesar salad with king prawns which is the best she is ever had.
