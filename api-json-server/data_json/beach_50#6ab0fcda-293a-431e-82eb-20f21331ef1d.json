The Savoy Hotel Beach Club 425 Ocean Drive Miami Beach is a beachfront semi upscale 2 acre resort style hotel. It is enviably positioned just on the fringe of South Beach in a quieter district known as SoFi South of Fifth Street which is characterized with a significantly more peaceful aura than the boisterous life of South Beach. However you are only a stone throw away from these shenanigans if you desire to do so. The hotel buildings are somewhat landmark and sport an Art Deco vibe. As I drove up to this enticing hotel I conjured up a view of the exterior as looking like Snow Whites castle void of the 7 dwarfs and this impression exuded a calm cool and clean demeanour. The entrance shined with a polished marquis and columns dot the lobby spaced with tropical plants befitting the area. Pumped up leather leather furniture with sparkling and colourful ceramic tile round out the decor. It became obvious from the greeting at the reception that this venture was family run and no doubt influenced the pride of ownership that displayed itself throughout the hotel in an impeccably clean and well maintained fashion. My room was decorated in a coastal style with lots of light blue sky and Florida green scape embedded in the tile patterns. It had a balcony very small but the view was on the polside so I was afforded a great view of the watery complex and a touch of the ocean. The bath was adequate and equipped with all the amenities needed. The onsite restaurant The Savoy Restaurant is handy for guest grub and was exquisitely decorated in white sofas chairs and tables with more blue sky walls and a shot of the dramatic with a splash of red decor. The restaurant has a polside terrace that is very homey and a bar that overlooks the pool that is a god send in the brutal Miami heat. Now the crown jewel of The Savoy is the winning pool beach combination. The hotel has 2 pools 2 sundecks is all decked out with lounge chairs umbrellas cabanas towels and the like all orchestrated to accommodate your sweat prevention needs. Of particular note are the lavish gardens and tropical plants that adorn the pool grounds in the usual spotless fashion. The pool area has a gate leading to the beach no password required. The beach area just off the pool complex is 200 feet of pristine private ocean front. Hotels with this sort of beach access are as scarce as hens teeth as most hotels reside on the non beach side of Ocean Drive. A very desirable asset indeed. It is beautiful and I walked the sugar white sand and tickled my toes in the ebb and flow of the water. I came across a 2 storey vacant lifeguard station painted in a rainbow of colours. I went up to the top looked out over the ocean and I pretended I was in Baywatch. Back to the lagoon pool for a swim and a sun layout. I ended up deep fried. In the evening I eat drank on the restaurant terrace with the lagoon and gardens all lit up. It was impressive and I toasted my stay as great. So if you want a quieter South Beach an oxymoron place with substantial accommodations and an over the top pool arena with direct access to a secluded slice of Miami Beach try The Savoy Hotel.
