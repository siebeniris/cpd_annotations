Just returned from staying 5 days in this wonderful hotel sharing a room with my daughter who was there for a conference. I was wowed from the time I stepped out of my Uber car and someone was immediately there to assist me with my luggage and point me to the front desk. Right inside the beautiful and impressive entry two employees greeted me. At the front desk the pleasant and knowledgeable man knew exactly what to do get me early check in at no charge and free wifi. He explained their rewards simply and completed the transactions quickly. He was happy to make sure I got the type of room requested when reservations were made. In the elevator an employee greeted me and asked if I had any questions. realizing I had just checked in. When I opened my room I was immediately impressed with cleanliness and the appealing look of the beds. they were as comfortable as they looked. It was nice to have a small fridge and a safe in the room. All the rooms have a beautiful view of the area. The carpet upholstered chairs and bathroom were all in good condition not worn looking. The neutral decor was tasteful and appropriate for the desert area. The art work was also of local plants. The only time I heard bathroom noises from next room was when I was in the bathroom and they were slight. Very quiet romsThey offer a 5 credit per day if you do not want your room cleaned. We did it once and the maid simply slipped a credit voucher under the door. I enjoyed using it on lunch one day. One can also redeem for 500 reward points. Every time I encountered a maid they were so friendly and nice. I spent lots of time at the pool. The view from the end of the pool area is great. During the week there was few people and plenty of chairs and lounges. On Friday and Saturday afternoons everything filled up so get there before 3. when most conferences let out and people check in. They have plenty of beach towels. They have a nice bar area at the pool and someone did come around when it was not busy to take orders. A couple of mornings the pool looked like it had not been cleaned and some tile needs to be repaired but otherwise it was adequate. I loved that they had a nice restroom accessible from the pool areaI enjoyed a couple of lunches in the dining room. They have a good menu and most of the entrees are 9 including the chefs trio. The grilled Brie sandwich was my favorite. The trio the day I tried it was delicious too. Both times my servers were delightful and attentive. One afternoon the hotel had a fun candy bar. two units of shelves with lots of big bowls of candy like mms gumies etc. and they had several containers of infused waters. What a nice treat for guests. Except when people were going to and coming from conferences the elevator wait times were very short. And even then it was not that bad. Many times I had elevator to myself. I can not remember when I have had such a wonderful all around experience in a chain hotel. After this experience I would be much more likely to stay in a Sheraton again. I hope all of them have the same high standards for quality and service.", "offset": [1492, 1528], "date": "2016-04-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "824bc0c7-8daa-4d42-93ca-c1c0878b7267", "sentence": "Luxury Location. did I mention luxury and location.
