Unfortunately they had fires very close by about 2 weeks before our stay so some of the scenery driving to it was just so sad to see the burned trees and some of the trails around it were closed but this review does not count that b c it is not in their control. I had a conference there and the meeting rooms were fine lighting sound food space etc. all fine. You could hear the kitchen serving staff in the kitchen prep area loudly talking through the walls though and was distracting a bit. The room was fine some nice finishes and depending on where your room is had some beautiful views. The outdoor pool was closed in Sept The indoor pool was busy. I liked the workout room had what you needed and had updated equipment. You could use the locker rooms for free and it had a dry and steam saunas. When I signed in for the spas every night they gave me a spa robe which I actually ended up buying b c I loved it so much and sat in the saunas every night. The locker room is nice with showers dressing areas. etcquite spacious. I could have sat in the spa waiting area by the water feature and listened to the sound and relaxed for hours.

The caf\u00e9 deli was nice for muffins snacks light boxed lunches coffee and other drinks. You could order a packed lunch for the next day and pick up on your way out hiking or exploring the park which I thought was a great idea. We ate dinner once at Jackolopes Bar and Grill. I would not recommend it. The waiter was nice but told corny jokes and was slow possibly just busy with not enough staff. The food was EXPENSIVE and only mediocre. They definitely charge a lot b c they realize there are no other places to eat around the lodge area. I can only imagine the price of their other more upscale restaurant Embers. We left dinner totally unimpressed. Coworker had the same experience expensive mediocre food long wait at 6 pm did not go back. The front desk staff was very nice and the concierge was so helpful and friendly to give us great hiking maps and ideas for things to do in the park. Def. use the concierge services it is free.

The last time we were there they had not yet started their remodeling and thus were great but a tad bit disappointed. Since then they have completed the remodel of their rooms and it is a big improvement. To start the entrance to the hotel front is the same. It has a big entry you can give your car to the valet without a fee but tipping is courteous of course and the folks that greet you as you arrive are warm helpful and very friendly. The room that we had was 471. what is rather strange and a tad bit confusing is that in order to go from the reception desk to the room are you either 1 take an elevator to the second floor then walk across a long hallway and across the balcony overlooking the highly chlorinated indoor pool then go a short distance to the elevator or the stairs to get to the forth floor OR 2 a short walk across outside past the outside pool and back into the building to catch the elevator that takes you to the fourth floor. So if you do not like walking this section of the hotel is not for you. If you are like my kids it is a race to see who gets there firstwhat is interesting is that if you enter from the back parking lot you will recognize the ancient sofas that have been there forever. I do not understand why those sofas after having boasted major renovations would still be there. Get rid of them please. Also if you are on the second floor you need to expect a strong smell of chlorine coming from the indoor pool. And my impression is that people with dogs pets are allowed here occupy the two lower floors. The room itself if a big upgrade. I can not really complain but not get excited either. The new bathroom counters which are a bit low look like granite but feel like plastic. I can see why they would do this since there is a lot of use from multiple families. It does not bring about a sense of luxury but it works fine. The shower on the other hand is lackluster. There was insufficient water pressure. I asked the front desk to take a look at the water pressure in the shower especially since the water pressure coming into the tub was really good. But they never looked at it. I also told them that the latch to the room door was getting loose. Plus I mentioned that there was dog poop outside on the walking area adjacent to the pool outside. Unfortunately none of that was taken care of. Most interestingly the poop just stayed there for the entire weekend with everyone walking by and occasionally moving as it spread cross the path. I realize this was Thanksgiving weekend but please. But I digress. The highlight here is that the hotel is only 3 miles from the south entrance to Yosemite and if you leave before 830 it is a straight smooth shot into the national park. Plus the ice skating rink though simple was very nice for our daughter. She skated every night that is 4 nights that we were there. Costs money but it is worth it for her. She made a friend during the time and they skated a couple of nights together. Turns out they are from our general area of the neighborhood South Bay in the Bay Area. And the giant Christmas tree was absolutely beautiful along with all the gingerbread houses that kids built on display and all the little touches made it nice. But let us talk about the whole Thanksgiving weekend thing. First the Thanksgiving feast was yummy but let us face it there is no way to make a dinner for a large group of people feel special. It just felt like a cafeteria and it is not worth the high price for the dinner. But then again it is hassle free so that is good and the kids are happy. You do have the option to go to their other 3 restaurants plus a separate less festive buffet. The tree lighting ceremony was rather anti climatic so do not make a point of going there for that. There are kids singing before the lighting and Santa and the elves made their rounds. But as for the lighting it was just the hotel manager making a speech and Santa having a child plug in the lights. Santa never made a nice speech there was nothing magical happening and the funny thing is that the light they turned on was the same lighting that they had in the previous nights. For some reason I expected that something else would be shining after Santa plugged it in. Big disappointment. One really cool thing though is that the kids can sit with Santa and take a photo. The line was long but after 30 minutes we came back and we only had a 3 minute wait. The strange thing is that they have a professional photographer who took the photos and you could buy the photo with your ticket number. But I never figured out where to buy those photosit is important to balance the ugly with the really good. On one day our kids were sent to the Adventure Club where they met with Amandia. She was so awesome. the kids never stopped talking about her that day. She and our two kids did archery rock climbing and ice skating all in a span of a few hours. She took really good of our kids and they were really really happy. As far as food we ate our breakfast buffet everyday. It comes out to something like 75 for the 4 of us each morning but it is worth it. there is enough variety and the food quality is fine. The staff are all very good. As for dinner we ate at their buffets a couple of times. Once it was BQ another Italian food. I think the third night was basically what was left from the Thanksgiving dinner. Nothing special and the atmosphere is lacking but that is what you get when you set up the dinner in a large convention room. But with kids it is worth it because they can pick whatever they want and there is no waiting for food. Overall this was a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend. The national park itself was rather empty on Thanksgiving day and we had moments when we had the surrounding area to ourselves. It filled up fast two days later. it is nice to have a nice resort just a few miles from the park. My impression is that Tenaya Lodge and the Ahwane make the top two hotels in the area I may be wrong but that is my impression. There was no snow at this time and it sure does not look like there will be much by Christmas. Hopefully there will be enough snow for the sleigh rides that are planned in the area.

The only down side to the cleanliness is that the shower head was covered in hard water stains. I can understand how some people comment about noise from the hallways. The hotel was supposedly only 20 full and we could hear plenty from the rolling bags and other guests. I could only image what this is like when the place is booked. It was a little hard to find the archery field during MLK weekend since it was moved away from the permanent signs. Lucky for us a nice employee helped us locate the area. Be warned that at least the temporary place is not easily accessible and requires a little hiking.

We were SO excited about going to Yosemite and staying at Tenaya for my birthday present. We upgraded to a King Cottage Room which is not in the main lodge primarily because it had a fireplace and private balcony and we thought we had enjoy that. We WANTED to enjoy that but when we walked into our room it was a chilly 63 degrees per the thermostat. We turned on the switch for the fireplace and nothing. Called the front desk was told sometimes you have to wait a few minutes for it to come on and I told her it had been about 15 and that it was 63 degrees. About 20 minutes later the tech arrived and fixed the fireplace GREAT. We left and went to the Spa had dinner came back to the room and you guessed it fireplace was not working again. Called front desk again. Repeat. Same tech came out and said he can fix it again temporarily but it needed a repair job as the thermocoupler was not engaging with something and he would put in an order to fix it the next day. We told him we had be out all day on a tour and he said he had put it in for someone else to repair the next morning. Tired from our drive and our hike we got ready for bed pulled the covers down and there was a gross stain on the sheet. At this point it was 10 pm we have already had a technician out twice and we just wanted to go to bed so even though I was grossed out. I put a towel down and slept on that and the most uncomfortable mattress and pillow ever. the mattress was sunken on the side and heard every creak on the floor and plumbing sound from the people upstairs we were in the Redwood Cottage. Next day we were gone from 7 am to 8 pm on an amazing tour and dinner got back to our cottage opened the door and OMG it was 90 DEGREES in the room and the fireplace was on FULL BLAST. We turned it off opened the doors and windows for the next 2 hours to try and cool the room down our room was so hot that a bottle of wine we had brought was hot to the touch as were the clothes in the dresser drawers. Needless to say we were never able to enjoy the Cottage Room with the fireplace. When I told the front desk after the first morning about the sheets they apologized and sent someone to change them which they did. Clearly there were previous issues with the fireplace as there was a big black smudge right by the fireplace control on the wall the tech even asked if we wanted him to send someone to clean it and said he was surprised it was not cleaned. The positives. Customer service of those we dealt with personally was great front desk valet restaurant and spa employees were all very friendly and helpful. The food in the restaurants was good. The grounds were well kept and it looked like they had a lot of activities available. The negative in regards to service is that clearly someone made the bed with a sheet with a big stain on it. Someone walked past the big smudge on the wall right by the front door more than once. Someone who repaired the fireplace left it on full blast knowing it would make our room unbearably hot. Hence my mixed review. Would I recommend a Cottage. No way. It is not a stand alone room it is a building with 2 3 rooms and every single noise was heard. Day of checkout the same person who I had talked to about the sheets was at the front desk and when I told her about the 90 degree room she was SO apologetic and remembered our conversation about the sheets. and she was aware of the fireplace issues. She said ours was what they call an anomaly stay and apologized profusely. She knocked off some money to compensate for our upgraded room not being an upgrade at all which helped but it was still so disappointing. On the plus side Yosemite was SO beautiful and our tour was AWESOME Discover Yosemite Tours Glen was our guide. that I was not going to let our experience ruin our trip.

Mediocre Cottage. This property it super cool. Since the hotels in Yosemite Valley oftentimes book out 1 year in advance this property is located few minutes drive from the Yosemite National Park entrance and is a great alternative if you want to be close to the park. it is a great primary choice as well. I had recommend it. They have multiple room options in their Lodge Cottages or Cabins. The Lodge is their main building where all the restaurants spa pool etc are located. The Cottages and Cabins are nearby. I can not speak about the Cabins but I was told by the maintenance man that they recently finished construction on these rooms this year. I suspect the Cabins account for the trendy rooms that you may see on various websites. The Lodges interior design had an earthy cabin feel. Everything was in great condition. We stayed at the Cottages which was a 1 2 minute walk away from the Lodge. Our Cottage had a total of 3 dwellings. Honestly I was not impressed with them. Our neighbors had small kids so every time they were around we could hear them loud and clear. The interior was overall well maintained but design is a little older. It was clean but not up to par with what I prefer. There was also a weird odor in the room but I suspect it was due to lack of air circulation. Once I turned on the wall AC unit overnight and ceiling fan the odor went away. Speaking of the AC unit is LOUD. so add that to the noise level. They do have a neat fireplace that you can turn on for heat. Ours however did not turn on unles the maintenance man did something to the fireplace. Once we lost the fire we gave up trying to turn it on again. You ask why was the maintenance man in your room. Well our TV remote died as well. They came to replace the battery. All minor stuff but it contributes to my level of comfortthat is the end of the bad stuff. Now onto good stuff. Customer service was AMAZING. Everyone from the valet to front desk to maintenance to servers was so helpful and kind. I felt welcomed and at home there. We had a minor issue with our booking and they credited us money on top of giving us free breakfast for 2 days. The maintenance guys were very nice were quick to arrive and eager to help. Amenities anything you can think of indoor pool outdoor pool movies at night live band rock wall archery free smores spa fitness center morning yoga on the balcony. it is like a resort. You do not even need to leave. Unfortunately our timing did not work with the spa schedule so we were not able to experience any services. I was able to walk into the bathroom. They had a sauna showers lockers etc. Everything smelled so relaxing and good down there. The best amenity in my opinion was the DAY TOUR of Yosemite. it is a full day tour that meets at 715am and returns around 5 pm. They take you around in this van and bring you to various destinations. The van is a custom made van that can be made roofless. kind of like you are driving around in a convertible van. it is extremely nice because we were exposed to the outdoors. Cool van aside since we were on an organized private tour we got to skip the ridiculously long lines private vehicles had to wait. Our guide was Amanda. she is great. she is great with kids and very entertaining to the adults. she is a great story teller. We went to Embers and Jackaloupes. Food was tasty and of quality. Free smores quenched my dessert craving. Also free Wifi and parking.
