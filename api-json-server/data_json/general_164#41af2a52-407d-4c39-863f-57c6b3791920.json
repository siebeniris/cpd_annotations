My Top tip would be to upgrade to a superior suite as an alternative to all inclusiveAl inclusive was an aditoinal \u00a3 100 a day each aprox. However upgrading to a superior room provided access to the lounge on the fifth floor which provided snacks and soft drinks during the day. I generally only eat two meals a day especially when it starts with a huge breakfast a banana and a some light snake snacks suited me. There is also a cocktail hour with complimentary beers and shorts. The superioir rooms were very impressive. The standard rooms were nice enough I was not quite sure they were five stars but the suites were very good. This really was five star standard. The food was very good great breakfast selection. Room service lunch and evening meals were very good. I think this was one of the best value hotels in Dubai. Family friendly etc. Nice beach not too crowded in March. Clean sandy snorkeling was ok if you went out far enough. The pool got busy after 930 but not overly. There are no 6 am towel merchants and the people were generally nice. Very good Gym facilities Squash courts well stocked gym table tennis table etc. The majority of the staff were excellent with one or two of the front desk staff not quite being up to the standard of the others. Not poor service by any means but not as high as some of their peers. Some information was n\u2019t very forthcoming. There are some things around access to the farcicalities that could be better advertised.

Just back from 11 nights at the JA Jebel Ali Hotel. My husband and I had an amazing holiday. The hotel was lovely and very clean. The staff were all very attentive and friendly. Big shout out to Dev Josh Laxman and Miriam. All so helpful and friendly. The food at this hotel is second to non. We have dined in many top restaurants and I would rate this hotel as the best food we have ever had. The steaks in the Italian and shooters restaurants were the best ever. With 9 restaurants to choose from you never get bored. The fish restaurant was amazing too. Need to book tables when you arrive as they all get booked up. Beach and pools are lovely. There is a free shuttle to Dubai which takes 35 mins and a trip up the Burj Khalifa the worlds tallest building is a must. We also did a two hour speedboat trip from the marina at the hotel and would highly recommend it. We had all inclusive and it is the only way to go. The food is extremely expensive if you were to pay as you go. For two of us we would have spent around \u00a3 25 at day on food and drink and we are not big drinkers. One small criticism was that some drinks were all inclusive in one bar and then not in another. The hotel could easily rectify this though. We met so many lovely people there who go back every year and we will certainly be joining them again next year. Extremely good value for money and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

The JA Beach hotel is quite an old hotel which has had a lot of work done to bring it up to modern status but the experience there was n\u2019t without flaw. The Hotel. Old building vintage elevators and a complete air of old school building and layout. Definitely not a deal breaker but one must know this has been around for decades and it shows age. Not a building you \u2019d want to photograph next to. Everything is wide and laid out in a way that everything is external. The gym. It \u2019s outside the hotel and a 5 minute walk. The Room. Fully updated and is quite modern. It is easy to mistake these rooms are from another hotel once inside. Great layout space and features. Our bathroom looked literally brand new. All the modern day essentials are there and the room service are exceptional at bringing you anything you need. The Service. Top notch great service quick effective and always around to support. Requested many things during my stay and everything taken care off nearly instantly. Bonus points for attention to detail. 1. Stated that we were attending for an anniversary and they had sent out a complimentary cake. Why is that relevant. Because 2. When the cake arrived we called to ensure it was clear of nuts. due to nut allergies and when later called room service for dinner they called back to state it had nuts. Not mentioned when ordering food but they recalled from the cake. Brilliant. Facilities. The hotel sits amongst a few other hotels of the JA resort and are almost all accessible. The gym is far and quite sad looking. Put me off exercising. There are 4 pools in total only one of which is private and all the pools are along the beach. Great for mixing experiences. Plenty of greenery and a stable that \u2019s a walk away. Even if you do not book any riding lessons it \u2019s accessible and can visit to see horses and ponies walking around. Food. This might be their biggest downfall. Aside from the hotel buffet and two signature restaurants there is barely any decent restaurant that is n\u2019t a version of the room service menu. The worst part is some restaurants stop serving food and others start at odd times and finding somewhere to eat especially later in the evening is challenging. I would highly recommend planning meals in advance as it could get annoying. Leisure. There are several activities provided by JA and partners like fishing horse riding and swimming with horses shooting club spas golf and others. Plenty to do. Conclusion. JA Beach Hotel is a nice visit but is n\u2019t great if you want a glamorous and modern hotel. It is far out and there is nothing around to do outside the resort. That being said the resort has a lot to offer but requires a little planning and help from the staff. One \u2019s expectations need to be right as well. This is an old hotel modernized but is still at the essence an old school hotel experience. Recommendations for JA A map to highlight where everything is and how one can move around to reach it. We arrived at night and it was quite dark to figure things out and even during the day it was hard to navigate and we resorted to google maps Rework all restaurants having clear defined and varied food cuisines that operate all day and night long. There are little choices at night and what the hotel provides are all the food there is Work on the building itself especially the outside. It looks super old and the \u201c resort view \u201d is basically views overlooking the parking lot.", "offset": [870, 939], "date": "2018-12-03 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "162e5eb0-96d9-4e3d-bed1-1d55ad8d4800", "sentence": "Exceptional.
