Rouge was on the sponsored hotel list of the convention. The walk from the hotel to the convention center was about 20 minutes. It was about an equal distance to the Mall and pretty close to the White House. The hotel room was I think spacious for a big city. The room was clean and the bathroom was well appointed. The shower water temperature control and pressure was excellent. There was also a magnified and lit makeup shaving mirror in the room and a hairdryer available. The chairs in the room were uncomfortable but the bed was fine. There was very good storage space for luggage and clothes a plush Leopard robe to use ironing board and iron but no coffee maker. Instead the hotel had free prepared coffee in the lobby from 5 am to 10 am. On one morning the coffee was empty and I did not stay around to see how long it took to be refilled. In the afternoons there was complimentary wine available. Overall the stay met all expectations and I enjoyed my stay.", "offset": [0, 23], "date": "2015-04-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "996c2445-fc67-4aaf-81e4-dd63d08fc2a3", "sentence": "Great location for where we needed to go.

The Rouge is nice little hip boutique hotel with a great location on Embassy Row in the Dupont Circle neighborhood. It \u2019s a few blocks to the nearest Metro. We pulled our luggage incoming but took a taxi outgoing \u2026. It \u2019s an easy walk to the White House and there are plenty of great restaurants bars galleries markets and liquor stores nearby. Love the residential feel of the neighborhood. We have traveled to DC dozens of times for both business and pleasure over the past 10 years and have stayed in many wonderful hotels in and out of the district. We love the Kimpton brand and seek them out whenever we travel coast to coast. The Rouge is one of the older Kimpton properties in the DC area and is showing some wear. I \u2019m thinking they may be close to requiring a bit of updating. This was our 4th or 5th time staying at the Rouge although it had been 6 years since our last. All the staff we encountered where friendly and welcoming but there was never anyone to open the door. We saw many guests us included struggling to get through the two double doors with luggage in tow. We did not have a car but witnessed other guests standing around in the cold wondering what to do with their car which looked stressful because the street is one way very narrow quite busy and lined with parallel parked cars. Weird lack of service for Kimpton \u2026. Our King accommodation on the 7th floor was spacious and spotless. The bathroom had a tub shower combo and was tiny. They no longer offer personal Aveda bath products and have opted for the bulk bottles of shampoo conditioner and shower gel screwed to the wall in the shower. I do n\u2019t love it reminds me of being at the gym and I feel it \u2019s a bit unsanitary. The bed was dreamy with top notch linens. The overall d\u00e9cor is Kimpton cool with a \u201c hipster \u201d type flare. It \u2019s very RED. Great red velvet blackout drapes. Housekeeping was great as our room was perfectly refreshed each day. I wish they would go a littler easier on the deodorizer as it was a bit strong and too sweet smelling. They should consider using scent free products. Our room faced 16th St which I requested for the street view. There is an architecturally stunning church directly across the street and the stained glass is beautiful at night \u263a Even with the hotel issues described herein the Rouge is on of the first DC area hotels we stayed in some 12 years ago. I have a soft spot for it and would recommend it especially if the price is right. However I really hope they give it some needed TLC \u2026.", "offset": [246, 374], "date": "2016-02-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "08bc5f23-9ed5-46a8-a999-25a3555e89f9", "sentence": "Front Desk at Rouge Rocks. When travelling to DC on business my first choice are the Kimpton properties particularly the Hotel Rouge. As a global business traveler I am tired of the mega chain hotels waking up realizing i could be anywhere in the world they all look and feel alike. That never happens when I stay at a Kimpton. Each venue is unique has it is own peculiar flair and consistently charming. The Rouge however is a standout because of it is front desk service. Hedi and Jenifer should be teaching customer service. Always a warm welcome solicitous about how the day is going and ensuring I enjoy my stay. it is more than running through their check list they make it a personal experience every time I am a guest. 5 times in the last 6 months. that is why when I have the choice I try the Rouge first.

The overall freshness of the food and the narrow inflexible window for breakfast keeps it from earning an extra half star. It loses one star for the overall friendliness of the staff for example at check in I was not spoken to beyond being asked to pay for my visit and it loses two stars for the ridiculous guest amenity fee a 28 night charge that encompasses wi fi long distance calls and shuttles regardless of whether or not you actually use these services and regardless of the fact that there is a fee upfront to use them wi fi for example was 13. night the reason why I did not connect any of my devices.
