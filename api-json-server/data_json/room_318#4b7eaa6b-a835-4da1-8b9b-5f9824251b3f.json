My husband and I just left the Flamingo after a 2 night stay at the end of February. I think if you do your research and go in with knowledge about certain things you will not be bothered by them as much. So here we go. PROS Our room was great with a view of Caesars and the Belagio fountains. I am so glad we upgraded for a GO room as I had done my homework and knew it was the way to goHousekeping was fine for us. I have read on here about bad experiences but we never ran into a problem. The check in was fast and easy with super friendly staff assisting us. We went ahead and paid the 20 extra to check in early so that we would not have to risk a long check in line at 4This is the BEST in location. Connected to the LINQ and plenty of access to both ends of the Strip too. CONS While our room was great overall there was BARELY warm water for the spacious shower in our bathroom. I like hot showers so this was super disappointing. You can tell that this hotel needs some serious attention. They must had recently finished the casino carpets prior to our stay but the hallways are dingy and blah and the elevators. I can see why people are afraid of them. I was prepared for it so the rickety sounds and shakes did not surprise me anyThere are only a few places for food with most not looking all that appetizing. A 99 charge for in room music.

In the morning I was told a new room would be available at 1 PM. It was but of the six SPA tower elevators only two worked for the whole weekend. The carpets in the hallway looked disgusting stained and edges in some areas unraveling. The room showed great wear and tear. The mattresses in the Deluxe room were bowed and ready for replacement. The familiar breakfast restaurant was closed and I was told it would be replaced by an outsourced restaurant at some time in the future. The only compensation I was offered was a 50 food credit usable only at Flamingo hotel owned restaurants or cafes only three cafes and the buffet existed in the whole hotel even room service has been closed down. No information about using hotel facilities was available in the room or even on the TV guest services as I was instructed to look.

When we called for a late check out on the finally working phone they said there was none available but they had a place to store the baggage until we were ready to get back to the airport.

Finally at 530am after barely sleeping again my wife and I went to the front desk to speak to a manager. She said the best thing was to give us upgrade to a mini suite but they did not have any available until the next day technically later that day so there was nothing she could do until then. And we had to call down to check when the room would be available putting it back on us to fix the problem. They had too many customers for her to be able to take care of it for us proactively. Oh and she took off the resort fees for one day. So we went back to our uncomfortable room. Around noon we called down and they had our new room ready so we packed up to change rooms again 3rd room in 4 days. The next room was bigger though not as nice as the Go room we had booked. The room felt a little cooler so we were hoping that we would finally have a cool room. That night more of the same uncomfortably hot even though the air conditioner turned on and off repeatedly through the night not sure why it did not just stay on. Overall just a terrible experience and we will probably not be back. There are way too many options to get better guest services and a comfortable room. The rest of our trip was incredible. This was the only downer and a pretty big one. I am not sure what resort fees are supposed to go for but I would think a comfortable room and even halfway decent customer service would be at least some of that cost.", "offset": [2746, 2914], "date": "2019-06-22 22:22:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "5c01ab4b-dbe7-4d68-918f-8df6eac804bf", "sentence": "The 16th floor was disgusting.

Hotel is located conveniently to get to off of I15 and after the oframp straight shot into the parking garage. Into the hotel and able to use the self checkin kiosk after waiting in line and off to my room. Would recommend that you get one to the rooms that has been remodeled for a little more money. Room was comfortable but did not really spend that much time in it did not go to casino as not a gambler. Just stayed for the one night. Yes I know they have some nice grounds to walk around and plenty of restaurants but. Showered went out to dinner and then onto some music. Was great to not drive as everything was close to walk to. Coming back and bed super comfortable. Self checked out and on my way back on the road. Who could ask for more. Prices were reasonable cheaper than others I looked at and had a great time.
