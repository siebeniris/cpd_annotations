This Embassy Suites does not live up to others I have stayed in. The elevator from street level to the lobby has no A C which in the summer heat is a stifling hot box. The atrium is nice enough. I enjoyed the sound of the water feature but sound seems to carry throughout the atrium and into the rooms including the sound of screaming children. The free happy hour is about the only thing this Embassy Suites has going for it. The room itself had a very strong musty mildew odor. I had hoped to combat it with turning the A C lower but I could not get the temperature in the room to drop below 70. After complaining about the room temperature twice 2 box fans were placed in my room. I do not believe this was a proper fix to the problem but they did drown out the sounds from the atrium. There were areas of the room that have lacked attention from housekeeping in quite some time. The bathroom tiles were mildewed and there was a message written on the mirror visible when steamy. dated the previous month.

At that point with the situation becoming just ridiculous really I was not upset. I walked out. No refund. No product. I am not accepting food products I plan to eat from angry people. The Embassy staff seems to believe at this location that the decent facilities alone are satisfactory without effort. I ask for very little. Be honest about what you are selling and deliver a quality product at a 4 star. It seems silly to comment on yogurt but this sugary goop is disgusting and is most certainly not ice cream.

Where to begin. First we booked this hotel because originally they said construction would be finished by mid May. Then they changed to the beginning of June. now it is the end of June. They really should close during the construction because things are just terrible. First they moved the front desk down to the first floor. When we checked in the front desk people did not seem very helpful. They gave us 2 Honors bags even though we had 3 rooms. Then you have to take 1 elevator up to the actual lobby of the hotel. It looked like a war zone. Breakfast was moved to one of the ballrooms more on that in a moment. Our rooms were facing downtown Cincinnati. The views were great and the suite was a nice size. We needed to print our boarding passes for our flight the next morning. I went down stairs to the front desk and asked where the business center was. They said they did not have one because of the construction. Later My Dad asked again when we got back from dinner. One clerk said yes just follow the signs and the other said no they did not have one. You work the front desk how do you not know whether or not you have a business center. Turns out they did have one. It was in the breakfast area. After we got back from dinner my sister texted me and said they had lost power to half their room including the bathroom. My 86 year old grandmother was in the bathroom at the time the power went out but thankfully she was alright. My sister called the front desk to ask when the power would be restored and they said they did not know. They claimed it went off because of the weather. Really. It was a clear day with no wind. The power finally was restored and they did not have anymore problems. Breakfast was mess because it was in the ballroom. They did not have some of the items other Embassys had on our stay. It seemed like they were trying not to do as much since it was in a makeshift room.

I called the front desk and they allowed us to get some snacks in lobby but they were n\u2019t comparable to mine. My kids go to bed around 8 not that night as it approached 10 pm I called to ask if quiet hours were going to be mandated and was told the bar closed at 11. However the noise was n\u2019t the bar but the music in rooms and the kids teens who were running \u201c circles \u201d around the square interior of the floors atrium. Sounded like a riot. The front desk acted like that was n\u2019t tolerated period and would send someone to tell the runners to stop. That went on for over 2 more hours. Sounded like a herd of cattle. Regardless of the negligence by the hotel the parents are to blame. I guess all guests here were born in a barn. They brought their kids here so they could get trashed and their kids could run instead of running at their own house. Well we have a 4 and 6 year old that was n\u2019t born in a barn that we had to get to sleep. With a noise machine and 3 phones with white noise aps playing we tried to mask as much noise as possible. Noise masking was useless for the 1st room of the suite closest to the door that had the pullout bed. I have video of the loud music and pounding. I am going to send it to corporate to see if this is standard. We may as well have been partying with everyone because it sounded like we were in the midst of it all. I waited and called the desk again 25 hrs later around 1230 to complain. They said again they would send someone. The running of laps died down around 1230 but not the music. I know it \u2019s NYE but some people actually come to a hotel to sleep. Being 22 weeks pregnant when it \u2019s needed the most no sleep here. Such a waste of money. The next day I am tired and annoyed. We go to swim and there are 6 kids unsupervised at pool blaring their own music and speaker with rap music. Pool is small and low ceilings so it magnified it. They were splashing and throwing towels in the pool. I called front desk and told them. All they did was send someone to tell them to turn down music. Why they did n\u2019t say you need to leave and get a parent is beyond me. I had to raise my voice at a couple of them because they were rough housing negligent of my 4 yr old near that is n\u2019t the best swimmer.
