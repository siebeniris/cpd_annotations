There is an atmosphere of We care about you from the front desk service to the rooms themselves. We were in La Jola for medical appointments at the Scripps Institute and were overwhelmed by the rates being charged everywhere even with the Scripps discounts. This motel is about a 20 minute drive more in rush hour we found from the Scripps facility but is worth the extra time if you have it. We made the short walk to the beautiful waterfront and enjoyed the white sandy beaches the surfers and activity there. Across the street from our room was a terrific Mexican restaurant with a 20 discount in the dining room coupons available at the desk and great Happy Hour prices in the lounge. We had a comfortable king size bed in an end room on the second floor and is was pretty quiet. You can hear TVs from other rooms occasionally. Our bathroom was minuscule but we looked at a double Q room which was much more spacious so the rooms do vary. Breakfast in the lobby no seating was simple pastries and cereals and fresh apples and oranges coffee tea. We had coffee maker in the room table and chairs tv.

The building is currently undergoing a lot of building work and the reception area is temporarily housed in one of the accommodation units. There is no dining room at present. The other minor gripe is the very tight parking space at the back of the building. We parked an average sized car and somebody parked a Ford Mustang next to us.
