I found my resent stay quite disapointing mainly in the quality of things. We dined at the Aqua Bar we were served garlic bread that looked and tasted like the garlic bread you buy frozen from the supermarket and my Salmon was so over cooked it was dry and i could not finish it. We ordered our food first and were served last after everyone had finished their meals we were told that the 400 G steak takes longer to cook did not seem the case for our friend sitting beside me eating a 400 G steak served very quickly after ordering. My friend wanted to buy cigarettes so we called reception they advised that there was a machine in the Aqua bar. when we arrived at the bar we saw that it was out of order. I asked the bar tender if they sold them when the machine was not working and he then advised that the machine had been broken for awhile and was owned by another company. Wonder why reception was not aware of this. we were then told that there was a place down the road that sold them but we had all had a few beer and could not drive. THe bar tender was lovely and very well mannered. When booking I asked for our rooms to be as close together as they could and we were place at opposite ends of the resort. The coffee at breakfast was great and the food was good but the pastries and fruit were not very fresh. All in all it was nt a disaster but i guess i expected more from a resort and a Novotel one at that.

Got a great deal via the Acor Plus members site. Headed up for three nights with my 12 yo son and his best friend. Reception area looking a bit tired and I am not sure if it is changed since I was up there many years ago. Table tennis area in middle surrounded by lounge chairs. Well stocked small shop with liquor. On check in it was obvious that there was a wedding party staying here as a few quite drunk people groom. were walking around in the area. Not a nice feeling as you are checking in. We had booked a standard room but were upgraded to a one bedroom suite due to Gold status on Acor card. The suite was well appointed. King bed and sofa bed. I opted for the sofa bed as was not big enough for the boys. Mattress not comfortable and for our next stay I would definitely bring a dona or something similar to add some comfort underneath. Smaller kids are probably okay on the sofa bed. Kitchenette with basics including microwave toaster jug. No safe in room. Shutter type sliding doors separate lounge bedroom and bathroom. No real privacy from noise or light seeping through shutters. would not be a problem with own family. We arrived early evening and unfortunately for us it was dark I will explain shortly. There was no advantage to being a member on check in as only one lady on desk. I arrived slightly before another guest and stood in the members line but as the other lady was standing in front of the receptionist she got served first. About 10 mins later another gentleman came and served me. As I had read previous reviews I remembered to ask for our bands which are needed to use the parks facilities. Saved me having to wait in a line the next morning. That should be a no brainer for guests checking in when the other desk is closed. We should not have to ask and the bands should just be given out at check in. Back to the car with a map with circled car park where we had to go. The map is not to scale and hard to read. Needs to be updated. I even found it hard to find my room number on it with glasses. After 15 mins of driving around and getting out to try and find the room number I had to drive back to reception and ask for help in finding room. Signs are not well lit so this did not help. Porter was very helpful and agreed lighting not the best and within a few minutes car was parked and room found. He did offer to assist us with our bags but we did not have much so declined. We unpacked and after watching tv two in room. we went to bed to sleep. Well that did not happen. Unfortunate for us a pre wedding party was below. I gather a few rooms decided to join up for booze up. I would have put up with it but the F word was almost every second word cigarette smoke drifting up from balcony area below and the last straw was when someone decided to use the grounds as a bathroom. Doors to balcony were closed but noise was too loud. I did call reception to ask if they could ask them to keep noise down. Managers did come about 10 mins later stating a noise complaint had been received. Nothing much happened after they left and about an hour later the party dispersed. This was around 130am. The next morning I went to reception to ask to be moved and I spoke to Byron. He was great. I said to him I fully understood the group wanting to party and I would put up with it but the foul language etc was not something I wanted to put up with especially with two young children. We were upgraded to the overwater units. Bliss. Byron even warned us there could be some noise from the wedding party who were dining at Lilys but I heard nothing. I came and saw Byron the next morning to thank him and he did say he was going to call to make sure everything was okay. The overwater units are huge. The only disappointment was that there was no kitchenette like the one bedroom units. would not take much to transform office area to kitchenette which would then make these units fantastic. I was told however we could ask for a microwave. Tea towel would be good to dry cups. I slept on the sofa bed which again was very uncomfortable. Springs in mattress digging in. Probably okay for small child. Boys loved the king bed and spa. Lovely balcony to sit and look over the water. We had south facing room so next time will ask for north facing to get the sun. Booked for seafood buffet which is not cheap 75 but with Acor card I got two for one and just paid for one child. Seafood was the freshest I have had for a while. Prawns oysters excellent although the crab was a little tasteless. I watched the Sous Chef Ben come out every 10 15 mins replenishing the seafood and other areas. I have never seen someone work so hard. I even went over to thank him. Amazing as some places they let food run out before they top up. Wine was around 8 per glass. Good selection of hot food and salads. Kids loved the chocolate fountain and icecream bar. I did have to wait a long time for strawberries for the fountain and skewers. By the time I got back to the table with my chocolate dipped strawberries the chocolate was rock hard and stuck to the plate. Even the staff thought I had left the table and cleared it by the time I got back. They did apologise and offered to bring back my water etc. Maybe some mini chocolate containers like Max Breners would be better. Then you can dip hot melted choc at the table. I could not see any gluten free cake options so you would need to stick to icecream chocolate fountain and fruit. Grace was our waitress who was very lovely and efficient. Breakfast was good but busy during peak times and tables could be hard to find. Typical buffet. Only one choice of GF cereal. There was a dedicated toaster for GF bread. Forget the automatic coffee machine yuck. But at breakfast there is an espresso bar so you can get great coffee hot chocolate there. Maple syrup as signed is not the real deal but flavored sugar syrup. Machine made pancakes on demand. One child can eat free with paying adult so breakfast is 52 for adult and one extra child 32 adult and 20 child. A bit pricey when adding to a nights stay. can not use your acor card for breakfast here. I wish acor would recognise loyal customers and allow them to use card at breakfast in resorts. Booked the boys into the water park. As we are in off season only runs a few times during the day. Sunday and Monday does not open until 11 which is a bit unfair. can not use free water activities Kayak catamarans until they open. I can understand catamarans but kayaks as long as responsible adult is with kids these should be allowed. 20 each for 50 min session in waterpark. A few pieces of waterpark out of action due to barnacle cleaning. Sarah and Elizah very helpful. We took our own bikes as there is huge bike track around resort. We did keep our bikes in secure storage at reception but would not do again as every time I went to reception huge lines to wait to see someone. You can hire bikes at resort. Games room paid activities although on Friday and Saturday nights had 10 for hour all the games you want to play. Cash only. You have to give voucher for beach towel and make sure you return voucher even if you do not use on checkout otherwise you could be slugged 25 per towel. Next time I will take my own. Went to do laser tag 35 each which is run by external company but was not operating. Later found out that they have moved locations on site and upgrading. Boys did Segway tour but had to book two hour stint as not enough participants. 100 each for two hours but well worth it. Girl who took the boys was amazing. Very safety conscious. Definitely would do again. Reception is always busy but should have extra staff on hand when required. I am sure it is stressful for one staff member looking after the desk and trying to serve guests as quickly as possible and man the phones. It seemed to me while waiting in line numerous times that you might have a better chance of calling to get service. Nothing is worse than waiting in line to see someone answer the phone and deal with the issue rather than say I am dealing with customer and will be with you shortly etc. But saying that I did call reception a few times during our stay and the phone rang out. I hope that wedding parties in future are identified and grouped together. Let them party as they should but let families and others who want a nice getaway be quarantined away from them if possible. Even Novotel staff who I talked to during our stay were well aware of who the wedding party was as they must have been very boisterous over the weekend. Make sure you are at least a free Acor member as there are deals around inside the resort eg two for one coffees as shop. Byron definitely saved the day with my stay here. THANK YOU BYRON. Byron was attentive considerate and went out of his way to assist me during our stay. He is a credit to the Novotel. I had already preboked a September stay back in January and was wishing I had not until Byron intercepted. I have paid extra so we can be assured an overwater unit and less chance of noise expensive seeing I could get it free with Gold status if the unit is not booked when we get there but did not want to take the chance of another experience like that. Four units in each group. I am hoping our next stay will be good and it will be an extra bonus if I meet Byron again.", "offset": [751, 882], "date": "2015-07-03 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "46f77034-f843-4ae1-9e01-21a7e9fb8473", "sentence": "I Loved the resort it was beautiful and relaxing with lots of things you could do and see.

The staff at reception were not helpful I asked if the waterpark was operating and when at check in to be told bluntly that they were a 3rd party and I had to go and find out down there. Later in the stay we went to the front desk to enquire about segway and archery having been told by the staff at the activities centre that they did not know anything and were out of leaflets. The reception staff again denied any knowledge and told us to walk across the foyer to get a leaflet and call them ourselves. At check in I also asked about the activities programme and the staff member initially just told me to go down to the lake and ask. when pushed she finally printed out the programme which I knew from previous experiences existed. On check out I was asked if I had checked on my tv screen to look at my bill I had no idea it had even been posted on my screen and I was tuted at when I insisted she print out a hard copy for me to check. There was no information booklet in the room with any information about opening times of restaurants other facilities etc. The resort looked tired rubbish not picked up from the grounds overnight rotting wood on the balcony the fridge in the room did not work properly we tried to hire bikes twice but there were no childrens bikes and the staff said they had several broken but no one had been to fix them.

We returned to Twin Waters for about the 20th time in our life. We love Twin Waters and it has been a return destination for our family for over 20 years. We love the freedom of the resort what activities are on offer and the friendly service we have received previously. With a big family we have four boys aged 171514 12 over time we have had to move up the style of accommodation and in the past couple of years moved to taking two rooms each time we stay. This is at considerable cost to us along with all the activities we do. This time the holiday was booked by my father in law who is a member of Acor Hotels and he uses them almost monthly around Australia. When he booked this Holiday he did so via your Acor website which suggested due to the size of our family to stay at The Sebel North Shore in a 3 bedroom apartment he used his points for some of the stay. This was a great idea as the quality and style of accommodation suited our family and we still had access to all the Resort Facilities Twin Waters have to offer. We were advised to open an Account at the Resort so we did so. All ran smoothly we opened the Account used the activities bike riding catamarans and charged food and drink to our Account. We approached the Food Beverage staff on Friday morning at the Restaurant and asked how much it was for Breakfast buffet as our boys love this and were told the price but also advised that we would receive the kids eat free deal with paying adults. As we are a large family and on a budget we asked our boys if this is what they wanted to do and they advised yes as they love it as I said already. Once this was decided we budgeted for other activities and all was fantastic. Then to our dismay we attended breakfast and were advised that we could NOT access this deal as we were not staying at Twin Waters Resort as you classify The Sebel as NOT Twin Waters and advised that we were incorrect. We spoke with the Food Beverage Manager in regard to this and his attitude was very confrontational and he did not care about our situation. he even quoted well we did not advise you of this this is not our problem. In the end you are staying at The Sebel and this does not apply to you. To have this stated to you in front of other paying customers and your children was very distressing for my wife and made her visibly upset and in tears. We had breakfast as this is what our children wanted and left the Restaurant. This meant also playing Golf for myself was now out as I had an upset wife and I missed my Tee off time. It was noticed by one of your Resort Staff that my wife was upset and they spoke with her at reception. I was looking after our children and the service and care they provided my wife Louise was exceptional and the Reception Desk Manager credited our account 60 this was a nice gesture on the Resort and her behalf. But this really upset my wife and she did not enjoy the remaining two days and did not want to join us in the Foyer area of the Resort nor venture near the restaurant or Bar areas. she was scared that she would be confronted by the Restaurant Manager. In the end this as I said ruined our 4 nights stay and has really put a question mark on our family EVER returning to Twin Waters again. It also places my father in laws GOLD status with Acor in jeopardy as he was disgusted with how Louise was treated. I am so sorry to have taken up this amount of time to advise you of our experience but I really feel this is something you should know about and act on in the future. I really feel that if the correct questions were asked in the interim this situation may have been avoided.", "offset": [0, 85], "date": "2017-05-30 04:04:47", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "21a2ba5c-bdf5-4329-bfd5-9047326a237a", "sentence": "Relaxing short break with excellent service.

At first we were thoroughly impressed with how the resort is layed out the abundance of facilities activities. Although our room was tidy it is evident that it clearly needs to be updated the bathroom in particular needs attention. Our tv remote phone was not working but the maintenance man was very quick to rectify the problem was very polite. We found all staff members we came across to be very well presented professional. The real downside to our stay was when we went to use the pool. There was a make guest in the main pool drinking alcohol in a cup whilst in the polBeing a family resort I thought this was highly inappropriate noticed that nobody addressed this individual as he was in full view of a very busy afternoon of pool users. I would have made a complaint to staff but I had a newborn child with that I was nursing at the time. I had instructed my husband son to leave the pool head back to our room.

Would recommend the resort. The setting of tropical plants all around the grounds was beautiful. We liked the swimming pool and bar areas. Resort entrance area and foyer were well designed very attractive. We also loved the lagoon where water sports were available. Even though we did not participate it was enjoyable to see others taking an active part. The entire area has a friendly holiday buzz as well as being very relaxing. Deli Cafe food was very good and reasonably priced. Other meals from a different section were nice too. Pleasant walks around the resort. Perhaps a bit more variety in the main meals menu. We were a bit puzzled over the mostly Italian menu. Walk to the beach a bit misleading. No directions as to which way to go.
