This hotel may better serve the business crowd. I do not recommend it for families with kids. Location is great just a few blocks from the white house you can walk there or to the mall comfortably. They have a free FIAT ride but only from 130am6pm so you can schedule drop offs within 3 miles. Very convenient. They offer free WIFI in the room which is convenient. They do not have coffee machine in the room and the lobby opens at 6 am. I you are an early bird in need of java you are out of luck here. The staff are wonderful and will try anything to make your stay more pleasant. They advertise a series of services for families and kids that simply are not there. If you are like us and were relying on DVD players of strollers you may want to call and check ahead of time they had no idea of what we were talking about. The gym only had a treadmill and one elliptical working. Frankly I was expecting something a bit more top of the line. Overall I would never recommend this hotel to a family on vacation. It feel stale it needs to be renovated and it does not offer the services that other hotels nearby offer like the grand Hyat. I was trying this hotel cause I go to DC frequently and was disappointed. It does not feel like a 445 star hotel as advertised. It seems they got a very good company to work on their website though.", "offset": [911, 967], "date": "2015-02-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "350b413d-425b-48d7-91c5-e7d0df49e33c", "sentence": "Quiet place walkable to metro.

The service is very good at the hotel and absolutely can not be faulted the staff are very friendly and accommodating and any requests I had were attended to very quickly. The room itself was very spacious and I liked the decor but the bathroom was quite small. my partner and I could not both get ready at the same time. I understand that the hotel is still in a transition period form being owned by Loews to being a Hilton Hotel so hopefully the rest of this review will be constructive. When I arrived in the room all the surfaces were very dusty and the bed was not very neatly made. In all the pictures I saw advertising the hotel there were coloured padded blankets and accent pillows on every bed. I thought they really added a finishing touch to the room and was disappointed to find the bed plain. I called down to speak about the dust and the head of housekeeping was promptly sent to my room. I asked about the pillows I had seen in the photos and she told me plain is just the way the beds are. She agreed that the room was dusty and said she would send someone to fix it so I left for a bit. When I came back most things had been dusted but not the lamps which were all still dusty. The iPod iPhone dock had a very dated connector I do not know anyone who has an iPhone 4 or below anymore. I would recommend that the hotel gets adapters for the rooms or new docks. My partner and I were staying for four days and on one of the days we decided to stay in the room for the day and order in. We ordered breakfast and it was very tasty but also quite expensive for what it was. When we left in the evening we found a letter at our door stating that the hotel reserves the right to visually inspect the room every 24 hours which was a bit jarring. We made use of the gym which was quite good for a hotel gym but could use a bit of an update the posters on the walls were quite obviously from the 90s and the enamel on the weights was flaking off. Overall it was a good experience but for a 4 star hotel I would expect to find the room as per the advertised images and not dusty on arrival.", "offset": [1801, 1999], "date": "2018-03-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "02542b8b-bfe7-44b2-b235-922ac2abd32b", "sentence": "No room available upon arrival and broken treadmills.

Snooze you lose Hilton. Three nights were spent at the Madison as part of a group business function that we were attending in the DC area. As a Hilton property formerly branded under the Loewes namesake I had revered expectations for my stay. We arrived late into Washington and our group check in was cordial and welcoming with nary an issue with our group being checked in at such a late hour. We were swiftly on our way to our rooms and mine in particular looked out onto a less than charming roof top area festooned with a healthy blossom of heat exchangers and tarps unlike my peers who had more enamouring views of the cherry blossoms on the streets below. The furniture in the room was stately and the Americana decor was tasteful and period correct. Ample power outlets abound I settled in quickly. Bathroom toiletries were brand name and of good quality however I was disappointed to see yellow colored water from the shower faucet for the first few seconds of each run. This was off putting and mildly disappointing. Off to the lobby to grab a late night snack or coffee only to learn that the kitchen closes at 11 pm. Even though the coffee counter was also closed a bar staff offered to conjure me up a cup of hot water. After waiting no less than ten minutes the water was obviously a lesser priority than the drunken groups at the bar I was advised by a portly lady at the concierge desk wearing a security outfit. that most of the dining establishments in the vicinity were likely closed for the night. As there are no coffee makers nor kettles in the guest rooms I sheepishly splurged on a coffee and a muffin from a 7 11 store nearby less than 150 m away and slunk back to the room for the night. After consuming a sugar laden delicacy from the \u201c Sev \u201d a workout was in order the next morning. Twenty minutes into my treadmill run all the cardio machines in the gym shut off without any forewarning nearly shooting me and my fellow early morning joggers into the wall behind us. A lovely guest also using the gym remarked that this issue had been going on for \u201c months \u201d and directed me to call the front desk to send someone up to reset the breaker. I was as angry about my woeful workout as I was curious about how long this particular guest had been staying at the Madison to have known this detailDespite this setback I was rewarded by a hearty breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Offerings from the ala carte menu were wholesome aptly portioned and pleasant in appearance. Everyone in our group enjoyed the food which was very well and quickly prepared. The \u201c Not eggs Benedict \u201d was a particularly good choice. On the night before our departure a couple of members in the party placed requests for wake up calls for the next morning. This request was not fulfilled and one of our group ended up sleeping in late for our departure. When inquiries were made of this hugely inconvenient oversight staff conveyed that the morning staff had forgotten to make the calls. Unacceptable. Asleep at the wheel Hilton I was underwhelmed and disappointed by you during my stay. Ahead of future visits to the capital I \u2019l better research the numerous other options in the area before clicking the \u201c Book now \u201d button.", "offset": [1835, 2019], "date": "2018-04-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "40eb3976-4d22-4812-95ab-a1a4d89817af", "sentence": "Great experience.

I travel a lot for business and have come to realize it \u2019s the little things that truly make a great hotel experience. Although it \u2019s an overall nice hotel it \u2019s missing those little things. The pros the hotel is in a pretty good area within walking distance of the many sightseeing areas and is pretty safe and quiet for a city. The rooms are a good size clean and nicely decorated. The staff overall are friendly and helpful. It also has a good size gym. Cons first there is no coffee machine in the room. I ca n\u2019t remember the last time I stayed in a hotel without a coffee machine. They clearly want you to buy coffee at their Starbucks hotel store downstairs. They do n\u2019t provide complimentary water in the rooms but you can buy water for 9 nor do they have any complimentary water stations set up in the hotel lobby for guests. Again they want you to buy water in their store. Considering is was 97 degrees with 80 humidity water for paying guests seems pretty reasonable. They also have a nice sized refrigerator in their room but you ca n\u2019t use it as it is full of overpriced sodas beer liquor that they want you to buy. So even if you bought water for the room you ca n\u2019t store it in the fridge to keep it cold. They also have an overpriced snack bar with candy nuts etc for purchase in the room. So essentially instead of free coffee and water that most nice hotels provide for free as a courtesy to guests it felt like they were more interested in having guests spend extra money. I also ordered room service and requested a glass of water with my meal. I was told that they ca n\u2019t provide a glass of water but I can buy a bottle of water. I \u2019ve never had a hotel or restaurant tell me I ca n\u2019t have a glass of water with my meal. Again totally inconsiderate of the hotel guest.
