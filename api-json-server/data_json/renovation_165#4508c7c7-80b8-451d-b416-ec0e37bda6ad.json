The Hilton Munich City is conveniently located close to Gasteig Deutsches Museum and still in walking distance to the very heart of Munich. Besides having a large parking garage its direct S Bahn link is excellent basically direct access to public transport in the basement no need for a car or taxi from the airportI used to stay there really often in the past couple of years but in the last month moved more and more to the Hilton Munich Park actually run by the same franchise partner even though I like the location in terms of walking index of the City hotel better. But that was not about issues at the City hotel just about pricing on my travel dates and convenience accessing my customers places on the last few trips. Now I returned to the City Hilton and was quite a bit shocked about the decline. First the room interior is really aging. Many dirt spots dents etc. The rooms really need refurbishment urgentlySecond there are several issues with service and employees. WiFi was not working due to router that needed reset. Called the front desk. After ringing for about 30 seconds there was the occupied line signal ie someone took the receiver and placed it back. Next call a minute later same result. So I went down to the front desk. Explained the problem was not really helped but asked to return to my room. call the front desk again to be forwarded to the service center of the internet provider. Explained my problem and was told to wait for a technician to call back. It took about 20 minutes. Then I had the feeling I have to explain the technician how to setup a WiFi network. Well in the end after the guy reset the router it worked. But that is not well executed by the hotel. Hanging up on customers without even answering the phone is unprofessional for a front desk. Being unable to execute a few mouse clicks to reset a malfunctioning WiFi router in house is at least questionable. Housekeeping was very slow did not make up my room by 230 pm even though the room was free for several hours. I asked Housekeeping to makeup my room as I wanted to use it. Was told a colleague would take care of this within 10 minutes. Came back after 20 minutes just to find the colleague just starting to clean up the room. Could follow his actions in the room. Well if this was cleaning we could all just throw our trash on the streets and call this a clean city. Not well executed that is not really what I want to see. Breakfast selection is pretty huge and always has been good quality. This is still the case. However staff is not really attentive anymore. One has to wait at the counter to announce the room number. as apparently there is not a waiter attending this station permanently anymore. Tables are not assigned it is Hello room number. thank you. and then it is up to you to find a spot. On day one I managed to have breakfast for 30 minutes without being asked about coffee or juice for the whole time. On the buffet some items like mustard have been empty I mean a jar of mustard that would be easily able to serve a family for a year no one every took care of it. Of course empty plates of cold cuts cheese etc. have been replaced but everything that might have required a little bit of extra motivation to open a lid. nope. Personel apparently has been completely replaced within the last year not for good. Executive Lounge is a bit small but nice. Can be crowded in the evenings but never feels cramped.

This hotel is very dated and is in the process of undergoing a complete renovation. While the renovation may be great for future guests the Hilton Munich City is a TERRIBLE place to stay right now. I checked in for a 20 day stay on business. The restaurant has been relocated to an old banquet room for breakfast. The restaurant for dinner is in a hallway outside the breakfast banquet room and the bar area is on the opposite side in the hallway. The Executive Lounge is in a different old banquet room where the hors doeuvres are simply awful. The first room I had backed up to the hotel service elevators which are now used as guest elevators during the renovation. After a very noisy first night I asked to move rooms. I repacked 20 days of clothes from the drawers and moved into the new room the next morning. When I arrived at my new room after work on the second night I again unpacked 20 days of clothes and then went to dinner before returning to the room to do some more office work. Unfortunately the wifi in the room had such a low connection rate I could not connect to my office or most internet sites using any device. I informed the front desk of the problem and their answer was to connect me to their internet help desk. After 1 hour on the phone with the help desk they concluded that the construction was impacting the signal somehow as the data speed was 046 Mbps download and 016Mbps upload see posted pic.

Stayed 2 nights in this newly renovated well located full service Hilton hotel. Overall it felt like a much lower 2 or 25 star hotel with many flaws. The management is very underwhelming and non responsive even after several pleasant conversations with subordinate staff members. I am typically Hilton Diamond or Gold over past several years and stay exclusively at Hilton hotels around the world when posible1. A C is not actually A C by any worldwide standard. Room is very stuffy with 2 persons high humidity in the room. my hair will not even dry out after shower. This is actually a water cooled heat exchange system NOT A C since the air temp is barely cooler than the room itself. Several conversations with staff not a single manager cared2. Executive lounge nowhere near international standards. I would not eat there again. poor service bad and tiny food selection certainly not the discerning among us. It seemed more like a free beer hall with people scrambling to avoid each other while in line for free booze very unbecoming of a Hilton3. Breakfast was abysmal by German standards. I even got yelled at by a staff member for asking why the bread was so hard I could not even cut it or break it. it seemed very stale. maybe 2 days. Overall the selections are not great. especially the eggs were quite poor. I asked to see a manager and was told no one is available. got to the front desk which I did and was told this is a good selection with good availability not even close to true. I even saw many people on both days complaining to each other about the breakfast. 4. Positive points for bar and service but music far too loud and inappropriate for this type of Hotel. Songs had swear words. even as children were sitting outside with parents. this would never happen at any other HIlton. I am not sure what this Hilton is aiming for.

Upon checkin a very friendly Jade warmly welcomed us and gave us some welcome chocolates. Our room was a decent size and had two comfortable single beds. This was little shocking for my 14 year old. Air conditioning worked well. The hotel had a recent remodel and everything was fresh and new. The one downside was the in the bathroom with the half glass shower door bathtub combo. I have never been a fan of these as water gets everywhere and this was no exception. Interestingly our room was connecting on both sides. I have never seen this before and tend to avoid connecting rooms. I did not hear any noise at all from either side. House keeping was probably the only lackluster component of this great stay. Inconsistent. Twice I had to call as face cloths were never restocked. The trash was not always emptied in the bathroom. Somedays it looked that only the barest minimum duties were performed. As Diamond you get two complimentary bottles of water in the room per stay and there are no individual water bottles in the Exec lounge. You can fill up your water bottles in the lounge if need be. The Exec lounge is beautiful with two balconies. There is a great breakfast with eggs sausage bacon cold cuts cheese rolls fruit yogurt and cereal. This was above average exec lounge breakfast fare. Kudos to Fatima. We asked for gluten free bread and she managed to track some down from the downstairs kitchen and every morning when we entered she remembered and would always ask if she should call the kitchen. A most appreciated touch. The evening presentation was very basic and somewhat of a letdown with hardly the variety of the breakfast service. Not really any hors doeuvres or cheese and crackers. Basically 2 mains which would run out as soon as they were served and it took some time to get replenished. There were also complimentary beer wine and cocktails. The amount of guests partaking in the evening presentation was much greater at one time than breakfast due to the 2 hour window. There would be entire families having dinner in the lounge. This led to overcrowding and a Las Vegas style buffet line with guests rushing to get food as soon as it was placed. Location is great. Plenty of restaurants and shops nearby.
