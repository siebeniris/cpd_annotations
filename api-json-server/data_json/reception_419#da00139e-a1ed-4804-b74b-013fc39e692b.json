I visited the Hilton Columbus at Easton for a second time previously over Christmas 2012. It is a luxury that I question. I fly to Ohio to visit my Sis and stay at Hilton Easton a few days before going home because it is expensive. SO worth it. I have read reviews from people who were staying here the same time as me and question their issues. The rooms are exceptionally clean and since my last visit newly decorated I was pleased to see a shower not a bath. Housekeeping do an amazing job. Likewise room service is outstanding. At all times when I left my room whether to lay out in the sun sit by the pool or just leave the hotel to shop the staff went out of their way to say hello. They were incredibly pleasant and it was lovely to see smiles. Other reviews around the time I stayed state they could not sleep this is nonsense I slept well staff were around cleaning from 7 am which is to be expected but there was no noise from other rooms etc. I fly 22 hours to visit my sis in Coshocton and stay at Easton a few nights before my journey home.

In my last review I mentioned that I would like this location to offer massage services. Prior to my arrival I called the concierge for recommendations for a nearby spa and was told they now offer massages on site. I was THRILLED. Unfortunately I am not sure what kind of screening process they use to find their therapists but they need to come up with a better way. There is no way this woman was a licensed therapist. I would think that in a hotel like this an LMT would audition for the job by providing massages to those hiring. The tiny lady met me at the massage room outside the workout area and I was disappointed that some of the noises outside the door were quite audible. This turned out to be the least of my concerns. She offered me a small selection of relaxation music. Frank Sinatra Pavarotti or one called Escape. I chose Escape thinking it would be nice relaxing music but it was a track of Toto Looking Glass Earth Wind Fire etc. NOT relaxing at all. She started the massage by using these odd erratic wiping motions with her hands and then began taking some kind of hard object and pressing as deeply as possible into my back. She spoke fragmented English and all I could understand was sorry sorry. I ended up having to INSIST that she stop so I could get dressed and leave the room. I was scheduled for an hour and only did maybe 15 minutes and that included getting undressed dressed.

The hotel is very conveniently located. It is basically part of the Easton shopping area where it is easy to walk around and there are ample restaurants and shops.

They also have valet parking for something like 14 but unles there is some particular concern I would save the money and just grab a spot nearby. My room was comfortable and well designed. Wi Fi is included in the price and was good for routine web browsing and emails. You can upgrade to faster speeds if you want and I think you can also get the faster speed if you are at some level of the Hilton rewards program. The room is finished with higher quality materials. There were ample plugs at the desk area. My bathroom had a large walk in shower no tub in my case. One neat feature is the mirror which has lighting all around and is heated in some fashion so it would not fog over. I had a couple of quibbles that caused me not to rate this as a 5. First the main areas of the hotel are currently under renovation. You actually have to come in on one side through a kind of sports bar and they check you in at a temporary facility. I understand that the renovations will be completed in November so when you arrive this may no longer be an issue. We also had indifferent service at the sports bar one evening. The good news here is that there are many good restaurants just across the street and it is an easy walk to at least a dozen other places.

We decided to sleep in a little and we are getting ready around 9 am when the fan on our air shut off and the lights went off. My husband called down to the front desk and was told that this was a KNOWN power outage that would last until 1AM and we should have been notified ahead of time.

Only issue with the room is that it was HOT. Several of my colleagues said similar things about their rooms. Thermostat was set to 68 and read 73. We turned it down to 64 and it still did nothing. I think there was only one tiny corner vent in the room. Sleeping was pretty uncomfortable. We meant to say something the second night but it got late and two had fallen asleep so we never did until checkout. The location is excellent. Bartenders were great and attentive.
