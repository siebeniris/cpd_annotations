Flights going and coming with Sunwing were both delayed on departure and arrival. Arrived at resort had reserved a superior junior suite absolutely no difference from the junior suite inside the room. I would have assumed the location in the resort made the difference re superior but no. Had to negotiate to get a better location closer to the beach. There are no views of the ocean from any room so if that is a priority not the place for you. Excited so we immediately went from the room to the beach. Last minute decided to put valuables in the safe in both rooms had 2 rooms. Good thing we did. Came back about 2 hrs later and luggage in both rooms had been rifled through. I reported this to the front desk. They said the manager would call. Waited. Called again and they put me through to security. Security said they would have the manager call. Still waiting for that. Bad start. Fod A la cartes no good. Buffet excellent and they change it up each day. Steak house restaurant by the ocean serves lunch buffet which is nice. One of us became quite ill both ends and thought it was likely the food. Who knows could be a combination of sun food alcohol. Clientele in the 70s or families with young children. Very few if any university age group. Even not too many 30 40 50 year olds. Riu Bambu next door a much more exciting group and better shows. Beach staff were very good and entertaining. A big shout out to Franklin Gasolina and the yeyeyeye girl. You guys are great. The beach is beautiful. We went on an afternoon snorkeling trip through the beach guys related to the Riu 39 per person and well worth itThe bathroom in one of our rooms was flooded twice by the room above. The water came pouring in both times through the bathroom roof. When we got angry with them they fixed it properly the second time. Just a hassle. The front desk staff are less than helpful do not really care. They make promises but do not follow through. This is not in the best interest of the resort and wanting people to return. If you have not travelled much or been to all inclusive you would likely think this hotel is great. We have traveled a fair bit and I would not rate this hotel as a 5 star.

It was well kept the pool was very nice the beach was very nice ocean was beautiful and pretty calm.

I came to the Riu Palace Punta Cana based on the recommendation of two friends. They were not wrong when they said this place is awesome.

In fact between all the great hotel activities morning water aerobics salsa dancing on the beach evening live music and theater and the awesome beach I was never ever bored. And beyond that I met the most awesome people during my stay. people are super friendly. The waiters and activity staff go above and beyond the call of duty to make sure you are happy. I honestly felt like royalty. While this is a wonderful place it does have a few nits. It is not upgraded so you have a room key and a room safe which can be a pain the carry.

Arriving at the RIU Palace Punta Cana DRHere is my review of the RIU Palace Punta Cana Dominican Republic. I hope you have time to read because I have lots to say about this resort. If you do not have the time bookmark this page if you are planning to visit here because you definitely want to know about this place before staying here. We arrived at the end of July 2015 at the RIU Palace Punta Cana. It was me and 6 of my family members we were having a family vacation and also celebrating our daughters 17th birthday. Once we arrived at the lobby we were not greeted with that welcome drink that everyone talks about. The wait staff was walking with the drinks but unles you asked for one they did not approach you with one. Maybe there was some confusion as to which guest were arriving and which were already staying there. The Check In. We proceeded to check in to the resort and found out that they had moved half of our party to another RIU Resort. Let me explain how they try to get away with this. If you book at the RIU Palace as a couple they figure the can move you to any of the other RIU resorts which are technically attached to each other by a long sidewalk Bavaro Macao Bambu Naiboa. Their excuse will be that they overboked and needed to move some of the guests to the nearby resorts to accommodate them. We came as a family and had three Junior Suites reserved and we were not about to separate the family just because \u201c they overboked \u201d. I basically told them \u201c I paid to stay at the RIU Palace and expect to stay at the RIU Palace your overboking issues are not our concern. We had reserved our stay back in March of 2015 so there was no reason to move us except for they just wanted fill more room at the other resorts. After about 30 minutes of telling them we were not moving they finally got us the rooms and we were on our way to put our baggage away in start enjoying our stay. Not a great start to our stay so far. Make sure you get a safe lock and key they did not give us our and we had to return to the front desk to get one. The Rooms All our rooms were Junior Suites with jetted tubs King size or Super King size beds a small living area and a balcony with a garden view. All room are pretty much garden view if you get ocean view they will place you in the far back side of the resort obviously closest to the beach but the walk to the restaurants will be a long one and same will be for the garden view you will be close to all the restaurants and the nightly entertainment but far from the pools and beach. Two of the three rooms had nice decorations but the housekeeping staff in our room did not seem to care much for going the extra mile to please us. So we got nothing the entire time were there. As a matter of fact we were lucky they came to do our room at all. Our room also had a small full stocked refrigerator with soft drinks beer and water. Oh by the way do not drink the faucet water it is not for human consumption you will need to do everything with bottled water including brushing your teeth. The refrigerator took a whole day and a half to cool the drinking inside. I called the front desk to report this but by the time they came around to take a look at it the drinks were cold. The air conditioner is very poor and did not really keep the room cold as you would be accustomed to in the States. If you open the balcony sliding door the air will shut off so you will need to keep the door close if you want to keep the room cool. The big ceiling fan was a big help but it does get hot in July in Punta Cana. The bed was large but hard as a rock if you like a hard bed this is the bed for you and you will sleep like a baby after a good day of having fun at the beach or the pool but if it is not you will not enjoy this bed. I am used to my pillow top at home so it was not the bed for me but I made the best of it. After you \u2019re asleep you will not notice the hardest of the bed any more. Our main issue with the room was the toilet it continued to get plugged up and it would not flush normally. The other two room we had did not have any issues so we know it was not just the water pressure. We called the front desk to send maintenance to check it out. The first maintenance man who came just used a plunger and said \u201c Ok there you go \u201d next time we used the restroom the issue continued. The tank would not filled up with water fast enough and we noticed there was beach sand inside the tank. We called the front desk again to send maintenance this time the maintenance man unclogged the toilet pump and the water started flowing better. I mentioned the beach sand inside the tank and he acted as if I was speaking a different language although I was speaking to him in Spanish. He flush the toilet and again he said \u201c OK there you go \u201d and left. We stopped putting paper down the toilet to see if this would solve the problem. It was no fun putting dirty toilet paper in a separate bag let me tell you. We had not further issues with the toilet until a couple of days later when my wife returned to the room and noticed our room was flooded with water from the toilet. At this point I was furious and again called the front desk to send someone to come clean up the flood and fix the toilet and request to speak to the resort manager. I had to come to the front desk to speak to the manager he would not come to the room to speak to us. His name was Niels Alosery according to him he was the resort manager although his business card said his title was Subdirector whatever that means. I explained our issues since day one and he seemed to be apologetic but all he would do is offer to move us to another room. We only had two days left at the resort and moving us to another room at this point was pointless. I told his he had to do better than that because so far I have not been impressed with the management maintenance and front desk staff at this resort and from all the RIU we have visited in the past this has been the worse. He asked what he could do to make our stay more enjoyable and we asked for a day at the Spa to allow us to relax. He would not go for the full treatment at the Spa saying he did not have control of the Spa but as the resort manager he should be able to do whatever it takes to make their guest happy. We settled for the 25 minutes relaxing massage for my wife and me. We did not want to waste anymore of our vacation time dealing with this issue. TV in the room was not bad lots of channels to choose from with a variety of show lots of sports channels. Overall the Junior Suites are nice and roomy but the plumbing in the room is awful. The Restaurants There are several restaurants at this resort Room service 24 hours a day a joke Don Manuel La Bodega Krystal Yokohama Luigi La Altagracia Perico Chicote lobby bar Los Rosario lounge bar with terrace Sports Bar. You have to make reservations to all the restaurant with the exception of Don Manuel and the Sports Bar. At Don Manuel you will get breakfast lunch and dinner buffet style and at the Sports Bar they only have snacks such as hamburgers hot dogs nachos etc. If you eat at Don Manuel ask to be seated in Jose Manuel section. He was our waiter each time we ate there and he is amazing. He should be the manager of this restaurant because he knows how to treat him customers and make sure they are having an enjoyable time. Jose went out of his way to ensure we had everything we needed. Tips your wait staff and you will become their priority. The food at Don Manuel \u2019s was good I would not say it was excellent but good and lots to choose from. We did not make reservations at all the restaurants but we did eat at La Altagracia Krystal and Yokohama. None of them were anything to write home about but the very worse for me was La Altagracia. This is the steakhouse which includes lobster with dinner. I was really looking forward to eating here since I love steak and lobster therefore I ordered both plates the steak and the lobster and an additional lobster plate. When I received my plate the lobster was so small they should have thrown it back in the water and to let it grow into adult status. I asked for the steak to be medium well my preference but it was more in the well done side and tough to cut with the knife. The steak was cooked to fast and they were very chewy. I ate what I could waiting for the second plate of lobster to arrive. This took some time after multiple reminders to the wait staff that I was still waiting for my second plate. Finally the lobster came and it was the same thing very small lobster tails which should have been thrown back in the water after the catch. When I inserted my fork into them it was like eating mashed potatoes very mushy and bad tasting. The lobster had been over cooked I told the wait staff about the issue and requested for another plate but they said they were all out of lobster. The manager came over and was trying to state his case but basically was acting like it was not his fault because he was not aware of the issue. I was not really in the mood to argue with him but did tell him that as the manager he should have been walking around the dining area to ensure everything was OK with all the dinners instead of talking with the cooks the entire time during dinner service. At this same restaurant during the hours of 1AM and 5PM the have a buffet style lunch that is actually one of the best in the resort. This buffet has traditional Dominican foods as well as hot wings hamburgers hot dogs fajita nachos etc. This is you best area for lunch in the resort. Krystal and Yokohama were not bad restaurants but they were no something to write some about either. Overall rating of the food I would say it was a 6 maybe a 7Pol and Beach I have no complaints here at all the pool and beach were excellent. There were chairs available around the pool each time we went out and the wait staff at the pool bar were great. Drink were always available to us when at the pool. Same service was received at the beach area although it took a little longer it was understandable due to the distance of the bar to the beach. Beach chair were also available at the beach each time we went and the beach area was clean. The beach water was clean too with the exception of some areas where seaweed had taken over but overall was pretty clear and blue. If you walk down the beach about 10 to 15 minutes the water is even more clear and blue and wonderful to swim in. You could even see the small school of fishes swimming in the area. Casino. This was a joke the casino on site was a very small room with a few slots and thanks all. They give away 10 coupon to get you inside but that is not even worth it. The bigger casino is off site at the RIU Macao a good 15 to 20 minute down a sidewalk that links all the RIU resorts together. This casino is also a joke although is much bigger the slot machines are old they have two poker tables and a couple of roulette tables and that is about it. I waited about an hour for players to come sit at the poker table and no one showed up to play must be the 100 buy in per player that scared everyone off. Do n\u2019t waste your time here you may have more fun at the Hard Rock Hotel Casino but you will need to take a cab for that. Shops. There are several shops on the resort that sell souvenirs and they will deal on the price but not much. After talking to other resorts guest it is not worth the time going off site to purchase gifts downtown Punta Cana. The items are pretty much the same and they will not bargain with you. You will also find beach vendors on the beach and you can get good deals from them. Entertainment. There is nightly entertainment at the Los Rosario lounge bar with terrace. they have a schedule posted outside the entrance telling which show will be playing. All shows are at 945 PM and run about an hour. They have a magic show and a Rock of Ages show which is pretty good. We missed the Michael Jackson show but from the little bit that we saw it looked pretty good. This is a good time to relax from a long day at the pool and beach and kickback and enjoy a show and a few tropical drinks. Lots of fun here I encourage you to go to the nightly shows. You have nightly live and DJ music at the plaza areas with room for dancing. I must warn you it gets very hot in July in Punta Cana and very humid so wear cool loose clothing and be prepared to sweat while you just stand there or while you are dancing. CreditsWhen you book your trip you made run across an offer for 150 200 in resort credit depending in how long your stay. Do n\u2019t let this make your decision to stay at this resort. You do n\u2019t get all those credits and unles you are a golfer this is where most of the credits are for. Just not worth making you decision from staying at this resort or another. Conclusion. This resorts needs some help and some updating. The management team need to show their guest that they are a priority just like the wait staff does. They need to stop watering their garden areas with dirty sewage water that lets out a horrible smell that will almost make you throw up only experience this twice during our 8 day stay. Elevators are fast but old and broke down several times during our visit. Music for guest at the beach would be nice. Room service is not what you would expect you can get the same food at the sports bar snack area. The resort has the potential to become a great place to vacation in and we had a great time at the pools the beach at the nightly show and when dinning at Don Manuel with our waiter Jose and the wait staff that did an excellent job bring the drinks but the hotel itself is in poor condition and needs to be remodeled specially in the rooms. It felt like the staff at the front desk was rude and did not care. This is something management needs to work on with their staff and take lessons from the wait staff to improve. If I return to Punta Cana it will not be at the RIU Palace. I know this is a lengthy review and I am not a very picky person but I felt like you needed to know what to expect for the money you paid to stay here. Happy travels and until the next time.", "offset": [10280, 10410], "date": "2015-08-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "56144bf3-2d7b-4615-96d9-b45e379c88be", "sentence": "Looks Can Be Deceiving. The resort property is gorgeous. The lobby grounds pool and beach all look like something out of a magazine. The restaurants need to be updated decor wise they look like they are from the early 1990s. My sons and I stayed for eight days. Overall the service was good as long as you tipped. The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful. Our housekeeper was excellent. The waitstaf was only good if you tipped. Once you started tipping they would make sure you were seated and taken care of at every meal. As far as the restaurants on property we tried all of them. Our least favorite was the Japanese. The lady working the front door was incredibly rude to my family and the waitress service was terrible the helper was fantastic we tipped him. The food there was not good either. Our favorite was Krystal. We also enjoyed the Grill and Steakhouse which is beach side. Although they do not seat you with a view of the beach but conveniently close to the kitchen even though the restaurant is not any where near full. The food at the buffet is sub par. It looks beautiful but has not flavor. The sports bar is a joke. Maybe is you want to watch a soccer game. The food that is available 24 hours a day is terrible. I would advise to order all or your meat well done and not to eat any raw fish. My son caught a parasitic worm while we were there and had to seek medical treatment from the resort doctor. Another note about the restaurants on property make sure you are in line early to make the reservations. They fill up early and for days in advance. The lady taking the reservations in not very friendly either. All the days we were there I never saw her interact in a personable manor with anyone. We did multiple excursions and enjoyed them all.

We really enjoyed our stay at the Riu Palace Punta Cana. It was an interesting experience for us as this was our first All Inclusive vacation we have primarily vacationed on cruise ships or create your own adventure kind of trips. The location was the best part of all the Riu resorts here the Palace Punta Cana had the best location by far. Upgrading the room to a Jacuzi Suite is 135 worth the money. We had an amazing ocean view 2 stories of balconies that had a view of a old ship wreck out on the reef and more room than we knew what to do with. There was definitely a language barrier as the majority of the other guests who stayed at this hotel spoke Spanish and we spoke none which was completely our faultThe staff was not the friendliest but we obtained answers to all of our questions so no real complaints there just do not expect to feel pampered by the staff. We did have some issues with the room it needs an upgrade for sure. The sheets were scratchy and the decor was dated but with a view like we had who really cared. We did have some bugs in our room not many but I did get more mosquito bites sitting in my room than I did the entire time I was outside so that is never a good thing. I would recommend learning the spanish translation for No flowers in my room since that is what I am blaming the bugs on.

We spent a week 114 121 2017 as an adult only getaway. We chose this resort for something new and were excited about the deal we got w non stop flights through apple vacations. We generally choose an AMR resort or an Iberostar resort when traveling outside of the United States. Lets start with the bad. as I had seen in previous reviews the front desk check in staff and check out staff are horrible. They did not make us feel special or greet us with excitement and warmth at all. We together with 2 other couples that we did not know were told of our instructions for our safe and KEY yes an actual key with a large plastic piece attached WITH THE ROOM NUMBER on it really safe if you lose or leave by pool or bar. The non individual attention and not friendly interaction after traveling a long distance taking forever at the overcrowded airport to get through customs and get our luggage and then long wait for the transportation bus to leave did not start the vacay well. We were greeted finally by a server with a welcome drink that was not good at al w cheap alcohol. no washcloth no smile or anyone telling us welcome. We were tired hungry and expecting more from our initial arrival. It got worse when I found out the only food available during the time frame we so happened to arrive which was about 330 in the afternoon was in the sports bar off the main lobby. I was excited as I thought about what you could get at a sports bar thinking chicken wings nachos pizza maybe. UM there was a fridge with boxes in it and containers of fruit. the boxes contained hotdogs hamburgers or sandwiches. you had to cook them yourself in the microwave. Bun and all. super disgusting. and I like fast food. No instructions no one to help you. Or you could have chips and cheese like the cheese in the warmer with a pump. The cheese was cold and bad and the chips stale. We were starving and so were some other guest that had arrived at the same time. Not used to that with Secrets or Iberostar. Always a grill or place to go all day at other places. We were told we could go to the other surrounding RIU resorts but were treated horribly and not allowed to get drinks at their bars. they took us from the Palace to the disco and Casino which was at the Riu nextdor. when we were ready to leave at 2 am there was no longer anyone to give us a ride back we were told. The disco had outsiders and locals that come in and drinks are not included. was a bit sketchy and did not feel well guarded at night like the other resorts we have stayed at. We had to walk back and saw literally no one out anywhere. There is nothing to do after midnight at the Palace. The lobby is empty with maybe one man behind counter. The sportsbar is open but very far to the bathrooms. Be prepared for topless by the pool and fountains even. We are used to seeing a few topless on the beach but if you are bringing your children you may want to know there was quite a few of topless and thongs right at the pool. Thongs whatever. but NOT AT AND IN THE PLACE I AM EATING MY LUNCH AT. The buffet closest to the beach and pools where we liked the view for lunch allowed everyone and anyone to come in and eat there were barefoot old men in spedos at the chicken meat counter and girls in thongs too. They really need a hostes host checking people in and out and not allowing that inside by food. There are only 2 bathroom choices if you are on beach or at pools and one you have to walk through the spa to get to. so barefoot people in swimsuits are walking into the spa to pee with sand etc. and the other is attached and next to the eating place by beach. The spa charged 18 more because I used my credit card was told after I booked and was there with only a credit card for my massage. Great massage however. What you read about too many trees is totally true on the beach. I seriously though people were crazy for complaining about beautiful palms but now I know why. I know they need them to protect the erosion which is and has occurred along the beach but I would think they would plant smaller palms that do not block the views sun. It was hard to find beach places and pool places that stayed sunny after 4. We could not see the water from our ocean view due to the amount of trees. Not a lot of activities for kids to do at the Palace. There is a small center by the eating place but honestly we did not see children really having much to do at the beach or pools with the adults. WiFI terrible phone service not great either. which was okay for us as we were trying to getaway from our phones computers. Now for the godWe went for the beautiful beach water and warmth. It was all there. Our room was a bit outdated needing new upholstery and bedding stains on wall coming out of air vent but beautiful and very well cleaned by our cleaning crews. The ladies did an amazing job both in am and pm. A bit hard to get washcloths but would manage to eventually. We tipped the cleaning ladies each day as they really did do a great job and were awesome. We were in room 46 which had a nice huge balcony. I think a higher floor would have been better and we did not need the Jacuzi tub as it was unused. We had one large roach bug day one but never saw another bug in our room the whole time we were there. and we think it was because we left our slider open. Our mattress was a good one. firm and seemed new. our nightstand was broken when we got there and I pointed it out but it was never fixed. The food was okay. We really liked the Krystal best and ate there twice. I liked the seabas and lobster risota. My husband liked the beef filet. We liked the lobster and steakhouse too. We never tried the Italian or Brazilian place. Food was good. Wine terrible but we have always known that about all Punta Cana resorts I stuck with Champagne. The servers did a nice job. We are not smokers however which made it tough if we wanted to eat outside. It seemed like there were a lot of smokers this trip at this resort at the outside seating pool and beach. The entertainment staff was fun and I did the water aerobics and some toss games. The shops right by the spa were nice and close. The nightly shows fun to watch. The grounds keepers did a nice job with the beautiful walkways and hedges. I am mixed whether we will ever try a Riu again. We did relax and enjoy ourselves which was our goal. We knew we had higher expectations but booked this last minute for the deal. I feel they have many changes some just with the people working there that could make all the difference. someone monitoring and turning away guest that are not dressed for an eating establishment. Spedos and thongs barefet and swimsuit tops shirtles men old and young should never be allowed in any buffet. Having better food choices available at those times when the buffets are closed a bathroom put in maybe on the outside of the spa building for pool and beach goers on that side of the pool little detail things to clean and make new with fresh paint upholstery and drapes. I am a detailed oriented person and notice most everything which can be good and bad. I love to travel and share my experiences with others to help them when they are trying to decide.", "offset": [3827, 3891], "date": "2017-02-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "a373a03f-bdd4-4154-aa8e-cb5437491a3e", "sentence": "Good Week at the Riu Palace. I have stayed at five different Rius but this was my first stay at a Palace. There were some things that were better. We had coffee in the room and also we did not have to make reservations for the restaurants. I do not know if this is just in the Palace or if they are all doing this. In the past I have had trouble getting a different towel while at the pool. No problems here. We tried all the restaurants and enjoyed the food. Neither of us had any complaints. The only choice for breakfast and lunch is a buffet. The buffets were very good and many choices. We did go to a restaurant each night instead of the buffet. I asked one of the waiters how much money he made. He said that he made 145 every 2 weeks and worked 12 days. We had also asked a couple of waiters and they said they worked breakfast lunch and dinner. The photos I will post are NOT pictures of the waiter or waiters that gave me the information about his wages. There is a problems with communication if you do not speak Spanish. We did not have any problems with the waite staff but many problems with housekeeping. I do not think they understand any English. Of course I am in their country and their language is Spanish. I travel a lot and have never had this much trouble before. One day they missed our room and we called the desk and it was cleaned while we were at dinner and the show. The beach was beautiful but lots of seaweed. I do not know if it were raked any but I would assume it had to be. Hurricane Harvey had just hit Houston about the time we arrived and we were told that was part of the reason it was so bad. We spent most of our time in the main pool. The last day we used the infinlty pool. It was so nice we wish we tried it the first day. Speaking of the first day which was a Sunday the pool was so crowded it was almost terrible. This is a family resort but many many kids The rest of the week it was entirely different. I do not know if this is a true statement but there might have been a lot of local families who had a day pass or something. I have heard in the past that some of the resorts let the local people buy passes at times. The rooms are outdated but the resort will close for 3 or 4 months next year to do the changes Probably the best thing will be the door locks. No more of the keys with the room number on them I always have trouble getting them open. They are going to have a walk in shower instead of the high bathtub they have now. Someone told me they are not changing the lobby. Which I think is nice. I walked down to the Riu Bamboo and it looks like something you might see at South Beach not a Riu. I was told by a quest there would be 4 pools instead of the 2. I believe one would be an adults only according to the guest who told me. Would I return to the Riu Palace. Probably. A lot depends on who I travel with and of course the price. My favorite resorts are the Secrets but they are usually several hundreds more. I have been on 4 beach trips this year and have had no major problems. Two were Secrets and the other two were not but I got my moneys worth. We enjoyed our week at the Riu Palace. We met a lot of very nice people We are very lucky that we stayed Aug 27th till Sept 3rd. I feel very sorry for the people living there because of Hurricane Irma.", "offset": [1396, 1440], "date": "2017-09-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "7cc19584-bba5-41bf-b9c2-6cfd388e7f1c", "sentence": "Not as other Riu Palaces. We stayed at this Riu for 1 week. First impressions always stay with you. We arrived after 140 the requests I made months earlier were not ready we had to wait for our rooms. We went and eat at the restaurant by the beach. in other Riu \u2019s the food is covered from flies or bees at this restaurant it was n\u2019t. We saw flies landing on fruit and food. The bar by the pool had bees buzzing all over and not just one or 2 but many. We made our way to our rooms the lamp shades had corrosion the door molding was cracked the tv did not work the room door and safe \u2019s did not used a card or a keypad you had to carry 2 keys for each room and 1 key for the safe but yet you had a card for the pool towels. There are 5 or 6 Riu \u2019s in the complex you can only eat on the one you stay and 2 others the other ones you can\u2019t. The complex has a water park very good for small kids and teens. The beach is pretty clean and once in warmAlthough a bit to much sand as far as you can go in with out swimming. Waiters are pretty happy smiling all the time and very helpful.

We had a lovely room on the third floor that looked out to the center courtyard that is huge. You have many restaurants to choose from Yokohama Japanese restaurant a traditional steakhouse Krystal with an Asian fusion vibe La Bodega Brazilian serving meat of a sword and Luigi Italian restaurants. There is also Don Manuel that serves breakfast lunch and dinner buffet style. It is huge and you will be able to find just about anything there. There is also a restaurant closer to the pool that is also buffet but is opened most of the day. There is a swim up bar at the pool with plenty of activities and music. If you want to celebrate a wedding there was a beautiful gazebo for that right on the beach. The beach is beautiful and the water was warm but with a strong current. The Palace is the first of a series of other Riu properties that you have access to. There are even a few that you can lunch at. They are lined up side by each and offer different amenities family adult only couples and a more party style. There is a large waterpark at the end of the row of properties. The lobby is spacious and lovely with a large bar that serves drinks late into the night. You will also find the sports bar in the lobby which is open late and has basic self serve offerings sandwiches nachos with cheese to heat up fruits and desserts. There are tour services with different tour operators so be sure and pick the one that you want. We did a tour of Santo Domingo and loved it. Every night there is a live show and the music plays on in the outdoor patio bar where you can take dancing lessons from one of the many social animators. We found them to be fun and always engaged with the guests. This is a huge property and although we thought the furniture was a bit dated our room was large and spacious and very comfortable. The bathroom was large with a deep bathtub. The spa and fitness facility was large and spacious. There are many different treatments offered all for an additional cost. There is also a local market that arrives once a week with typical kitch items and knick knacks but the prices for earrings with traditional stones was reasonable. We would recommend this hotel for couples families with teens or groups. The family resort is just down the beach and better suited for smaller children as there is a kidie pool and activities for them also.", "offset": [697, 789], "date": "2018-01-12", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "642e775d-12eb-4f46-9226-7636fc678bd9", "sentence": "Wonderful visit.

We had a great week here. Transfer from the airport was quick check in was quick. Wily on reception was very welcoming and friendly. I loved our room. Initially I was a bit worried as there was 4 of us and in the room was a king size bed and a sofa. The sofa luckily pulled out into a double bed. Both the sofa bed and king bed were very comfortable. The only bad thing that happened all holiday happened on the first night. We were starving after the flight and did not really eat our plane food we \u2019d missed lunch so we decided to get ready for dinner right on time and the kids decided they \u2019d like to try the steak restaurant on the beach first. We arrived to be spoken to very abruptly and told come back at 9 pm. As we were starving this was n\u2019t great but we got a few drinks in the bar and headed back at 9 pm. Unfortunately the staff treated us like they did n\u2019t want us there they did n\u2019t give us an option on the starters and just bought everything which lead to waste. The food ordered took ages to come and when it did the steak was over done and the lobster over cooked. Bizarely the waitress refilled our drinks by pouring Pepsi from a cup into our glasses it felt to us that she was just topping us up with someone else \u2019s left over drinks. We left before dessert. We literally thought what have we done with our hard earned cash. The buffet had finished by the time we left and went to bed hungry. From the very next day everything became amazing. Sandy and Marco greeted us in the breakfast buffet and they were wonderful. They looked after us so well and Sandy has an amazing gift at entertaining children. These guys work so hard. Breakfast was delicious and there was nothing missed out that you could possibly need. Lunch is always served in the restaurant on the beach but as we had such a bad experience on the first night we chose not to return. Instead we opted for the chicken and plantain served next to the pool bar which was delicious. Buffet supper always had something for everyone. It may look pretty standard food but the flavours were great. Make sure you try the Dominican section. I had a minced beef and mashed plantain pie and it was amazingly delicious. King Prawn noodles were amazing too. Also the lobster and steak at the buffet were cooked perfectly. We tried one more speciality restaurant which was the Japanese and the staff were very accommodating and pleasant. I enjoyed the meal and the restaurant was so pretty but the kids being a bit fussy were n\u2019t so keen on the food hence why we had buffet for the rest of our stay. I would have loved to have tried the other options. We never had a problem getting a lounger. The pools were great. I enjoyed the sea too. Yes there is lots of seaweed but if you climb through it the water is clear and you can swim just fine. We just did not have enough time to do everything we wanted. We managed 2 trips to the water park one beach party at the hotel next door one foam pool party one trip to the nightclub 2 trips to the gym. The kids did not want to see any shows unfortunately so we mainly sat in the lobby bar in the evenings which was lovely and the staff were amazing. It was a great time to catch up with the family and talk more in depth about what everyone was up to. Unfortunately Sandy left halfway through our stay but Marco carried on looking after us well as well as Paco and Juan 2. Paco even served us the one day we turned up for lunch at the beach restaurant and he made everything wonderful for us. The hotel is beautiful. We went out on a trip one day driving buggies round the island which was a fantastic day when our bus returned us to the hotel the other people yet to be returned to their hotels were really wowed by the beautiful entrance and lobby area at our hotel. We are so sad to be home. The staff really make this hotel everyone has a hola for you. The maid service was brilliant too. I was excited about having a mini bar in the room but I never used it. Soft drinks were stocked daily in our fridge. Would I return. Yes I \u2019d jump on a plane right now and go back. There is something for everyone here. I \u2019m not one for classical music but the pianist and violinist at the lobby bar played so beautifully. We equally enjoyed getting our groove on to Spanish American music in the club and by the pool. We were a British group and we did n\u2019t come across many other brits at the hotel but this did not bother us at all. One thing the Americans sure know how to party. Book and go and have fun just avoid the steak restaurant.", "offset": [2888, 3029], "date": "2018-08-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "f0a9dfc2-ee89-455d-b4fe-1bde817ce91f", "sentence": "Hotel Review Tips and Much More \u2026. We are a group of 19 traveling to the DR for the first time. I rarely write reviews but since reading other past traveler \u2019s review it has helped me a lot. Hopefully this review will help other. Here it goes \u2026. \u2026 ARIVAL The arrival was smooth as we flew in nonstop on Southwest. Flight about 35 hours. We were advised by the flight attendant that no food of any type was allowed to be brought into the DR included snacks chips etc. Everyone on the plane was having a feast one hour before landing to get rid of the food. Upon arrival it would be random screening as they select people. Worst case scenario they ask you to throw it out. I suggest bring enough to eat when enroute so you do n\u2019t have to throw it out. Airport was a little different as you have exit the plane via stairway on to the terminal and then take a bus shuttle that to you the gate. Upon arrival you will go thru immigration and custom and then baggage claim. Note that there is no longer a requirement to buy tourist visa card as it should already be included in your airfare. It does n\u2019t matter if you were charge for it or not as the fee is paid by the airline directly to the DRgov. Have your baggage claim ticket for your checked bags ready as when you collect your checked bags you will have to show your baggage claim ticket before they will let you exit the baggage claim area. TRANSPORTATION. Since were traveled in a large group I had already pre booked my transportation with Dominican Airport Transfer. They are a 5 star rating and would recommend them. You pay by credit card at time of booking and cancel anytime for full before the day of travel. We booked a private van 168 round trip that can transport up to 22 passengers. They were waiting as you exit the airport with a name sign. Beware of airport baggage porters when you exit they will try to help you with your bag and walk along the driver of your transportation letting you assume they are with the driver transportation company. They will load your bags in the vehicle and demand that you tip them 1 per bag. They do the same thing when you arrive to airport for departure. As soon as the driver opens the trunk they swarm in and unload the bags and take them to the check in line before you even know what is happening. I suggest you be quick if you do not want this service. CHECK INYou can tell upon arrival that the lobby was newly renovated and new. The coffee bar and daiquiri bar was new to off to the left of the concierge. Check in at the hotel was a breeze. Some reviewers said that they serve you drink while you wait in line to check into your room but we did not get that service. The concierge was very friendly. ROOM. For the most part the rooms are as pictured on the website. It does look refurbished as in the bathroom is new with a stand in white marble glass frame with rain fall shower head and double sinks. There is a sitting area of which the sofa bed wall arts curtains beddings accessories flat screen TV and safe is new. Everything else is refurbished meaning that it was touched up. The furniture you can tell was spot treated. lightly painted to cover the chips and dents. The doors baseboard and walls were touched up as needed. You can tell the workmanship of the remodel is poor especially since this hotel was reopened on 71418 but at least it is definitely cleaner and modern for the most part. The room is musty from the humidity but once you turn on the AC and let it run for a while the smell goes away. I would recommend bringing air fresher to mask the smell if you are sensitive to that. Since we were a group of 19 we had 8 rooms reserved. One of the rooms we had the toilet flusher broke several times but they came to fix promptly. I would not say that the room as completely bug free as we had a few ants in our bathroom. I always carry Lysol disinfectant spray when I travel so I sprayed it and that took care of the issue. The keycard was malfunctioning where only 1 of the 2 or 3 cards worked so you have to go to the front desk to get it reprogramed throughout our stay. Note on the bedding situation. There are only 2 options in the bedding king or 2 full size beds and a sofa bed. The 2 full size beds are pushed together and not separated by a night stand. A little tight if you are staying 4 people in a room. Try to ask for rooms on the 2nd or 3rd floor is possible. There are hardly any rooms with ocean view as the resort is designed n a U shape. Most of the view is to another hotel garden view or courtyard view. FOOD There is definitely plenty of food for different taste palettes. The buffet has a great variety and is open for breakfast and dinner. The sports bar is open 247 but have very limited selection of food. Sports bar is the only place to eat between 3 6pm as all the restaurants and buffet is closed in preparation for dinner. Lunch is served at the steakhouse buffet style. There is no reservation required for al la carte restaurants. They open at 630. We always arrived few mins before to ensure we were able to get tables to accommodate all 19 of us. It was never an issue. The Japanese restaurant was the least favorite. They took forever to bring out the food. The food was not good at all. If you do eat here the sushi appetizer was ok. the deep fried shrimp calamari and veggies were good and the steak was edible. The other items on the menu were bad. The steakhouse restaurant was good as well. They had lobster and steak. When ordering tell them to bring extra lobster tails and they will bring a plate of 6 extra to share. You can always ask for more. Service was quick and staff was friendly. Seating is under covered overlooking the beach. Spanish restaurant \u2013 we did not try as the menu did not look appetizing. Krystal Fusion restaurant \u2013 that was also good. We tried a little of everything on the menu. The dessert pineapple sorbet with sponge cake and leche was delicious. Italian restaurant \u2013 food was very salty. They did have a salad appetizer bar. For the most part the food is good but again we are not picky eaters. We came with an understanding that this hotel is catering to guest from all over the world and can not please everyone and not all the food is authentic. The buffet was open till 10 pm so if we did n\u2019t like the restaurant food we would go to the buffet afterwards to sample other dishes and for dessert. The coffee bar in the lobby is great for pastries coffee and milkshakes. Their capuchino express taste much better than in the buffet or restaurant. Dress code. The brochure says that men are supposed to wear close toe shoes and long pants. You can wear dress shorts and polo shirt for men and ladies can wear summer dresses. I have seen some in shorts and t shirt with tennis shoes which are frown upon but they will not kick you out. Definitely no tank top bathing suit or cover ups in a la carte restaurants. I would recommend that you only drink bottled drinks. Bottled water 1L size is available at the concerige for free. We use that to brush our teeth and clean our tooth brush to avoid fod water poisoning as this country uses unfiltered water. All the soda drinks are bottled. The ice is fine to drink. Beer 52 is a popular beer and so is their Samy sosa. NIGHTLY SHOWS. The entertaining crew would walk around and ask guest to salsa between 9 \u2013 930pm. At 930 945pm the show starts. First night was the Michael Jackson show where they had an impersonator sing and dance to Michael Jackson debut albums. We saw the balancing act show on the last night we were there like a mini version of cirque de soleil and found that to be very entertaining. The other night shows were more of like Broadway dance shows and 80s or 90s rock dance show. Be warned that if you want covered seating you have to be at the theater around 830pm or so. Otherwise the remaining seats will be outside in uncovered area. It sometimes rain at night. BEACH EXCURSIONS. The beach is definitely not is as pictured on websites. No clear crystal blue Caribbean water here. It \u2019s where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Caribbean so the water is not crystal blue. It \u2019s more of a turquoise further out in the distance on clear days. But for the most part it is filled with sea grass. I do n\u2019t mean just little sea grass I mean tons sea grass. There are tractors that run the beach in the morning every other day where workers rake up the grass on the sand. But the ocean keeps bringing more in. Out of our 5 day stay it was on the last day as we were leaving did we see clean sand clean ocean with turquoise water and that only lasted from morning till noon time. If you can swim further out then the beach ocean is swimable. We booked an all day excursion to Sanoa Island. Beware of the locals on the beach trying to sell you an excursion. They say they are part of the hotel but when I asked the concierge they said that they are not in partnership with them and that the beach is a public beach with beach vendors trying to sell anything from jewelry to excursions and spa treatment etc. We booked our excursion thru Olympus Tours. There are a bunch of tour agents sitting in the theatre every morning at the hotel that you can approach and negotiate a deal for an excursion. We were able to get a deal for about 35 off asking price. The excursion was very long as the transportation to and from took forever. 70am pickup from our hotel and then going to other hotels to pick up other guest. By the time we made it to the catermeran party boat to head to the island it was 930am. 1 \u00bd hour on the party boat to the island for lunch and swimming in crystal clear blue Caribbean water. We stayed for about 3 hours on the island. Then another 20 mins speed boat ride to the natural pool for 30 mins swim. Then another 15 mins speed boat ride to snorkeling for about 20 mins. And then another 40 mins boat ride back to the bus for another 1 hour ride back to the hotel. We had people in our group do parasailing as well. Pack lots of sunblock the sun is scorching hot. It cost about 40 a bottle of sunblock on the resort if you run out. POOLS ACTIVITES. The pools are newly renovated and very relaxing. There is a flat screen TV with activity board listing the time and dates of each activity available. There is plenty to on the resort. Although it is listed that there are water sports activity such as jet ski wind sailing etc. It was not available. We did get to kayak but that was it for water sports. Water Park that is about 5 mins walking distance which contains about 6 or 7 slides. Really fun but make sure you get there early as toward the afternoon the line gets long. There is a drink station there but no snack food. Bring your own towel from the hotel as there are none available. They will not let you on the ride if your swim shorts have zippers. No jewelry or accessories is allowed watch earnings necklace bracelets or shoes. There is a paved pathway that leads from Palace to Bambu Macao and Bavaro hotels. We only have access to Bambu and Naobia where you can get drinks and eat in their buffet use their pool see shows and other amenities. You ca n\u2019t eat dinner at the a la carte restaurant is the only exception. Bavaro and Macao is off limits. CASINO. There is a very small the size of a bedroom casino on the resort of the palace. It \u2019s mainly slot machine and 1 black jack and 1 roulette table. There is another casino on the RIU property at Macao. Casino called Diamond. It \u2019s a little bigger the size of a small restaurant which has plenty of slot machines 2 black jack table and 2 roulette table and bar. Not many gamblers on the floor though. There is a free shuttle that will take you to the hotel and back. Drinks are not included at the casino. I mean if you want to gamble best to catch a cab ride to Hard Rock Resort. It \u2019s like a 20 cab ride over. There is night club is across the street of the casino. We never made it there but were told that admission is free but drinks were not included. DEPARTURE. Checkout time for the room is at noon. Our flight was at 4 pm and pickup was not scheduled until 1 pm. The concierge has a corner to hold luggage until transportation arrives. We were still able to have access to the resort amenities while we waited for our transportationOur departure experience at the airport was a nightmare and we almost missed our flight due to check in issue with Southwest. Be aware that there is a kiosk that you can print your boarding pass and luggage tag at the airport. Be sure to do this if you are waiting in the express line. They had 3 lines priority full service and express. Although we were at the express line it was the slowest line as it took about 25 hours to check in luggage and verify passport at the check in counter of southwest. We made it on the flight 5 mins before the door shut on the plane. I suggest that if you see a long line to have a person from your party wait in each one of those lines. Whichever line is called first is when you move your party to ensure you are covered on all bases. Otherwise you will be stuck at the mercy of the check in counter. The people at the airport speak very minimal English. I asked several times telling them we are going to be late and they did n\u2019t seem to understand or care. OVERALL We all had a good time. I would recommend this resort since it was recently refurbished. The staff are friendly and always has a smile. Although their English is very limited they do try their best to speak in broken English. Although we will not be traveling back to DR again because of the beach as that was a disappointment. Not RIUs fault as they can not control mother nature. On the last note several of us got sick on the last day with stomach issues diahrea even though we took numerous precautions. It may be related to the medium rare steak or the mixed drinks as it only affected a few of us. At least it was on the last day as we were departing.

The other night shows were more of like Broadway dance shows and 80s or 90s rock dance show. Be warned that if you want covered seating you have to be at the theater around 830pm or so. Otherwise the remaining seats will be outside in uncovered area. It sometimes rain at night. BEACH EXCURSIONS. The beach is definitely not is as pictured on websites. No clear crystal blue Caribbean water here. It \u2019s where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Caribbean so the water is not crystal blue. It \u2019s more of a turquoise further out in the distance on clear days. But for the most part it is filled with sea grass. I do n\u2019t mean just little sea grass I mean tons sea grass. There are tractors that run the beach in the morning every other day where workers rake up the grass on the sand. But the ocean keeps bringing more in. Out of our 5 day stay it was on the last day as we were leaving did we see clean sand clean ocean with turquoise water and that only lasted from morning till noon time. If you can swim further out then the beach ocean is swimable. We booked an all day excursion to Sanoa Island. Beware of the locals on the beach trying to sell you an excursion. They say they are part of the hotel but when I asked the concierge they said that they are not in partnership with them and that the beach is a public beach with beach vendors trying to sell anything from jewelry to excursions and spa treatment etc. We booked our excursion thru Olympus Tours. There are a bunch of tour agents sitting in the theatre every morning at the hotel that you can approach and negotiate a deal for an excursion. We were able to get a deal for about 35 off asking price. The excursion was very long as the transportation to and from took forever. 70am pickup from our hotel and then going to other hotels to pick up other guest. By the time we made it to the catermeran party boat to head to the island it was 930am. 1 \u00bd hour on the party boat to the island for lunch and swimming in crystal clear blue Caribbean water. We stayed for about 3 hours on the island. Then another 20 mins speed boat ride to the natural pool for 30 mins swim. Then another 15 mins speed boat ride to snorkeling for about 20 mins. And then another 40 mins boat ride back to the bus for another 1 hour ride back to the hotel. We had people in our group do parasailing as well. Pack lots of sunblock the sun is scorching hot. It cost about 40 a bottle of sunblock on the resort if you run out. POOLS ACTIVITES. The pools are newly renovated and very relaxing. There is a flat screen TV with activity board listing the time and dates of each activity available. There is plenty to on the resort. Although it is listed that there are water sports activity such as jet ski wind sailing etc. It was not available. We did get to kayak but that was it for water sports. Water Park that is about 5 mins walking distance which contains about 6 or 7 slides. Really fun but make sure you get there early as toward the afternoon the line gets long. There is a drink station there but no snack food. Bring your own towel from the hotel as there are none available. They will not let you on the ride if your swim shorts have zippers. No jewelry or accessories is allowed watch earnings necklace bracelets or shoes. There is a paved pathway that leads from Palace to Bambu Macao and Bavaro hotels. We only have access to Bambu and Naobia where you can get drinks and eat in their buffet use their pool see shows and other amenities. You ca n\u2019t eat dinner at the a la carte restaurant is the only exception. Bavaro and Macao is off limits. CASINO. There is a very small the size of a bedroom casino on the resort of the palace. It \u2019s mainly slot machine and 1 black jack and 1 roulette table. There is another casino on the RIU property at Macao. Casino called Diamond. It \u2019s a little bigger the size of a small restaurant which has plenty of slot machines 2 black jack table and 2 roulette table and bar. Not many gamblers on the floor though. There is a free shuttle that will take you to the hotel and back. Drinks are not included at the casino. I mean if you want to gamble best to catch a cab ride to Hard Rock Resort. It \u2019s like a 20 cab ride over. There is night club is across the street of the casino. We never made it there but were told that admission is free but drinks were not included. DEPARTURE. Checkout time for the room is at noon. Our flight was at 4 pm and pickup was not scheduled until 1 pm. The concierge has a corner to hold luggage until transportation arrives. We were still able to have access to the resort amenities while we waited for our transportationOur departure experience at the airport was a nightmare and we almost missed our flight due to check in issue with Southwest. Be aware that there is a kiosk that you can print your boarding pass and luggage tag at the airport. Be sure to do this if you are waiting in the express line. They had 3 lines priority full service and express. Although we were at the express line it was the slowest line as it took about 25 hours to check in luggage and verify passport at the check in counter of southwest. We made it on the flight 5 mins before the door shut on the plane. I suggest that if you see a long line to have a person from your party wait in each one of those lines. Whichever line is called first is when you move your party to ensure you are covered on all bases. Otherwise you will be stuck at the mercy of the check in counter. The people at the airport speak very minimal English. I asked several times telling them we are going to be late and they did n\u2019t seem to understand or care. OVERALL We all had a good time. I would recommend this resort since it was recently refurbished. The staff are friendly and always has a smile. Although their English is very limited they do try their best to speak in broken English. Although we will not be traveling back to DR again because of the beach as that was a disappointment. Not RIUs fault as they can not control mother nature. On the last note several of us got sick on the last day with stomach issues diahrea even though we took numerous precautions. It may be related to the medium rare steak or the mixed drinks as it only affected a few of us. At least it was on the last day as we were departing.

We have been to this RIU property many times before the renovation. We have also been to other RIU properties. This resort was in desperate need of the renovations. While I miss the beauty of the traditional decor the resort is still very beautiful. We had absolutely no issues with our room. The housekeeping team did a fantastic job of working around us and providing a beautifully cleaned room every day. While I have read that some experienced plumbing issues this was not our experience. The beach does have some seaweed but it is not a show stopper for us. We recognize this is an ocean and seaweed is to be expected. The resort truly does try to keep it clean but Mother Nature can not always be contained. There was no foul smell and we were not bothered by it. We had the pleasure of meeting Flores on the beach. He was so personable and ensured all of our desires were met. He works very hard all day in the hot sun and takes great pride in his work. He was truly a delightThe food in the restaurants was plentiful and we always found food we enjoyed. As mentioned we have been to this resort many times but last time we were there was two years ago. When we walked in to the buffet restaurant we were greeted by Raul. He was our server two years ago and remembered us. This guy is an absolute delight. We were very happy to see he was still there. While the resort is now different it is lovely in a new way. We used to go in March April timeframe but have now experienced that late August early September is much quieter and the resort was nearly empty. This is now our preferred time to visit.

We are Caribean and had no complaints with the taste of the food. They even had cowfot and oxtail one evening husband loved that. Our buffet staff was Sandy. He was amazing. Our little one loved him and always smiled when he saw him. The other staff were great too. At the steak house the lobster was AMAZING. We liked that we were able to go to Riu Bambu for the lunch buffet which had great options. Riu Bambu is more of a busy party younger fun crowd. While Riu Palace Punta Cana was more relaxing which we loved. The entertainment was not that great in terms of a show. However we arrived Sat night and left Sat evening.

To be honest all staff were amazing and very attentive. One negative just my view pool cleaning staff reserving beds by the pool that still remain reserved into the afternoon and left unused.

We recently spent a week at the Riu Palace Punta Cana as a belated birthday trip for my wife. We have stayed at a number of these Palaces before mainly in Mexico but decided on visiting Punta Cana after a 10 year break especially as this hotel was described as being fully refurbished in 2018Initial impression of the front of the hotel met our expectations very grand. This was supported on entering the hotel as the lobby was also very impressive. The whole of this front area was an amazing sight. Our disappointment started as soon as we entered our room. Whilst it had received some sort of an upgrade ie the bathroom the flooring throughout and perhaps the actual bed. The furniture in the room really did look the same as the furniture which we had in our rooms 10 years ago other than they had stuck wood on top which was similar to the new floor. The actual bed frame was also very old style dark wood very much in the old Caledonian style certainly not the bright airy rooms we experienced after upgrades in Mexico. We had a very small balcony with a small table and 2 chairs with very little to see as it overlooked the service road between us and the adjacent hotel. There was no light on the balcony either so a bit too dark to sit outside when you returned to your room after a night out. The main buffet restaurant was okay although we skipped the first evening meal as we were jet lagged and wanted an early night. At breakfast the next morning we were underwhelmed at the food on offer especially with no option of eggs cooked fresh to order. The scrambled eggs were certainly not the best we had eaten. The coffee was fine but the tea was served in a teapot without a lid the first day after which it was served in a small metal open jug exactly the same as the one the milk was served in. One of my pet hates is poor quality napkins. These were single ply 5 star. I do not think so. This standard was the same at the Steak restaurant at lunch but did improve at the evening meal where we did have real linen napkins. My first experience of the standard red wine was that I would not be drinking it. I could not drink any of this wine after the first sip. This did improve the following day when I was given a bottle of the presumably reserved wine. Many thanks to our waiter for that. Our disappointment continued after the meeting with our Rep who advised that you could not make a booking for the evening meal at any of the speciality restaurants. You just had to turn up when you wanted to eat and hope there was space. If not you were given a pager and would be called when a table was available. We decided not to even try this as we had similar service in Montego Bay last year and spent several hours waiting to get a table. So we had the main buffet for the entire week. Food did vary every night but again certainly nowhere near 5 star. Perhaps we expect too much but our expectations are only based on previous Riu standards in their other Palaces. The pools were all very good clean and not overcrowded. Obviously the one with the swim up bar was the most popular. We actually spent our sunbathing time on the beach this time which offered a very nice cooling breeze a superb beach and of course waiter service. Although that did vary depending on where you sat. The evening entertainment was unfortunately not of a very good standard either. We only saw 1 actual show Michael Jackson of course. We were a long way back from the stage as it was very popular. It was also spoilt by a small group of guests who were standing outside a nearby restaurant and making a LOT of noise. Nobody approached them to ask them to either be quiet or move. Quite a few of the audience actually left during the performance as they just could not hear it. Management should be more vigilant during such times. Immediately after that another group left a close by restaurant and decided to stand in what was the aisle so they could see the show. Fine for them but they blocked the view of everyone sitting behind them in the open courtyard. We were actually glad that we had only booked a 1 week holiday as after about 4 days we really did want to go home. That is not like us at all. Whilst I have given this hotel a very poor report I really must add that there were a number of highlights. The main asset of this hotel is without a doubt the staff. We made so many friends with them and nothing was ever too much trouble. I will not name any of them as there were so many. To all the staff we both thank you very much for the service chats and making us feel welcome. I will be very careful when booking another holiday at a Riu Palace in fact our next one is now booked at Moon Palace Cancun.

The restaurant menus are a little small so we just stuck to the buffet. The buffet had a good variety of food some basic food like pizza and fries for pickier people and other food like fish sushi plantain based dishes etc. The service we received was excellent. We were served at dinner by Raul and Wily and they took care of us every night. Highly recommend finding their area of the dining room. They made the stay excellent for us.

I am not going to waffle on and repeat all the other reviews yes the staff are fantastic and could not flaw them in any way the room was large and comfortable the food was plentiful and you could always find something to suit your pallet etc. So why is it no longer special. I here you askFrom our first visit here we noticed the little things were no longer given or there. Gone were the bathrobes or slippers that were in the rooms. The meet and greet at meal times Gone. Cushions on the sunbeds Gone. Decent evening entertainment Gone. What you got in it is place was stupidly loud music all based around the swim up bar and pool with entertainment geared up for the younger 18 30 generation and to top this off you had children in the same pool whilst the adults were entertained with drinking gamesThe bar behind the pool bar was an ideal place to relax once the noise had stopped as it overlooked the beautiful beach and sea. The only trouble was that it closed at 6 in the evening. What a waste. Many of the guest we spoke to would have enjoyed spending the evening there if it remained open. Many of the sunbeds on the beach were broken or sagging but once you found decent beds it was bliss that is until you backside goes numb due to the lack of a cushion. Mind you the waiter service on the beach helped. Overall we both enjoyed our stay at the hotel this is no longer a Palace. Until they sort out the little things we will not be going back. Just as a footnote. There are some shops in the area between the Palace Hotel and the Bamboo Hotel. Do not use the Pharmacy he is a complete rip off. He will overcharge way over the odds.
