We booked a king oceanfront on a high floor and we were upgraded to a king suite on the third floor which was just fine which had a fantastic balcony and was steps from the beach. We could hear the surf in our room with the patio doors open and it was wonderful. I spent a lot of time on the balcony very happy. There was a wedding the first night with a big party below us on the second floor. Thankfully the band quit at 1030. We ordered champagne for our room upon arrival 30. Champagne did not come to the room within an hour and we went to the beach and ordered it there. Went out in the evening and when we came back at 80 champagne was there. We took it back to the desk the next morning and the front desk wanted me to return it to the restaurant but I did not want to deal with it so I left it with them. It was taken off our bill. The housekeeping service was great with turn down service in the evening. I enjoyed having towels replaced two times a day since we went to the beach a lot and took a lot of showers. Beach service was very good. The only disappointment was that the electric floating chairs were not working. Small beach but not overcrowded. Nice and clean and great service. Great location. Two blocks from the butterfly conservatory where the troly stop pedi cabs and bike rental is. Away from the big crowds. The only real complaint I have is that the bed was uncomfortably hard. I expected a more luxurious bed. I do not mind paying high rates for great rooms and luxury I expect from the Waldorf Astoria hotels and this bed disappointed. I have had better beds in a Hilton Garden Inn. I was sad to leave Key West but so very happy to be home in my own very comfortable bed.", "offset": [1196, 1229], "date": "2015-01-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "79be22c6-3b37-48b4-b3e0-af4513538ddd", "sentence": "The beach and pool experience was wonderful.

Our room accommodations were changed at our request because our party of three was joyfully changed to two and thus we did not need the nicely sized studio room. Our new room was comfortable with an outstanding view of the water and pool area quiet and conveniently located by the elevator and parking area. A few tips. morning coffee is available in the Lobby but they do mean morning early morning 5 7 am. As is typical remember no glass containers by polside so if you bring your own beverages cans are a must. Polside service is available and the mixed drinks were refreshing. However if you prefer beer in the hot sun check out the deal in the gift shop. We found the pool staff to be on the ball and readily assisted with towels and lounge chairs.

The Reach a Waldorf Astoria hotel lives up to expectations with staff and amenities. Every staff member was professional friendly and available.

The pool was a nice size for both lap swimming and play and was convenient to the bar.

Workers began with jackhammers and other noisy things at 10 am generally after we had left for the day but worked until 5 or 6 so if we wanted a nap there was noise. We had an Expedia bargain rate so this was tolerable given the circumstances. Our room was another matter spacious attractive and clean but there were no drawers in any furniture except one small drawer in each night stand. A large console that supported the TV had only shelves. The counter that held the mini fridge did not even have shelves in the vacant end. There were thick fresh towels daily but the only towel bar in the large bathroom was inside the shower stall where whatever was hanging there towel or bathing suit would get splashed. LED lightbulbs in the bathroom were not very bright either. These small details were annoyances in our day to day routines. Great location on the quieter south end lovely pier and beach. Wonderful staff. large balcony with ocean view. South end was quiet an easy walk up Duval or Simonton to great restaurants and shopping. Nice beach pool. Love the Butterfly House very close by.

We spent a long weekend at the resort for my husbands birthday. I read reviews on the resort and found that overall it was rated at least a very good with some exceptions. I now understand why it was not rated excellent. The resort is very tired and worn. It really needs a good coat of paint everywhere and a deep clean. The elevators are very dirty inside and the wood looks like it has been chewed by termites. I am a Hilton Diamond member and always eligible for an upgraded room. When I asked if I could be upgraded they said the resort was fully booked. However I saw several rooms with a direct view of the water over the courtyard that remained empty the entire weekend of our visit. Very disappointed none of those rooms were offered to me. I heard this was really standard practice at this hotel. They leave these rooms open for walk ins so they can get the full value of the room. Not a good practice for regular Hilton customers. The beach area and the guys working the beach were wonderful. They were happy quick to set you up with chairs and an umbrella. Food drink service was available on the beach as well. That was a little spotty though. There was a small wedding held on the outdoor balcony below our room. We could hear the music and watch the dancing etc. The music was not too loud and there was actually fireworks after the reception. It was beautiful and everything was tastefully done as not to disturb any of the other guests. The food was very good at the resort and the pricing was inflated.

My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel because we were going on a cruise out of Miami and decided to spend some time in Key West. I chose this hotel because of the location and I give that a good rating. We were within walking distance of everything there is to do in Key West. The hotel itself is a little outdated and could use some updates. Additionally check in was supposed to be at 4. We arrived around 3 so we understood that our room was not ready yet. I will say that it seemed odd because we never saw that many people at the hotel while we were there. We checked our luggage and were told that our room should be ready by 4. I did not get a message that our room was ready until 445 which was very disappointing. Considering that this was a Waldorf I had expected top notch customer service. Any of my interactions with the front desk staff was mediocre. The room was clean. This just was not what I expected from a Waldorf Astoria. Pros are location to Key West activities was great access to the beach was very nice the employee in the gift shop was very helpful. Cons. Front desk was average rooms are in need of some updates and you are paying for the Waldorf name. I used 800 Hilton points to book this hotel for one night in order to avoid spending a lot. I have stayed at nicer Hampton Inns that cost me a lot less. I am a loyal Hilton member but when we go back to Key West I will look for a less expensive option.

The restaurant is absolutely the best. everything we ate was delicious from the eggs and sausage at breakfast to the burgers wings and shrimp flatbread at lunch to the grouper at dinner.
