We flew in early and arrived at the hotel at 9 am. They were able to get us into a room by 11 am which was appreciated and we got late checkout at 2 pm as our flight home was at 930pm. The front desk staff were nice enough. There is a nice outdoor pool with loungers tables chairs and sofas. The rooms were very dated and had 2 double beds. The washroom was tiny and the shower was awful. It barely drained and water backed up during a shower which was gross. They provide shampoo and conditioner but you have to ask at the front desk for lotion. We were getting ready for a wedding in the morning so we told the cleaners not to clean our room yet. The room never got cleaned and we had to ask for clean towels when we got back well past midnight. The restaurant was very average with mediocre food and expensive prices. I would suggest walking to a closeby cafe instead. Bf ends at 11 and lunch starts at 130. I asked for the quinoa and kale salad on the menu. The salad was made with mixed greens not kale. We were in a rush to eat as we had to get ready and leave the hotel by 1 pm. Our lunch took a long time to arrive as they were preping meals for conference guests. They should have told us there would be a delay before we ordered. I would not stay here again.

The LaGuardia Mariot has had a big makeover and some may find it a bit too modern. The lobby area is beautiful and as always the staff was courteous and very helpful.

The furnishings are modern with an interesting geometric design. Nice big flat screen TV. The tub in the bathroom has been replaced with a good sized walk in shower. I am all for this but the floor was very slippery and there was no grab bar. Elderly Aunt Hariet may have a problem here. The toilet paper roll location might also be a problem for Aunt Hariet as she is not as flexible as she used to be. On the plus side the bedding was very comfortable and instead of a tiny bedside table there was a larger round one that will better accommodate Uncle Hermans CPAP machine. The air conditioning and heating unit was a nice change as it was comfortable and quiet so you could hear the TV regardless of the on and off cycles of the machinery.
