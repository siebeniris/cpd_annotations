My last visit was several years ago and I was impressed. This repeat trip was equally enjoyable. I arrived on Super Bowl Sunday obviously a busy day but the hotel checked me in quickly and my room was clean and ready to go. The staff is attentive and easy to work with. A few notes on the room I took an ADA accessible room bc it was on a higher floor overlooking the Fountains at the Belagio room 5437. Note that it appears that such rooms do NOT have accessible balconies balcony but no door to access. I really enjoyed the large balcony on my last trip and had I known that the room did not have a balcony I would have opted for a lower floor with a balcony. Purely personal preference but something to know. On this trip I had a City Room. It was nice a standard size hotel room. On my prior trip I had a Terrace One Bedroom it was awesome. The Hotel did a great job with the conference set up and service from what I could tell was seamless. A daily upcharge was a little annoying but I understand that this is Vegas and the vacationer with no need for in room wifi greatly exceeds the business traveler. The gym is very nice. They do have various jogging routes and there are plenty of people running up and down the strip at 6 730 am every day. A fun time to see another side of Vegas.

The Cosmopolitan Hotel is beautiful. The casino was smoke free and bright the location can not be beat. Just a few minutes walk to CityCenter Belagio and Planet Hollywood. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were great. Having a balcony in Las Vegas is a very nice feature and the view of the Belagio Fountains was incredible. This is definitely their selling point and you pay for it. The layout of the room was very strange the two televisions had very weird placement and they each had their own remote which was not labeled and made working the TV confusing at first. The room has a minibar with a refrigerator stocked with drinks as well as a freezer spot to place your own items. There is a full sized microwave and a small dishwasher. There were no dishes or dishsoap so we were not sure why it was there. A coffee pot would have been much more appreciated. The strangest part of the room was the curtain. that separated the bathroom from the bedroom. The lack of complete privacy to the bathroom might be fine for couples but not for everyone. It was not sealed and there was no way to lock the curtain for privacy while showering changing. The room was in very bad shape for being the newest hotel on the strip. Furniture was dirty the light switches in the bathroom needed to be wiped down the back of the Tv remote was missing the door handles were loose the couches seemed very worn and the balcony was filthy. The railing appeared to be covered in spit from the rooms above us. The shower temperature control was lacking the water was scalding hot and there was no way to cool the water down. Instead the water just turned off completely. We were almost at the end of the hallway and it was still very noisy all night long because the doors were slamming all night long.

First as I stated the trip was for work for a conference but if I could have I definitely would have brought my husband with me it was a fantastic experience. I emailed the concierge department before my trip and they helped me set up a shuttle to and from the hotel to the airport Super Shuttle if you pay round trip up front it is 20 or 11 each way MUCH cheaper than a taxi. not only that Katie and Julie both in the Group Concierge office were AMAZING. They were kind and friendly and incredibly helpful regardless of the of questions emails I asked. sent. The woman who checked me in was so sweet and the process once I met with her was very fast. I did order room service twice during my stay the both times the food was much better than I expected and the customer service was top notch. The only 2 negative experiences I would say and the first maybe more of Vegas in general than the hotel. As someone who is on the heavier side I did not feel comfortable going to the pools. I felt totally out of place and so I just did not utilize that amenity. The other which I should have called the front desk about was a utility person knocked and then let themselves into my room to clean the terrace which I had NOT called about. This was a bit creepy but other than that I had a good experience. The housekeeping staff was great the Room was GORGEOUS a little dusty though I did not get to utilize the jacuzi tub I am afraid but the bed was great and the shower was HUGE.

The check in is directly to the left when you walk in with no actual lines but the staff comes from behind the counter to greet you and take you to them individually which is nice and a first for me. They explain charges room type and location up front and after you acknowledge you provide you credit card and are then given your room keys. Our room was on level 60 and in the EAST tower closest to the Strip. Room was clean air conditioned well and fully stocked and booby trapped refrigerator.

I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for a girls trip. We arrived at the hotel around 80pm on a Thursday night and did not have to wait in line to check in. We had booked a Terrace king room with pull out couch and were offered a fountain view for 50 more per night which we accepted. Upon entrance the hotel has a very modern and posh feel. The entrance and Lobby are not quite as extravagant as other hotels like Belagio or Caesars but definitely had a luxury feel to it. We stayed in the Chelsea Tower which was right near the check in desk and very convenient to the Uber Pick up area and Taxis. The boulevard tower is a bit more central to the casino and restaurants however our group was happy to be in the Chelsea tower with more convenience to the strip. There was also a great coffee shop right near the entrance of the Chelsea Tower called Va Bene which was very convenient. The room itself was stunning with the best view overlooking the Belagio Fountains I had ever seen. We loved the balcony attachment on the room something you had have to specifically book and the view upgrade was well worth it. The bathroom was very spacious even for 4 women to share and the beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed dining at the hotel at Beauty and Essex Milos and The Henry. We also enjoyed late night appetizers at CliQue followed by drinks at the Chandelier bar which is a must go to place if you are staying at the cosmopolitan. My only complaint would be the extremely slow elevators. I am not sure if the hotel was having mechanical issues during our stay with their elevators but it seemed as though only two were running. It took close to 15 minutes to get on an elevator on a Saturday morning and when we got on it was so packed we were squeezed in and stopped at every single floor. Several other guests were complaining about the elevator issues as well. The location of the hotel made it easy to access the strip.

Stayed here for 5 nights during memorial day weekend. I reserved a wraparound terrace suite with fountain view and was in the Boulevard Tower on the 21st floor. Excellent location. I had previous reviews about noise in the Boulevard Tower but our room was quiet. The layout was nice with separate kitchen and living area and a 2nd full bathroom. I had previously stay at the Wyn and the level of service between the two hotels are vastly different. At the Cosmopolitan the decor and furniture were worn and stains on the floor. The bed was not comfortable. There was no turn down service in the evening. There was a 35 resort fee per night and self parking was 10 night. Most of the 20 30something guests seemed to be quite intoxicated day or night. However at the Cosmopolitan having a terrace to walk on or sit and relax plus the views of the strip and the Belagio fountains is unequaled at any hotel in Las Vegas. So it will depend on your preferences for the same price if you want a 5 star hotel and service stay at Belagio or Wyn. If you want an average room with average service but an amazing view stay at the Cosmopolitan. We had dinner at Scarpeta one night and the food was fantastic I would definitely recommend that restaurant plus it overlooks the Belagio fountains. By the way I paid over 3500 for the 5 nights.

Cosmo is the hippest fanciest casino hotel in Vegas that attracts the youngest most beautiful people and the rooms designed as condos not hotel rooms have useful features and are very guest friendly. Nonetheless the hotel is quite flawed \u2026. Roms. The studio suite and 1BR suite have sitting areas 2 TVs a Jacuzi bath and a fridge and Microwave and a terrace frequently with a Belagio fountain view. What \u2019s not to like. Well quite frankly the rooms are more flashy than elegant even with all the lights on and the curtains open they are dark and the cleaning staff does not do a thorough job. The rooms at the Wyn Encore are better designed and \u201c happier and the rooms at Aria are more elegant than flashy. If I did n\u2019t love my host practicality and the location convenience of the Cosmo and the sportsbok area I would stay at Encore or Aria or Vdara for their rooms. Cleanliness Housekeeping. Maybe it \u2019s generational but both the rooms housekeeping and the bar wait staff were not taken care of. An entertaining story about the bathroom I take baths in hotels \u2013 they relax me. But I am aware that they may not be properly cleaned have read on line stories \u201c never take a bath in a hotel \u201d. so I quickly do a soap and washcloth cleaning before my first bath. No I am not a clean freak but this just makes sense. Well on arrival I looked in the bath saw a few small hairs and a couple of fingernail clippings. So I called housekeeping first time in 20 years. and they sent someone over to clean. After cleaning the bath she asked if I wanted anything else \u2013 I said no. But afterwards I looked around and saw that there were some smudges and dirt in the shower area so I cleaned myself and told management. And just as a test before leaving the next day I pulled 3 hairs from my head and left them in the bathtub. When I came back after the room was cleaned one was still there \u2013 obviously housekeeping is more about speed than thoroughness. And as for the bar \u2013 I sat down at the Chandelier Bar and there were about 10 dirty classes \u2013 I moved them to the side to make a space for me I will upload a photo. There were 3 bartenders on duty. It was 10 minutes before any of them bothered to clear them away and they still left four. WhatCasino. The Casino layout is easy to navigate and there is a choice of games \u2013 if you play BJ you can play a nice 8deck game with 3 2 odds at 25 minimum. If you need to do a 15 minimum you have to play 6 5 which is not acceptable \u2013 in that case you should switch to video poker or craps to minimize your losses. Dealers and wait staff are pleasant. Sports Book is run by Cantor Gaming which means you get good odds and lots of choices. And the bar next to it is overcrowded during football season \u2013 great if you do n\u2019t mind crowds. The buffet is overpriced but very good to excellent China Poblano used to be good but some new dishes stink eg way too much cumin in the dumplings. Secret Pizza is good by west coast standards but no better than average by NY or Chicago standards STK is very happening but food is B only. I do like the Greek place Milos. The gym is full of new equipment and quite frankly packed in the mornings. But very nice. If you want eye candy you will find it in droves \u2013 a very young beautiful crowd. So if you are going to Vegas with friends for sports food action and convenience stay at the Cosmo.

Our vacation was a 4 night get away for a married couple leaving the worries of work the kids and home behind. The Cosmopolitans slogan of \u201c just the right amount of wrong \u201d seemed to sum up what we wanted out of our trip. A lot of research went into finding the right room for our trip and the One Bedroom Fountain View Terrace Suite hit all the checkboxes. The room has a Japanese soaking tub. A square 2 person deep tub up against the mirrored window with a view of the Belagio fountains. Who needs a pool or spa when you have access to that. The room also has a terrace just off the bedroom with magnificent fountain views and views of the North Strip. Where else in Las Vegas can you and your significant other lounge on a terrace enjoying a whiskey and a cigar wrapped only in a blanket. A massive walk in shower adjacent to the Japanese tub leads to a bathroom with double vanities. These one of a kind amenities make it easy to overlook the occasional not so perfect aspects of the hotel. Being a very organized vacationer I wanted to maximize our time in Las Vegas and had most days and evenings planned out in advance. We flew in on a Sunday just before noon and had a reservation to watch the Seahawks football game at a Sports bar in the Miracle Mile Planet Hollywood across the street at 115. This was an ambitious undertaking considering we were landing at McCaran less than 2 hours earlier and I \u2019d heard about extensive waits at the Cosmopolitan checking in. The vacation package was booked through Costco Travel which included \u2018 invited guest check in \u2019. Thanks to a good cab driver and the invited guest check in we went from wheels down at McCaran to unpacking in our room in 45 minutes. The other check in lines were a little bit longer I \u2019d expect that no one had more than a 30 minute wait. I think one of the advantages of the \u2018 invited guest check in \u2019 may have been priority access to rooms. We were checking in early 1230 and were given an amazing room on the 52nd floor of the Chelsea Tower. For those unaware the Chelsea Tower is scheduled for renovation the Boulevard Tower closer to the strip has had most rooms renovated more on that laterA little bit of organization can make your trip so much more enjoyable and thank you to previous tripadvisor reviewers for helping me know how to get organized. \u2022. Reviewer after reviewer complained about not having coffee makers in the rooms. Prior to the trip I purchased a 1 cup coffee maker from Walmart for 139 and on arriving to Las Vegas we picked up 1 lb of Starbucks French Roast at Walgrens across the street and the problem is solved. You can wait in line every morning for a 5 coffee downstairs or make one in your room in your PJ \u2019s for a fraction of the price. Now we have a small travel coffee maker or you can take the route my sister in law took on another trip and just leave it in the room it \u2019s still cheaper and more convenient. \u2022. Reviewers have also complained about the price of the minibar and getting charged for items they only moved in the mini bar. DON\u2019T OPEN THE MINIBAR then. The first thing I did on getting to the room was call guest services and got a small fridge delivered to the room No charge. Except for the 5 tip for the nice gentleman that got it there in 10 minutes. Get your free fridge and stock it up with water refreshments beer cream for your coffee etc. from Walgrens which is a 5 minute walk away. If you are organized like I am you can also go buy a whole pizza at Secret Pizza and keep the leftovers in the mini fridge for the balance of your trip. There are still microwaves in the Chelsea tower rooms. You can also pick up your favorite spirits at Walgrens. We mixed 90 of our cocktails in room it \u2019s Vegas. no one cares and save yourself some money. \u2022. Reviewers have complained that the room is dark and it is hard to see and this is certainly true in the living room area of the one bedroom suite. If you are going to spend any amount of time in this area or lighting is that important to you get a different room. In these rooms the bedroom and bathroom are adjacent to the natural lighting on the terrace and that is where we spent our time\u2022. A few reviewers have complained about the TV not functioning correctly. Why go to Las Vegas and watch TV. Anyone can do that from home. Our TV did n\u2019t go on once. If we wanted to watch something we \u2019d step out on the terrace and watch the incredible view. Every day we were finding new and interesting things to see. \u2022. A few reviewers have complained about housekeeping. Our room was very clean and there is an envelope to tip your maid. Please tip your maid it is a lot of work to keep these rooms in top shape. We used a glitter bath bomb one time and my wife said it looked like we murdered a stripper in the tub. We tried to help out by rinsing it out a few times. When we were in our room the \u2018 do not disturb \u2019 sign was on the door and we were not disturbed. On the second day we only vacated the room between 2 5PM and when we came back the room was not made up. Do n\u2019t expect housekeeping to be psychic knowing your comings and goings. This was n\u2019t a big deal a quick call got us some fresh towels and the next day just before stepping out of the room I called guest services letting them know our schedule and the room was cleaned promptly. \u2022. Some reviewers have complained about the lack of privacy in the room. Both the shower and tub are completely exposed to the bedroom. There are blinds but if someone wants to get a look in there is nothing stopping them. This one bedroom is designed for a couple. If you are booking the Cosmo with your cousin or your Grandma book a different room. I think some of these complaints have lead to the design changes in the Boulevard Tower. I believe the window to the shower now has some tinted feature on it that prevents guests from seeing into the shower. The hotel is sexy from top to bottom and losing this feature makes it just a little bit more like every other hotel on the strip. I \u2019ve also heard the renovated rooms have no microwave or bar sink. If these are important to you at this time ask for the Chelsea Tower. \u2022. This also leads me to some reviewers complaining that the room is n\u2019t appropriate for children with wall hangings of partially clothed women etc. LAS VEGAS is not appropriate for children. Our room had a picture book of 18th and 19th century Japanese paintings of \u2018 intimate \u2019 positions. If you do n\u2019t want your children to get an early education and you must take them to Las Vegas stay at Circus Circus. In Vegas there are n\u2019t near as many sidewalk vendors with the little cards with the \u2018 straight to your room escorts \u2019 but there are a few and this is still Sin City. The food at this hotel never let us down. Wicked Spoon was ok. Secret Pizza Beauty Essex and Egslut were exceptional. For cheaper eats the bridge over Las Vegas Blvd from the second floor takes you to McDonalds Taco Bell Pink \u2019s hot dogs etc. The hotel was perfectly centrally located in the prime real estate on the strip. We spent a day exploring North Belagio Caesars Mirage TI Venetian Harahs The Linq Balys Paris. And a day exploring South Aria Monte Carlo soon Park MGM NYNY Excalibur Luxor MGM etc. Only once did we take a cab besides our trips to and from the airport. If you are staying off strip or at one end of the strip or the other expect to pay for cabs or wait around for the busses. To sum things up this one bedroom fountain view terrace room may not be for everyone but it was perfect for us. Expect to pay a premium for this room but as long as the price for this room is in line with the other premium properties on the strip I ca n\u2019t see staying anywhere else.", "offset": [3476, 3628], "date": "2017-12-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "f5f371b4-280d-4c03-aeb4-2957a56073ae", "sentence": "Extremely satisfied and would recommend to others. Amazing hotel and probably one of my favorite on the strip. You literally have everything at one very chick place. Perhaps a note that the restaurants on the third floor should prioritize hotel guests. Great location perfect rooms gigantic balconies amazing service literally ca n\u2019t find a single complaint. Amazing service. Got upgraded to the 54th floor when they saw me all tired from the Grand Canyon trip. No breakfast area. I only tried the paid restaurants on the third floor and the food there was pretty ok. Got to see two rooms as I was upgraded halfway my stay. Modern with spacious living space and big closet.

I have heard so much about this place and it definitely lived up to the hype. A small group of us went for a 50th birthday celebration. I will state that one of the guests in our party has high roller status so our entire party had top of the line VIP treatment so this may not apply to most guests. Our party was treated like royalty. The suites and penthouse were amazing. I had a suite on the 51st floor with a beautiful view of the Strip. It included a safe a soaking tub with a window for a nice view while in the tub very large glass shower fridge large screen TV with good channel variety and a large comfortable bed. I was located in the the boulevard tower. The only complaint for lack of a better word is that I could hear all the noise from the pool dayclub during the day. Fortunately it did not start until around noon and ended about 7 pm DJ music and not good music either club music yuck. I was a bit surprised being up so high but the halls and the rooms were otherwise quiet and I heard no other noise. I just turned the TV up a bit and it pretty much drowned it out. The decor in the hotel is really over the top it is Vegas after all it was stunning loved the pink chandeliers. We ate at The Blue Ribbon Egg Slt yes Egg Slt and The Henry. All were absolutely delicious but be prepared to wait in line for everything esp Egg Slt. We were able to bypass the lines because of our status just an observation. I have been to Vegas several times it is been a while between trips but the lines everywhere were what I would consider ridiculous. do not plan on getting a quick meal anywhere even fast food. Just a tip. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Mostly younger crowd though most certainly the hippest place on the strip.", "offset": [1505, 1636], "date": "2018-07-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "d56fa23f-c498-437f-8e01-d1ce94c94a2f", "sentence": "Spectacular.

The check in and check out was quick and smooth and not only were my requests fulfilled but the sweet woman at the Front Desk unfortunately I did not ask her for her name and Mr Brandon Dunlap Lead Guest Services went even further. The room Terrace Studio with two queen beds is beautifully designed. It is spacious extremely comfortable everything was spotless and the view. We were on the 58th floor and we watched the Belagio fountain show multiple times sitting on the terrace. It was a thrill looking at them and the strip from high above. I had read that this establishment is popular with young adults however I came with my elderly parents and they enjoyed it. Especially my Mom could not stop raving about it. She was convinced and so was I that the right choice was made. It is centrally located which was perfect for us. I definitely would recommend anyone to stay here. It is ultra modern and sophisticated with plenty of Art displayed throughout the property. I particularly enjoyed looking at the columns in the Lobby with the changing images.

What kind of nonsense is that. It was Mikala that informed us at the desk that we could check out late.

Let \u2019s start with the good and there is a lot. This property is absolutely stunning and is located in one of the best locations in Las Vegas strip. A new sparkling building with modern touches of cool modern class. The rooms are the only ones on the strip with balconies. I highly suggest looking over the Belagio fountain to make this experience really worthwhile. Now the bad and the reason why I can only give this hotel 2 star. When did hotels provide such a minimum amount of amenities in rooms that you have to pay to get a kettle. There are no coffee making facilitiesWhen do you book a one bedroom terrace room and get downgraded to a studio but they claim it \u2019s an upgrade. When does a room include a stunning bath but no bath salts. How is it acceptable for a five star hotel to provide two loose sheets over a comforter which was dirty when you have a massive balcony but no sofa when you provide an over crowded pool area with sun beds but no umbrellas unles you are willing to pay 200 for a canopy. You pay an additional 50 for resort fee and yet you feel like the hotel management is looking at you as an ATM. Is this really the age that you pay a crazy high nightly price. and they feel it \u2019s enough to provide guests with the absolute minimum. A room with a full kitchen area and yet the only thing provided was a fridge. No microwave. No coffee machine no cutlery. It \u2019s ugly it \u2019s predatory and I ca n\u2019t believe the Mariot group are willing to put their name to such an unhospitable experience. Adding the Mariot name is really name only as the rewards are not respected just like their clients. There is enough choice on the strip to find amazing and hospitable. My advise is find somewhere else where your money is respected.", "offset": [711, 770], "date": "2019-09-07", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "242050c1-46c0-43c6-b4ab-860c5e31dfe2", "sentence": "We spent a few nights celebrating our daughters birthday.
