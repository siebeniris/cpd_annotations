They wanted a copy of my husbands deployment orders for a military discount but in the end they would not give it to us and said that only military orders bringing us to Eglin AFB would be honored.

Housekeeping brought one if you had call it that. One side would not completely straighten even though it was locked. The bottom padded board was missing. It was just a fabric sleeve with the cardboard type thing missing. My husband complained and the housekeeper responded Well it is what we have and put a couple comforters on the bottom. We ended up stuffing a couch cushion into a fitted sheet and crammed it in the bottom of it then put blankets around it so there were no gaps. Thankfully the cushion was just about the right size. I expect more from a 400 hotel room. Much more. Why could not the front desk staff I talked to have been honest told me they had them but they sucked and advised me to bring my own. The room itself was dated appeared old and obviously had not been renovated or updated in quite some time. Not to mention all of the creepy earwig bugs myself and my daughter squashed with our flip flops. I told the front desk staff that the quality of the room was not worth the rate. They were very unacomodating told us it was all about location told us they wished there was something they could do and kept telling us the nearby hotels had similar rooms for much higher rates. Well I had bet their rooms were nicer. And with an infant and fussy high maintenance terrible 3s 3year old in tow moving to another hotel after unpacking was not an option for us.

Realizing all drugstore items were up front I went back to find girl still filing her nails. Realizing she was the only other person in the store I asked if she worked there since she never asked if she could help me or better yet never even acknowledged me and had no name tag on. She replies with a \u201c yea \u201d and continues filing nails. I then asked if she had my needed item and she replies \u201c yea right there behind the counter \u201d continues filing nails. I then tell her I would like to purchase said item and she continues filing nails as she makes her way behind the counter where she stops and continues filing nails. When she decides her nail is to her liking she gets my item and rings it up. Worst customer service I have pretty much ever encountered.

As we arrived we approached the front desk to check into our room. We were told that there had been a glitch in their computer system and that we could not check into our room or be advised on a time frame as to which we would be provided any information pertaining to our already paid for rooms. Initially I thought to myself that that was uncontrollable. However what was controllable was the response from the staff. While they had pleasant attitudes no one seemed to be in a hurry to seek how they could be of assistance. They were only interested in collecting payments. Finally after several request to speak to a manager for assistance we were completing the check in process. At this point we observed the very misleading front entrance to this so called resort. As we entered our room we noticed how filthy and dirty the carpet was everywhere. Upon entering our room we noticed make up stains and hair all over the bed sheets and hair wet hair on our towels and also that our carpeting was filthy. We asked for the room to be cleaned and the maid seemed more than 3to help. The television in our room had a malfunction so we also asked for the maintenance guy to check up on correcting the issue. We called the staff several times for towels which they did bring new towels 30 minutes later with wet hairs sunken into the fibers of the towels. When we asked about why everything was filthy there only response was that they were short staffed and that remodeling was taking place. Those accounts were true but what was also true was a lot had to do with simple neglect and insufficient systems in place to ensure this cleaning for all paying guests. Tge simple thing to say is it all because of remodeling and not take responsibility for failed systems especially considering the debris was unattended multiple days at a time. After our stay there was another issue with the staff charging our account double and failing to repay refund in as timely a manner in which they deducted from our accounts. When we called to inquire about the transactions we were asked why it was an issue and what we needed to speak to a manager. I understand it is protocol for staff members to attempt to not further escalate issues which free management to work out other issues but a handful of times this protocol adds further insult to guest who had requested direct management intervention for specific issues. In conclusion this hotel resort is not the place I had recommend to anyone unles you are interested in filth and sun par accommodations.", "offset": [104, 170], "date": "2019-04-14", "cpt": "3", "category": "room"}, {"id": 33, "uid": "42dd03cf-e2ad-40e3-9989-477970a1d81d", "sentence": "Love Location Love the Amenities not a Fan of the Rooms.

The room I knew were gon na be less than excellent given by the previous reviews before I checked in but that \u2019s why we asked the guy at the front desk for a renovated room our room was in front of the court yard facing the hot tub and island grille. They are tiny outdated definitely need more work if that \u2019s the renovated room plus the ability to hear conversations from other guests in the shower which i thought was weird. The walls are that thin. They could hear us and we could hear them. I was really hoping the grotto was open but I know they are renovating so I understand that. Thank God I did n\u2019t see these until the day we were checking out we were packing our room and i saw one roach and my husband killed it and then putting our suitcases on the luggage cart we saw a huge roach next to the air conditioner that I stepped on did n\u2019t know it was there. and I heard a crunch. it was disgusting. I ca n\u2019t stand those things. I was immediately creeped out knowing that we could \u2019ve been sleeping with those in our room.
