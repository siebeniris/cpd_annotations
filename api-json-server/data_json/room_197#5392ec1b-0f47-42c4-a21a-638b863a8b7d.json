We have stayed at this hotel a few times over the past 3 years as my daughter was studying at Erasmus university. As always the staff are very friendly and efficient. The hotel itself is reasonable modern. This time I requested a room for 3 people myself and my 2 daughters and accordingly paid a higher price. This unfortunately meant they put an extra bed in a room that already has a double bed and no space for a 3rd so it was very tight. Not ideal i would have preferred if they had told me that they do not cater fr 3 people in a room.

The Hampshire Savoy in Rotterdam is rated as a four star hotel. One of the reasons I booked a hotel at the Hampshire was the location but also as we were staying at least three days over the new years weekend I thought we had go for something pretty clean and comfortable that I thought I might be familiar with. Having been in a Hampshire hotel in Groningen I was ultimately disappointed by the one in Rotterdam. At the same price the contrast was glaring. The hotel in Groningen although not centrally located was modern sleek clean and bright everything the Savoy in Rotterdam was not. The positive Like I have read from many reviews the staff at the reception are incredibly friendly and are doing a wonderful job. The location of the hotel is very good for a weekend visit very close walk to the city center and the wonderful Markthal which honestly might be the best thing Rotterdam has going for it. The negative. Brace yourselves. the place needs and update in info and style. The confusing WiFi information. I am not sure but I think Hampshire no longer has the paying WiFi in the room despite the dated information in the little hotel book thingy. If it is free the book needs an update. If one still has to pay for WiFi which I think and hope we did not do. well that is in itself out dated. In terms of style the whole hotel could use major overhauling or a reduction in its star rating. It is to be crude an ugly hotel. I read reviews dating back from 2013 where the response by a hotel representative to a commentator pointing out the dreariness of the place was that an overhaul was going to happen. Well three four years later and I suspect nothing has happened. The room itself looked like the rest of the place. The colors of the room were dark and gloomy. The lamps did not brighten up anything. We were in room 102 a corner room next to the elevator facing a grey building and a small ugly street. I know there is always an option to upgrade and pay for superior rooms which are the same rooms I suspect the Hampshire likes to use to promote itself on their website. but at some point one has to wonder if the cheapest and smallest room at a hotel should not account for the general standard of the place. The room had no minibar we chilled our cheap bottle of new years Proseco near the window a sad experience indeed the tv was not plugged in and I do not mean the electricity plug I mean the thing that plugs the tv to the box so we can get channels surely an odd thing to be unplugged. We also got the fake double bed thing where you can fall in the gap in the middle when the beds drift apart at night those things should be banned. The room was dirty. The table under the TV had white dried out crusty bits on it. There were cups and a boiler but the inside of the boiler was filthy. So much so that we did not even have the courage to ask for it to be cleaned because frankly we just did not want to use it anymorelet us just generally say that it is not a room one wanted to inspect too closely for dirt and stains. The bathroom could have used a round of thorough cleaning and was very small. Lack of Isolation and heat We heard everything through the doors and the walls it is not very isolated and you can hear everything that is going on in the hall way. Although the aircon heater thing seemed to be turned on it did not feel like 25 degrees celsius. We might have been confused to how the thing worked but by default the room was cold when we got there and stayed cold until we leftThe price I did not look too closely at the hotel room price it was expensive for what we got. What felt like a rip off was the price of breakfast. I decided to include breakfast online the day before. I got the bokingcom ap so I got a message saying that the total price of the room was updated to include breakfast. When we got to the hotel the receptionist said the room was paid for so I assumed that included the latest modification concerning breakfast. However it did not and I had to pay a city tax still do not know what that was for and breakfast for the full three days at the end of our stay. They registered that we only had breakfast once despite ordering it for the full trip and as a goodwill I do not know why we could not have just paid for that one morning. We do admit responsibility for booking breakfast in advance for the three days but there was to my knowledge not an option to just book it for one day but they were aware we only consumed it once they even said so at the reception. The breakfast is 17 euros by head by day. so yeah an expensive affair indeed. All in all what is frustrating and somewhat anger inducing is the misleading star rating. It is majorly inflated for this hotel and if it is based on the quality of the superior rooms I can only conclude that no faith can be given in these ratings. I also think that rather than concentrating the efforts in overhauling the superior rooms I can only assume they are in better state I might be wrong. a hotel can prove its worth by making even the cheaper rooms clean hygienic pleasant and somewhat comfortable to stay in. Until then I can not recommend this hotel and I will probably not return there myself Kudos to the reception staff though.", "offset": [4734, 4892], "date": "2017-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "ed70085a-755e-44ba-ab3d-62a6f88e49a3", "sentence": "Conveniently located hotel in Rotterdam.
