I was visiting San Diego solo and really enjoyed my stay at this gorgeous hotel. it is in the perfect location in the Gaslamp Quarter within walking distance of tons of restaurants and bars. Upon check in I was warmly welcomed by an Andaz host. I explained that since I was travelling alone that I would prefer not to authorize the 100 day incidental rate. He was able to just authorize a total of 100 which I appreciated. O there is free wine at check in at certain times. ChersI headed up to my room on the 6th floor in a corner which I loved. It was at the end of the hallway and I had a pretty good view of the city. I actually slept with my windows open since the weather is perfect. I enjoyed hearing the sounds of the city my favorite part of my stay. Well the king size bed was super comfy and the bathtub was spacious so those are a close second and third on the list of favorite things.", "offset": [673, 740], "date": "2015-07-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "567c2348-a77d-4ff2-90f5-5709c71fca1b", "sentence": "No comparison with another Andaz I have stayed before. I have stayed at Andaz in Shanghai China before and that stay left long lasting impression. In fact I was so impressed with Andaz that when I found out there is an Andaz in San Diego I decided to book there even though I can find less expensive choice in the same Gaslamp area in same category. Well I have to say I was disappointed. The building is an old building room is small the feel of the super modern Andaz is just not there. However I did enjoy the breakfast on the roof top.

My initial experience of Andaz San Diego was a little let down. Although front desk was very acomodating due to our early arrival the room they set us up with was in a hall way that smelt like industrial cleaner. The signature king was quite small and not suitable for a honeymoon stay. The room had peeling wall paper and the doorways were very chipped and damaged. It was not a good start for a honeymoon. However after one call to the front desk the staff was very responsive in trying to make our stay as pleasant as possible. We were upgraded and from that point on we did not have any further problems. Even being on gaslamp the junior suite was away from all the noise. We were able to sleep sound at any time of the day. The valet was kind and responsive with the text application and convenience was top notch.

I wanted to love this hotel mostly because I truly fell in love with the Andaz in Costa Rica. Overall it is a solid hotel with a hip vibe and better than other places I have stayed in San Diego. That said it has some design quirks that put form before function. The rooms are cool. But practicality does not seem to have been taken into account in the room design. The shower is fully exposed to the room. This could be a cool feature if the shades were appropriately matched to the room you can either lower the rolling shade and shower in the total dark or you can leave the shade open and give the neighbors across the street a show. Why not leave the heavy blind but have a sheer cover that would give some privacy while allowing light into the room. Similarly the closet is only about a foot wide so for a longer stay or for more than one person you have almost no closet space. Also the chair at the desk could not be pulled out without actually dragging the couch to the opposite wall. So yes cool design but many impractical elements. Room service was good. The roof deck bar and pool are beautiful. I did not like the loud club music at the pool and would have preferred a more mellow quieter vibe up there. The gym was functional and above average. Service was only average. Most of the staff was pleasant but not one was particularly friendly or happy. I would stay here again. With a more energetic pleasant staff and some small changes to the rooms this could be an outstanding property. Anyone traveling in the near term should know that the lobby is under renovation a new restaurant is being built so the main lobby is currently out of service.", "offset": [1138, 1246], "date": "2016-04-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "372f9e43-eaa4-42cf-a744-4a00cd24451e", "sentence": "First Class Service. I came to SD on a business trip with my husband. This is my last night at the Andaz SD. I am sad to go. I will begin with the first night. Our room was by the elevator mechanical room and I guess with the travel it just was not a restful night for me despite the complimentary earplugs on the side table. What happens next is why I LOVE the Andaz and am committed to staying here upon my return. I was immediately escorted to another UPGRADED room and was personally moved by Riley. We chatted away and before I knew it he had me set up with my first Uber ride and a locals itinerary to get my day going. He guided me on what beaches to go to where to eat and put me in the car with care. That evening I realized my husbands favorite pajamas were somewhere in the sheets of the old room. I gave Dan at the front desk a description and he made a series of calls to the laundry service to find them. The next morning he saw me in the lobby and told me he was not able to find them. He asked me what size they were and 2 days later when we came down for an outing they handed my husband an exact replica same brand and color brand new. I could not believe the amazing gesture. Each day has been the same. I come down to the lobby grab my excellent coffee and chat with my buddy Riley about what I should do to get the most out of my trip. It seems to be a small staff of very competent gentleman that run this hotel. I will not forget this place and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking to be taken care of while visiting San Diego. PS each room has a nice array of complimentary snack and drinks that were a wonderful addition to my day as I packed them as travel snacks.", "offset": [1001, 1153], "date": "2016-05-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "01cfef16-85e2-4887-9d18-641eb900d930", "sentence": "If you want to be near the action of the Gaslamp District. I really like this hotel. it is more of a hipster hotel not a lot of kids. but I brought our 4 YO son and parents with me. This was a business family trip. The staff is amazing. They treat you so well and I love the Nespreso coffee and infused water in the reception area. This hotel is walking distance to all the great bars lounges in the Gaslamp. My only complaint would be that one of the rooms we got faced the inside courtyard our room had double beds. I do not recommend you get those rooms because they are dark humid and face the other room which is a little too close for comfort. You want to get the rooms with the king size bed and that face the street so that the light pours into the room. I had the dark cave room and gave my parents the light and bright room. It really is a big difference. Note it can get loud if you are facing the street but when you are in the heart of the Gaslamp. the energy and buzz from the neighborhood is to be expected.

If you are not a business traveler this may just be the place for you. Walking distance to restaurants and clubs in the Gaslamp the location will be perfect for many. If you are a business traveler however there are a few things in how the rooms and hotels are set up that just fail to provide the amenities and convenience you are looking for while on the road. Rooms are quite modern but lack accessible electrical outlets they exist but you have to go under the desk to get to them. when working at the desk. Street noise. The hotel provides earplugs is that ever a good sign. Beware. Hotel gym is smal two treadmills. Another sign of a hotel that does not cater to business. Only one restaurant in house and it is located on the rooftop. When I arrived they were closed for a private event which left room service as my only option on property. Complimentary coffee is offered in the lobby but it will fall short if you are a true Starbucks patron closest Starbucks is about 4 blocks away.

I stayed here recently in room 316 for 6 nights for a work conference. Overall I was very happy with my stay. I had arrived at the hotel early about 830a to drop off my bags. They told me my room was ready and went ahead and let me check in which was really nice. I was even upgraded to a large king room. The room was comfortable and well appointed overlooking the street. The housekeeping could have been better as there was a lot of dust in the room. The shower was large with 2 shower heads and a huge glass window open to the room. The shower did have a curtain you could close to the room but do not expect full privacy. I was alone in the room so this was not a huge concern for me but I could see how it could be for others. Note to the hotel please put a grab bar in the shower. I slipped and fell pretty hard. I feel lucky I did not get too hurt just a few bruises. I noticed the shower was slippery and put down the provided rubber mat but it was only 1x2 in a much larger shower. The room was pretty standard comfortable bed although the pillows were too full IMO. My room was right off the elevator and opened to the front street. I had no issues with noise what so ever and slept like a baby. The pool is small and only 3 ft deep so not a great swim. Also the sun chairs were almost always full mid day and despite having 3 cabana areas that were always empty they were roped off with reserved signs. Bee prepared to either arrive early or go without a chair. They also do not have a waitstaf at the pool so if you want a drink or food you have to go to the bar to order.

I came for a short visit to enjoy the hotel and surrounding neighborhood. Pros. Nice exterior of an historic building. Cool modern decor on the interior. All the staff from the valet to the front desk to the maids were very friendly and accommodating. Complimentary wine at check in and in room soda water juice with a few snacks was a nice touch and appreciated. Check in is at 30. The room was clean with comfortable beds. The furniture and fixtures had some scratches wear for a place just renovated in 2017. My interior of the building room lacked a view but from what I read that is the price to pay in order to ensure a quiet room here away from the street. It was quiet until I heard doors slamming in the morning. The rooftop lounge and bar area had a nice atmosphere with a city view which I enjoyed. Cons. No onsite parking valet only so pull your car up to the front I drove around the hotel a few times looking for their parking. Be aware of the one way streets. Okay fine. I understand the high cost of downtown parking35 but if you need in and out privileges it is 49 day. This was not spelled out when making a reservation. do not forget anything in your car you will not have access to it. The place is compact with only a small lobby and the rooftop area to hang out in. The lower level had some conference going on. I had dinner at the rooftop bar and the food was not good watery mashed potatoes that tasted like instant potatoes and poorly prepared broccoli and asparagus. The fish was just okay. This Gaslamp District neighborhood was not comfortable or inviting to me. During a stroll I did enjoy seeing some restored turn of the century buildings but that was it. There is no shopping. I was not charmed into entering most of the places I passed. There were homeless people on every street I walked. Some were walking around and a few were sleeping in doorways with their trash left behind. I recently visited NYC Paris Rome and I did not experience anything quite like this when sightseeing. Sketchy neighborhoods are places I avoid when on vacation. Because of this atmosphere I will not be returning to the Andaz San Diego.
