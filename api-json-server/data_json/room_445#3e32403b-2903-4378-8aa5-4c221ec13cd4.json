Ride this past weekend and we booked this hotel for a 1 night stay after his 200 mile bike ride. Check in was fast and easy and staff was friendly. The room was spacious clean and the king size bed was very comfortable. We had no troubles falling asleep after such a long day and did not notice any airplane noise at all. We went out for dinner Saturday night after his ride and barely touched our food because we were exhausted after such a long day. We decided to pack it up so we could munch on it later. When we got back to our room we noticed there was no mini fridge or microwave. So unfortunately the food went to waste. They were able to accommodate our late check out request of 4 pm so we could go sight seeing for the day and leave his bike and our luggage in the room w out having to cart it around town. Husband is leery about leaving his bike on the car when we are out and about. There is no in room safe but we did not have anything of value besides his bike to lock up during this trip.

My son and ourselves mom and dad stayed in a suite at the Sheraton PDX. It was the worst suite we had ever stayed in and I do not think we will be back. The room was dark the d\u00e9cor was horrible and it looked like it had not been cleaned in months or housekeeping could not see the dirt and filth. The tables in the sitting room were so smeared and not clean under the glass that we could not have put any food on them. It was disgusting. The hallways had such an old and worn look to them as did the furnishings in the room. The tiles around the bathtub and shower had mildew on them and we could not hardly turn the faucet handles on the sink like they were rusted. And when we turned the hot handle it squeled so loud the other rooms had to hear it. The drain in the sink was all rusted around it also. The room had a real old smell to it when we walked in the room. We did not get in till three of the clock in the morning due to plane cancellations but we did not expect a suite to ever be like this in any hotel. The front desk was friendly and even offered a late check out for us but it was the room that was so poor. We have no idea how their other rooms are at that Sheraton but we feel the whole hotel need an update and better maintenance. To us there was no excuse especially when you are paying for a suite. Also there was hardly any plug ins for your cell phones.
