The interior is very nice and spacious. It appears this hotel has been remodeled. Due to a mistake with booking they upgraded or room to a suite. The room has a living room separated by a door. I was surprised to see the living room only had one single chair in it and no sofa to sit on to watch tv. The room was spacious and we enjoyed the Sleep Number Bed. The room has 2 balcony as it was a corner unit. The bathroom was also very big and it had a jacuzi tub which we did not use. Although the fixtures and everything in the room is new it may still have old pipes. It took about 10 minutes to get full hot water to come out of shower head. Also the room smelled really musty moldy as if the room had not been ventilated in a while. Upon leaving the hotel for the evening at 830 pm I stepped off the front steps into the front parking lot only to step on broken pieces of glass. It was a hazard accident waiting to happen. When we got into our car we called the front desk clerk and told them to clean up the broken glass upon entering the hotel. As we were telling him this a young lady in heels also stepped on the glass as she entered the steps of the hotel. When we returned at 1 am to the hotel the glass was still right where it was when we left. It is clear the hotel did not care about a possible hazard even after being on notice. This is quite upsetting. Was told by front desk staff that the pool was heated. When I went in it was freezing at 11 am The pool was definitely not heated. I am an avid swimmer and swim in heated pools all the time this was not heated. If it is not then just be honest about it. Pool is deep up to 8 ft. Swam only for a few minutes before getting out and using hot tub. Other than that good hotel in a safe neighborhood. Free parking too.", "offset": [136, 177], "date": "2015-03-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "63a09ac9-4e9a-482c-8f1d-39926bd9e995", "sentence": "A lot of small wrongs and one rude check in equals blah.

Outdoor pool furniture modern and comfy w very large shaded area. Checked back at 2 just to see if a room was ready. Heres when I met Nicole. There was a room ready yay but it was on 1st floor right near lobby across from public restrooms. So I just asked if we waited till 3would we have other options. This is where it went south. She essentially said that was our room. even if we waited to 3 no matter that check in for all guests was at 3that by definition she merely needed to have one room to offer and that was it. Her affect was flat bored unfriendly and rude. I checked w my friend and we decided to take the room. When I went back to the desk there were other workers there maybe upper management. but no name tags but Nicole then feigned being nicer w a fake smile. At no point then was I told about any of the amenities like breakfast option or bar hours. Then we get to our room. Nicely decorated w attempt at modern edgy 1. AC was not working. Easy fix w a call to desk. 2. Sleep number bed controls needed new batteries. Easy and quick fix w maintenence replacing them. However one of the beds would not stay adjusted thru the night was hard as a rock. did not realize this until well into the night too late to fix. 3. Great a fridge in room. Too bad it was not very cold. 4. No USB ports in room but nice large desk w some outlets. Also if u are an i phone user had an i clock. Found USB charging ports on large table near bar. 5only one garbage can for entire room and bathroom which was actuality quite spacious including bathrom6toilet seat loose 7rom door did not close completely on its own8. Only one drinking glass in entire room called to get more but could only get cups cuz bar was closed. 9. Lather brand shampoo and conditioner and lotion nice stuff. Our daughters asked for extra and were each given a set. If not for such a bad first impression at front desk I maybe could have overlooked some of the smaller things.

Further there is no mention of the cost until you check out after you have already parked. Had they mentioned the cost at check in i would simply have parked on the street where there was plenty of space. There was also a maintenance issue.

I have stayed at similar hotels in the area and I expected a familiar experience. Functional with a bit of style. My initial impressions were positive. The hotel has a very nice open feel to it.

When I went to the desk they were surprised as I was apparently the first person to complain. Attempts by the staff to fix the problem were enthusiastic but futile. Curiously on the day of my checkout there was a note slipped under my door detailing a scheduled maintenance period where the hotel was going to increase their bandwidth. So the impression I got is that the hotel knows there is a problem but declined to tell me up front. They preferred to jerk me around with trying to \u201c fix \u201d the problems on a 30 minute phone call with operations.
