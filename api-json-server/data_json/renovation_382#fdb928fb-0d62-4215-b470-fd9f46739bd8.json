Your staff at the front desk especially Michael were all very accommodating. The shuttle drivers were very helpful in finding us a nice place to eat and getting us there and back. The shuttle driver for the evening even went out of his way to get us back after 100. I feel badly that I forgot his name but I did want to mention what a great person he wasThe room was very comfortable clean and had a great view. When ordering our morning pot of coffee the room service was quick what a welcome treatUnfortunately not everyone in our party was pleased with the Spa service overall but I know that is not your area. We would certainly come back to stay in your hotel again but not too sure we would do it as a total Spa retreat again. I did fill out the survey for the Spa but I have to tell you the most off putting part of the experiecne was the downstairs area of the Spa. The lockerom Salon pool area and lobby were not clean and tranquil feeling. I was also very surprised by the greeting and start to the Spa experience. I guess I have become accustomed to a true Spa experience from the moment I walk through the doors I was very disappointed by the first impression and greeting at this Spa. The front desk personnel were rude seemed too busy to take the time to welcome me properly and explain what the layout was and what to expect during my time there. Shoes were practically thrown at me and I was rushed down the hall while the person pointed out areas in a quick manner. I spent almost 10 minutes looking around for the lounge to only find out it was upstairs and I had to wait to be brought there. The robe I was given had holes and stains on it and the locker room was very unkept. The salon was disorganized with stained walls and unkept work stations no atmosphere what so ever. The pedi area was cramped with two chairs bright lights and certainly did not a relaxing Spa feeling in anyway. One member of my party was given a service she did not ask for whcih ended up to be an upgraded service. She only found out during check out when she was charged a lot more than she had thought the service cost. Upon questioning the situation she was not treated well and dismissed quickly. She called down later that evening but was basically told. Oh well and offered a 20 discount for her next service. When asking about a situation it is not always about wanting something back in return it is about truly listening to what the customer was feeling and leaving your cutomer feeling thier feedback was heard. Instead my friend was dismissed at first put on hold transferred and put on hold again. Not a very relaxing feeling for her. Luckily once brought upstairs things got a lot better. I was a bit disappointed by the small size of the lounge and sadly surprised it was coed. Angel was the massage therapist I had and she was OUTSTANDING. She was a true savior in the hole experience. We all loved her and her service and technique was superiorI wish I could say I would return again for a Spa Day but I can not say I would. I will look out to hear if the Spa will be renovated and I would possibly come back. I will however be returning to stay at the hotel as it was a very nice relaxing experiecne.

Just returned from trying to enjoy the holiday weekend at the hotel. The property is ok common areas renovated rooms VERY dated but clean. My boyfriend and I elected to spend weekend at property as we have enjoyed the outdoor pool in the past. Well we will not be returning ever again based upon the lack of management at the pool. A could of large families ruined the entire weekend by having their kids urinate in the bushes by the pool leave diapers on the tables one dedicated in the pool even. The pool closed for 5 hours on Memorial DayAl this could have been solved by management maintaining a presence at the pool. In addition when you speak to the Spa manager April she looks at you like you have no heads and does nothing about the family leaving food and diapers all around.

I have stayed at the Hilton Short Hills a few times now and it is a very nice updated Hilton hotel. it is definitely on the pricey side compared to other Hilton properties in the area but it is expected as it is in a posh area of New Jersey and across from a high end mall. As a Diamond member I have been upgraded most times when I stay here and just had a Junior Suite and it was very nice and spacious way more than I needed as I was on my own traveling for work. The staff is extremely friendly and always helpful with anything that is needed. They have an executive lounge which has breakfast happy hour small bites and dessert. As a diamond member I recommend the Dining Room breakfast buffet option over the executive lounge as it has more options. A few more nice things about the hotel is that the self parking is free even though the website shows a charge but the gate is always up and I have never had to pay the last few times I have stayed there. They also have 2 free electric vehicle tesla chargers in the garage. My only negatives about this hotel and the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars I would really like to give it 45 if that was an option is with the location and self parking garage. The hotel is accessible from route 24 124 JFK parkway but it has an odd entrance and depending on what direction you are coming from example 24 east. you end up taking many exits and ramps to go around before you get to the light for the hotel. Also the parking garage is underground and it has quite narrow turns and feels a bit like a dungeon until you get to the hotel parking area. Overall minor negatives that you get used to it once you stay at the hotel but highly recommend the Hilton Short Hills and will definitely stay there again.", "offset": [28, 127], "date": "2019-04-25", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "23aa30ca-ef17-40f9-a062-a0ef34bc39e1", "sentence": "Great hotel.

I stayed for one night for business. The hotel is clean and updated with above average room size. Unfortunately I was awakened at approximately 3 am as someone tried to open my door. I had the safety latch on so the person could not enter. I believe the door was open about 1 inch banging multiple times against the metal latch leading to waking me out of deep sleep. When I looked out the \u201c peep \u201d hole I could not see anyone. I then called the front desk who ending up saying that the person must have been from the room next door. At that same time I heard the door slam next door. I was startled and was awake for more than an hour. In the morning I discussed the issue with Colleen the front desk manager. After she reviewed the lock logs she clearly stated the door was NOT opened although d sexy acknowledged someone must of tried to enter from my description. I respectfully disagreed with her and stated again the loud noise that woke me was definitely the door opening banging against the metal latch numerous times. Although I am a 55 year old man who can manage an intruder this is a MAJOR safety issue for anyone who stays at this hotel. For transparency the hotel offered 10k bonus points which I declined. I requested the charge to be refunded for the night but this was denied.", "offset": [53, 113], "date": "2019-11-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}]}
