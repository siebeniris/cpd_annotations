We stayed at this hotel very close to the airport for one night. We took a top floor south tower room facing away from busy Airport road. It was a good choice as it had an extra sliding door between the bathroom hall area and the sleeping area. For those of us that get wakened by those horrible slamming doors this was a very nice feature to deaden the noise. I do not like the trendy fat little pillows all the hotels seem to have and carry my own pillow with me. Otherwise the bed was comfy and the room a good size and spotless with a large flat screen TV. There is a pool that we went down to see and it is a large pool and very nice. A private garden sitting area outside would be lovely in appropriate weather. There is a restaurant on site that had a very nice menu at typical nice restaurant prices but not excessive. The airport shuttle runs every 20 minutes from 4 am and was on time and very quick to the terminal. With the more expensive room we were allowed to park for 15 days and the total bill came in just under 200 which given the fact the parking alone at a parknfly would be about half of that made this a very good rate. The only complaints I have about the hotel was that the walls do not seem very well insulated as we were wakened by people yelling in their rooms at 230am for a short while. Also the coffee served in the morning downstairs in the foyer did not have the option of milk instead of creamer which meant I had to either drink it black or go without. Not such a small thing when my departure shuttle was at 5 am and I desperately needed a coffee.
