This hotel used to be part of the Japanese Prince Hotel chain hence the Prince name stays. It definitely has an Asian theme to is in many places which is nice but somewhat out of place for the location in NE Toronto. I stay there frequently due to the proximity to offices where I visit. I am not sure why else someone would stay there unles some function is held there or nearby relatives. The rooms are quite large and very clean. I am usually placed in the tower where most rooms have excellent windows overlooking the direction you get. I think there is 1 interior room for every corner room. so lots of windows. Ask for a corner room if you want a better view. Bathroom are reasonably modern although there are some paint starting to peel in the damp areas. There is a shower beside the bathtub although the shower is quite small as I tend to hit my elbows periodically on the walls or glass. Not a big deal unles you are a really big person. The bar area is reasonably nice and bartenders have been quite good I have eaten in the main restaurant beside the bar and I find the dinner food is very fresh and generally very good not cheap though. Breakfast for me has been the buffet which has the standard fare for a Westin lots of fruit some berries usual sausage links bacon etc. They have an omelette station too. Service in the restaurant is not too special they could use improvement there. Generally English is not the primary language and not all are easy to understand. They are also sort of connected to a Japanese restaurant which is a nice change. I have not used the outdoor pool or tennis courts.

If you are in Toronto for leisure you do not want to be here. But really the biggest mark against it from a service level they were totally unprepared to handle our conference needs. Coffee stations inadequately serviced during our scheduled breaks. An inordinately long time for food service at our gala. A dismissive attitude when one of our table mates indicated that they had a severe allergy. A bar with only one bartender scheduled for a two hour break in our program they knew our timing. The bar on our last night there closing at midnight basically losing our on thousands of dollars in business. We also had issues with the billing of our rooms but that was more to do with Westin corporate rather than the the hotel itself.

Traveled to the GTA on business again and decided to give this hotel another try. Was greeted on arrival by friendly associates at the front desk who were attentive. Much to my surprise I provided a complimentary upgrade to a higher floor. The bathroom appeared to be the only area of the room that had been remodeled but the changes were nice. Hans Groh bath fixtures throughout with a rain shower shower head made for a luxurious shower experience. Bath amenities were run of the mill nothing spectacular. The remainder of the room appeared as others I have stayed in at this property wallpaper coming off the wall in places desk and wardrobe are fairly old and worn. Hopefully these will be replaced as a part of their remodel plans. Common areas of the hotel are spectacular and are what can be expected of a Westin property. One disappointment again is the pace of service in the bar on the lobby level. SLOW beyond belief. Sat for 10 minutes not acknowledged even though a server walked by several time. Finally decided to just stand and order pay immediately and take it to my room. Takes forever to get the check. Always seem to be out of Stella Artois and other beers on tap or something is wrong with the tap or some other excuse. Breakfast buffet in the mornings is very good and offers both healthy and alternate options. All delicious. Service in the restaurant is consistent with Westins high standards.
