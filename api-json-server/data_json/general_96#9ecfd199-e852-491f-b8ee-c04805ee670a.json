As a lover of gin a night spent in this place could prove to be painful but the style and ambiance does not inspire heavy drinking. It does however make you want to try a little of everything. Handmade gin cocktails prepared at your table with flair make for an entertaining show while being allowed to choose your tonic type means you can have gin served the way you prefer this is fun in my books they staff really know their job. Nibbles for dinner were delicious with fusion food that complemented the drinks the setting is gentlemens club with great music played at a decent volume so you can still enjoy good conversation something sorely lacking in Dubai.

We really enjoyed our stay at the Four Seasons. We. Visited for a few days at the end of a hectic tour of Sri Lanka some where to relax and catch up with our family and friends who live in DubaiThe Hotel is typical of Dubai very extravagant lots of gold and marble however the Four Seasons has carried this off with amazing flowers beautiful furnishings and lighting blend together the sea views for a real WowOur room was perfect Very comfortable bed huge balcony with fantastic view of the city better than a sea view at the present time. Reviewers have mentioned building work nearby it is a bit unsightly on the beach but by the pool you are totally unaware. I did nt notice any level of noise at all. We visit Dubai a few times a year and building work is totally unavoidable it is everywhere hotels offices The Opera House Malls etc i do nt believe it will ever be finished but it has never spoiled our trips and the end results are what makes DubaiThe location is fantastic probably the closest beach hotel to the city. the famous fountains and the Burj KhalifaThere are two pools one for families the other adult only Fantastic pool in beautiful gardens with very comfy sun beds and amazing and friendly pool Service. All the meals we had were superb Su blu. is like a seaside bistro very relaxed great setting. Breakfast. huge choice of everything you could wish for personally i loved the Bircher museli the freshly baked bread and the juices and smothiesThe bar on the sixth floor had great views but i felt was more for a young crowd as very loud musicI would definately stay again in fact I enjoyed my stay so much that I would not.

Then came back then i want to go to some shopping so the hotel offered a car to get us to dubai mall. BUT did not offer a ride back. And the guy we spoke to he was really RUDE he said that its our fault that the car got ruined and we should pay for a taxi to get back to the hotel. I need an explanation why should i pay for something that I did not do. I was not responsible for that. The valet guy for got the lights so it is the hotel problem and it should be fixed from your side.

Overall rating of average is probably based on me as an individual not taking to the interior decorations of the Four Season properties in general worldwide. Emailed this property prior to arrival with various questions including a collection from the airport. Granted i sent the email on the same day of arrival however i believe 8Hours notice is sufficient to gain a response in which i did but the response came 2Hours after i checked in. Maybe an improvement from global to ensure email communications are answered and forwarded to the hotel for a response in a timely manner. Maybe provide direct emails as opposed to a global email. Expect a faster response from such a well named property. Arrival was well greeted however the check in process was a little lengthy with way too many questions. Guests generally wish to arrive and check in to freshen up and not spend 20Minutes at a desk. Very welcoming and friendly however a faster process. Deluxe rooms suggest that when booking a skyline room you are very specific as not all the rooms are skyline or as a suggested option go for the beach view or higher grade in the suites. A skyline room could be a ground floor room that looks at a road or it could be a higher level floor that looks over the city which is a preferred option. There is little difference between the costs. I tried to change room on arrival based on a booking of a deluxe room made by the company and the difficulties to do such were evident and the response time frames to do such were lengthy. The option provided was to move to a suite as there were supposedly no rooms available with a sea view. The suite was nice but for those who spend a limited time in the property a pointless option. Sea view rooms as an opinion are better however the location of Four Seasons is still in a zone of development so views are not spectacular at this moment in time. Deluxe room provided prior to change questionable on some the cleaning ie work table marked balcony dusty some minor points but again not something to be expected from this property. The hotel is actually nice and the people who work in the hotel are extremely pleasant friendly and willing to assist the guests as every opportunity one of the best properties visited on a level of professionalism of staff. All willing to assist. Breakfast is very well presented and the options available are vast and tasty. Again a plus as some hotels offer poor basic breakfasts whereas the Four Seasons is excellent in every way. Cafes well located very good service and a decent menu on offer for coffees teas deserts small finger food etc. Spa and Fitness fantastic very good selection of equipment in the gym and a very good menu for spa services. Salon Males standard hotel salon as expected a little overpriced as an opinion but something to be expected. Service was good and the barber pretty clued up on various styles. Pool and beach area. Like a little more green around but this is a new property and plants take time to grow especially in heats of 40 plus degrees. Adults pool for relaxation and a kids pool separate for family and children. Overall very nice. Beach is questionable as there are various work scopes taking place around the hotel in the water making the beach look a little dull but over time i am sure it will improve. Overall good but as per my starting point just not my selection of properties Would visit again though.", "offset": [2753, 2861], "date": "2016-08-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "77a5344b-c05d-413c-97f3-41556fdbe5f5", "sentence": "Excellent.

The flooring around the pool was extremely dangerous when wet the staff said that plans were in motion but a short term solution should have been made. Accident waiting to happen especially at the childrens pool.

Dubai is known worldwide as a place of opulence luxury and hospitality. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than at the Four Seasons Jumeirah. From the moment I made an enquiry about staying till the time the transfer door closed and we drove off we received what can only be described as world class hospitality and treatment. I have to make a very special mention of Valerie Hipolito. It is her total commitment and dedication to ensuring absolute customer satisfaction that really made our holiday and anniversary so magical. From the moment I enquired about a reservation she made me feel really special. She was kind and helpful and made our booking for us. Throughout the process leading up to our stay she stayed in touch and got the Concierge department to help us plan the various activities we went on whilst there. We had to change our stay dates due to a personal reason and Helen was amazing in doing this for us and even re arranged our desert safari for us to lighten the load. When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the team who opened both of our doors at the back for us this opening and closing car doors happened every time we arrived or left the hotel. our luggage was delivered to our room and we were checked in and given a tour of the hotel. Our Suite was absolutely amazing we had a large sitting area with dinning table 2 bathrooms and a very large bedroom and master bathroom. This was topped off with a lovely balcony overlooking the beach and sea. The room was immaculately presented with every modern luxury available. What you did not have and needed was never a problem. I injured my foot at the water park and a member of staff brought me a water bottle for my foot. Breakfast is the best we have ever had anywhere in the world. The amount of choice was phenomenal and this was matched by the excellent quality and taste. We enjoyed freshly made smoothies to order with omelettes and french toast along with the many other items on offer. I ca nt say no to food and as such have come back many kilos heavier but was well worth the indulgence. The indoor and outdoor pools are exquisite and well maintained and clean with so many staff at hand should you need anything. We used the indoor Jacuzi and mood showers as well as the steam bath every day. The outdoor pools and Jacuzi were also lovely to enjoy as was the private beach. There is so much more I could say and this would very quickly turn into an essay but in summary I would say that this establishment has the correct formula. They have every detail down to perfection. It is not the grandeur elegance or even the quality of every aspect that make this hotel magical. rather it is their staff and the team. The attention to the little things are what made our trip one we will remember forever. Hotels can spend millions on luxuries but no amount of money can buy the correct attitude or the genuine desire to make each guest feel like royalty. The great attention to the little things is what this place has in abundance the constant smiles and desire to help make this place for me one of the best in the world. Just take a look at my photos attached to see.
