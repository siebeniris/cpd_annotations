Just to get away from the house and the heat we checked into this Hilton for one night. Our house does have excellent air conditioning but when it is this hot 107 110 we begin to really feel coped up inside. Most of our friends and relatives stay here when in town as this is only about 4 miles from our home and they all love it. Up to now we had only been in the Lobby area. I found a good price 75 and we packed our toothbrushes and off we went. Front desk was not all that friendly. In fact when she asked for my ID and I pulled out my wallet she had to have seen my AAA card which is next to my drivers license and yet said nothing about our getting a discount as AAA members. When we were in Kansas City and went to the World War I Memorial Museum I took out my wallet to pay he spied my AAA card and immediately told us that we could come in at half price. To me this front desk behavior is not honest. I see now that we could have saved 15 as AAA members. Since we always stay at Mariots and they have everything about us on file I never need to bring up our AAA membership and often forget about it elsewhere. Our room was clean and it was nice. We are not used to such low ceilings anymore anywhere and my husband who is tall looked out our window and banged his head against the wood panel over the top of the drapes. But no harm done. The shower was wonderful and the WiFi worked very well. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. No issues there. All the other people we met who work there were friendly and polite. NOW. the air conditioning system in our room 310 was VERY noisy. We are not bothered by that as it turns into a humming background noise and does not disturb our sleep. However we did want to watch TV and had to put the volume way up so that we could hear it over the air conditioning engine. At 10 pm we became concerned that we might be disturbing others and I went out into the hall to see if I could tell if the adjoining rooms were occupied. What a relief. There was a service elevator next door on one side and on the other the room was far away. If we had lowered the volume we would not have been able to hear the program. The hotel is spacious and airy and well air conditioned. As someone mentioned the windows are dirty but what a task to wash them especially in this heat.

No joy it stayed noisy for another 1 12 hours. I realise that the staff can only do so much with a person it just made me think about the adjoining room thing and why had they put me in it the hotel was not full. So my lesson is your reward do not let them book you into an adjoining room. I did move for the next and final night there and it was much better. Overall the stay was nice the breakfast buffet was a bit high priced for me so it is a matter for individual choice on that. There are some good views in certain spots too. Overall it is just those little quirky things that got me. Enjoy your stay.", "offset": [989, 1154], "date": "2019-11-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
