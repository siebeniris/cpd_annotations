We had a very special 24 hour turn around trip gifted for me and a girlfriend to go to a show at the mountain winery and relax. My 1st trip since having a baby and her bachelorette. Instead of staying at a cheap spot by the airport I booked here to stay in the peace over a babbling brooke like the description promised. Our stay cost 318 for 1 night. When we arrived our Uber could nt even find the place it was so covered in construction material. There s no lobby they made a sort of everything room on the 4th floor. We never saw any of the hotel except a n elevator that looked like a service elevator covered in blankets and trash torn up floors a hallway with computer printed signs pointing you to the everything room to check in. The hotel was now booking for half that price but said they could nt honor it due to the 3rd party booking. We asked to cancel and they said it is too late the penalty would be the 1 days cost anyway. We had no car did nt know the area and did nt know if we would get that money back and felt a bit trapped since it was a 1 day trip now half over. We tried to make the best of it but in the morning they started drilling and pounding on our walls at 8 am. The hotel was hot and mucky and it was about 100 degrees outsidethe lights were flickering in our room. the conditioner empty in the shower it just was nt the boutique experience we spent 3 months getting ready for. That all being said in the future I am sure this place will be great. I just felt a bit side lined. The hotel said they had no record of us from the 3rd party which is why they did nt notify us of the construction but they somehow know to charge our card for the 318 before we even checked in. They said it is to preauthorize because they never know what kind of characters are coming through there which is fine but that also to me shows they knew who we were and that we had a reservation as well as they were in control of charging usi do feel bad for the staff being put in this position as I now look at these reviews and see they probably get a hard time from most people during this renovation. And its rightly so since this is nt the place I thought it would be. Once finished they will no doubt have a beautiful hidden gem but I do nt think they should be booking rooms this deep in construction and definitely not at boutique prices. And should maybe have a better plan in action to help out people caught off guard. I do nt write this to discourage you from staying in the future but please check with there current construction status prior to making your reservation so you know exactly what to expectweve asked that the 3rd party booking site make the situation known to guests and they have been kind about trying to make this right after viewing our photos and story.
