We stayed Club Executive where we were looked after very well byMr. Ali Mirza. The Executive rooms had been recently refurbished and were very comfortable.

We managed to get a great deal with British Airways to spend a week at JBH on a Half Board basis. My wife and I started our honeymoon here 10yrs ago and I had wanted to come back for our Anniversary which we just could not do logisticaly. So when the offer came up for the end of the school holidays we jumped on it. The biggest thing for us is being able to relax and feel comfortable which can only be done if our youngest son can eat without fear of going anaphylactic due to his allergies. We need not have worried at all I had done some pre work by calling the hotel directly and also having an email conversation with guest relations Poja Francis in the run up to the trip. Upon arrival one of the first things was the hotel arranging a meeting with an exceutive chef at our convenience that day. Chef Bon arrived for our meeting armed with the email chain and proceeded to ask a number of questions about our sons likes dislikes when it came to food and re confirmed those foods that cause a reaction. The first thing he did was advise us that the meals would be prepared in the room service kitchen so as to avoid contamination and then proceeded to explain that if we could advise the time and location we would like breakfast dinner in he would ensure that our sons meal would be delivered to the relevant restuarant so that he could eat at the same time as us. This even included room service breakfast at 6 am on our day of departureWe had breakfast each morning in the Executive Lounge and it was fantastic each morning we were welcomed by An who knew us by name and what we wanted to drink without having to ask. The chef in the lounge Khutan was phenomenal our eldest liked waffles and as soon as the chef saw us she would put waffles in for him and make me an omelette. Similarly at Afternoon Tea Happy Hour as soon we walked in Albert took care of us ensuring the meal for our youngest arrived warm and timely so that we could all eat together. For parents who have children with allergies I can not recommend this hotel and it is staff enough. Every evening meal we had at whichever restuarant Latitude Karnevale La Verandah DA the Head Waiter Manager came over and explained they were aware of the allergies but wanted to re confirm just to make sure. In addition to the aove the rest of our trip mirrors the majority of the comments already listed for this wonderful hotel but in shortLocation Fantastic 30 40mins from DXB airport next door to Burj Al Arab hotel all rooms have sea view and on a good day from our room 1801 you could easily see the Palm further down the beachBeach. Gloriously clean beaches although the sand was hot and the sea was extremely clean and warmPols Choices choices to be honest we never went in the Leisure or Family pools although looked great. We used the Exec pool mainly which is further down the beach towards the Burj Al Arab. all pools had plenty of lifeguards and there was always a waiter nearby if you wanted anything at all of the polsWater Park. One of the biggest selling points for us complimentary access to the waterpark including an hour before it opened to the public. Plenty to do for all ages and many hours spent in here our 6 yr old made the most of the wave pool lazy river and kids area whilst the the older one wanted to ride the big slidesFacilities. There is so much on offer here but ultimately we wanted to relax s o spent a lot of time in the pool waterpark aside from a few trips. Getting Around. Within the resort and nearby Jumeirah hotels there is a buggy service with designated pick up points. If they can not pick you up they will radio for another buggy to come by and get you. This was perfect as it saved the walk in the sun even more so if you wanted to goto Jumeriah Madinat. awesome beachTrips. We went out twice from the resort firstly we took a taxi to the Burj Khalifa and went upto the 124th floor I could not afford the additional 50GBP to go up to the 184th floor. we also went to the aquarium while we were there. Secondly and this is a must do in our opinion was the sundowner safari.

My room of choice was an ocean club executive king room for myself and my 2 year old son which included half board dining and transport to and from the airport in high end vehicles. The half board involves the perk of \u2018 Jumeirah Flavours \u2019 that allows you to use your half board at 50 participating restaurants at Dubai Jumeirah hotels. At the airport while waiting for my driver I was taken to the Jumeirah lounge and offered tea coffee and biscuits. When the driver arrived our luggage and everything was handled for us and upon entering the car I was given a cool towel and bottle of water very nice touch. When we arrived at the hotel we were taken straight to the club lounge reception where our check in was handled for us while we waited and drank cappuccino and juice. They also have an executive lounge on the 24th floor but that is for 16yr olds and above not an issue for me. When I got to my room I was not disappointed it was on the 13th floor with uninterrupted views of the Burj al Arab and the ocean. The only thing that had not been done that I had requested was for the alcohol to be cleared from the fridge but a quick call to reception and this was sorted out pronto. My chosen room gave me a choice of breakfast in 3 locations which included the international buffet at Latitude Beachcombers Restaurant and of course the club lounge offerings. I liked latitude so much that I had my breakfast there for my entire duration. The food is excellent and there are choices form all over the world. I also enjoyed afternoon tea lovely sandwiches and cakes and hot and cold canap\u00e9s served pre dinner in the club lounge. I will mention though that it may be difficult to fully enjoy both the afternoon tea and evening canap\u00e9s in one day due to the close timings. All the hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly the housekeeping staff gave my son a gift every day that we were there from a beachball to a Frisbee to countless chocolate and leaving fruit in the room which he gladly receivedMy son enjoyed it very much the pool the beach and the attention from the staff. The room rate is pretty steep but you also get a lot for it and the service is absolutely what you would expect from such a hotel. I can honestly say that my stay at the JBH is one of the most enjoyable hotel experiences I have ever had. Now I do n\u2019t stay at the same place twice purely because my curiosity always makes me seek something new but the next time I go to Dubai I will have my wife and daughter with me as well and will most likely stay at JBH again. that for me is the biggest compliment I can pay them and it \u2019s well deserved.

This was our 5th stay here and I must say though I am a little disappointed. We normally travel there as a family of 4 but this year took our mums and my wifes sisters family of 4 10 of us in total the other 6 had never visited Dubai before so I guess we had biged it up and although they seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed it us 4 noticed a change for the worse. We always book the club rooms which are on the higher floors of the hotel and include the afternoon tea which is still great plus the executive pool and beach areas which again are still very good you also get the happy hour drinks and nibbles from 6 pm till 8 pm in the 24th floor lounge and this is still very well staffed even though we only ever seem to arrive there with half hour to go they still make the effort to ensure you get the most from the experience. We then all go down to dinner mostly in Latitude which is still very good and has professional and friendly staff and an amazing selection of food. We also ate on Christmas Eve in La Parila which was as amazing as always. Moving on to the disappointment the arrivals hall at the airport was very busy and we took 90 minutes to clear customs. With the club rooms you get private transfers from and to the airport normally in Lincoln Navigators and we have never experienced any trouble before however the cars were not there and the Jumeirah reception desk staff tried blaming my travel company for not even booking the cars a cheap shot I thought as we always use the same travel company and there has never been a problem before. So after a further 30 minutes wait we arrived at the hotel at around 11 pm after landing at 830 which meant we had missed our dinner as we had the half board package not the hotels fault granted but on arrival in the ground floor club lounge I asked if we could have some snacks to tide us over whilst we were all checking in. I was informed by the really unhelpful club team representative that this would have to be billed as room service. I had to go along with this as I had 9 hungry companions and I did not want to make a scene but when he told me that they had to put my 77 year old mum up on a camp bed for the 1st night as they did not realise I had requested the twin beds for the 2 mums booked and stipulated 7 months prior. I was very angry and of course embarrassed. We had booked five separate rooms all to be on the same floor not a big ask but the guy said to me that the rooms were only allocated once the guests actually arrived. what a load of codswallop. I have never met anyone at JBH as unprofessional as him in all the years we have been staying there very sad. The check out process on the 24th floor was carried out far more professionally and we had no qualms until it came to the collecting of our luggage the porters were half an hour late which meant we were all concerned whether we would make our flight which we did thankfully. but it was unnecessary stress that spoiled our final hour or so at the hotel.

My daughter received a trip to Dubai for her 21st birthday and I really wanted to make it special. I googled for endless weeks and investigated dozens of hotels but my final decision fell on Jumeirah beach hotel for various reasons. One of many reasons was that the hotel together with four other hotels are situated on the same grounds. Except for Burj al Arab we could use all the other hotels swimming pools and the beach area for all these hotels together is vast. The Wild wadi water adventure park is part of the package. The up town sky bar has a mesmerising view of Downtown Burj Khalifa and a big part of Dubai. The hotel is well located between Dubai Marina and downtown. There is a free shuttle to Mall of Emirates on different allocated times and the mall is linked directly with the metro. Between all the hotels and the Madinat souk there are loads of restaurants to choose from. Rather expensive with the South African exchange rate. All the rooms have splendid sweeping views of the Burj Al Arab and the harbour and the Wi Fi worked well. The abra service that gives a ride on the canals through all the hotels is also free of charge for guests. There was a lady called Aicha. How can I ever thank her for the suburb service. From the moment we stepped on that abra she went out of her way to make us feel at home and even stopped at various places positioning the abra in such a way that the sun was perfect for us to take out of this world pictures. She was informative about the trip and told us so many interesting facts. Please acknowledge this lady. She is an asset to any hotel group. The hotels offer a buggy service between the hotels as a walk can sometimes get quite far. The hotel is run with military precision and I have never in my life encountered such immaculate hotel grounds pools beach area gardens cleanness of hotels on inside and rooms. Add the friendliest and well trained staff ever and this is a winning combination. From the manager \u2019s right down to floor level we were stunned with the service. Housekeeping and room service must get a 2010. Food from room service was outstanding and delicious. Although this is a large hotel it never took more than 10 minutes for the ice bucket to arrive after ordering one. Rajesh cleaned our room everyday and a more kind sincere helpful friendly person I have never met. From morning to night he had only one big emotion and that was his mesmerizing smile. As soon as we stepped out of our room in the mornings Rajesh was there to clean up. Rooms are large and spacious. If I may point out a tiny drawback. The duvets and linen was not the plush luxurious linen we used to getting in a 5 star hotel. Never in my life had I seen such thin duvets. One night the fitted sheet even had a rather large hole in it. So let \u2019s hope with the new renovations this can be rectified. Another tiny drawback was the gym. Although state of the art classy upmarket etc etc. Most of the equipment was rather new to us. As fitness junkies we exercise every day. Not once were there personal trainers in the 8 days at Jumeirah beach hotel available or allocated to guests needs. They were all busy with private clients. During our stay we did encounter a slight problem regarding renovations that could have ruined the holiday totally. Just the opposite happened when my complaint was referred to Mr Ali. I can completely understand why this gentleman is in a managerial position. He offered us another room immediately and although it was time consuming it eased the pain of the renovations that happened right above us. He also went the extra mile with other little things to ease the pain of the uncomfortable situation regarding the renovation hick up. Well done Ali. You were a real gentleman through the whole process. The guys at the entrance of hotel. No words. Super helpful. We arrived the first evening after 10ho pm and our luggage 4 suitcases was out of the taxi in no time and straight to our room. Check in and check out was a very swift professional process. Last but not least. Chere at concierge. This lady is going to move up the ranks faster than lightning. As I previously said. We have stayed in many hotels over the years as this IS BY FAR the best concierge we encountered. Their English is perfect their knowledge on point and Chere you earn 5 star accolades for how you treat quests. We still in awe with you. Will never forget the service we got from you.

My husband and I had a friend from out of town and we went to the Pan Asian buffet at Beach Combers restaurant. It was fantastic. The food was fresh and very tasty. Especially the sushi. The staff are very friendly especially chef David. Hats off to the chef and all the staff. The ambiance of the restaurant is very chill and right on the beach with great views of Burj Al Arab.", "offset": [213, 263], "date": "2019-04-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "b60a0436-cfb5-4b0a-91bf-ea0c9c600a8d", "sentence": "Excellent Customer Service. OK off to a bad start. The room we were allocated had some construction maintenance works taking place in a nearby room. The drilling started at 9 am which is not so bad except we got to bed at 2 am after a late flight from Europe. Also as we had an oceanfront room there was noise from the Lagoon construction outside but not that intrusive as glass doors are double glazed. Day Two the drilling stated again at 9 am. I did complain and was immediately offered another room but as that was our last night it seemed pointless to pack and move only to repack and move out the next morning. I suppose it would have been better to have been told in advance that some works taking place may affect us but that did not happen. However in fairness the staff were unfailing in their efforts to assist us. Assistant Manager Corina Matcovscaia went out of her way to make our last night more comfortable and I thank her for her care and attention. I highly recommend this Hotel and have to say the bed was a dream. so much now that I am home I want a new bed.", "offset": [0, 27], "date": "2019-08-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "54415367-cc3f-4dd7-84ea-7724d59b29a2", "sentence": "Great Hotel Bad service.

As a family we have been using the JBH hotel since 202 now 17 years. Ok my first booking cost \u00a3 34 per night. now it \u2019s a little more expensive. My point is the quality of the physical building and facilities are still excellent. More importantly the quality of service from each and every member of staff you interact with was world pioneering and even now only a very few competitors can match this very high standard. St Regis close. Couple of tips over the years. always book premium leisure it costs but it \u2019s worth every penny. Second travel either as a group or more than one family. Book a two bedroom suite comes with premium leisure. or if you can stretch to it. book a villa up to three bedrooms plus sofa bed so makes it achievable. You will be blown away by the total package.
