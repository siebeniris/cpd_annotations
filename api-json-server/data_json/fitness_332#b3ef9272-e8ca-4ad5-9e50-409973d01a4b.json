We have been going the Tradewinds for years and this has always been a wonderful getaway yet for some reason I get too busy to share a review \u2026 shame on me. We do our \u201c mom and dad \u201d getaways but this is always one that the kids love and we could n\u2019t do it without them. They stay busy the entire time and allow us to sip on some cocktails on the beach while they take part in all of the activities for the kids. The restaurants are phenomenal. Palm Court Italian Grill is always excellent the Flying Bridge near the pool and the beach is always hopping. If you want a table here around lunch time you \u2019l need to troll the tables to see who is wrapping up and paying their bill and wait or sit at the bar if there are only a few of you. If you only want a drink by the pool head to Saltys Polside Beach Bar and it \u2019l be much quicker near the adult only polMy son and I had breakfast at Bermudas which has a very good breakfast buffet. Beef O Bradys on site can quench your sports fix and we have seen and got autographs from local professional sports figures there in the past. This was our first time trying the Guy Harvey RumFish Grill \u2026 all I can say is WOW. The gigantic fish tank is amazing but the food was some of the best seafood that I have ever had and I am from Florida. Our entire table echoed that sentiment. There are bars everywhere. Regardless of your age you should try the Tradewinds Bar Crawl. It will have you checking out all of their locations. You get a passport and they stamp it at each location. It \u2019l net you a t shirt in the end but either way you really have to find these places and experience them like Redbeards Shark Tooth Tavern that is tucked away in the resort with some live music playing in the evenings like a small fishing town tavern. Another great stop is The Sand Bar down at Guy Harvey Outpost especially in the evenings they have fire pits for everyone from every age group to enjoy. I think they even do s\u2019mores down there for the kids. The biggest thing that I notice every time that I go is the familiar faces of the staff. Everything in that industry has churn but there are the staples that have been there for 17 years or so like the current manager of Flying Bridge. I finally stopped her to ask how long she \u2019s been working there and. 17 years in the food beverage industry is a tough tough job. Customers can behave as if they are staying at the Taj Mahal or they \u2019ve just had too much to drink and become belligerent. This staff does it all with a smile a friendly \u201c good morning \u201d and that is one of the biggest things that can make a huge difference in a \u201c average stay \u201d and an excellent stay \u201d. It also says allot for the Tradewinds and the way they treat their staff. The little things mean much more than other stays will ever understand. It rained one night and there were baskets of free umbrellas for the guests to use. Very easy to do for the Tradewinds but something that goes a long long way with the guests. We just got back from a Memorial Day weekend there with the kids. Very nice fireworks display right on the beach. A huge cookout I mean HUGE and a carnival on the beach. The views are great even of the courtyard but I highly recommend the beach front rooms for those amazing sunsets that rival anywhere else in the world our TripAdvisor logo is from one of our stays.

The lady who checked us in was very friendly and helpful. After you check in you go to a separate desk to get the wristbands you wear throughout your stay. At that desk they try to sign you up to attend their information session for time share type of thing. Once we got past that we went up to our room. We got lucky and had a corner room. Because of that our front door was private and no one walked past it. Made it nice and quiet. The room itself was nice nothing extravagant. there is a nice size fridge empty. so you can stock it with your own goodies microwave and sink area as well as plates cups cofemaker. The bathroom was fine no complaints there. There were plenty of towels. We had a king sized bed. It was decent not the most comfortable bed ever but we slept fine. We made sure to book a cabana as soon as we arrived for the following day. We spent Saturday lounging in our covered cabana. It was a beautiful day and since the cabana was covered we did not get burned. We also tried out the big slide on the beach which is included in the resort fee. On Saturday evening we tried to go over to the sister property Guy Harveys for smores. We were told the smores campfire was cancelled due to weather but it was absolutely perfect outside. Oh well we did end up going on Sunday night and had a nice time. On Sunday morning my husband and I tried to get an early morning workout in it was around 70am which I think is a normal time to be at the gym. Unfortunately the fitness center does not open before 8 am any day of the week. I did enjoy a nice run on the beach though so that was ok. We spent Sunday at the pool. We were at the main pool which can get loud with all the little ones. There is also an adults only pool if you want some peace and quiet. While we were there we were able to walk to various restaurants along the street. The hotel has a great location close to so many places including a number of ice cream places. We did not have any meals at the hotel. I did buy coffee at the little coffee bar in the lobby. I had a special request iced coffee with a shot of rumchata and the barista bar tender made it happen. We left on Monday morning so we spent a total of 3 nights there. We had a lovely time. Check out went quickly and smoothly. I would recommend Tradewinds. We ended up booking this for a great price so we felt like we got a good value. All of the staff were friendly and accommodating.

I am realistic enough to know that our terrible weather had a lot to do with our overall experience however I doubt we had return. To say it rained for the 3 days we were there is an understatement and I understand that Tradewinds has no control over that. With that being said. they need more activities for rainy days. Kids club is weak and the size of the kids club is super small. They do not have enough activities throughout the day. Our tie dye activity consisted of picking out a white shirt and handing it to a counselor to dye for you. For 25 a shirt that is not my idea of kids tie dyeing a t shirt. Their game room I was told is run by an off site company and Tradewinds can not help when it steals your money which all the games did. So that was disappointing. With as many banquet rooms they have they should set up game rooms or other activities for when the slides obstacle course and pools close due to weather not to mention they use satellite TV. so when it is raining the TV does not work either. Our room which was a suite was small even by regular hotel standards. For 400 a night I would have expected more space. They are understaffed for a resort. Check in was not until 4 PM. They do not have the staff to clean all the rooms in a timely fashion. They did not come to clean the room until almost 5pm. by that time you are usually heading back to your room from a day at a beach and trying to get kids clean and ready for dinner. The gentleman that checked us into the hotel was woefully un informed and disorganized.

We have been staying at Tradewinds Island Grand annually for the past four years. Obviously it must have had some pros if we kept returning.

There are plenty of restaurants bars a few shops so that you do not need to leave the resort. We had a disappointing stay last year that was mainly due to the weather. We decided to give it a go again this year but a few things happened that will prevent us from ever returning that have nothing to do with the weatherPROS. Kids activities mini golf paddle boats the huge inflatable slide are all included in the additional resort fee. Other FEE based activities include floating water park see the mega con on this below floating cabanas kids club activities paddle board and moreRestaurants and bars are all over with easy access. Drinks are delish but pricey. Huge Pro for my family has been the gluten free menu. Furthermore my son has multiple allergies we have worked personally with one of the head chefs ahead of time for the past two years. He was extremely helpful in making his staff aware of our situation accommodating our special needs above and beyond any place we have stayed and following through. Thank youBeach it is a beautiful beach no doubt. We enjoy the covered cabanas. Payment with your room key is accepted for pretty much everything which is very convenient. Cons I will start with the big ones. Rooms. I have not had a clean feeling in our room the past two visits. We always stay in the Breckinridge Bldg in a Gulf Front Parlor Room with a balcony. They are small rooms though and cramped with outdated decor but they have a nice sized balcony. Back to cleanliness. musky smell. although that is somewhat acceptable on the beach thick dust and crud in corners and on lamps and fake plants. The first night there our son had an accident in the bed which is extremely rare he is 7. Nevertheless it was not pleasant and everything was soaked. We took all the sheets and blankets off the bed and put them in a pile on the floor with a few dirty towels that we wanted switched out cleaned. There is a sign that asks you to preserve water and to only put the towels you want replaced on the floor. So we put the sheets and blankets with it. We made the other bed because it was fine. We also put a few dollars on top because we felt bad having them replace the sheets. By 4 pm no one had come by to clean our room so we asked an employee about it. We explained we needed service and why. We came back a few hours later to what appeared to be a clean room. You know where I am going with this. Because everything appeared freshened up and cleaned I figured it was clean. The next day when I was making the beds I realized that our sheets had never been changed. There was a huge stain the same one. right there. This meant that those wet sheets blankets and towels were all piled up together nearly all day bleck to go right back on the bed. If that were not enough within an hour of realizing that we found a giant roach in our room. I am from Florida so I know it happens but. Needless to say I was ready to pack up and leave immediately. If it were not for the charge of the room I probably would have left. Floating water park while this seems like a fantastic and fun activity it is rarely available and costly. Last year it was never set up our entire stay due to weather. And by weather I mean waves not just rain. This time it was set up one day of three nice days. The first day it had rained earlier so I guess they called it a day. The second day which was gorgeous all day they went to the trouble of setting it all up but then took it down before letting anyone on it. Apparently one wave made one of the items tip. let us just say that was probably the only wave of the entire gorgeous day. Finally they set it up the next day only to stop selling tickets after the 1 2 pm slot because now it was on a sandbar. So finally it is set up with beautiful weather no waves but it happens to be on a sandbar. Meanwhile PARENTS do not let your children on this thing without your supervision. The two lifeguards out there there were two because there were 30 kids on it although we were told 16 18 at a time but the lifeguards were DEEP into their own conversations about the other lifeguards. In fact a random man not wearing a life vest indicating he had not paid his 16 hr was climbing the slides. Finally it was brought to the lifeguards attention. One of them saidsory we were distracted. Ya thinkPols gross. I would not put one toe in them. that is just me though. I have a pool at home so a small extremely crowded pool with lots of kids just is not my thing. Price for the age and upkeep of the hotel I think it is overpriced. We paid aprox 350 night inc resort fee. If everything all activities were included perhaps that would be a better price. It had been worth it because finally we could stay somewhere that the hotel could prepare my sons food.

We choose the same building to stay in as last time. We were in suite room 241 in the Hibiscus Building. It is the only way to go. We went to the grocery store and stocked up the refrigerator so we did not have to eat out every meal. We had easy access to the pools and all the activities because there was only a flight of stairs involved not an elevator. I thoroughly enjoyed my morning coffee on the balcony overlooking the pool and the Gulf. The kids loved all the activities. We swam every day in the Gulf and all the pools with water temperatures in the 80s. We all went down the slide a hundred times. We pre bought the kids adventure pass wrist bands so they did not have to carry money with them to spend at the KONK center Bucky the shark rides or bungee trampoline rides. They loved the 1 pm kids polside invasion the dive in movies at night and nightly Smores. This time around it was very quiet at bedtime and in the mornings.

The family pools are crazy crowded so we did not use those. The hot tubs are by the family pools so they can get crowded too. Luckily the beach is great and big enough for everyone.

I really wanted to rate this hotel higher because of the lovely proximity to a wonderful clean beach and the excellent cheerful staff. However the accommodations are just too dated for a higher review. Pros include the location and the many amenities on site several pools activities spa different restaurants and of course the beach. Common areas are nice and the conference meeting facilities are actually quite excellent. This hotel delivers very well there. However the rooms leave a lot to be desired. They are very dated they look like a trip back to the 1970s. the furnishings need updating and not just for the style my room included damaged lampshades dirty carpeting scratched furniture and a microwave that had gone yellow with age. Fixtures in the bathroom need replacing and although the room was basically clean there was a lack of attention to details like dirty light switches mold in the tub and in back of the toilet and stains in the bar sink in the room. Although the beds are comfortable the pillows are awful like dollar store foam pillows one buys to go camping. Perhaps the most disconcerting part of the accommodations is the layout the resort is set up like a motel on steroid most rooms on the 7 floors face narrow outdoor catwalks so people walk in front of rooms all the time. In essence those rooms offer no privacy and if one pulls the curtains it is like being in a tomb. There are more expensive rooms with garden views but the ones facing the pools and bars are very noisy there is loud music or activities requiring microphones for many hours during the day and evening on that side of the hotel. The water views are very nice but all the balconies are essentially fire escape landings they are very narrow. Most cruise ships offer luxuriously large balconies compared to what you will find here and cruise ship balconies are notoriously small. While there might not be much the resort can do to deal with access to the rooms improving the furnishings and getting rid of the carpets would be a major step forward. This would require major revamping however. As build the rooms are not very soundproof one hears people in the bathroom above so only those on the 7th floor might escape bathroom noises everyone hears noise from the hallways and access catwalks. The design of the resort is not really handicap friendly there are a multitude of steps ramps narrow catwalks and considering the size of the resort there are few elevators.

We had a little hiccup between my booking on bokingscom and the hotel s reservation system so my 1st night in the TradeWinds was actually down the road at the Don CeSar Hotel. Have to hand it to the staff on the front desk for how well they handled the hiccup. Stuff happens between booking companies and I tend to look at these things as part of the adventure.

I appreciated the overnight at DonCesar thank you to the night manager on the 4th July did nt catch his name for getting me a bed somewhere close. but within seconds of getting to TW I knew this was my favorite location. I got an amazing beach facing room with a Queen bed kitchenette bathroom TV and dining area. I loved it. i do nt honestly understand the complaints I had read on here about the place being old or dusty musty. I had no experience of that despite the place was fully booked it felt fresh and clean to me everywhere I went. There were tons of towels and toiletries in the bathroom and free bottles of water in your room beside your kettle note. I used tap water to make tea coffee so save your bottled water for the beach by having in the fridge overnight. The cabana system is the best.

Beach is stunning clean soft sand lots of little shells to collect. I loved it. Tons of activities i did nt have family with me this time. but know my niece will love it as there are tons of activities to do for kids and adults alike. In front of me on the beach I saw kayaks SUPs floating cabanas paddle boards balloon rides water taxis activity center floating equipment etc etc. On the grounds there are tons of activities including fun by the pool dance and singing competitions for kids arts and crafts hair stuff games different pools for different ages tennis courts adult pool music live some fantastic singers and nice and mellow and relaxing stores to buy sun cream souvenirs and UPF tops. The deli does all day deli meals and breakfasts and there is an amazing Starbucks coffee shop right outside the deli in the middle of the lobby. Lots of restaurants to eat in that are either casual laid back or formal dining to suit all ages and families. Buffet deals on at the weekend too. you never have to leave the place. The furthest I got was across the street to BeachZone which has everything you need as a tourist and for kids on the beach note there are tons of free beach toys for kids so do nt go mad buying beach stuff that is freely there to use for small kids beside the huts on the beachTaxis can be got outside the hotel or ordered by the hotel to take you up and down St Pete s Beach I l do that the next time. I was having too much fun relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere to leave over a long weekend this time around. I also caught the amazing fireworks on the beach on Saturday night after the 4th July. Made up for having to travel on the 4th and missing them due to flight schedules. Was so well done best I ve seen in years outside of my hometown of Washington DCThe people make the place. Shout outs here to Laurie Richard Kaitlyn and Gus on the Front Desk. My trip did nt start out as expected but I rolled with it and was so happy to be there. Add to that I got back to my room on the Friday night and there was a bottle of sparking wine on ice and a tray of chocolate covered strawberries compliments of the Front Desk Team who appreciated that I took the overboking so well. That was so sweet and oh so tasty. Thank you team TW you rock. Tom was also so friendly and helpful took care of getting me to from Don CeSar and also getting my SuperShutle back to the airport and minding my bags on my last morning on the beach. Also worth comment are the TV and wifi systems i had some work to do while I was there and had no problem connecting to our systems at work via the wifi in the room and even in my cabana on the beach. Fantastic. TV channels are set to give you a walkthrough of the entire complex facilities dining and activities and then into the ordinary channels. When you need a breach from the beach the beds are so comfy to stretch out on and watch tv for a while. Rooms were quiet. i had neighbors beside me but other than when they were on their balcony and I was on mine there was no noise from their room. I would stay in that room again in a heartbeat. So tips for new arivals do a full walk around there is so much to do and see and plan your vacation. get ice cream and pizzas they re so good when you want a light snack. meal get a Just let go tee shirt for 20 very reasonable and a lovely souvenir of your trip I m still humming the signature tune go to the deli for breakfast very tasty and the girls are so much fun make sure you go to your booked cabana before 12 noon as there are lots of folks come out late looking for cabanas and if you do nt claim yours you risk losing it but getting another also is nt an issue. Let the staff at the hut know when you are done as it makes it easier for them to know what free ones they have keep an eye on little kids on their own looking lost saw it a few times and was able to redirect kids to parents parents keep a close eye on your kids easy to get lost when its busy ask staff for advice they ca nt do enough to help you get to know people on site as they really do want you to have a great experience too late to complain after you leave. Give them a chance to fix any issues you have. Let go. It s an amazing place i m already trying to plan my next visit with at least two members of my family from overseasUse the safe in your room its very handy for leaving passports and wallets behind you so you re not stressing about them on the beach Order room service it only costs a few and is a lovely lazy way to chill after a day of activities visit the kids area even if you do nt have kids. i saw lots of elderly couples and singles enjoying the singing and dancing competitions at the kids pools lots of fun you ca nt feel lonely here on your ownTry to upgrade if you can afford to to a beach front apartment so good to watch the sunsets if you ca nt make sure you re on the beach for sunset photosThanks everyone. One of my best every US based holidays and one of my first as I usually spend all my vacation time travelling home overseas to Ireland.", "offset": [2372, 2518], "date": "2018-07-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "f597e870-3151-433a-a8b5-5c31485a5444", "sentence": "Amenities are just a tiny portion. Do n\u2019t be fooled by that fee. We forked out some serious cash for the \u201c extras \u201d. First. the transportation to and from the airport was amazing. We loved our drivers. It \u2019s extra. we went in July of last year. The staff are incredible. I am still shaking my head with the amenities. We paid 240. We stayed 4 nights. The kids got to use the huge slide. The beach cabanas are included unles you wanted front row. The water inflatables were extra the shark riding thing was extra. The food and drinks were crazy outrageously expensive. The next time we go we will try the sister hotel Rum Fish. If you book with Tradewinds just keep all the extras in mind. Especially when having a sizable family and it \u2019s hard to say no to some of these awesome looking activities. Paddle boarding and the huge rafts are extra as well. Overall it was okay. We were not miserable and our room was spotless and cleaned everyday. Please watch the sunset at least one time if you go there. It \u2019s breathtaking.", "offset": [689, 798], "date": "2019-07-05", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "d11968bf-9932-4baa-af80-e717b2c16a8e", "sentence": "Bob Walter Chris and Olivia make our stay a memorable one each and every time. Seldom does a traveler get to experience to enjoy a consistently excellent quality of service as the one provided by the staff of Tradewinds. specially the service provided by Bob Walter Olivia and Chris. These guys deliver outstanding customer service as easily as they breathe. Over the last 3 years my son friends and I have been staying at this resort at least once or twice per month. During each visit everyone has had a great time because of the many resort amenities activities and superb staff. The moment we arrive at the gate Walter is always so pleasant remembers our names and makes us feel at home. While having fun around the property and pool areas Bob is constantly making sure that everyone is safe and having a good time. He stops and says hello so often that my son has begun to call him Uncle Bob. While at the pool deck or the area around Saltys Olivia is always smiling being attentive and making sure that everyone has drinks made by Chris. the best and friendliest bartender in St Pete Beach. Olivia and Chris give the place a chill and vibrant vibe that every traveler wants to experience at this amazing Beach Resort.", "offset": [469, 582], "date": "2019-11-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}]}
