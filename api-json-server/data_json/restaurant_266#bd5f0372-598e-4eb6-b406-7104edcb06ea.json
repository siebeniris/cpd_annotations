I stayed at the Renaissance Dallas over a period from late June through early August while doing consulting work in the area. Depending on the client I sometimes do not have a say in lodging as the client books it for me. That was the case here and although I am wary in these situations because the assignment is not always the best I was more than pleased with this lodging arrangement. The hotel is easy to find and get to from the airports especially Love Field which is closer though if you are not familiar with driving in the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex it can be a little confusing to actually get to the hotel itself from the freeway or surface streets. The location is also close to downtown and several major area hospitals so it is convenient. However an argument could be made that is sort of an inconvenient location in relation to other area attractions businesses dining etc. Check in was very nicely handled as the staff were friendly efficient and worked to ensure the room was not simply what you reserved but met any special requests. I initially thought that this was a function of my being a Mariot Platinum Elite member but I observed and overheard throughout the course of my stay that they did this with many travelers who were staying there. In part because of my Mariot status but also as a result of availability of king bed rooms which I was booked for I was assigned to an Executive Suite on the 27th floor. It turned out to be an excellent comfortable space. The layout was sensible the entire suite was very clean and furnishings were very comfortable. Everything was in good working order. Climate control worked well which was especially a positive in the extreme summer heat of north Texas. Wi fi was fast and reliable. The concierge lounge on the 27th floor for those who get access to it offered a wonderful complimentary breakfast service Mondays Fridays. They also offered an evening service with beverages and light snacks. The lounge was laid out nicely and was spacious enough to be both comfortable and handle busier times. The staff working in the lounge particularly the two who were there most mornings running the breakfast service were wonderful. They were working hard but always took time to greet and get to know guests. The hotel also has an on site restaurant called Asador which primarily offers lunch and dinner though they also do a breakfast buffet on the weekends. The menu is somewhat limited and everything is pretty expensive even for typical hotel dining but the food is quite good. However I think most travelers would do what I did and only eat there once or twice and drive to other more cost efficient dining options off site. The hotel also features an excellent fitness center on what is essentially the top 32nd floor of the tower. Access is gained by taking the elevator to the 30th floor then going to the fire stairs and going up the last two floors. A nice complimentary laundry space is also found there as is an outdoor pool jacuzi. To do anything in the Dallas Fort Worth area travelers pretty well need a car. The hotel does offer valet service though there is ample space for self park that is secure and easy to access. The hotel does host conventions both on site and as a lodging option for those based at the adjacent Market Center or other area convention centers and other special events. There were several times where the occupancy was very high given such events taking place. But in comparison to other convention hotels I have stayed at in other locations this was definitely one of the best. Staff remained efficient friendly and professional and there were very few if any disruptions on the guest room floors. As noted throughout the customer service was excellent throughout the duration of my stay. The public areas all over the hotel were dutifully maintained and kept very clean no matter how busy it was. If there was any drawback to my stay it was one specific aspect of housekeeping service. The hotel offered an option to not take housekeeping every day by hanging a placard on your door along with the do not disturb one. As a reward you would get points if you only took housekeeping service every other day or every two days. I did not mind this option at all because I often do not take housekeeping every day during extended stays. However there were several occasions where I would remove both placards from the door when I would go to work and was ready for service but would return and find service had not been done and it would not be done for more than a couple of days. Consequently on two separate occasions it was one full week between housekeeping service being performed on my room even after calling to request it and on a couple of other occasions taking two or more days after removing the placards before service was done. This is the only item that prevented me from giving an Excellent overall rating. Overall I was very pleased with my stay. I have not had the best of luck with lodging while doing business in the Dallas Fort Worth area previous to this. But I had a very good experience at the Renaissance Dallas and would return there again for business or leisure in the future. I recommend it for business or leisure travelers alike.", "offset": [2094, 2221], "date": "2016-08-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "2dba6f45-3465-45dc-b796-b4594204be75", "sentence": "personal service.

Not enough space to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to the management and staff at this amazing property. Aesthetics aside it is always the staff and quality service one receives that makes a hotel experience worth sharing. Front Desk Supervisor Joe Zambouni is the quintessential gentleman and professional. He went beyond the extra mile to make our unique stay as pleasant and stress free as possible. This was n\u2019t a vacation or work related stay. This was strictly a long distance medical trip. The king rooms were clean luxurious and spacious. Just like home. Our 1st night stay turned into 2 when we learned my husband had to have an emergency surgery the following day. From the moment we arrived until we checked out on day 3 we were treated not like guests. But rather more like old friends. From the moment we shared our story with Joe and others our experience at The Renaissance was unlike any we have ever had. And trust me we are all well traveled. But when your trip is medically related it is n\u2019t quite like a vacation or work related venture. Having worked in the business as a Sales Marketing Director I do n\u2019t know many in the hospitality industry that are trained to deal with unexpected medical guests. But then I also do n\u2019t know anyone who has n\u2019t been touched or affected by cancer in their lifetime either. Whether it \u2019s a family member or a close friend. When the news hits it literally rocks your world. And when it hits you a 2nd and then a 3rd time you can hardly breathe because the universe just swallowed you up whole. It \u2019s never easy. Especially if you have to travel long distances to receive specialized medical care. Front Desk Supervisor Joe Zambouni set the bar high. He could n\u2019t have have been more compassionate authentic and understanding when we arrived. It was evident upon our arrival that things were n\u2019t well. It was written more clearly on our faces after we returned from my husband \u2019s medical appointment. We learned he had to have emergency surgery the next day. When my best friend husband and I returned to our rooms we discovered a wonderful surprise. There was a thoughtful card signed by Mr Zambouni and his staff inside a gift bag filled with sweet yummy treats any guest would enjoy and appreciate. It brought tears to my best friend and I. While my husband recovered from his surgery and was kept overnight at the hospital. my best friend and I made our way to the hotel. We were famished. So we headed straight to the restaurant to have dinner. We looked like zombies. The past 48 hours had taxed us to the point of sheer exhaustion. All we wanted was a decent meal hot shower and a good night \u2019s rest. The restaurant manager Paul proved to be another exemplary Renaissance Hotel team member. The quality service and kindness shown to us was most memorable. We had a small issue at first however Paul took charge and handled things like a seasoned pro. Our new server Ephraim was courteous attentive and made sure our meal met our ideal satisfaction. Those appetizer French fries with Ranch dressing were the absolute best we \u2019d ever had. No lie. I do n\u2019t think my best friend and I shared more than 5 words over our entire delicious dinner. We were extremely exhausted and emotionally spent. Just when we were getting ready to pay our dinner tab a beautiful platter of every scrumptious elegant dessert on the menu was brought to our table. Compliments of the house. With eyes wide open we just sat there in utter shock. We looked at each other. Looked at the elegant desserts. Looked at our server Ephraim. Then back to the fresh fruit decorated dessert platter in awe. Like a scene right out of \u201c Friends \u201d my girlfriend and I looked at each other coquettishly grinned thanked Ephraim then quickly grabbed our dessert forks and dove into the closest decadent treat near us like starving orphaned children. If you want a girl to temporarily forget about her troubles give her a sweet surprise treat. We could n\u2019t thank the restaurant manager Paul enough for helping us to end our very long stressful day with a wonderful superbly made dinner and delicious desserts we could not finish. It warranted a warm hug and genuine thanks from this wearied and worried wife. In closing whether your trip to Dallas is for work pleasure or the unexpected medical appointment I highly recommend you consider The Renaissance Hotel for your next stay. I promise you wo n\u2019t be disappointed. And I certainly do n\u2019t think you \u2019l find a more refined friendly classy professional caring establishment anywhere in the Dallas area. In my humblest opinion of course. But then again you wo n\u2019t know for sure until you experience it for yourself.", "offset": [3573, 3604], "date": "2018-09-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "2a1acb85-eda5-4636-a80f-bdd63410531a", "sentence": "Decent but excellent customer service. We came as a mini family vacation for the weekend before heading to Houston. The hotel is dimly lit elegant looking but somewhat aged. The room furniture definitely needs an upgrade as it \u2019s dented scratched in some areas the mini fridge is on its last leg and in the fridge cabinet it smells like soured water with the bottom of the cabinet ruined from spilled water over time. The bathroom tile has old mildew on the grit. The room stays cold at least and the beds are decent. The hotel restaurant is pretty good. Get the buffet or go cheaper by ordering off the menu. Two of my kids were free which helped. Coffee is fine and the buffet changes daily. There \u2019s minimal healthy option like chia yogurts boiled eggs fresh fruit. You can also order fresh juice blends. My problem is the smart elevator system. Push your floor number and it tells you which floor to go to. Great. Here \u2019s the problem though should you have kids who have trouble with their suitcases or maybe even an elderly person there is absolutely no option to keep the doors open from the outside. The elevator is programmed to go to the next destination. My toddler could not get off quick enough and the door began to shut on his hand and mine without opening. We tried to get a hand in their fast enough to open it but no it shut and went to the next floor. My toddler went up alone and got off on the floor. I tried to hit the lobby button and it would n\u2019t open. I tried to intercept it by hitting the second floor button. Did n\u2019t work. I sent my sons upstairs and I ran to the front desk. My husband called the lobby. A guy at the front desk ran to the elevators and went up telling me he will find him. Loretha McCre in Loss Prevention came over and assured me she will find him. Within a few minutes she and the guy from the front desk came down with my son and his suitcase. She gave me a big hug and told me everything will be okay. Phew. I \u2019m very thankful at the quick response from these two to find my son. I bumped into Loretha again later and told her I will definitely mention her name online. This kind lady was sweet assuring and made everything better for a worried family.
