Only disappointment was the location without a car you would be stuck as there is nothing around the hotel we reviewed the area before booking and all the information suggested that it was part of Galleria which included the spectacular shopping mall however it transpired that the area was called Galleria and the shopping mall was some 2 miles by car away. However with a car you are fine and with self parking chargeableyou can come and go as you feel free without paying over the odds for Valet parking.

We also tried to use the courtesy car to visit a local restaurant. The attendant told us it would be back in a few minutes so we waited on the bench. After 15 minutes we approached the attendant to find out what had happened as the car had not arrived. He said he would call the vehicle. We received no feedback. After a further 10 minutes we approached him again only to be told the vehicle had been called to The Galleria and would not be back for a further 15 minutes. As a result we were now late for our dinner meeting and had to take our own car.

My friend and I just did a staycation here this weekend and we were so disappointed. It started from the second we pulled up. We wanted to park at the entrance just to check in and take our bags up to our room. We were told we would have to park in the garage and walk over with our bags there is no crosswalk or elevator connecting the garage to the hotel or take a baggage cart but there were none available. So we got to lug all of our stuff from the garage to the hotel in the cold. When we walked in nobody greeted us and the front desk staff was not welcoming at all. We got checked in and got up to our room. It was a nice room but there was not a refrigerator and the only way to get one was to rent one. no thanks. So we asked for a key to mini bar so we could keep our champagne cold. We were told someone would be up with it but they never came. Finally we went down and got the key just to find out it did n\u2019t work once we got back to the room. WiFi is not free unles your an Omni Hilton member which my friend that was staying with me was. we called to see if we could use it with her membership and they said they \u2019d see what the could do and get back to us. they never did. After leaving for dinner we got a second minibar key at the front desk and again it did n\u2019t work. We were tired and fed up so we said forget it. The next day we try to leave only to find our room keys wo n\u2019t work on the garage anymore. I called for assistance twice with no answer. I finally had to call the actual hotel to get someone sent out to help us. We found out later that night that our keys did n\u2019t work because they did in fact switch the reservation to my friends name and never told us. Well now we had left over food and nowhere to keep it cold so we had to have maintenance come up and work on our mini bar just so we could keep our food cold. This morning we go to check out and someone had bought coffee at the restaurant bar and charged it to our room. How is it possible to charge to a room without a giving a name as well. Then I get home and have a random 97 charge from the hotel and the reasoning was very confusing was not explained very well at all. They are supposed to be refunding me so fingers crossed. All this said never once was anyone apologetic or even very friendly about any of the difficulties we had. The nicest person we experienced while there was the maintenance guy that came to fix our fridge. We did book through Hotwire so maybe we just were n\u2019t important enough.
