As we got to the room I call the reception asking for the sauna. To my disbelief I am told that the spa is closed for renovations. In shock I check my confirmation email thinking that I must have missed that. I did not. I contact bokingcom support but they only reply hours later in what was the beginning of a frustrating and at some point unprofessional customer support experience. The next day we checkout. No one asked us about how was our stay during the checkout of a five star hotel. It was the cherry on top of the cake. Why were not we told that the spa was closed during check in. Why would someone lie when asked about the interior swimming pool. Douro41 Hotel Spa tried to deceive us intentionally. Later that same day I call bokingcom customer support. They confirm that there was no information about the spa being closed when I made my booking. They call Douro41 Hotel Spa while I wait on the line. I am then told that I should have complained next to the hotel. I explain that 1 the problem is with the booking done through bokingcom it is not like the bed sheets were dirty and 2 I paid to bokingcom.

Extremely long waits for a drinks up to an hour and very junior staff managing the hotel. When we initially checked in we were urged to book a reservation at the hotel as it was so busy. Much to our surprise we arrived at an almost empty restaurant that night. It was n\u2019t until we were served the food that we really understood why it was empty. It was possibly some of the worst food I have eaten at a hotel let alone a 4 star hotel. Undercoked and completely flavorless we were forced to return to our room and order room service. We spent the rest of our stay eating at the reception cafe which was mainly pizzas and burgers but much better than the restaurant. The spa was also equally underwhelming. We paid for a 1 hour massage that felt rushed and once again conducted by under qualified staff. As with a standard massage they did n\u2019t enquire about pressure or ask if there were any areas we would like them to focus on it was more of a vigorous rub down an expensive one at that. Finally checking out was also an issue when they insisted I did n\u2019t pay for my stay despite having an invoice from the hotel that had told me I had paid.
