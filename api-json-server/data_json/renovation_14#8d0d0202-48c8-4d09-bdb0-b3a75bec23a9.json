Taking 2 x 17 year olds we needed somewhere they would be safe if they wanted to go off on their own. We stayed in a 2 bedroom terrace suite. Wow. What a wonderful room. A tub you could swim in my own walk in wardrobe and dressing room. shower with amazing pressure. The bed was huge though a little hard for me. They changed the sheets daily. We had a connecting one bedroom suite for our children. They had a Juliet balcony but would come through to our lounge to go out on the terrace which had dining facilities as well as lay down beds. Morning breakfast on the terrace served with table cloths and flowers was a wonderful treat. 2 huge flatscren TVs proved a bit of a problem as they both went wrong every day we were there. They immediately sent someone to reprograme them but it was a bit annoying not that we watched much TV. We had to complain twice as our room had not been refreshed by 3 pm in the afternoon despite leaving the Make Up Room light and being out of the room from 9 am. They did come up quickly but in a room which cost us \u00a3 10 for one week we did not expect to have to chase. We managed to get a half board option with Virgin for the same price as room only with one of the online hotel room booking options. Had some lovely meals smashing BQ at The Edge belly dancers at Levante. although if you do not sit near the front you see nothing as the girl almost stays on one spot and we were behind columns I thought she would dance around the restaurant. Chinese was a bit disappointing not the expensive one the one by the Burger restaurant. Sit on hard wooden benches very restrictive about what can be ordered but food quality was fine. We used the Club Rooms every day so went up for afternoon tea they do free drinks at 5 with hot dishes and until 11 at night there is a savoury buffet on the go with hot and soft drinks. Drawbacks for us. We left 7 grandchildren at home there were too many children screaming and running all over the place in the Club Rooms and in and around the pool. True we went in school holidays so our fault. But its not fun to keep being bombed in the pool and hit with water guns. Took forever to get our bags up to our room when we arrived. If you are arriving early as we did remember you can not get into your room until 2 pm. We did get in at 12 in the end but were exhausted and needed a lie down by then. Everyone was friendly and helpful. If you want some entertainment in the evening sit on the benches outside of the main lobby and watch the Feraris Bentleys and mega cars arriving and going all evening. We went on a rip on the Megabus around Dubai which leaves from outside the hotel.

Shame about the staff attitudes. This is my 4th time at the Atlantis I have never had any issues hence my return. However we upgraded to the Imperial club room. Well what can I say. Disgusting serviceWe had to renew our cards after 7 days I was told my husband and I had used all our meal credits Erm no we have not I knew exactly when where we had eaten. We should have had 2 remaining in those cards and another 2 to be added basically a staff member called IslamCaled me a liar. After me telling him a few truths It was worked out a restaurant had charged us twice. Did Mr Islam apologise. Nope not at all a few other staff members were rude to my 4yr old son and tuting at him. He is very well behavedAs it was Ramadan the lounge was not overly busy and we did not wait long for tables Food and snacks were good and worth it for the soft drinks. As they charge 2aedFor a Coke etc round the pools. Depending on the extra cost I am not sure how much more worth the imperial club is.

The only disappointment was when we heard about the park being under renovation partially. This was a fact I did nt come across on the website or while booking. So during our visit the lagoons the lazy river and several rides were under maintenance.

An extensive selection of international cuisines are available from fast food through to fine dining including a Nobu and Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The Imperial Club upgrade included an extensive buffet breakfast afternoon tea and happy hour offering cocktails and quite substantial snacks. This was certainly great value and I would recommend the upgrade. The resort itself while well maintained and spotlessly clean is somewhat dated. The interior public areas and guest bedrooms could benefit from an design makeover. The guest ensuites are still in excellent condition with a rain shower seperate bath spacious vanity and private toilet area with bidet. The restaurants shops pools and hotel grounds present very well. The outdoor beachside disco is reminiscent of Ibiza with touring international DJs. Great fun however we did feel a greater variety of evening entertainment could be offered. Given the climate an outdoor cinema would be perfect for families evening tennis or candlelit beach dining. The resort complex is somewhat isolated and transport is required to go anywhere. Additional in house activities would be beneficial. The staff were excellent from check in through to the waterpark lifeguards all were fluent in English and a delightful mix of nationalities.

When we complained we were begrudgingly offered a different type of room on the other disc of the hotel but the hotel refused to relocate us to the type of room we had booked which we had chosen well in advance for very specific reasons.

Atlantis was an hour late in providing us with our junior suite. so they upgraded us to a Royal Suite which was bigger than our house in London. I can not express what an amazing treat this was but even without that amazing turn of events we would have loved every minute. Despite being at capacity every member of staff was a model of service good humour and humility. We checked in on Tuesday coming early to enjoy our included access to Aquaventure and were delighted to find that the lounge access essentially meant that we could stay refuelled and refreshed all day. Do check out the various packages as although a family suite looks pricey it \u2019s effectively full board and given the price of the restaurants on site it \u2019s well worth it.

We booked 2 rooms each imperial club and had one ocean view and one palm view. Both the rooms were recently refurbished and absolutely stunning. We were checked in promptly and as our room was not ready as it was 830 am we were invited to have breakfast in the imperial lounge and get changed so we could use the pool. Early afternoon I was contacted to say our rooms were ready. On our arrival a guy showed up with a beach bag per room toothbrushes fruit lots of water chocolates and flip flops a lovely touch. Throughout our stay we were supplied with unlimited water and fruit in our room. We chose to have breakfast on the ground floor imperial lounge in the west tower each day as it was so quiet and there was a beautiful spread of food. fruit salads humous breads cooked breakfast fresh omelettes salmon. It is definately worth booking the imperial club as we enjoyed the afternoon teas and went to happy hour on the 12th floor of the east tower for drinks one afternoon. The pools are stunning and mini life jackets are supplied for small children. Our 11 year old enjoyed playing water basketball each day with the staff who started the games. Everyone loved the water park and spent 2 days enjoying the flumes. there is lots of snack outlets and the prices are reasonable and fabulous quality. We also took a taxi to motiongate theme park and had a fantastic day. We had an atlantis driver on the way there and jumped in a taxi on the way back which was half the cost.

This was our 4th time to Dubai as our little boy is now 2 and half years old we thought we would try Atlantis to accommodate the little one. It did not disappoint. There is so much to do for kids throughout the day it \u2019s absolutely amazing it reminds me of being at Disney in a way very similar set up but more high end. From the amazing aquarium to complimentary access to the water park at any time you want it is just fantastic for kids. Last time we came stayed in a different hotel. they were just building a new bit for toddlers in the Water park but now it was finished it was amazing for him. There were lifeguards at the top and bottom of every single slide so you take them to the top and you know that they were looked after at the bottom. We went in the water park every day and did n\u2019t have to queue to get on any rides and as an hotel guest there is a separate entrance so you can skip the entrance queue. The restaurants were all nice you do have to pay suplementaries for the nicer ones but it \u2019s not that much. We love Nobu but our boy was too young to go in which was disappointing. After staying in Dubai a few times I would say that Atlantis is much better suited for families however we did feel that due to its vast size it was slightly more mainstream and you do n\u2019t get the ultra 5 star experience attention like you do at other high end resorts especially Jumeirah al Nasem. However it is worth the compromise when your little ones come first lol. One thing I would like to compliment the hotel on is the amount of smartly dressed security guards they have checking your passes and taking care of guests. They are n\u2019t there to intimidate you as they are all so polite and helpful they just ensure that people using the water parks and restaurants who are n\u2019t staying with Atlantis do n\u2019t wonder into the main hotel. The beach is nice but it no where near as nice as the mainland beach Jumeirah etc with the palm being built on a different type of sand. Our little boy slit his foot on a sharp building stone near the sea front so I would recommend using water shoes for the littles ones. In the evening apart after usage of the restaurants there was n\u2019t that much entertainment for small children which was a little disappointing we feel the hotel could make more of an effort in this area as we found ourselves just wondering back to the room after food. There is a play area and bowling for older kids but it would be nice for a little bit of something going off in the evening times. Overall the hotel is fantastic we requested a new refurbished room and it was stunning. The views over the palm and Dubai were breathtaking.
