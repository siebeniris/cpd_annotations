As is the case at most resorts there are pros and cons but our most recent stay at Inisbrok this was especially true. We had not been in three years and booked their holiday rate which was fair at 189 night. We traveled with our two sons 4 and 1 12 and there is something for everyone. Golf The Copperhead and Island courses are about as good as it gets Pro greens fees are a bit steep at 200 165 con. Copperhead was pretty wet in spots balls plugging in fairway on 1229 despite no rain in days and as mentioned in a previous review some of the bunkers were hard lacking sand. think brown sand not white beachy Florida sand. The twilight rate kicked in at 2 pm sunset 545 and when told our 14pm tee time was moved back due to am fog delay I asked about the reduced rate and the pro told me about some no issues package but still charged us full. A single at 209 moved up to join us and got twilight rate. We got 16 holes in so I have an issue with that. Island course is nice pro and when I arrived early for our 8 am tee time the gentleman in the shop could not find the booking on the tee sheet con. Apparently the young lady in the main shop booked us for Jan 31 not Dec 31con con. Fortunately the first group let me go ahead and I zipped around in 2 hours 20 min bonus pro. the only issue at Island was the gator coming out of the water on 18 cart path that scared the daylights out of me. Pol Pros. Main pool THE LOCH NESS is great for young kids shallow end with sand and 2 slides. There are five other smaller pools around the resort. Cons. Both days at the pool 1227 1228 there was a 2hour wait for a towel. Its 80 and sunny the week after Christmas I understand it is packed but that was a bit ridiculous. Note there is no lifeguard and deepest part is 4 ft. Service Stan the man at check in was extremely helpful with our bags and other items and gave us some nice tips. The trams are great very convenient given the resorts 90 acres. The resorts consists of 28 or so buildings all named after famous golf courses so if you are not near the pool course spa or wherever you are going you will need your car or tram. My driver to shuttle over to Island course was already outside after my call and walk outside 2 min. Fod OK but they nickel and dime you here 50 for breakfast. Ie. kids meal cereal and strawberries or banana 49. My guys chose strawberries and they charged an extra 4 for that. That was last we saw of the market salamander grille. 20 breakfast buffet for cafeteria style scramies. We went to Publix and bought stuff for the rest of the week. We had a more enjoyable meal for dinner at Chilis for less money with drinks. Also 350 tax for a cup of coffee. I requested some activities online dinner reservations were made and I got a call that these were booked but a spa service for my wife the only call I got was the day of saying I missed the apt. The park is nice with shuffleboard basketball courts and mini golf. Fun for the fam.

Just got back from a long weekend vacation at Inisbrok. The resort is large and very well maintained.

There is no elevators which made it somewhat inconvenient for moving your luggage. Room was well decorated and updated and we loved it with all the conveniences of home. We played golf on the Copperhead and South course and enjoyed them both. Dined in the salamander grill and Packards steak house and both were delicious with exceptional service. Stay close to the Osprey club house for the most convenient location. The Loch ness pool looked very nice with slides and hot tub. but the temperature was too cold for pool activities when we were there. Staff was very helpful and friendly. We were upgraded because we were Iprefer memebers. We had a rental car so did not use the shuttle but saw them operating frequently. Several restaurants off site within 10 miles if you have a rental car. There was a lake there that you could fish in with artificial bait but we did not do that.

I stayed here recently for 10 days while visiting family living in the area. We are familiar with Palm Harbor and the Tampa area but have never visited Inisbrok. Thus it was a pleasant revelation that this peaceful beautiful refuge exists just minutes off the hectic US 19 highway. The complex is sprawling over several city blocks and is meticulously maintained. Being gated the traffic within the complex is light and slow perfect if you have young children who can run around without fear of speeding traffic. The worst traffic jam we encountered was caused by an armadillo and golf cart. The facilities are innumerable pools golfing tennis basketball volleyball and on and on. Over 10 days we only managed to enjoy part of these. We also used the complementary shuttle to nearby Honeymoon Island we were dropped off and picked up right on schedule and since Inisbrok has an account with the park we avoided paying the entrance fee. The main Loch Ness pool was empty much of the time but still well staffed so we were always able to get immediate service for food beverages towels supervision for the water slides. We also used the on site complementary van service to move within the complex my mother is in a wheelchair and they had 2 vans with a lift. the staff were very patient and polite and more than accommodating our needs. We stayed in a spacious 2 bedroom unit. It felt more like a home with a large functioning kitchen that we used to make dinner every night and a living room that we used for family gatherings games etc. The unit itself was a bit dated but it was clean and everything worked functioned as it should and none of us were disappointed.

I am telling this from a non golfers perspective. My husband was in the Golf Channels tournament last week. This was our second trip to Inisbrok and I will be honest. I was not exactly excited about the place the first time. I remember it years back as dated and tired. Guess what. nothing has changed and now it is stained on top of that. We requested a King bed. This evidently means that we must be in a condominium instead of a hotel room. Well you know that old saying about first impressions. Here is our first impression and I realize that hotels resorts are helpless to a point as to the clientele that checks in. Imagine driving to your building at about 8 or so at night. we could still see and out in the parking lot a large conglomeration of children young adults some of whom were in a filthy white vehicle and the rest coming and going through the entrance to the building. These two groups rather threatening looking in my mind were shouting back and forth to each other at the tops of their voices hanging out of the windows of the car etc. They were not mad but yelling some sort of instructions whatever the case it was very loud and I thought inconsiderate. I hesitate to write this but it was a rather rough looking bunch. We proceded to get our two suitcases out of our vehicle and started toward the door. They gave us no trouble basically since some of them had gone inside by now. Those in the vehicle had driven away I think. I did notice that when we got inside the first door this group went in the second door down a hall to the right and our room unit turned out to be through a door to the left. I do not mind telling you I breathed a sigh of reliefNow inside our unit I realized it was not a hotel room but a condo. The decor was decent but dated. The bed was indeed a King bed but since we do go on a few little trips a year now I suggested we quickly lie down and make sure we do not roll to the middle make sure the mattress is decent. It was. But when I pulled back the comforter if you can believe this I saw that the bottom sheet was just barely over the mattress on the upper right corner. It was over it about half way really. Oh boy well we have seen that before countless times. These new deep mattresses are not suited to conventional bottom sheets. I pulled it loose with the intention of pulling on it to hopefully get it farther up onto the corner when I noticed that the mattress pad underneath was way down from the top of the bed. that is annoying. let us deal with that first. Around the bed I went undoing the sheet from the upper left corner and it was then that I noticed that the stretchy part of the mattress pad was very torn. Back to the right side I inspected that side and lo and behold it had a big hole in it too. I tried pulling up on the mattress pad to bring it up to the top of the mattress but it would not budge. What else could I do but pull back the entire comforter wrapped within two sheets that it was and undo the bottom sheet all the way. Then I noticed that the mattress pad was hanging off the bottom a great deal. I put my brain in gear. let us see if I take the mattress pad all the way off and turn it all the way around. the bottom stretchy two corner areas are fine. then it will stay fixed at the top. The parts with the holes will now be at the bottom. This I did when my husband walked back in the room wondering what on earth I was doing. By now I am getting a little sweaty since the thermostat out in the living room said 75 degrees when we walked in. The bedroom was a lot warmer. We set it at 71 and you could hear it run but it was far from 71 degrees while I was doing this work. I explained to my husband what I was doing. We just get tired of hotel beds where you wake up all night long with the bottom sheet coming loose and pretty soon it is a ball at your waist by morning. We got the mattress pad placed and it was during this that I noticed a small round stain in the middle. Well we will ignore that. Next we address the bottom sheet. Yes once you get the two top corners all the way down there is absolutely no way the bottom two will go down. But I am prepared for this we now take with us safety pins. We pinned the sheet in places along the binding and at one bottom corner it went down well enough but for the final corner I got creative and just let it lie on top of the mattress pad and I pinned it in two places with the pins. The downside of the pins is that you have to remove them every morning. So now we have had two first impressions. the people in the parking lot and the bed. Night number one in that bed typical for every comforter except the Heavenly Bed at a Westin. our legs get hot after about an hour and we spend the rest of the night throwing off the cover and then pulling it back. We always want a regular blanket instead. Some hotels have them some do not. And those that do. sometimes they do not come in a King size. Anyway another annoyance. I was on the side where the a c vent blew right on me. That added to the hot cold all night. The next morning we were still in the room when Housekeeping knocked on the door. A nice lady named Sefana Safana was there. She wanted to know if she could do the room or should she come back. I was so irritated by that skimpy bottom sheet that I asked her to come and see what we had rigged up the night before plus the mattress pad that had holes in the corners of the boxing and so on. We got in the bedroom and the pins were still in place. I showed her what we had had to do to keep the sheet in place. She said she knew exactly what the problem was. she said the bottom sheet starts out plenty big but in about two weeks or so in the laundry. it shrinks. And I suppose I would understand that I imagine at a hotel or resort there are certain temperatures they must use by law to kill germs etc. But if the guests are so inconvenienced as to have to take a bed apart completely and re do it. I showed her how we rotated the mattress pad and also the stain. When she saw that she said she would call immediately for a new one and she did. Since we were just sitting and reading out in the living room when the mattress pad was brought to her she came back and put the whole thing together. All new. she said proudly. She was quite cheerful and friendly. I did not have the heart to tell her about the hot comforter. at least yet. Night two and three still hot off and on. We do know a thing or two about HVAC vents. we could see that this was one of those that had adjustable louvers. Our man had shown us at home how to move them with needle nosed pliers and a cloth so you do not mar the paint. We did not have needle nosed pliers on this trip but the kitchen had a skinny knife. My husband after night 3 got up on a chair and with a steak knife and a cloth adjusted the louvers to point more up than down. Cold air drops anyway. Finally I slept all the way through on night 4. The cold air drifted down gently instead of blasting me directly. My next heat related thing was to ask for a second blanket. I had opened a closet door to find a blanket but it was small. just the size of the top of the bed. At the Grand Wailea in Maui we had the same situation. We ended up taking two small blankets and pinning them together down the middle. I asked Safana for a second blanket. We could tell English was her second language. I certainly could not expect her to comprehend the pinning part or do it either. So when we got back that evening she had gotten rid of the inside of the usual covers and put the one blanket in. On the bench at the foot of the bed was a second blanket. I got the whole thing apart pinned the two together and this was perfect. Light and breathable. Why there is all this heavy cover in Florida is beyond me. And another thing when we pulled the drapes across in the bedroom. both sets were entirely loose on the outer side on the right side. Since I have made curtains myself and understand the pins and tabs I got up on a chair and hooked back both curtains into the little tabs. Now when the rods are pulled the curtains stay fixed. Now to the stains. The couch. one of the loose back cushions has a big black stain up on the top of it. The armchair next to the couch the loose seat cushion has a stain on the seat. I took the cushions out and turned them over to see if they were firmer. unfortunately they were not. It was then that I saw the stain. We flipped and rotated the two outer seat cushions of the couch hoping for more firmness to no avail. I saw that it was Century furniture. that is a good line but I would say it is long overdue for new cushions. The couch the two armchairs all are so soft it is hard to get up and out. The bench at the foot of the bed also had a stain. Outside right when you step from the asphalt to the surface to walk toward the building door the surface looks dirty. I would say it needs to be steam cleaned. There is also one step that has yellow paint on the edge of it and the yellow has faded out to the point that it is almost gone. that is a safety issue. It needs to be re done. A railing alongside this walkway. the first morning we walked out toward the car a small animal had used the bathroom on the railing right at a 90 degree corner. A little pile of what looked like black pearls. Maybe a squirrel. Whatever the case this sat her for three days. Our room unit was on the ground level and my husband wanted to walk out onto the patio but it was gritty and covered with pine straw. You would not want to go out there barefooted. And when I read the reviews about how everybody is friendly and eager to help. yes they are. But does that make up for what I have just described. I do not think so. You get in a place and the furniture is so worn out it is hard to get up and out of it. And stained. You have to totally re make the bed on the first night. Yes Sefana stood listened and was eager to understand what was wrong and she made it right. Why not do it right the first timeThe first morning we went to the coffee place off the lobby to get coffee. It was late so nobody was in there. Got the styrofoam cups poured the coffee out of those container things then saw that there was no half and half. Only CofeMate fake cream and some flavored creams. My husband asked the lady if there was any half and half. She produced a jug from under the counter that she essentially used to make coffee drinks. it had a date written in huge Sharpie on it. At this price point should not Inisbrok have containers of real half and half. I think so. The rest of the mornings we drove to Starbucks. We never had any trouble with those scary people. My husband is a good judge of people he is out in the business world. He studied the older ones in the group. it seemed to be a big group several cars. He said This is a golf resort and they have no interest in the golf it is odd. They looked very out of place and the older ones looked a bit intimidating yet on the other hand a young boy held the door open for us as we were leaving one night. Who knows. I thanked him and he said he was welcome back. Very welcome in fact. Poorly dressed dirty vehicles just plain strange all the way around. Oh and the second night we were there about 1030. while sitting in the living room we heard a dog barking up close. Several times. I do not think it was outside. I do not know if this is a resort that allows that or not but that is an indication of how thin the walls are. I would hear people golfers making noise every morning too. About 6 am. All in all rather unpleasant all the way around. The quick way to sum up Inisbrok is that everybody is friendly and eager to please and I understand the golf courses are nice. Everything else is tired dated and stained. I was not entirely at ease the whole time we were there and was glad to get home.

Inisbrok is a large property. We paid around 680 for two nights and two days on the pool deck with lunch on the deck both days. There are about six pools on the property and a couple of fine golf courses. This place hosts a PGA tour event so the golf facilities are excellent. There are shuttles provided free of charge to take you to the various places you may want to go to on the property so you do not have to drive your car all over. They make it very simple to get around with a simple call for a pick up to the pools restaurants or golf courses. There are grocery stores restaurants Dunkin Donuts ect just off the property and very convenient but the resort does have dinning and bar options on property. Very nice. I want to start out by saying you may never find a better staff anywhere on the planet. From check in to walking across the property everyone working for this company was cheerful and helpful. Early morning gate guard was a little gruff but hey working the late shift is not always fun. Staff is excelentI am sure back in the 70s 80s this place was the cats meow. I booked the room from Hotelscom and told the person on the phone we wanted one of the two bedroom suites we had been in before about ten years ago. Check in was very pleasant at the central check in building but when I arrived to my EXECUTIVE SUITE I was less than impressed. The building smelled stale damp and musty. The room looked clean but dated and I could have lived with that. The problem was there was a divider door between our suite and the suite next door. I could absolutely see the people in the suite next door through the cracks in the door and could hear every word of their conversation. I called the central check in and explained the noise situation. I asked if they may have another two BEDROOM suite available as this suite had two queen beds BUT they were in the same room. I also explained that we had my 83 yr old mother with us and she could barley walk. I asked if we might find something without steps as it was very difficult to get her in and out of the last building. The desk person was very polite and helpful and found us another suite on the property. This suite was again dated and a little musty. The beds were still in the same room but we are family so we could handle that. The steps were still at the entrance and it was difficult and time consuming getting nanny into the building BUT she is a trooper and did not mind too much. There was ONE handicapped parking place in the entire parking lot for this building and it was RESERVED for room 3182 legal. If you have a wheel chair bound person or a person that has difficulty walking you should address this issue when booking for sure. The room had a small kitchen and a large room with a sleeper sofa breakfast table TV and two queen beds in it and one bathroom with a tub shower. Not terrible but you better be family or not shy in that type of room. Be specific and do not assume anything when booking if you need privacy at this resort. There were some roaches. I saw six in two days. The room was clean. It did not look dirty and was well kept but there were roaches in the kitchen and bathroom. Just a heads up. The only other issue was there is very little or low lighting at night on the property. it is very difficult to read signs to buildings ect. I do not know if this is part of the motif or just an out dated expense but it was hard to see. can not get too lost though. Over all The kids 71 had a great time at the pool areas and the food was good polside. Service at the pool was also good as every where else. Shuttles are very nice and the drivers were always helpful. do not let the size of the property scare you. They do a great job with this aspect of the visit. do not have to worry about drinking and driving. Shuttles run late at night to and from on site restaurants and barsHandicap accessibility was an issue for us. The trip was a lot more difficult than it had to be with SAVED handicapped parking places lack of handicapped parking lack of building accessibility ect. Rooms are dated and musty BUT clean. Roaches were an issue but roaches do not always mean dirty. More than likely I would be hesitant to bring the family back here because of the issues with the room and it is out dated venue and handicapped issues BUT I would come back with some of the guys for a golf Vacation if the price was right.", "offset": [3941, 4094], "date": "2017-06-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "c11999fc-acdb-4382-a1d5-bd037151515b", "sentence": "Do NOT stay at this resort. there is a reason you must pre pay for one night and they do not allow cancellations after arrival.

We tried to eat at the Market Salamander Grill but unfortunately it had rained two hours earlier and apparently none of the staff was capable of drying off any of the outdoor tables so we left and went to Ozona Blue instead. The only two bright spots Michele in the Turnbery Pub and Daryl in the Copperhead Pro Shop. Amazingly friendly and professional. If you are looking for a golfing vacation we were not with the guys to get drunk you may not care if you pay 150 for a round of golf at one of the golf courses. If you are looking for a vacation with your spouse stay somewhere else. lest you show up and find the spa is closed. You can get a king suite with a whirlpool tub at the Hampton Inn in Tarpon Springs cheaper than staying here. And it will not smell like a teenagers sock drawer.", "offset": [665, 738], "date": "2017-10-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "3f6314a3-6a5b-45f5-bf5f-07d86eb65964", "sentence": "Our Stay At Inisbrok in Palm Harbor Florida. I had asked in advanced for an updated room. They gave us a room on the first floor in the Meriam building that was far from updated and felt like a dungeon and looked out onto a parking lot. We went back to the front desk and told them we were dissatisfied with our room and that it was not what we had asked for. He asked me what I had asked for it was in the notes on the computer. and I told him I had asked for one of the most updated rooms that they had. He gave us another room and in fact upgraded us from the Executive King Suite which looked beautiful online to a One Bedroom Suite. It was a little more updated open and roomy but nothing like the room we had seen online. I think this is false advertising. There is no elevator but we did choose to stay on the third floor as we went there for the beautiful views along with the peace and serenity. It was a beautiful place on the outside but do not plan on your room looking like they do on their website. You can hear traffic and airplanes except late at night. The beautiful grounds and the friendly staff. Honeymoon Island is beautiful. Tarpon Springs is close. Had a nice dinner Bumbas in Tarpon Springs. We only stayed 2 nights. They need to install elevators and show how the rooms really look online or update them.", "offset": [90, 236], "date": "2017-11-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "e6c4eac5-59b7-47ab-8232-23ef34c91f53", "sentence": "While I did not enter into the facility I had the privilege to meet some very special people while working n the parking area. The best were in handicapped parking. Being able to be the first face they see is a joy because it gives them the feeling that they are in for a wonderful day of play. If nothing else they give me insight and put a smile on their faces.", "offset": [0, 126], "date": "2018-03-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "68d184aa-1810-4e95-92fb-010973f79403", "sentence": "The club is beautiful. It is a lot different than it used to be when it was private though. They sell condos there and are running into people using their condos for Air bandb instead of putting them into the rental pool. So as a hotel guest I had every right to be at the pool but if I had been an AirBandB guest of someones condo I would not have had that right. So while sitting in the sun a security guard approached me and and another guest in the pool and asked for ID room key. It was scary. They need to have someone there to check your ID before you go into the pools not to shock and surprise you after you are already there. But the place is beautiful. Loved Lyn the Pilates instructor and Dawn Mercer who gave me a super golf lesson. The Steak house Packards and Italian Restaurant are closed Sunday to Wednesday which was not ok with me. There is no room service now either but there is a place to buy food and a place to eat called Marketplace Grill which is fine. You can call the Operatot to ask for restaurants that deliver and know the property. It is 75 acres so go that route. I had great. Chinese from Chin ho. Great prices too. Over all I look forward to going back. It is 25 minutes to Clearwater beach. I had a kitchen too and the people were all very nice.", "offset": [92, 221], "date": "2018-09-27", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}]}
