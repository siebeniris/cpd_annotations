On the PLUS side the accommodations were good. Second top floor with golf course view. One bedroom one bath with full kitchen and living dining room combo. All clean and well equipped. On the NOT SO GOOD side suite smelled unmistakably strongly of curry. Suspect previous occupants culinary efforts caused the residual odor. On day two at our request management used a small air freshening machine while we were out of the suite for a few hours. It reduced the odor somewhat but it was too late for our clothing and suitcases they smelled. Unfortunate timing found us directly below week long roofing repair replacement efforts which began promptly at 8 am each day and ceased at 5 pm Incredibly loud sledgehammering and pounding sounds combined with constant compressor noise and workmen shouting to each other motivated us to get up and out early each day and avoid returning until very late afternoon. On the plus side there is much to do and see in the area. so we did it. A MAJOR inconvenience was no wi fi availability. They are in the process of replacing the wi fi capability so by the time you get there it should be OK. Business center in main lobby did have internet for emergencies. Parking spaces are all narrow recommend using spaces further from the buildings to minimize inevitable door dings.

I booked Welk for 3 nights on Expedia. It was definitely best priced among comparable amenities hotels resorts. I was under the impression it will be big resort just like we have seen in Hawaii or Cancun but it was relatively a small property. Which is in a way good that all amenities can be easy in reach. We really loved room with kitchen with all essential pots and pans dishes and cutleries. There were two pools one full of kids along with parents and another adult pool which is always full with senior folks. Fitness center is just a filler with broken equipments. Looks like visitors may not care about this as they are here to relax and not for workout. Two pool tables and ping pong table were really nice additions in recreation center. Staff was friendly and willing to upgrade if space is available. The only downside I noticed is that they do housekeeping of the rooms unles you are staying more than 1 week. Maybe this is one of the reason why they priced lower than similar hotels.
