Very disappointing hotel. If you book 3rd party you ca nt use your Hilton rewards card. If you book 3rd party you will get room 1 step above the janitor closet. Sink drain stop did not function. Window shade broken. Room located right above the entrance to hear all the noise outside. It is the furthest of the chain hotels from the downtown section. You can walk through the enclosed crosswalks from one hotel to the next till you finally get to downtown but the crosswalks do not flow. they change floors and locations at each hotel. So why bother. Stay at better location hotel. If you do venture outside to walk the street have plenty of change for the pan handlers. The pictures of this hotel hype the wonderful view. I saw the not so wonderful entrance motel style on 3rd floor. The only saving point for this hotel is the restaurant Nikolais Roof on the top floor. Fantastic restaurant. Fantastic views. But you can always visit Nikolais while staying somewhere else. Parking lot is hard to navigate and seems to need better security. This hotel is a total buzkil for vacationers. Nikolais Roof restaurant Furthest big chain from Coke World Aquarium and downtown area. Most important a feeling of security in the tomb of a parking lot.

We booked a king room and advised them we would be arriving after 7 pm. When we got there around 8 pm all they had left was a double with two double beds.

Also was disappointed in the concierge who gave us a map of the area but there was no shopping available and only a few eateries. We were within walking distance to the Aquarium so went there as it was about the only choice except for the Coca Cola museum. Aquarium was better than most. The restaurant called Rays was superb.

I was scheduled to stay here September 9 10. What a horrible stay. First lets start with the hotel this is a 40 year old hotel and I am not sure it has been renovated since it opened. They have renovation schedule any minute now based on notices. The carpet is definitely worn. Both telephones in my room were broken. I told the staff it was never fixed. My safe broke with my belongings in it security came within 15 minutes to unlock it. I wish security was that responsive the remainder of my stay. read on for that. The curtain pull broke as soon as I touched it. There is plaster on the ceiling near the curtain that is falling off. My friend that was travelling with me informed me that he had hair in his bathtub and found a disposable razor on the floor in his bathroom and his toilet would run flush every 15 minutes this I did witness. No refrigerator plastic cups. Apparently we chose to visit on a weekend when there was an electronic dance music show. The hotel was filled with HUNDREDS of tye died unbathed noisy rude 18 20 year olds that packed rooms. The hotel staff should have questioned this when you see hundreds of people checking in and they are carrying their own pillows blanketsindication that they intended to have far more people in the room than linen provided. The first night they returned from the show around 1 am and were noisy. I spoke to the desk staff the next morning and they said there was not anything they could do. I inquired about going to another hotel and was told good luck all the hotels are in the same situation this weekend and are sold out everywhere. The second night they began to return around 1 am again. Congregating in halls and playing music dancing horseplay. I called security twice in a 30 minute period and never saw anyone. At 2 am the real fun began when hundreds of these guests rounded up on every floor balcony and began hooting yelling throwing things down to the lobby from all 25 floors. it was like mardi gras including people throwing up in the hallways. One girl dropped a bunch of whipits in the lobby and the staff helped her pick them up. I went to the front desk and spoke with a young desk staff who stood and continued to twirl his keys on his finger and said sorry there is nothing I can do. I asked about security and he said I will let them know. I asked to speak with a manager and the manager came out and apologized and said he was not sure what they could do but they are trying. I told him I was going to check out. I went to my room and packed and came back and checked out and told them I wanted a full refund. They said they would do that and apologized. 3 other guests also checked out while I was there. The police finally arrived and stood in the lobby which only made them take the parties into the rooms or deeper on the floors and out of the lobby. I sat in the hotel lobby watching this fiasco for 2 more hours. One of the security guards actually came and woke two young men who were NOT part of this group sitting near me because they were sleeping sitting up in chairs in the lobby. She told them they can stay but they are not permitted to sleep in the lobby. This seemed ridiculous as they were very well mannered and sleeping where we were unable to sleep in our rooms because of the chaos. I never saw this security guard approach any of the partyers in that two hour period. I walked across the street to the Mariot where it seems they had a very quiet evening and almost no one in the lobby. After the first night the hotel staff and security should have been better prepared to deal with this and the hotel management should have been better prepared to deal with the customers complaints more professionally. I am a Hilton honors member and can not believe this is a Hilton property. and by the way as a member there were no extra amenities such as bottled water etc. DO NOT STAY HERE.", "offset": [3815, 3898], "date": "2016-09-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "402f646e-eb5b-4710-b4b4-f7eeb13e1e3d", "sentence": "Not worth the rates outdated rooms.
