There was some issues checking in with the front desk being closed due to their hours. The condo is very nice but a different layout then a typical worldmark layout. The master bedroom had two full size beds with the extra room having the king size bed. The kitchen is VERY tiny with little to no counter space. We stayed in a condo designed for 6 people. The table only sat 4 people. I am not sure if this is corporate wide or just this resort but when checking in you must schedule your cleaning day. They will not clean it automatically mid stay as we are normally accustomed to. The pool and jacuzi was fantastic. There is also a great playground for young children and a sand volleyball court. The grocery store is very close by and this resort is centrally located from the airport SeaWorld and DisneyWorld.", "offset": [69, 155], "date": "2015-02-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "1e60cc05-29a6-446e-b913-aa0c753824f0", "sentence": "Wonderful stay beautiful pools and room. I would have given 5 stars except the Expedia Local Expert desk is dishonest. They offered discounted tickets and we ended up paying more than the box office and Internet price.

This place surely goes above and beyond to ensure that you feel like comfortable. This is not a hotel or a resort it is a timeshare. there is no housekeeping. it is as if you are staying at a home when you stay here. The small details and accents to the room make it very welcoming. I love the front desk staff. The women that helped me were so sweet and understanding. Unfortunately there was an issue checking in. I originally booked a 3bedrom since no other options was available. Waitlist contacted me to let me know that there was another room available. Unfortunately this swapped out my name and replaced the reservation with my fathers name since he is the owner of the timeshare. I could not check in. So I called my dad and he called Worldmark reservations to fix this. Apparently it sometimes takes a while so the women at the front desk called reservations to check in on the process. Finally I was able to check in. WohoI love the balcony. It was so nice to end each day just looking out sitting on the balcony with a beer and enjoying the warm nights in Orlando. My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 days4 nights. I think it would be perfect for families as well. There are plenty of activities and things to do on the property. My 1 tip rewash the kitchen tolsbefore you use them. I am a germophobe but it does not hurt to do a double cleaning.", "offset": [807, 923], "date": "2015-03-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "6424a17b-7fa9-4259-89b6-5919a618cf07", "sentence": "recent trip to Universal Studios. A relative was super nice and let us stay as their guest. We stayed at a 2 bedroom condo. There was a room with a king a bedroom with 2 beds and a couch bed. It was really like a little apartment with the 2 bathrooms and all. We were on the first floor and it was super convenient to go to the pool. We found an ice machine iby going up the elevator. There was also ice in freezer. The kids loved the pool. There were two actually and 2 hot tubs. BTW they hide the pool towels under the bathroom sinks. They do not tell you that at check in but we asked around and found out. We could smell others cooking on the outdoor grills each night and it made us hungry. That would be a plus to remember for future visits. Be patient for check in. There is this one lady. she is nice but really overworked. She must have answered the phone 20 times and talked on the walkie talkie several times during the time I was trying to check in. I think it took about 25 minutes for just me to check in. I ca nt imagine how long it would have taken if there had been a line but it did take way longer than needed. There is a desk where i would assume they try to sell you something I stayed clear of that desk and was never asked about anything during my stay. The drive to Universal takes about 20 min. We were going to take the bus or itroley to save some of the 17 per day parking at Universal Studios but the savings was not at all worth the trouble only about 20 savings for a part of 5 over a 3 day period. Just drive its an easy drive with the navigation on your phone. There is a close Publix Grocery store the Walmart is about 10 min away. We ate just down the street at the Golden Corral and saw there were a number of good places to eat nearby. There is wifi but you have to pay extra for it. If I was the owner I probably would have it but it was more than I wanted to pay for this visit.", "offset": [1130, 1276], "date": "2015-04-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "87e3e7e4-9aa5-4c60-b9d5-6d4b2a5345d0", "sentence": "IMHO other timeshares in the area are superior to Kingstown Reef.

The pool water was refreshing and not too cold. There was a bar area near pool but was not open when we were there so I can not rate it. Nice TV. Only thing was we had to pay for Wifi only 50 day. There were movie rentals available also at front desk. We had one plumbing problem which we reported and it was attended to quickly and efficiently while we were away for the day. This is a resort time share but we were not asked to attend any presentations. Be aware that guests take care of trash when leaving as well as recycles which was very easy and convenient. to use.

This was on my business credit card and the staff told me it could take up to 10 days to reverse the charges. They gave me free wifi for the duration of my stay for the inconvenience however the code they gave me did not work and I had to call the front desk to get resolved. When I did connect the wifi was very spotty and hardly worked. It was very slow as I needed it for work. I ended up using my hotspot anyway. This was a bit frustrating but I brushed it off. When I drove to my building there was limited parking as half of the parking lot was fenced off for the construction. The room was dated but was spacious and clean. Unfortunately the room they gave me was right next to the construction area and they began working at 7 am each morning. It was impossible to sleep with the constant noise. Very annoying.
