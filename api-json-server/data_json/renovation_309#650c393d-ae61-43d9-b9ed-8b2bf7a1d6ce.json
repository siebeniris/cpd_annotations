I am a Diamond member with Hyat so have a reasonable expectation that some basic requests be fulfilled. I have only one thing on my reservation profile which is quiet room. There are quiet rooms in the property those facing the pool and courtyard. However rooms facing McBean parkway are extremely loud. So whoever assigned rooms clearly did not care. Others have mentioned the workout room. Half of the Lifesystem equipment is dead and has remained so over the last 3 weeks despite multiple comments including those of others here and some I witnessed at the front desk while personally making the same request. On this last stay it was clear no repair has even been attempted the same bare wires were hanging out weeks laterA topper albeit minor. At breakfast when asked if it was possible to get a latte not exactly an exotic request we were informed that there was nobody manning the espresso machine so they could not do it. Well that kind of put things over the top. I had a long polite conversation with the manager who took my information and promised to get back to me. 9 days later and no communication. I appear to be confusing them with people who care.

We recently stayed at the Hyat Valencia because one of our good friends was getting married at a venue a few miles away. After researching a few hotels in the area the Hyat seems to be one of the only full service 4star hotels in the area. Check in We booked the Corner Suite online with the Romance Package which included breakfast a bottle of champagne chocolate covered strawberries. Check in was fast efficient and our room was ready at around 3 pm. Room. The whole hotel has been recently renovated aligns with the new design aesthetic of the Hyat. Our Corner Suite was located on the 4th floor overlooked the major intersection the hotel sits on. The rooms are clean modern with high quality furnishings throughout. The bathrooms feature a nice walk in shower modern touches like a back lit LED mirror. The bedding was incredible felt very similar to the Four Seasons bedding. The room featured a small living area that was partially separated from the bedroom. There were two small Juilete balcony with sliding doors that could be opened to get some airflow into the room. Despite being one of their top suites we found the actual location of the corner suite to be very noisy lacked privacy. We typically like to sleep with the curtains open from the bed you constantly get cars headlights shining at you while you sleep even from the 4th floor and the constant sound of revving engines at 4 am. If you are booking a room pick the golf course mountain view as this side of the building has the best views is the most quite. Service. The level of service at the Hyat Valencia is what you expect from most 4star hotel brands friendly efficient. Despite the hotel being packed with guests we felt the hotel was understaffed. Even though we valeted our car for the duration of our trip we could never locate the valet attendant. On Saturday night we went down to the bar with friends to grab a bite to eat. The menu stated the kitchen was open till 11 pm. When we placed our order at 945 pm the bartender told us the chef went home the kitchen was closed. Location. The hotel is situated in the heart of Valencia with Six Flags a short 5minute drive away the local mall right across the street. For those looking for dining options in Valencia you can walk across the street to the mall choose from Larsens Steakhouse BJs Saddle Back Ranch Cheesecake Factory. Breakfast. Our room rate package included a breakfast buffet at the hotels restaurant Greater Pacific. The buffet offered pancakes potatoes scrambled eggs bacon sausages. In addition they also had a small yogurt station a small selection of pastries. Once seated you could also order eggs any style with your waiter.", "offset": [0, 47], "date": "2020-01-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}]}
