As a seasoned luxury traveller I was looking forward to this resort stay I was worried that I had made the correct choice as the Datai Langkawi was pretty much next door and this is a world famous captivating resort. I was not disappointed from the moment we arrived we were given personal attention by the hotel manager and our villa was sat right on the beach itself. something I always make specific request for. They did us proud the kids could jump out of the infinity pool straight onto the beach for some beach fun. I have read about and seen pictures of the Spa at this resort and it is truly amazing one of the best I have experienced like something out of a film.", "offset": [432, 538], "date": "2015-01-08 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "9ef37ae1-4a2b-478d-9762-344291b743f5", "sentence": "Yet another wonderful experience. This was intended to be a birthday vacation for my husband and my little toddler boy who turned 2 during our period of travel. It was a dreary start to our much awaited vacation when we checked in to our Lower Melalueca room with partial seaview. Although we had a relatively full view of the sea and the room still exuded charm and comfort it had definitely lacked in the luxury elements. As a returning guest it was even more noticeable that the room requires some refurbishment and cleaning up. There were patches of uneven paint works touch ups on the wooden flooring and on the ceiling the outdoor sunken bath was undesirable due to the stained tiles and mouldy surrounding walls. Poor water pressure makes bathing in that sunken bath a real hassle and the view from the sunken bath consists of a dusty air con compressor unkempt sporadic plants and muddy stone pavements. The curtains in the room were in a poor state the black out layers were filthy with stains and the front layers were extremely wrinkled. My husband wanted to order something from the room service some of the pages were detached from the binder. There was even a cob web at our eye level in the toilet cubicle. Right next to the fruit basket were two welcome notes from the hotel manager. One of the notes was for another guest. All in all it was an uninspiring first impression the room looked tired and it was a poor start to our 9nights stay. The very next morning we have decided to salvage the next 8 nights of our vacation and bring ourselves to another place which we would cherish more. I was quite worried that the hotel would charge us the full rate for our intended 9nights stay so I had to speak with someone from the front office to ensure that our early check out would not cost us much. Shanmugan the Front Desk Manager attended to my queries and concerns right away. He even made an effort to take down notes and listened attentively to my concerns. In addition to apologising profusely Shanmugan had offered to move us to another room and he generously offered the family beach villa. He even suggested that he would decorate the new room with a birthday theme to surprise my husband. I was then escorted to the new room and WOW it felt like I have checked into a totally different resort. Suddenly it felt like the good old Four Seasons that we are so used to. The Family Beach Villa Villa 8 has a full unobstructed view of the white sandy beach and the sea. The private compound of the villa offers spacious area for relaxation complete with day beds and a huge dining table. There is also a small plunge pool with Jacuzi function overlooking the beach. The spacious villa is surrounded by reflecting pools. The living room adjoining the master bedroom has glass window panels all over which allows you to enjoy either the beautiful seaview or the quiet reflecting pools. There is also a family area with a study desk overlooking the pools. We had an additional twin bedded room for our little toddler and also a spacious bath area with indoor and outdoor sunken baths. Although we could still see minor wear and tear issues in the beach villa the entire villa was in a much better state than our existing room. We were so glad that we did not opt for an early check out we stayed put for the next 8 nights enjoying the pampering and undivided attention given by each of the staff member. As promised the Beach Villa was decorated with a Birthday theme complete with a lovely birthday cake. Every staff member we have encountered on my husbands birthday made the effort to greet and wish him. Throughout our stay we have gotten to know some of the staff members well owing to their friendly and hospitable nature. we have had the Director of FB dropping by our villa to say hello similarly the housekeeping manager also checked on us frequently to ensure that everything was in order. During our dining sessions every staff member would make the effort to engage with us play with our little toddler and they went above and beyond to please us. Staff members seem to have superb product knowledge and confidently promoted their services without any hesitation. Having worked in the hospitality industry for more than 17 years I have never come across an organisation with so many contented and happy staff members. Everyone we spoke to had only good things to say about the management and they are so proud to be a part of the organisation. Despite the occasional scorching heat and mosquito attacks staff members were seen wearing a friendly smile at all times they were attentive to all requests and very often anticipated our needs without us asking for any assistance. Whenever our little toddler had gotten bored of his meals there would always be several kind hearted staff members offering to keep him entertained while we continued to enjoy our meals without any interruption. Here we would like to extend our gratitude to these outstanding individuals who had made our vacation memorable Shanmugan Derrick Azlen and Atul. If I could I would take down the names of all the staff members we have encountered in the short duration of our stay. Every one of them deserves a mention. Despite some of the basic rooms looking a little tired and uninspiring the resort still has quite a lot of remarkable things to offer. The spa experience is not to be missed prices are justified and the entire spa facility is top notch. Many daily activities offered such as Yoga beach football volleyball kite flying outdoor cinema by the pool etc however some of the activities could not be launched due to lack of participations from the guests. We opted for the half board package and we only have praises for the chefs. we have dined in all the outlets Serai Ikan Ikan and Kelapa Grill and we can proudly claim that only the best and freshest produce were used to prepare the most delectable gastronomy for us. we have enjoyed our nightly indulgence at Ikan Ikan and we kept returning for more. Derrick the outlet manager at Ikan Ikan was even kind enough to offer us a little booklet of recipes for our Ikan Ikan favourites. We will return in the near future this time we will definitely opt for the Beach Villa. It will be more costly but it will surely be an unmisable treat.", "offset": [3623, 3743], "date": "2015-10-18 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "cbe609bc-71de-48be-9c53-af7c72b9a75d", "sentence": "An amazingly serene and beautiful resort.

If you do not feel like riding you can always call for a buggy which is really a golf cart. do not expect a busy scene here. It is super quiet. That said do book a mangrove tour with the Four Seasons. Our guide Anour was terrific. He was incredibly knowledgeable and it was clear he cared very much about the local environment and his guests. The food at the resort was very good. After a few nights we felt the need to try something different and we went off the beaten path and ate at Pias the Padi a restaurant located amongst a rice paddy field. Amazing meal.

After 15 hours of travelling from the UK we were pleased to finally make it to FS Langkawi our 4th Four Seasons. Our stay was nothing short of exceptional. Firstly we decided to arrange a transfer through FS. This was seamless and despite being a little more expensive that organising ourselves it meant that we went straight from getting off the plane to in the car in around 15 minutes the airport at Langkawi is pretty small. Unfortunaltey the month we travelled September is the rainy season for Langkawi. Despite this we were pretty fortunate with the weather with around half the days having no rain at all. If going again though I would certainly consider going at a different time well outside of the rainy season as this makes a big difference. It s not like other places where the rain is pretty predictable to a heavy downpour in the afternoon. it came at different times and from light drizzle to thunderstorms. One thing you should know is that it s a HUGE resort. Around 15 km long and so make sure you ve got good shoes or they have an excellent buggy service which whips you around places very quickly. Room tip we initially checked in to a upper pavilion with a sea view. It s a stunning room see pictures. but i m not sure it s worth the extra cost of the sea view. It s still set back quite a way and with the adult pool in the way. Later in the trip we moved to a Beach Front Villa which is 2x the price bear in mind. but it s about 4x as big and is probably the nicest accommodation I ve stayed in ever. The Villa even had it s own treatment room. Both the rooms had the largest bath i ve ever had in a hotel room and although we did nt try could easily fit 8 10 people. The food is excellent as you expect with 3 restaurants to choose from. We especially enjoyed the Thrill at The Grill evening with the brilliant Derick giving us cocktail recommendations try the Pomegranate Mojitos. Ikan Ikan is very good for local cuisine and Serai is okay but we only ate there once. If you have a breakfast included package then remember that you can choose to have a room service breakfast as part of the same cost. We did this a few times and actually preferred it to the buffet in Serai. A highlight for us though was heading out on a Mangrove tour with the resort naturalist Aidi Abdulah. He s such a friendly and knowledgable guy and made the whole trip very insightful.

Without doubt the Four Seasons in Langkawi is the best beach resort I have ever visited. The top qualities of the resort are LocationStafDesignLocationLangkawi is simply beautiful and the Four Seasons is positioned on the best beach on the island. Soft white sand warm calm sea overlooking stunning islands. The beach is quiet my daughter and I were frequently the only people on the beach. It is paradise. Langkawi itself is a hidden gem all the beauty of a Thai resort but a totally relaxed atmosphere no hawkers not a one. StafI hope that the leadership of the Four Seasons will read this review as the staff at Four Seasons Langkawi are exceptional. Far better than other Four Seasons and other 5 star places I have stayed. The staff all spoke excellent english were highly intelligent and very capable. For example from the first day we arrived every member of staff knew our names and which room we were staying in. Everyone greeted me personally even just while walking around the resort. When we returned to the resort in our hire car late in the evening before we had even got out someone was there with a buggy to drive us to our room even though we had not seen a single member of staff when we drove in. Late one night the chain on the flush of our toilet broke it was fixed within 10 minutes. Beach service is amazing. Constant refills of iced water great. I must just mention Indran by name. He is without doubt the best person I have ever encountered working in a hotel. This man is a legend and Four Seasons should promote him and pay him more as a matter of urgency. If I were running a hotel I would be trying to headhunt him. The guy is exceptionally smart has masses of common sense and just gets the job done. An excellent role model for his team. Designwe have been lucky enough to stay at some pretty incredible places but this was the first time we have ever had our breath taken away by a standard room. Yep. A standard room is that good it actually made my teenage daughters mouth drop open. Later in the holiday we upgraded to a Beach Villa which was the stuff dreams are made of. Aswel as the rooms being beautiful the whole property is incredibly stylish whilst also managing to be friendly and unpretentious. They have also really invested in watersports. Often on holidays I have found the watersports disappointing but not here. Everything from brand new jet skis to jet boots and a catamaran and brilliant inflatables. What would I changeNot much to be honest. The one weakness of the resort was the food. I would suggest opening something like a food shack for easy casual all day eating Lux in Mauritus has a great one that the Four Seasons should copy. They definitely need to add a much cheaper accessible food option. For the main restaurants. The big issue is the relationship between price and quality. The restaurants are great good quality food and a good range. But the resort restaurants are in line with the other restaurants on the island but are changing close to ten times average prices in Langkawi. Four Seasons either needs to look at dropping the restaurant prices a little or should aggressively upgrade the quality. The second option is my recommendation there is no restaurant on the Island even close to Michelin star type quality. If Four Seasons brought in a world class chef to push Ikan Ikan to Michelin star type levels that would be fantastic having a destination restaurant on site would be the final touch to a phenomenal resort. Overall. As close to a faultless resort as I have ever experienced. I would recommend Four Seasons Langkawi to everyone.", "offset": [546, 673], "date": "2017-04-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "eb049689-c3ff-41ab-a9e6-47eb242b7386", "sentence": "Nicest resort in langkawi. Recently our family stayed in langkawi Four seasons resort hotel from 2nd to 7th June for 5nights. We stayed at the partial sea view king room. From airport to the resort was about 30mins. Hotel included pickup from the airport which was excellent. Upon reaching the Hotel the staffs was extremely friendly and give us a tour of the place using their buggy. The room was fantastic and huge it has a huge Jacuzi at the back yard too. TV had some problem with the receiver flickering all the time. But managed to solve the flickers after changing to a new receiver. Have to watch out for crickets a lot of them and very noisy at night. We had about 10 monkeys outside our room one afternoon which was a pleasant surprise. But please remember keep your room door close. We fed them all the fruits from our room. 1. Food review There were 3 restaurants that we have tried. I must say all the Staff services was excellent. a. The Kelapa grill near the family pool if you order the nasi goreng and fried kway teow it wo nt be wrong. We ask for additional chilli padi the noodles was excellent and tasty b. Ikan Ikan restaurant more traditional restaurant serving local malay cuisine. Our favorite was the egg fried rice and the Malay fried chicken which you do not want to miss c. International Serai restaurant that serve breakfast located near the hotel lobby. Breakfast spread was not bad but I wish selection was much more. As every morning was the same food after a while it get really boring. But dinner was excellent as well they serve me Mediterranean cuisine. We had the triple cheese pasta and fish while our kids had the usual pizzas. Overall the food in all the restaurants was very good and well prepared. But the price was extremely extremely expensive. A simple soup might cut you back around 20 to 30sgd. During the last night we even went out to Ochard Ria in cenang for seafood travelling by normal taxi was about 30mins and cost 15sgd one way. The food was normal nothing to shout about. It was catering more to tourist not to locals. They were selling live seafood. Price was a lot cheaper than Four seasons though 2. Beaches at the Hotel and sea sports. Pros The beaches are long exclusive and private. Cons The beaches was really dirty fill with shoes and bottles. Water was not clear and clean as we would prefer. Not for snorkeling. More cleaning of the beaches highly recommended Weather was unpredictable during June. it can rain or shine 2 to 3 times a day. Seasports was available most of the time. And the staffs in charge was very helpful and gave us alot good information. During the last few days one the staff Zul and lady was fishing at the rubber jetty. This gentlemen and the lady was very friendly helpful and taught my sons how to fish for the first time in their life. Even though it was not part of their duties or responsibilities. This was a wonderful experience for my sons. I hope the hotel could seriously think of incorporating this fishing activities as one of the experiences for all the hotel guests. Overall review. We need to highly comendate a young gentlemen working there Mr Suyash from India. I believe he is one of the manager the restaurants. His service is way beyond excellent. We usually meet him at the breakfast restaurant in the morning. When he found out my younger son was down with high fever. He immediately help to arrange the hotel medical assistance to our room. He was always extremely hardworking and willing to go beyond his duties for the guests. He should be rewarded for such dedication to his profession and his guests. Always willing to help guests in any way. His friendly and positive attitude is a good representation of Four Seasons hotel. I would not hesitate visit the resort that he is working in during my holidays.

There is even an outside shower in a private garden courtyard if you are feeling brave. There is also a private plunge pool which was also very nice. The extremely high ceilings and very tall windows facing the beach and sea make for an unforgettable view. Unfortunately it comes at a price in terms of the fiddling about with the curtains which are constructed in lengths joined by Velcro strips which unfortunately do not seem up to the job. Each evening I took about 10 minutes to try and link the curtains up together to ensure we were not going to be woken too early by sunlight flooding into the room. The massive sliding doors to the outside were a bit clunky and quite an effort to shift. The outside doors to the private courtyard area at the back were in a pretty bad shape. The windows everywhere really needed a decent clean given the size of them not an easy job. We did not see any windows being cleaned the whole time were we there. The lighting technology in the room is substandard. There is not a single light setting that suits for night lights either too bright or too dark risking a fall on the long journey from the bed to the bathroom which includes some steps down. The outside lighting was not great either with 2 out of the 3 tree lights not working. The maintenance man got them working for about 5 minutes before they went out again. Cleaning and servicing of the room was okay but it was clear that there was a bird or something up in the rafters somewhere droppings on the floor each day. No easy way to clear them out I would guess as the ceiling reaches up to 30 ft into the rafters.

The resort is so huge that you really can have total privacy if you so wish by staying at your own villa. We did this one day and saw a total of 4 people in the distance walking up the beach. Very relaxing. But again it comes at a logistical price in that there really is not much action going on anywhere. The bar was dead virtually every day not surprising given the extortionate pricing. How about a happy hour to get people in thereThe adult pool is lovely but there just are not enough sun beds. We tried to get a cabana or subbed on 2 days at 10 am and were told it was full and to come back around 3 pm. That really is not good enough given the prices being charged. The water sports area was 1 km away from our villa. I understand that they had a flag system to tell people when it was safe to swim in the sea jelly fish are a problem some days. Obviously that did not work for us as we just could not see any flags or signs anywhere. Breakfast was okay but it was disorganised. The food quality on offer was fine but the logistics of having to order freshly cooked egg dishes without knowing when they would be coming out made everything that much more complicated. Getting someone to serve tea or coffee was pot luck and the fact that the overworked waiters were having to provide butter on request rather than having these placed in the cold cabinet just made their job that much more difficult. The last day we asked if we could sit at a table overlooking the front to be told that it was not available despite the fact that nobody was there. Subsequently a couple turned up 5 minutes later with staff all over them. It seems the hotel has 2 classes of guests those that can reserve seats and get exceptional service and the rest of us.

That did not suit my wife and I had to speak with the manager to get some fish cooked for her as the staff seemed unwilling or unable to do anything on request. Just unecesary hassle that could have been avoided by communicating clearly what the night entailed and the menu details. I would characterise the food as being pretty good but not outstanding. It is ridiculously expensive. One evening we went out to The Dana to eat at the Terrace restaurant. What a difference happy hour at the bar followed by truly excellent food at reasonable prices. We worked out that we could justify the 12 hour taxi ride to eat out every day and have better food and drink and save ourselves a small fortune at the same time. Overall the hotel has some very strong points the beautiful beach the friendly and helpful staff the feeling of space and the relaxing environment. But it comes at a price.

We had the beach buffet one evening which was good but expensive. It was sold as lobster night and that really was it lobster or nothing. That did not suit my wife and I had to speak with the manager to get some fish cooked for her as the staff seemed unwilling or unable to do anything on request. Just unecesary hassle that could have been avoided by communicating clearly what the night entailed and the menu details. I would characterise the food as being pretty good but not outstanding.

My wife and I stayed for 5 nights in a beach front villa. The views of the 18 km private beach are stunning. The beach front villa was huge with a vast living area sleeping area private massage room should you so desire and separate dressing room shower room and toilet areas. There is even an outside shower in a private garden courtyard if you are feeling brave. There is also a private plunge pool which was also very nice. The extremely high ceilings and very tall windows facing the beach and sea make for an unforgettable view. Unfortunately it comes at a price in terms of the fiddling about with the curtains which are constructed in lengths joined by Velcro strips which unfortunately do not seem up to the job. Each evening I took about 10 minutes to try and link the curtains up together to ensure we were not going to be woken too early by sunlight flooding into the room. The massive sliding doors to the outside were a bit clunky and quite an effort to shift. The outside doors to the private courtyard area at the back were in a pretty bad shape. The windows everywhere really needed a decent clean given the size of them not an easy job. We did not see any windows being cleaned the whole time were we there. The lighting technology in the room is substandard. There is not a single light setting that suits for night lights either too bright or too dark risking a fall on the long journey from the bed to the bathroom which includes some steps down. The outside lighting was not great either with 2 out of the 3 tree lights not working. The maintenance man got them working for about 5 minutes before they went out again. Cleaning and servicing of the room was okay but it was clear that there was a bird or something up in the rafters somewhere droppings on the floor each day. No easy way to clear them out I would guess as the ceiling reaches up to 30 ft into the rafters. This was a little disturbing as was the nighttime antics of the macaque monkeys running about on the roof. The resort is so huge that you really can have total privacy if you so wish by staying at your own villa. We did this one day and saw a total of 4 people in the distance walking up the beach. Very relaxing. But again it comes at a logistical price in that there really is not much action going on anywhere. The bar was dead virtually every day not surprising given the extortionate pricing. How about a happy hour to get people in thereThe adult pool is lovely but there just are not enough sun beds. We tried to get a cabana or subbed on 2 days at 10 am and were told it was full and to come back around 3 pm. That really is not good enough given the prices being charged. The water sports area was 1 km away from our villa. I understand that they had a flag system to tell people when it was safe to swim in the sea jelly fish are a problem some days. Obviously that did not work for us as we just could not see any flags or signs anywhere. Breakfast was okay but it was disorganised. The food quality on offer was fine but the logistics of having to order freshly cooked egg dishes without knowing when they would be coming out made everything that much more complicated. Getting someone to serve tea or coffee was pot luck and the fact that the overworked waiters were having to provide butter on request rather than having these placed in the cold cabinet just made their job that much more difficult.
