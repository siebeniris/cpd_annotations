It has been an awful experience so far. The first room we were given had a poor seal with the balcony door that caused a significant cold air draft. As the night went on it got so cold that we had to pack up everything and ask to be switched to another room. The new room on the same floor was warmer and did not have a draft but now we were dealing with a heater fan that makes a really loud sound and waiting close to an hour for a crib. The crib took two phone calls and an in person trip downstairs to speak with someone and find out what is going on which was only met with excuses about being short staffed in housekeeping. If the bad experience ended there I would probably give it 3 stars. But my wife finally gets the baby to sleep and everything in the world is about to be right again then all of a sudden the rhythmic rumbling of bass starts jarring the room and you can hear the muffled lyrics of the corresponding song. Turns out they are hosting a wedding reception and they thought it would be a good idea to relocate the people with a small baby who complained that their room was too cold to the room directly above the reception ball room. 4 diamond service. At this point my wife is nothing short of irate and goes downstairs to speak to the manager herself which is not characteristic of her typical demeanour and evidences just how frustrated she is. it is really disappointing that i chose to go with a high grade hotel and end up with a such a low grade experience and I want others to know that this place is not up to par.

This hotel used to be part of the Japanese Prince Hotel chain hence the Prince name stays. It definitely has an Asian theme to is in many places which is nice but somewhat out of place for the location in NE Toronto. I stay there frequently due to the proximity to offices where I visit. I am not sure why else someone would stay there unles some function is held there or nearby relatives. The rooms are quite large and very clean. I am usually placed in the tower where most rooms have excellent windows overlooking the direction you get. I think there is 1 interior room for every corner room. so lots of windows. Ask for a corner room if you want a better view. Bathroom are reasonably modern although there are some paint starting to peel in the damp areas. There is a shower beside the bathtub although the shower is quite small as I tend to hit my elbows periodically on the walls or glass. Not a big deal unles you are a really big person. The bar area is reasonably nice and bartenders have been quite good I have eaten in the main restaurant beside the bar and I find the dinner food is very fresh and generally very good not cheap though. Breakfast for me has been the buffet which has the standard fare for a Westin lots of fruit some berries usual sausage links bacon etc. They have an omelette station too. Service in the restaurant is not too special they could use improvement there. Generally English is not the primary language and not all are easy to understand. They are also sort of connected to a Japanese restaurant which is a nice change. I have not used the outdoor pool or tennis courts.

This is a typical Westin. Comfy bed nice sized room nice public areas etc. This hotel is about 20min from downtown but it was very easy to get around with a car. Public transit was also very close by. The rooms have free wifi which was a plus. I booked my room on Priceline at a great deal. I called both Priceline and the hotel to find out what the incidental hold is at check in. Priceline told me to contact the hotel the hotel told me they do not charge anything you pay it all at the end. I thought I had asked very clearly when I said so when I check in you do not hold any of my funds. The answer was still no. They would have my card on file but would not take any of my funds until check out. Great because we were traveling on a TRUE budget. So when I arrive and they ask for a 250 deposit I was a bit miffed. The manager was unapologetic but the guy checking me in helped figure something out. That was problem no 1. No. 2 when we got to the room the tv did not work. Not a single channel. I called for maintenance no one showed after 30 min or so so I fixed it myself and called back down to cancel the request. No. 3 our key cards periodically did not work. We just stood there trying the keys for about 5 10min at a time until we could get in the room. No. 4 I called for extra soap and towels at least 3 times. We traveled as a family of 4 and we did a lot of stuff so we took 1 or 2 showers each day. We needed additional washcloths and soap. Never got it. I even called before our room was cleaned and asked if the room attendant could leave it while they were cleaning I figured that would be easiest. Nope. Never got it. We pretty much had to ration the soap. This hotel was so comfortable and I would have considered staying here again but not after the lack in service. I will opt for a location downtown next time.

Little did I know because she did not tell me that they authorize for 250 for incidentals for a one night stay. That is absolutely crazy. I am a little shocked that they would authorize for such a large amount and not think that they should inform their guests prior to taking the authorization. Also not only did she not mention it but I handed her a debit card which freezes your funds for 3 5 business days when an authorization is taken. I work in the hotel industry so a little suggestion to management would be to always be up front and honest with your guests. I understand needing to protect the hotel and would have been fine with such a large amount had I been informed prior to them authorizing my card. They should tell you at check in and the front desk should also be trained to take extra caution when someone is presenting a debit card.
