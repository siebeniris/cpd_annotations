I had been here perhaps 20 years ago and was pleasantly surprised that this inn is going strong and had been renovated to comfort and style. It was nice back then but we found it to be a great place to relax for our time in Yountvile. We had a second story room with vaulted ceilings and a small patio with furniture. There was lots of light and a nice fireplace a wine refrigerator that was appreciated a large and modern bathroom. A bottle of wine was placed in our room and the morning breakfast is huge and tasty. We were able to stay healthy with a custom made egg omelet and lovely fruit. Their pastries are made in house and worth the splurge. In the afternoon is a nice tea service that will sustain you until dinner. The bed was comfortable. I would recommend this for a little retreat. The gym is a five minute walk away and is small but has water towels and is just fine.

We honeymooned here and had not been back so decided to celebrate our 25th anniversary by returning. We had vague memories but as soon as we stepped in our room it all came back. The high wood beamed ceilings wonderful fireplace and spacious yet cozy room was incredible. The large soaking jacuzi tub was perfect. Loved the LOcitane bath amenities. We used the fireplace so much and they never had a problem providing us with as many logs as we needed. The balcony was spacious. Loved the breakfast each morning with mimosas. Made to order omelets or eggs and something different each day. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The grounds are lush and beautiful. The only suggestion I would make is that if the staff knows someone is celebrating something perhaps when you book the reservations they should ask if it is a special occasion then have a card or something in the room to acknowledge. But other than that everything was perfect and we plan to return sooner than another 25 years. Lots of shops and restaurants that are walking distance.

My wife and I stayed here for two nights in late December as one of the stops on our Seattle to San Diego road trip. The property itself is very nice and and located within walking distance to all of the great restaurants. Our room was very nice and cozy. It was nicely decorated included a fireplace and the bathroom was quite special. We were situated in the back corner of the property which had an unsightly view from the balcony. We also did experience an early morning disturbance with a garbage truck which is obviously nobodys fault just something to keep in mind when checking in. One of the brightest spots of our stay was the housekeeping. They really went above and beyond. The attendant at the omelette was also great. Unfortunately that is where praises of the service stop. The front desk staff were not friendly or helpful for that matter. There was a specific incident with a front desk attendant upon check out that was very surprising to me. In short the attendant gave a rude response rolled her eyes and walked away after I calmly asked for clarification on a charge. It certainly was not the California chill we experienced on other parts of our road trip. I brought this to the attention of management several weeks later when prompted for feedback which went ignored. Whatever. If you run into better luck with front desk staff this is actually a pretty great spot.

The breakfast offered a great selection and was regularly restocked. There is a lovely pool area and the rooms are set amongst beautifully manicured hedges and fountains.

My parents and family members including my husband and I have been staying at the Vintage Inn for over ten years. The upstairs rooms have vaulted ceilings large shower tubs fireplaces balconies with two chairs or couches and comfortable beds. The rooms have been recently updated or will be soon. The lobby is getting a complete renovation making it more modern and upscale. In the meantime the reception is in a separate building and is even nicer than the old lobby. The temporary lobby has outdoor fire pits and an inside sitting room with a large screen tv or just a nice place to read. The breakfast which is included is one of the best we have ever had. Full of variety cereals hot and cold fresh fruit fresh danish and an omelet chef. We never need lunch. We also love the fact that there are so many great restaurants within walking distance. Botega and Bistro Jeanty are our favorites for dinner and R D for lunch. Get the cuban sandwich or the fried chicken sandwich. The best part of the Vintage Inn is the incredible staff. In all the years we have been staying at the Vintage we have seen very little turnover which says a lot. From Chris at the front desk all the way up to the general manager everyone is so efficient and wanting to please.

The breakfast was a slightly extended version of what you would get at a Motel 6 I think coffee and pastries in a soul less room.

Having stayed at the previously named Vintage Inn I looked forward to staying at the remodeled House. We stayed in a loft suite which was large and wonderful. They did an excellent job on the redesign with modern comfortable and stylish furnishings. The huge bathroom and equally large TV are nice features. The other redesigned area that stands out is the large lobby building. Its beautiful but lacking much purpose. The breakfast area was moved to a nearby building and the bar was eliminated entirely. The relocated breakfast area works fine but eliminating the bar was an odd choice for a large property. There are nearby bars but why force a people to leave the property. With no bar or food service in the very large lobby building it seems like wasted space and we rarely viewed people in there. I suggest they rethink the use. The pool area is fairly unchanged and works out very nicely for post tasting lounge time. Keep in mind that this is not an adults only property so kids are often at the pool. I adore kids but I think bringing them to Napa is a curious choice. People have complained that the breakfast is not what it used to be. I thought it was perfectly fine. There is no omelet station but the food is high quality and there are ample choices. Keep in mind that none of the other high end Yountvile hotels offer any complementary breakfast so just enjoy it. A few quirky elements aside VH is definitely a place I had return to for Yountvile lodging. Its far from cheap but its in line with the other luxury hotels in the area. While this place is a great option there are a handful of other equally good spots including Bardesano Yountvile Inn and North Block.
