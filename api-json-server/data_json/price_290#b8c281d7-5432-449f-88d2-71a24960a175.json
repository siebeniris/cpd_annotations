Busy weekend for the hotel but the registration staff were very nice and informative. The lobby is clean and quaint with small tables to accommodate the morning continental breakfast crowd. The room was adequate but the beds were very hard and lumpy. We found it very very uncomfortable and did not get a very good nights sleep. The cowboy BQ is next door and is good very convenient although a bit pricey. The message the therapists are on site and they are a great value. Check with the desk on check in for discounts. The hotel has dog friendly rooms and ample places to walk our furry friends. The hotel was recently repurchased because the previous owners let it go however the new owner has cleaned up the place and is striving to make it much better. Saying that the rooms are old and still need some things upgraded but it was clean and except for the beds was very comfortable. They have 2 pools both of which are kept super nice and clean plus there are cabanas by them for a nice nap.

There was 2 pools and 2 hot tubs. One pool heated and one not. Pools were open till 1030 pm which was nice to unwind in hot tub after shopping. Overall good experience for the price. It is an older hotel and could use some room upgrades. The grounds were nicely manicured and the pool area was great. Very quiet and no problem finding a chair to relax. King bed in our room was comfy. We were only there for a short stay. We checked out some downtown shops and restaurants. Also took in the Palm Springs Aerial Tram which was great.

We arrived around 9 pm we were late due to the traffic coming out of LAX. Our taxi driver was the one who helped us with the bags as we had a few none of the hotel staff would. We were greeted by a gentleman I did not catch his name and a lady called Teri. The gentleman was very helpful and very polite and welcoming but Teri has got to be one of the rudest front of house staff I have ever came across she could not even crack a smile. We were offered a room upstairs as it was more quiet which we were happy with and Teri snapped and went. Well there is no one to help you with your bags and I m not doing it so you will need to do it yourselves or change what a warm welcome that was. We also asked if we could buy stamps from the hotel to post some cards home and again Teri snapped with I do not know. well that s something she should know or be able to tell us where we can buy them as I m sure she would have to post work letters from the office. We were also told that the wifi was not working but would be working in the morning some devices were connecting and some were not which we could deal with until the morning. When we got to our room it was straight in front of a car park I m sure the upstairs room would of been more quieter but again no one would help us with our bags I am sure it would not take much to lend a helping hand. The room was clean and well furnished however the two double beds were not double beds two normal sized people could not fit comfortably on it. We called up and asked if there was anything else available and I was sharply told by Teri on the phone. Well that s all we have we have rooms with one king sized bed and the double rooms we have guests staying in those rooms with more people and they are happy clearly they are not happy by the sounds of the reviews on this website. The air con also was not on when we came in and neither was the fridge. In the morning by 10 am the wifi still was not working we called up a few times and were told we would get a call back but we never did. Once our devices managed to connect to the wifi we had to stand at the window of our room to get it to work it actually worked better we stood outside in the heat and then other times it would not work at all. The hotel breakfast was simple but what was on offer was nice. Our bathtub plug was broken and when we went to turn the dial to drain the water out it was broken half open and lots of black muck was coming out we could of easily cut our hands and we had to stand inside the bathtub holding the plug ourselves to drain all the water out. The toilet was also noticeably dirty and looked liked it had not a proper clean in about 6 months. The beds were comfy but not big enough to hold more than one person. The third day our rooms were cleaned and bed linen and towels changed. The towels given to us were already dirty they had make up marks on them and neither were the big towels any use they did not even cover you up properly. Overall the hotel is in a good location its clean and not badly priced. However I think the customer service of the staff needs improved the wifi needs sorted and rooms redecorated. I would stay here again if I was in the area unles I found something better.", "offset": [3159, 3230], "date": "2016-04-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "f4e97a57-a15e-420d-91fd-74caac324975", "sentence": "Great for price not impressive.
