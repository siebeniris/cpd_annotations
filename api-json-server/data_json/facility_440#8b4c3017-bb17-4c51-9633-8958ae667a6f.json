Positive fedbackThe following comments should not be seen or construed as criticisms but as feedback based on daily observations during our stay. ComunicationIt was immediately evident to us that communication lines between hotel employees did not always run smoothly. Evidencea. On arrival at the hotel we were asked whether we wanted coffee tea delivered to our suite in the morning. We welcomed this offer. In the morning we cancelled this arrangement as coffee and tea facilities were readily available in our suite2 days later we were awakened by a knock on our door followed by a room service announcement that we simply ignored. 2 minutes later we received a telephone call from the reception telling us that tea was being delivered to our romb. While having dinner at the Conservatory restaurant we ordered some wine which never arrived at our table. A few minutes later another waiter brought up the wine list and asked whether we wanted to order some drinks with our mealsAtention to detailAt breakfast and once at dinner in the Conservatory it took waiters a very long time to clear the empty plates. This is not professional probably as bad as the practice current in the US of taking away plates from guests while others on the same table have not completed their meals. Cultural difference we expect. Management presenceWe felt that management presence in the Conservatory restaurant and breakfast room was erratic to say the least. We would have liked to see managers performing a more effective supervisory role and engaging with guests to address specific customer issues. A number of past reviews posted on TripAdvisor had made mention of a wobbly service. Therefore it is somewhat disappointing to note that no real progress has been made to remedy such weaknesses in this area. Charm friendliness and good intentions do not constitute efficient restaurant service. Addressing guests by nameIt may be pleasing for long staying guests to be recognized by hotel employees and addressed by name. This practice has some merit but also some pitfalls. Some foreign names are not easy to pronounce and it is a little unfair to ask employees in the second front line to cope with unpronounceable guest names. It is difficult to form an opinion as to how different guests feel when their names are mispronounced. Some may feel embarrassed whilst others may not read anything into that. Although our family name is easy to pronounce it was tortured to death daily on countless occasions. For this reason we very much prefer the more common but polite form of Sir Madam. All the above mentioned observations refer to very trivial things but there should be no trivialities in a 5 star hotel. Hotels exist only because of guestsRestaurantsThe ConservatoryWe had dinner at the Conservatory on 3 different occasions.

If there is a Relais Chateaux hotel where we are going then it is for me. Generally you can bet your house on them however this time was a little lacking. The bad start and the weak link was the Night Manager. We arrived just before midnight a little late because the pick up from the hotel did not turn up at the airport. It transpired their taxi driver had been told we were not on the flight. The Night Manager had no apology and asked me to show him the proof after a three day journey to get to the hotel that was not exactly the approach we needed. He then showed us to our two storey suite managing to avoid carrying anything heavy and leaving that to the lady security guard and my husband. We were shown around the ground floor of the suite but not the upper floor which was up a steep set of stairs. My take if he had shown us he had have had to take the bags up as it was he left that to us. I asked him to book us into the Greenhouse restaurant attached to the hotel it was not done and only by good luck when we turned up could they accommodate us in this VERY busy restaurant. So not a good start. However things did improve the rest of the staff and the General Manager were on top of their game the breakfasts excellent and general ambience was calming and restive. The gardens are an absolute joy stunning in fact.
