Spent a short weekend at the Mariot and had a great stay. All the staff were extremely friendly and service oriented. Would definitely return. Pros 1 nice room facing water and pool. As usual comfy mariot beds. With the music coming from the Sail bar across the street it was like a party in our room every evening. 2. all staff were very friendly. Patricia the bartender was great try the grilled pineapple mojito. Carl in the Concierge lounge was very attentive. Check in out was smooth and no wait. The valets and bellmen were friendly and gave good restaurant recommendations check out miguels for Mexican. 3 had a great massage in the spa and prices are reasonable for a hotel. The spa has shower facilities and a sauna for use post treatments. Also cool hand salts to try 4 pool area is nice and large with always enough chairs. 5 you can walk along waterside on paved paths and the trolley is across the street if you do not want to drive to places like Ybor City. 6 location is near some attractions like Florida Aquarium and a history center. Get a map from concierge desk and it includes coupons for these attractions. Aquarium is not huge but nice. Also they have easy directions to get to nearby beaches like Clearwater Beach and gave us a tip to get there early to stake out a spot. while we did not exactly follow the tip since we did not want to get up too early they were rightCons. 1. every time I tried to call valet to request my car nobody answered. Ended up not being a huge deal as they brought it quickly downstairs but kind of defeats the purpose of saying you can call and have the car be ready when you are ready to go. 2. the pool water was freezing 3. I think due to the location of the pool it was always super windy.

Seeing the reviews here it seems the hotel has some service level issues with housekeeping and front desk they have not fixed and if you read my review you \u2019l see it \u2019s just getting worse. This is my review. If you care about your safety read on. Every one of your departments basically failed us except valet Check in we did n\u2019t get the booked room and were basically over charged for a downgrade. The front desk guy said he would take off 50 for each night but they only took off 64. Weird but a big indication of service. the room service to go is a new experience for me and being asked to come down and get it or pay 5 for it to be brought up seems tacky but whatever. However missing half our food the oatmeal was another misstep from f and b Then The BIGGEST issue I \u2019ve ever experienced housekeeping cleans our room around 3 and leaves the deadbolt on. So we came to an open room at midnight and realize our door was left unlocked for hours for anyone to go in and help themselves to what we had. Not to mention someone could have been waiting in the room. If you \u2019re a female this should concern you greatly. The room also had a dirty hand towel left on the made bed mind you. We call down in a panic. The front desk guy was very apologetic after we realize nothing was missing we went to bed. He gave us 10k points right away for the trouble. We wake up and take the elevator up and it gets stuck. The door opens 4 inches and stays like that for 30 60 seconds. Feels like a lot more at the time but it was quick. It went back down and we got out So we went to the lobby restaurant good experienceWent to our room and checked out shortly after and just spent more time at the airport than the hotel as we felt it was n\u2019t going to go any better. At check in we were given 50 off a night for basically being downgraded we booked a live well king bed room with a balcony. Only a lower level room was availableAt check out I asked the woman who checked me out if the 50 a night was applied and she just yes\u2019ed me I went to verify it on the ap I saw only a 64 discount was applied. Shady practices or poorly trained employees. I say the latter which shows more of this poor service level. Rooms are real nice. Bartenders were great. Location was good for us. But the open door and the fact we had laptops and expensive shoes and purses in the room. If someone went in to take stuff it could have been thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars taken from usConsider this security lapse before choosing a location. What would you do if half your stuff you take on vacation that does n\u2019t fit in the safe is stolen. The other reviews complain of the same thing poor service and one side of the hotel does face construction curentlyIf you \u2019re not having a big convention or party here I assume you \u2019re given the construction side of the hotelI would have never wrote this review but I checked my bill. Went on the mariot ap to ask the hotel to adjust the bill and I got a response the the 64 was the adjustmentThey wasted enough of my time and I let a lot pass by. The response on the ap was the end for me.

Having used the Mariot Water Street and prior to that the Mariot Waterside for the last 10 years regularly I had today one of the most awful experiences I have had with hotel reservations in a long time. I have written really positive recommendations for this place before and not sure what has happened but today was not a good day. Having booked at least a month ago for this trip I had some last minute changes which meant I was not going to make it to the hotel on Monday night instead arriving early from LA on Tuesday morning. To make sure the reservation was kept and not cancelled my Assistant called the hotel on Monday morning Tampa time 1000 to inform them of my plans and to make sure I could check in on Tuesday morning my reservation and Mariot members number was quoted to the Hotel staff and my assistant was assured that the room would be available even if I had to wait a short time due to rooms being cleaned etc. On arrival this morning I was informed they had cancelled my reservation and had no rooms available which was a surprise and a disappointment especially as my assistant had called to confirm my arrival and assure that paying for the extra night I was not there would be OK. This would all of sort of been OK not great but OK until on asking to speak to the Manager Stanca I was treated pretty shabbily and to be honest quite rudely. I was told that my Assistant must be mistaken even inferring that we had called the wrong number and certainly not offering a solution. A pretty poor response from a Hotel that normally has a great reputation and one I have written hugely positive things about in the past. If I am honest i am just very disappointed that I was treated this way and I intend to take it further with senior management.
