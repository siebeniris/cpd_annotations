Location afordability convenience. Whilst the hotel is definitely old in need of refurbishment it was still clean comfortable a great option for an overnight stay close to KLC. The gym is large with all imaginable but old machines for a solid workout lovely large pool area breakfast spread more than sufficient. We stayed in the west wing which was a bit of a walk to breakfast gym and unusually no mini bar although menu option to order such items. It was a last minute booking upon changing our arrival into KL. Fikry on concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful in giving suggestions of places to go to navigate around town. Definitely suggest using nearby public transport as traffic is terrible all of the time it seems which is easy cheap.

Negatives On check in the navigator was not that helpful just handed over the key pretty much. No information about hotel was provided eg. Breakfast times facilities etc. We had access to the Club Lounge which we had to ask for. This should have been automatic as it was with our booking to begin with. We were not given any information about how to access club lounge service hours at lounge etc. Found out that food and drink only served from 530 730pm when it was too late on the first night. This was not explained to us at all and it would have been nice to know at check in time. This is crucial information you would have thought. Stayed in the east wing. Room pretty dated. I understand they are slowly renovated but they need work asap. Rooms really are not up to standard compared to other Renaissance properties. Pool area dated. There was a mouse in the garden on pool deck which gave us a bit of a frightPositives. Was able to get late check out which was great. Due to the lack of info above regarding the club lounge we were given access after check out at 4 pm as we had a late night flight. Breakfast was good. The buffet lunch was also great and good value. Fitness centre was also well equipped. We were given a honeymoon cake which was nice as we were celebrating our honeymoon in Malaysia. Hotel location is excellent.

My wife I were travelling to Malaysia for the first time and were naturally were excited about our stay at the hotel. On arrival check in seemed to be hurried and did not seem like the staff were trained in hospitality. Seemed like a business transaction rather than a welcome. My wife being in the hotel industry with a brand known for its hospitality in India this is the first thing she noticed. We were allocated a room on the 7th floor in the newly renovated west wing. The west wing and ballroom area were mostly empty throughout our stay and dimly lit. At night it seems you are entering an apartment complex rather than a hotel. It gets a bit lonely since you hardly see any staff in the common areas. The rooms are nice spacious. but I had still avoid staying here. The rooms we were put up in were roadside facing with the KL tower view were not sound proof. On the 2nd night I was awakened by police sirens motorcycles racing down the road. Not cool. On the 3rd night we woke up all sweaty since the electricity had tripped. The AC must have not been working for quite sometime. We called room service who switched the AC back on however after another 10 mins the electricity tripped again. We called again and again it was switched on. The point is if you just renovated your rooms issues like these should not happen. The maintenance guy was not able to find the root cause of the problem and suggested we ask for a room change. We were supposed to check out the following morning would it even be worth the hassle since we were already up. Another nights sleep lost. There are no bathrobes kept in the room. You need to call for them via room service. The ones that came were flimsy cotton ones not the ones you had usually see in other hotels. And honestly they smelled weird. The only good part of the hotel which other reviews also concur is the POOL. It is massive. Loved our time in the water and was refreshing in the KL heat. The breakfast at Temptations is average nothing to write rave reviews about. Indian food is limited to mostly south Indian. On one day there was something which looked like chole chick peas. did not try it though. Their sambhar was weird looking and tasting as well. Western local options are plenty for non vegetarians we stuck with eggs pancakes. The in room dining options felt limited. We called for spaghetti which had the noodles sitting in a bowl of oil olive oil I guess. No taste to the food at all. I added a whole bottle of ketchup to make it consumable. I am not sure if this is a Malaysian thing but if you are ordering pizza or pasta is not oregano andor chili flakes sauce supposed to be served along or at least be available. There was no oregano available in the hotel we had to call for chili sauce every time. Whatever we ate in the hotel did not feel up to the mark and was tasteless we ended up ordering from Grab for most of our meals. I smoke intermittently when traveling and hence do not carry a lighter. Asked the guy cleaning the rooms for a matchbox did not have one he asked me to make do with a used one with 3 4 matches inside and I will keep one in your room when I clean it. did not happen. Asked at the east wing reception they did not have one either. I mean common. I had taken taken a spa package so a 50 minute massage session was included at the Mandara Spa. The spa is located near the east wing end of the pool and you take a staircase down to what looks like the basement or the ground floor. could not figure out since except the door the spa has no windows for natural light to come in. The massage was ok but at least the staff were friendly you could have a conversation with. They lent us their bathrobes the good ones to go back to our rooms in and asked them to be returned. I readily agreed. To conclude at this price point averaging 50 RM night the level of service and hospitality in the hotel leaves much to be desired. I was contemplating between Sofitel Damansara Hotel Stripes Renaissance KL. This turned out to be a wrong choice.

We noticed that the 24hr gym was a little unsecure as people could just come in from our experience.
