Entering the parking garage from the street side is very confusing signs are hidden so do not be surprised to either go around 2 3 times or make a sharp turn. Leaving is confusing since many exits are closed thus making it seem like a maze. Elevators have broken buttons and no air conditioning so hold your breath since it can stink pretty bad in there. In our case we came as a party of 5 with plenty of luggage. Unfortunately the parking garage elevator DOES NOT take you directly to the reception desk from the parking garage. You have to drag your luggage around the corner enter the hotel and then to the reception desk. So be careful lugging your stuff late at night since you are out in the open. Next thing the reception desk staff. There were 4 female workers there. One I made direct eye contact to. You would think she would smile and tell me that I could come up. Instead she just plain ignored me. Just stood next to her co worker and talked about her day. Not professional. The manager was the one that check us in since he must have realized he had an incompetent employee. Oh we stopped the the gift store. While we were shopping around for souvenirs my children and I started hearing someone belching outloud and farting. Mind you my children thought this was hilarious but I did not since this persons farts was lingering in this stuffy store. Came to find out it was the Asian guy employee blowing up his man holes. Ugh The good thing about this place is the housekeeping services. The ladies were very friendly and provided us items that we needed during our stay. The room was decent but I am concern about future visitors because the wall that separates the room and bath tub looks like it is about to bow out. Oh and the added bonus is the bar across the street blasting their music until 2 am. For me and my children it was white noise but for the rest of my family there were plenty of dark under eye circles.

This is my first Trip Advisor ReviewMy daughter and I recently stayed here at the Hyat and it started off horrible then thanks to one of the managers it turned out great. It was raining our Uber could not find the hotel and when he circled around it three times there was no front drive. I was so shocked because I was not informed when I booked my reservation over the phone with Hyat Gold Passport. I called the hotel around 1230am to ask how the heck do we get dropped off and a nice and professional lady picked up the phone I will always remember her name because it was so unique. Autumn Nurse later I saw on her name tag. She was so sweet on the phone and listened to me trying to give the Uber driver directions and she probably could tell I was getting frustrated. I explained how I had no idea about the renovations and so on. She apologized so sincere I could tell she really cared. As she heard me and my daughter yelling at the Uber she simply said May I speak to your Uber driver I was fine with that. In less than 5 mins were pulling up on the only drop off side in front of the hotel. Autumn gave the Uber driver the directions and pulled up. I was back on the phone with her while were getting our stuff together in the car. I was asking her so many questions as we were pulling up about parking and how to walk up the sidewalk assistance with luggage. She was so patient with me and answering all my questions without any annoyance in her voice. She then said Can I place you on a brief hold Almost 2 mins later I see her walk from the hotel to the side of the street waving and walking towards our Uber car. She announces her name and that she wanted to come out here herself and help us. Mind you it was hot and rainy and she came out to help. She introduced herself to me and my daughter and shook our hands so professional. She then took our luggage out the car and started to help us take it in the hotel. She was apologizing for the inconvenience that this was and not being informed ahead of time. She explained how it was on the website but she Without even asking she compensated us and I was so surprised. I usually am the one that asks what are you going to do to fix this and she did not even have to make me say it. She was so empathetic and understanding of our situation. She even had our keys ready for us and without even going to the desk. Amazing after a 4 hour flight from Puerto Rico I just wanted to crash. She explained the hotel and amenities as she walked us up to our room. The room was amazing it was not a new room which I hope comes soon. but it was so spacious for me and my daughter I loved it. Autumn really made my first bad experience turn into a great one. She is a great manager and Hyat is so lucky to have her. The Daily Grill was good but not that many options. Mortons is always good but this one did not have certain things that I like from other locations. There is no lobby so you can not sit and wait for guests. The location is great and the staff is great too. It is a pain to be in a hotel going through renovations but it was time and it needed to be done.
