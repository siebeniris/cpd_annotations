IT HAS EVERYTHING to help relax you. Plus the staff caters to you. Everybody was super nice and friendly especially Mrs Gloria. My husband means the world to me and while we were at the gazebo Mrs Gloria walked all the way there to us and brought us wine which made his b day celebration extra special. I thought that was so nice of her to help make it more romantic. Also Mrs Gloria kept checking on me while my husband got his massage. I had a problem with getting coffee out the coffee maker but Mrs Gloria helped me with that and she talked with me to assure I was comfortable. Mrs Gloria made my experience memorable. This was my first time going to a Spa. Everything was super clean to my standards and the lunch really is what it saysGourmet. The grill cheese is the best. I love this place.

Me and 3 girlfriends recently returned from Chateau Elan for my 50th birthday celebration my husband treated us to and it was absolutely WONDERFUL. The grounds are very well kept and immaculate from the moment you pull onto the property. Our mouths dropped at how beautiful and elegant the property is. Each and every employee we encountered were extremely courteous warm and professional. We were there with the Girls Want to have wine package which includes accommodations at either the inn or the vilaswe got a villa spa services wine tasting and lunch. We were pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded from a two bedroom villa to a three bedroom villa. Thank you again Chateau Elan. The villa was spacious clean and very well appointed. It was a 3 bedroom 3 bath which accommodated the 4 of us quite nicely. It also includes a full kitchen which was stocked with basic items dinnerware flatware pots pans coffee maker and even have a washer and dryer. Our first night we ate at Versailles for the buffet dinner. The food was good especially the prime rib. Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing. We then did our wine tasting immediately after dinner. We tried 8 different wines. The young guy who served us gave us ample servings so needless to say we were feeling great. The next day we had our spa services. 2 of us had facials and 2 had massages. They were all 80 minutes services and blissfully wonderful. The facial I had actually gives me the best of both worlds with foot hand head and shoulder massage along with facial services. You are allowed full use of the spa with any service so we took advantage of steam room sauna and a fresh shower. After the spa we had lunch at marc. This was included in our package. Although they have a very small and limited menu the food was ok. 2 of us had the fried chicken and our only complaint was the skin was a little salty but once you pull the skin off the meat was really good. Chateau Elan is a very relaxing getaway and they really cater to their guest. There were other amenities on the property that we did not partake in golf pool and we were too drunk to go listen to the live music. but it truly served and lived up to its purpose for my girls getaway weekend.

For starters it is pretty obvious at this point reading through the reviews that Chateau Elan may have some of its employees or paid actors on their reviews. Since when did customers start giving 5 star raving reviews at the expense of another guest unfortunate and dreadful hotel room attack. Bias Much. My husband and I stayed at the Chateau the weekend of presidents day. we have heard of the nice landscaping and wine tastings that takes place at this resort and figured we would ride two hours down and enjoy a day of relaxation. Upon arriving we quickly observed the chautea was a bit dated and had a very minute luxury aura. The desk clerks were not the most welcoming. There were two young ladies both seeming in a daze and gave a lovely 5 second eye glaze several times before asking if I needed to be checked in. I guess they were waiting each other to take the lead. Nonetheless we received our keys and was escorted to our room. Later that evening we decided to have dinner in the Versailles Diner. MIght I add that this reference is an insult to the lovely Chauteau Versailles located in Paris France. Realizing that there were no other guest at the diner at the time we were quite disapointed to have waited almost five minutes before being seated. As we make our request for our appetizers and water the waitress quickly scadadales off and away without finalizing our request. Where was she off to in such a hurry on such a slow day. my husband asked. A few moments later as we are attempting to enjoy our meal we notice three young ladies had come down and was seated not too far from where we were sitting. Throughout the evening we could hear the young ladies generously place their orders and advise to their waiter that they were having some issues with their meals. Being that we were fairly close to this group we could hear the mumbles and snicketing from the waiters and hostess as they made condescending remarks about the simple request from the young ladies. I have worked in hospitality for over 42 years and started a family catering business 15 years ago we find it to be no less than an honor to make sure our patrons are happy with their meals and experience even if it means correcting it multiple times. I was highly disgusted to have witness such unprofesionalism from the diners staff members that night. Shortly the next day we learned of disturbance that took place overnight regarding a drunken woman who repeatedly beat bang and yell cantankerously at her hotel neighbors even attempting to bombard her way into their room. My husband and I also quickly learned that the victims were the same group of young ladies we overheard the waitress being incosiderably rude too as well. Shame on this chautea for the way they handled these young ladies and I certainly hope no one has to experience such low class treatment especially from such a basic hotel. This place is far from a luxury resort unles you are from the small town of Braselton and rarely get to travel.", "offset": [1642, 1804], "date": "2019-02-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "2bc4617e-69da-4b4b-ba8a-c3d611f5ffee", "sentence": "Very relaxing and a wonderful time with my daughters.
