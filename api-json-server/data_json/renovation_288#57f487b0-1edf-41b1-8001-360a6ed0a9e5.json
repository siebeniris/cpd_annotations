Stayed at the Lowes Madison Hotel for a long weekend vacation trip through our nations capital. The hotel is located a few blocks north of the White House and close to some of the popular public spaces such as Farragut Square which hosts a variety of activities and food trucks throughout the week. The hotel is quite a hike to the museums of the national mall however so factor that in if there is someone in your group with mobility issues or you can not walk very long distances. You many need to rely on public transit or taxis to get around but those are easily hailed and the friendly concierge staff will assist. Parking is 50 a night. While pricey it is worth sparing you a big headache trying to line up alternate arrangements for your vehicle. This is a very urban core and parking is difficult. The trade off of the distance is that there are more stores and restaurants in the area. This was booked as a Secret Hotel deal and while it was definitely worth the great rate we paid I disagree with it is being billed as 45ish star accommodations. Though refurbished and adorned with such amenities as Revolutionary War wallpaper there was some wear and tear in the room such as cabinet doors stuck shut HVAC vent screens falling off and housekeeping did not replace additional towels and soaps lotions etcnothing a deal breaker but little details overlooked. I would stay there again and found the hotel staff friendly and the room comfortable.", "offset": [1097, 1408], "date": "2015-03-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "584fad5f-03fc-4a88-ab42-24981b07661b", "sentence": "Loews Madison Is Rather Mediocre. We travel to DC every year for a Mom Getaway and we typically stay at the Willard Intercontinental. We could not stay there this year and since I had a great experience at a Loews in Atlanta my friend and I decided to give the DC Loews Madison a try. Our stay overall was mediocre. Due to this hotels caliber and price point it deserves only three stars for failing to live up to the expectations of its status as a luxury hotel. PROS. 1. Location is within comfortable walking distance to the White House and other sites. 2. Some of the staff is pleasant and very helpful a notable exception was the woman who checked us in she exuded pomposity. 3. Great concierge service4. Rooms have been renovated 5. Comfy pillows and fluffy white comforters that make up for the less than awesome matresesCONS. 1. NOISE NOISE NOISE. The hotel is pretty well insulated so there is not terrible noise between rooms only the typical toilet flushing and shower water. However the noise from the street is unbelievably loud. We had difficulty sleeping during two nights of our stay. Travelers looking for a quiet respite from a busy day of sightseeing will not find that here. 2. No views. Our windows allowed us to stare at the brick building next door. You will not get a gorgeous view of the city or monuments from this location3. Marginal housekeeping 1 DUST. Upon our arrival we went to adjust the wooden blind on our window. Much to our horror it came crashing down. On a positive note the staff was outstanding in handling this and helping us. They moved us to another room and gave us a restaurant credit. On a bummer note there was a thick layer of dust covering the blinds in both rooms. The dust was also all over our new room even the lamp on our bedside table needed a good cleaning. 2. Our drinking glasses were not changed out during our three night stay. We left them on the edge of our dresser hoping that housekeeping would leave clean ones and upon our return each day the same dirty glasses were still there. We did not receive refills on our toiletries. To be honest the toiletries were not high quality so we did not use all of them. However we never received new pieces of soap etc. We left tips so we found all of this disapointing3. The room renovations in an attempt to marry modern trends with a historical presence resulted in drab rooms that are dreary. The halls are very dark4. At times the hallways smell like a campfire we were in room 73 so it the smoke travels up several floors. The hotel restaurant Rural Society uses an open flame for cooking and has stacks of wood along the walls. There was a moment when we thought we had have to get out some marshmallows and make some smores5. No high definition televisions. This makes the picture distorted. 6. No automatic in room coffee makers. Do we really have to REQUEST one or a voucher at the rates we are paying. This is disappointing. 7. Lack of attention to detail in terms of maintenance. Our tub was chipped and the wooden molding behind our bathroom door was chipped. With the recent renovations this is unfortunate. 8. No newspaper delivered to your door. If you prefer that rather than an ap you are out of luck. 9. Problems with staffing the restaurant bar was open but the quieter bar on the other side of the lobby was not. The bartender in there told us that they lost the key and could not get the liquor cage open. For real. SOME TIPS 1. If you stay here and are looking for a less touristy neighborhood vibe turn right when you leave the hotel and travel to Logan Circle. There is a wonderful gelato shop there Pitango. There is also a Swetgren which offers fast organic meals. We went into the neighborhood Whole Foods one night and bought a bottle of wine. This area is only about a ten minute walk from the hotel. 2. If you want a quick breakfast outside the hotel travel to Corner Bakery on 14th street. The food is really fresh and the manager Teddy keeps it clean. it is a much better option than the nearby Starbucks. 3. If you want to travel around town without using Uber or cabs the whole time the McPherson Sq Metro Station is only about a ten minute walk I Street. We took a quick day trip to Alexandria via the blue line and this made it highly convenient.", "offset": [2943, 2995], "date": "2015-05-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "a9b328fb-a148-4244-ab09-50cb5563bd59", "sentence": "Will Never Stay Here Again. To be fair this hotel was selected for a group I was traveling with so I did not pick this hotel to stay at. However I still had to pay for it and found it terribly overpriced. There were four adults crammed into a deluxe 2 queen bedroom that was so small and had little in it except for a desk and the beds. There are no free amenities to be found in this hotel the rooms do not even have coffee makers. The beds are hard and room service takes forever. I just wanted some hot water to make tea and it took an hour for them to deliver it. Some of the rooms are much more dated than others. Part of our group was in a different room for the same rate but it was much bigger and had an updated bathroom. Loews Madison also limits rooms to only connecting three devices to the Wi Fi for free. If you have four or more devices be ready to pay 1395 per day. Halfway through our stay there was a labor dispute with the union so everything was operating under reduced hours and there was no housekeeping.

Stayed at the Madison last week of February. Location is decent on 15th and M. Neighborhood is walkable and office oriented like much of DC. Hotel itself recently converted to Hilton from I think Loews. Our room was basic. Just the normal King with street view a little loud. More importantly it lacked what have come to be expected accompaniments. For example no coffee maker. Who does not have coffee in the room these days. Was told I could request one from housekeeping. Maybe but learned that after buying a 20 room service pot. Thermostat kept room comfortably cool at night but we had to raise it to 77 to make the room comfortable during the day in late February. Service did not blow me away either. For example when we sought to adjust our reservation shortening it a bit well within the time frame for making an adjustment or even cancelling it was kind of a hassle. We were told we needed special approval and that we might be charged. In the end they did approve and we were not charged but this was something that should have been possible just calling the Hilton call center let alone calling the hotel directly. We almost cancelled on them which we could have just for the way they handled it. Truthfully I think there may be rooms that have been remodeled based on other peoples reviews.

We had lounge access as Diamond members. The lounge is open on weekends and there were hot hors doeuvres even on a Saturday evening though no alcohol other than a wine machine that required purchasing a card at the reception desk to use. Diamon members also have a choice of a nice buffet in the market in the morning or the lounge breakfast which included eggs and sausage.

The hotel has been recently renovated and it is lovely and has a comfortable lobby adjoining a fully stocked bar. The location was excellent and within walking distance of many major DC attractions. The room was very well appointed with a very large flat screen tv plenty of drawers and closet space a comfortable chair for reading or resting and a good work station for the business traveler. The beds were very very comfortable and had good linens and pillows. The bathroom was well lit although it could have been even better with a shaving make up mirror had an excellent shower with the best water pressure I have experienced in the District nice products from Crabtre and Evelyn and large bath towels. There is also a well stocked mini bar which the family did not avail itself of as the prices not surprisingly were ridiculous. there is a CVS a couple of blocks away where you can purchase practically all of the same items for a mere fraction of the price. The staff was lovely and helpful with one exception which I shal discuss below. The front desk assistant manager was arrogant and dismissive. We seriously considered never staying at the hotel again because of his unprofesionalism. But everyone else at the hotel from the chambermaids to the wait staff the bartenders and the bellmen were so lovely so polite and so helpful we were persuaded to look past the assistant managers behavior and do plan to stay at the hotel again. Also the price of the breakfast buffet is too steep about 250 a person per day and while it is an all you can eat affair most people especially women and children do not eat 250 worth of food for breakfast. There is a cheaper package option for about 180 plus tax but you must purchase the buffet for every day you stay at the hotel even if you do not plan to use the buffet every day. I would recommend the hotel institute a continental breakfast option for less money. However in fairness there is a fully stocked Starbucks on site with a grocery and that is where we purchased the equivalent of a continental breakfast for the mornings we ate at the hotel. The hotel is also pet friendly for those with dogs.", "offset": [64, 177], "date": "2020-03-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}]}
