Last minute business trip. Would not consider them again. On check in while waiting in line all I heard from 2 or 3 dif front desk staff was no no no that s our policy. Same poor attitude with me. Told them I was tired appreciated anything they could do to get me a comfortable quiet room. The girl looked at me like I was from Mars and should be happy she was willing to talk to me or give me ANY room. Room was a shoebox. Tiny little sink that was built into the wall between the tiny shower no bath behind a sliding glass door. Opposite side of same wall was a sliding glass door that covered toilet which was in a separate area. To use the sink shower or toilet you had to move sliding door so that it then covered the room entry door or one of the amenities. Headboard was made from molded plastic that had lights inside it. it was about 2 thick and very odd. Tiny little couch that was below the window that had a beautiful view of the 3rd floor of the parking structure was of the same odd molded plastic. Closet was single rack from the wall unenclosed next to the plastic couch. TV was mounted on the wall 90 degrees left of the way you face in bed. Room was super tiny. I am sure the bright yellow 1960s tile in shower and toilet and the whole molded plastic thing was part of a 60s or retro look they are going for but it was lost on this guy and I wo nt be back.

I do have to admit this is my third review of the SLS Las Vegas and I am going on my 5th stay. I literally have not stayed anywhere else since my boyfriends birthday last May. I am happy to say I am planning a 30th birthday party for him at the SLS for next month the 20th to 23rd. His birthday is May 22nd. I already mentioned her before in a previous review but I can not rave enough about Patricia the casino host. She is amazing and has gone through great lengths to help me and my party. It is a surprise party so it is stressful setting it up but she makes it so stress free for me. She set up two rooms for us for three nights and assured me she had help our guests as well with finding them rates. I honestly do not know what I would do with out her. She even set us up to check in VIP for our stay to skip the lines at checkin. She has been a pleasure to work with and helping me put in a cake order at the bakery and she will also be setting up our reservations at the Cleo my boyfriends favorite restaurant in Vegas once we have a guest totalThis review is not so much about the amazing hotel and accommodations but about the outstanding casino hosts and staff the represent the hotel. I called a couple times when Patricia was out and spoke to other casino hosts but although accommodating none seemed to go above and beyond like Patricia does. I am really grateful for the Asian guy at the Code desk that recommended me to her. I wish I remembered his name. Anyway if you visit the SLS and are a gambler specifically slots speak to Patricia and I promise you will not be disappointed.

I recently visited Las Vegas for my college graduation. This was my first time experiencing Vegas. My family flew in from different places on the US. We reserved 4 rooms total. I found SLS Las Vegas when booking my flight through Southwest. The room looked exceptionally well. The reviews were fairly good. I booked a room for the World Tower double bed which was a bigger room. Once I arrived to the hotel the systems were down for 15 minutes. I waited and never was acknowledged when the system was back up and running. The young lady at the front desk told me that I had a room at the Story tower with an one bedroom. I told her there must be confusion because I paid additional money for World tower and double beds. After telling her this she acted as if she was doing me a favor by giving me a double bed and told me that World Tower was booked up. I was irritated about this issue. She proceeded to offer me a new room in the World Tower the next day. I specifically asked her to put in notes so the next front desk employee will know. The next day I went to the front desk they did absolutely nothing to move me over to the bigger room. She said the only thing she could do was offer me a 50 voucher WHICH I ALREADY RECEIVED FOR BOOKING THERE. While the hotel looks extremely nice there is no structure within the company.

I recently stayed at the Sahara for the first time for a business trip. My room was on the end of hallway and quiet. I liked using my room key to work the elevator. I also liked that my elevator was close to the self parking garage. It was always an easy transition. Parking is free like it should be. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. I skipped daily cleaning and was given a few extra towels when I asked. The Fridge has a small freezer section big enough for an ice pack. Ice is available on another floor. You need the upgrade to get coffee in the room so I went with cold coffee in a bottle. The pools all three were closed for renovation. As a swimmer this could have been killer but I was busy with other things. It was my fault for not clearing the situation ahead of time. I expect the finished product will be nice. What set the Sahara apart for me was the customer service. My business partner and I needed some immediate help having missed the closure of the FedEx Ship Center. it is an unmanned center I believe. We had urgent correspondence that needed to go out tonight. it is our fault that we waited. Symone was not only friendly but helpful. She showed a great deal of patience as she cheerfully helped us with scanning and transmitting a document. I loved that we chatted while she was willing to repeat the process or try again or whatever was necessary. I actually had a very stressful day waiting to hear from my godson who lives in Nashville because of the tornados. I do n\u2019t need to share details. Having to get this correspondence out tonight could have been another real stressor. I credit Symone with me helping to finish the day well. I did not mention my personal issues but I do not think it would have mattered. I expect she is the same with everyone. She is effervescent and would be a credit to ANY customer service team. So in the end it was a good stay. I heard from my godson and got an important document to its destination.
