Absolute perfect trip once again. Ritz Carlton South beach is one of the best luxury hotels in Miami and with the added bonus of their club floor this trip was magnificent. The club floor access requires an extra cost however it provides complimentary beverages breakfast lunch appetizers which can be enough for dinner in some cases and a chocolate dessert after 8 pm. It has a view of the ocean and is a great addition to the hotel. Inside the club there are a few staff which make it great. Sean was extraordinarily pleasant throughout our stay and knew exactly how to interact with the guests providing individualized service. Clemence was also very nice and provided some advice for a future trip to France. The staff is the creme de la creme and your stay on the club floor will be a memorable one. In terms of the rest of the hotel there is a beautiful pool with a view of the beach ocean a workout facility and several restaurants. A re commendation if you are thinking of eating a late dinner at the hotel order room service to the hi top tables at the end of the pool. Vivian at Bistro One made this experience possible and it was fantastic. By night time the pool area is empty and with few people on the boardwalk it is a private dinner with a view of the ocean. A women from room service brought our dinner and was extremely nice. She ran back into the hotel to find us a candle and a jug of water and then proceeded to sing happy birthday it was not a birthday but she sings it for the guests and was keen to show us in a beautiful voice. The pool also has access to the beach and the boardwalk. On the beach there are chairs and umbrellas with one umbrella included in the resort fee. The staff at the pool are very friendly providing jugs of water and food when ordered. Boras the manager was particularly nice. All in all a magnificent trip. I would advise to stay on the club floor. If you have a family that eats it is worthwhile as you do not have to go out for meals and the drinks are complimentary. Furthermore the breakfast in the hotel if you go can be quite expensive 36USD Bkfst. Buffet. so the club floor is nice to have.

The hotel is gorgeous. Soothing colors comfy furnishings and beautiful lighting. It even smells wonderful when you walk through the door. The hotel is in the perfect South Beach location close to Lincoln Drive and Ocean Ave. This is a great place to stay and we chose it this past week for our family vacation to Miami. This is our second stay at this property and we booked two rooms for our family. Normally I love our stays at Ritz Carlton Hotels and my husband is a Ritz Carlton Black Card Member with gold level status. But something was seriously lacking in the service and accommodations this time at this hotel. do not get me wrong the staff said and did everything they are suppose to say and do from a customer service perspective but they never could actually deliver. Upon checking in we were unhappy with one of the two rooms we booked for five nights. The hotel was at 95 capacity so I get that the pickings were slim but they offered us three different rooms all with pretty much the same issue views of air conditioning units on rooftops. We took a room on the tenth floor and yes it was a large nice room but the view was one of the ugliest views we have ever had in a hotel anywhere. It was not quiet as the staff at the front desk suggested it would be and we heard the units running our entire 5 night stay. This coupled with the major construction project taking place outside our window and some very loud party loving neighbors really made our stay in the room uncomfortable. Also at the pool I had like to know who the couple was who received the choicest spot at the pool held for them the entire five days we were there even though they had show up past mid day. it was always set up for the very special couple first thing in the morning. I would get up early to get a nice spot at the pool tip each day for the chairs and umbrella that were included in the resort fee and yet our umbrella disappeared several times over the course of our stay when we had walk down to the beach. Bottom line is we were on vacation and really got tired of fighting for stuff. I find it very unfair when others are treated with priority because they are what special in some way. I get you can pay for the ocean views the club level and spa treatments but is not the pool first come first serve. Additionally with the black card you are entitled to a room upgrade.

This hotel is in a good spot on Miami Beach and is an easy walk to anywhere you might want to go. The hotel is also lovely inside and has a nice albeit busy pool area. The concierge made fantastic suggestions every time we asked. However in many respects the service is appalling. A few examples1. You are given a voucher for a free cocktail when you check in. We went to the bar to claim this and found that the my husband was allergic to one of the ingredients of the free cocktail of the day. Instead of offering to adapt it or give him a different one they made him pay full price for an alternative. Obviously if you are staying at a Ritz Carlton you can afford to pay for a cocktail but it is not really the point it is just poor service. 2. We headed to the beach found the guys who were setting up in the Ritz Carlton beach area and got four loungers and umbrellas for myself my husband and my two teenage children. Tipped the guy who set it up for us. Five minutes later he returned and said that as there were four of us we needed to pay the hotel only allows two loungers and one umbrella per room even though we had a four person family room. I was very unhappy about this we should have been told before we got set up and before we tipped him. so we left the beach and vowed not to stay at the hotel again. I can understand this at busy times possibly but to charge your paying guests a not inconsiderable amount to use a pool umbrella when they are all lying on the beach unused and the loungers are all empty is just rude and unnecessary. Had we been told before we were fully set up it might have been different too but to set us up and then return and tell us is just terrible service and frankly rude. 3. The beach cafe I have forgotten the name was never open at the times it should be no idea why except once they said rain was predicted. It did not rain but it was still closed. 4. Service at the pool was very patchy. One day I forgot my purse and my husband was five minutes behind me so I could not tip immediately when we first arrived at the pool. What a difference that made. We did not get offered drinks the servers ignored us and just handed us towels to set ourselves up. I understand tipping culture but in a Ritz Carlton the service should be good anyway even if you forget your purse for ten minutes. As an aside the loungers are very packed in around the pool. Obviously this is Miami so that is pretty standard but it is something to keep in mind if you prefer a quieter more exclusive feeling.", "offset": [1577, 1742], "date": "2018-03-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "1ab81a4b-ed2f-407c-8a5b-087161cafe3f", "sentence": "I am not a person that writes poor reviews but I feel like I have to. Being a business owner myself I know how damaging bad reviews can be. I have also been a loyal Ritz customer for the better part of 20 years so writing them a bad review really pains me. My wife and I stayed at the Ritz in South Beach over the Valentines weekend. Being that we live in Florida it was a short drive away from the Kids just to enjoy ourselves without parenting duties for a couple of days. From the moment we arrived we were surprised by the lack of good customer service that we have grown to expect from the Ritz Hotels that we have enjoyed over the years. Being a Titanium rewards member we get an upgrade upon check in. That did not happen. When we got to our room the adjoining door to the next room was unlocked. After trying to lock it unsuccessfully. We called down to the front desk. We did not want to leave the room without the door being locked. After a second call and a lengthy wait maintenance came up and fixed the door. We then went down to the pool to relax and have a drink. We waited almost a half an hour to be waited on. I will say Richard at the pool was extremely nice. That night we had dinner in the restaurant. The service was extremely poor and the food was just mediocre. When paying Ritz prices you expect a lot more. After signing the check and leaving to look for the gift shop to buy tanning oil for the next day our waitress Su came running down the stairs after us to inform me that I had not put the room number on the check. We then asked Su to point us in the direction of the gift shop. She led us on a wild goose chase up stairs down the hall and so on. When we could not find it we went back to the front desk only to be informed that the hotel does not have a gift shop. The following day we went down to the beach to enjoy the day. Upon arriving and trying to secure a few chairs the staff pointed out that they had beds available. We thought they were complimentary for hotel guests but they were not. They let us know they were 200 per day but being a guest they would charge us 150. After saying no they dropped it to 125. I can not say I have ever negotiated before at any Ritz I have ever stayed at. After a half hour it started to rain and continued throughout the day. We were charged for the Bed anyway. My wife has reached out to the Manager several times to alert them of our experience and to this day none of her calls have been returned. She has also reached out to the corporate office to be told a manager would get back to her within 48 hours. That never happened. In summary I would not recommend this particular Ritz Carlton.", "offset": [1223, 1285], "date": "2020-02-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
