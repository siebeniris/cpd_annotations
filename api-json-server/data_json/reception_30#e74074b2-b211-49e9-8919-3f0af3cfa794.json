Furthermore the staff has us great adivced how to reach all our request sightseeing spots in singapore. We have been quite positive suprised from the design of the lobby and the lunch room which is furnitured in a cool looking retro styleloved it. The rooms are separated in different colours themes which are align to the interior concept. When we have checked out at 1 am the staff has prepared a tasty lunch box for us which we directly eat in the lobby.

Wanderlust is a unique quirky very clean hotel staffed by incredibly helpful employees. That being said we probably would n\u2019t book a pantone room again any time soon. Whilst I can not vouch for all rooms the green pantone room certainly was an experience. You quickly get over the overt colour of the rooms dismissing it as eccentric and fun however this hotel is a relationship make or breaker for new couples given the toilet is practically on the bed. There is no room for being shy unles you send your partner roommate from the room every time you need to use the lavatory. Two people sharing a bed set into the tiles imagine a spa bath with a mattress in it where one person is required to do an awkward climb over to exit is also not the best arrangement for adults. The green pantone room had the added benefit of being spa adjacent. Whilst the spa was terrific the blaring music that randomly pumped out of the speakers until closing time was not. Same goes for the other hotel guests who defied the spa opening hours and sat talking outside of the room windows.

Perhaps the best available room is then not the one directly across it. Walls are very thin as well so you will hear the room next door having sex.
