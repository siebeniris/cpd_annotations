The rooms were very comfortable spacious and furnished with beds so comfortable that we came home to buy the same mattresses for our house. Paddys Irish Pub became a popular gathering place for wedding guests since the food was above average and the service was excellent. We were well taken care of throughout our visit to Chateau Elan. My brother the avid golfer played a round and was quite impressed with the condition of the golf course and its playability. Some of us had a breakfast at the Golf Grille and found it very well prepared and once again we were given first class service. The venue for the wedding was actually in the vineyard and we were fortunate to have great weather. The reception was in the Barrel Room downstairs in the winery. It turned out to be a great wedding and reception and a good time was had by all. I suppose our only disappointment was the wine. it is actually not very good utterly devoid of character. But then we live in Napa Valley and are quite spoiled with a regular menu of the best wines in the world. so not really a fair comparison.", "offset": [847, 928], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2ac0d2d2-3008-4f3c-942c-5ae8120b211d", "sentence": "New Years Gala.

It was our first visit to this winery. Four ladies out on the town for an afternoon well spent. The grounds are so pretty but it was inside the winery itself that we found most enjoyable. The place is very pretty and inviting. What a wonderful place to hold a special event. We took a tour of the facility that was guided by Julie. She was so informative. One of my friends had been on 6 winery tours and said this was the best by far. She is quite knowledgeable. Afterwards we thoroughly enjoyed a wine tasting session. Emily was our hostess. We had fun conversations with her as well as other customers at the sitting. How fun it was to meet others from all over. The wine was delicious. Each of us had a different favorite. Mine was the moscato. A day very well spent.

I recommend this for a nice introduction to the Chateau without getting locked into too many prepaid items. You can always add different amenities after arriving. You get one night at the Inn 2 meals dinner and breakfast and a bottle of wine delivered to your room. You can choose your price based on what type of room you want. I also added a wine tasting for 2 which was excellent. You get to taste 8 wines and you will have a lot to drink. you will want to order some food to go along with it. It was a very quiet weeknight for my stay it would be interesting to see what it looks like when they are busy. The food at the Inn impressed us exceeded our expectations. Overall this will not likely be the nicest poshest hotel you have ever been to BUT. the people that work at the Inn and the winery were by far the nicest most polite and professional people I have ever encountered at any overnight accommodation. That was certain. There is a lot to explore I wish I could speak on the golf course or the spa or the other dining rooms or the other overnight options. but I had a brief visit.

We were excited to experience wine cou try right here in GA. Be sure to ask for all the details when booking and confirm the rate. We had a issue with our rate that had to be escalated. The wine free wine tour is pretty breif but interesting. But the wine tasting was pretty awesome. You have a choice between the premium and the standard with tastings of about 7 different wines. If you register you will get a complimentary 8th pour. The attendant at the tasting who checked us out was less than helpful but the barkeeps were all amazing. Making recommendations an also being very attentive. The rooms were ok. I was rather disappointed in the sheets tissue etc. I expected a bit more posh amentities not the single ply tissue you get in public restrooms. also be mindful that there is currently construction happening at the inn so mind their dust. Next we had the bufe. it was ok nothing to rave about. Again nothing i expected for a wine resort. There was a carving and dessert station which made it a little better. aimilar to breakfast. Same buffet but an omelette and waffle station. The pool is awesome there s a bar they have activities daily jacuzi and two firepits.
