The reviews were pretty good so I was expecting way more during my stay. For starters upon check in I was told all rooms have connecting doors because the property used to be a hospital and they had patient and family rooms connecting. I guess you can not do much about the building history but to be told this when checking just set an odd vibe for the stay. Plus i was coming from a hospital and this was the last thing I ever wanted to hear at the point of check in. The room was ok. Nothing special. Bed was ok. Decor was nice and looked like a recent renovation but it still needed some updating. The desk chair was ripped and my TV did not work. After spending an hour with Angelo great guy by the way who handles maintenance it was finally working after he had to replace the TV. So after checking in and sitting for an hour I was finally able to go about my day. When I returned in the evening I was kept up until 3 am with 20 somethings partying in the room next door. They were not even that loud but the walls must have been paper thin. The staff is friendly and do their best. I just feel the hotel itself just has an odd feeling about it. I walked over to the Hilton down the street and it looked very nice. I was not aware of their pricing though. I will say if priced the same i would check out hilton next time.", "offset": [301, 424], "date": "2015-05-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "1b54e05f-7352-4f4c-bdc7-98ad78e9e0d5", "sentence": "great staff great place great view.

I also have mixed feelings about this hotel as previous posters do too. The bed was comfy room was small but fine and we did not have highway noise but we were on floor 14 and not facing the city. It is close to the airport which is nice not a long drive at all. it is a quick cab ride to the city but nothing close to walk to. The bartender at the restaurant is really good Christopher I think. We liked him a lot. The nachos were delicious the dessert eh. What we did not like about the hotel was the paper thin walls. We had neighbors partying and screaming all night. After a few calls downstairs at 2 and 3 am they finally seemed to stop here we were trying to get sleep after having 5 kids including an infant. So that was a downer. They took off the cost of parking for what we went through but honestly the cost to self park almost 20 bucks per night seems high. Our movie option was not working on our TV so a nice electrician guy came up to fix it. The second he walked out though it stopped again. I finally got back there myself and fixed some wires and got it to work. The other thing that stinks is the location in terms of the highway you basically have to get on the highway just to turn around and go a block south. it is a bit wacky and some cabbies had issues with getting us in and out. I think we would try Magnolia next time we are in Dallas.", "offset": [998, 1047], "date": "2015-09-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "5baec88e-6d89-48df-8209-e23f037119b0", "sentence": "Nice Comfortable Business Hotel Off The Stemons Freeway.

Took a shuttle bus to this hotel because they did not have a hotel shuttle. Was 5 miles from the Love airport. Came for a conference. Room was not ready yet but the staff was very nice and even handed out bottles of free chilled water for us while standing in line at the front desk. Elevators were pre summoned and you had to enter the floor you are in before the elevators came. I got a small corner room on the 23rd floor but the view was fantastic. It even had a window in the bathroom. Dorm fridge and safe iron hairdryer were very visible. I could not find the coffee maker but finally discovered it under the sink. Well stocked towels and extra pillows. Bed was very clean and comfortable. Room service was either a food delivery or you can order and pick up your food from the first floor restaurant to avoid the 5 delivery charge. The house Burger was very tasty. Wifi was 1295 a day but our host conference paid for it. It was flaky at times but mostly quite speedy enough for me when it did connect. There was a premium wifi option which I declined. Nice hotel slightly dated great staff overall tried very hard to please. Evan at the front desk went out of his way to get me neosporin ointment for my foot wound when I could not find any at their small gift shop. Nothing in terms of stores or eateries that are in walking distance from this hotel. We were pretty much a captive audience for 3 days. It rained while we were there and we could hear the thunder storms over our meeting rooms. On the 23rd floor I could still hear some of the road traffic but could have slept well if it were not for the noisy next door occupant. I was awake until midnight. Walls are thin because I could hear every word through the double doors separating my room from the next door. They had ice lemon water all day and free news papers available every morning in the lobby I am satisfied with the room quality and of course the wonderful service but might choose a different hotel next time because of the location and lack of hotel shuttle service.", "offset": [1174, 1315], "date": "2016-09-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "b663e74e-2dd1-467e-8b82-e5b54625aeee", "sentence": "Two visits Two problems. My first visit was the Saturday before Memorial Day weekend. Even though they have a huge vacant parking lot next to the hotel which used to be free they now have a Conference Center and charge for parking in the garage and behind the garage. As a Gold Elite Mariot Rewards Member I was surprised to be charged 18 a night for parking. At the Dallas Mariot Suites Medical Market Center just up and across the freeway Gold Elite members are given complimentary parking. After coming back to the hotel after eating an early dinner I was surprised to find the gate to the parking area up. Cars were freely entering and going without paying the 18 charge. When I asked at the Front Desk the purpose of the gate being open they did not have an answer to my question. I later received a call later from the Rooms Operations Manager my room indicating that the gate was up because of a wedding that evening at the hotel. He said that my parking charge was going to be comped by the hotel however it took me complaining to the Front Desk to get that done. There were probably quite a few other guests who may not have seen the gate up and were still charged the 18 for parking. It seems as though the hotel values the people coming to its new Conference Center more than they value regular guests at the hotel which I find disconcerting. My second visit was in Mid September on a Mariot e certificate. I used the Mobile Check In to let the hotel know I would be arriving for an early check in at 120 noon. When my plans changed I updated that time to a 10 check in. I had also requested an upgrade being a Gold Elite Membership Rewards member. whenI checked in shortly after 10 I was told the room was not ready. I was given a voucher for a drink at the hotel bar. Even though the Front Desk person talked with someone in Housekeeping about cleaning the room I was never given an estimate of how long the wait would be for my room. After 90 minutes and some assistance from the Rooms Operations Manager John Mathew my room was finally available. If I decide to stay at this hotel again and my room is not available I will ask for a specific estimate on how long it will take until the room is ready. If I had known it would take over 90 minutes for my room to be ready I would have gone and had lunch somewhere and returned when I received word the room was ready. During this same visit there must have been some other event going on at the Conference Center. The main entrance to the hotel off the freeway feeder road was blocked. Traffic was re routed to another entrance. Parking was not allowed in the garage by some hired non hotel parking valets. Again this hotel seems to be more interested in people coming to its Conference Center than regular guests staying at the hotel.", "offset": [2381, 2476], "date": "2016-10-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "b8c97da8-8e49-4fcb-80a0-a8ce3e34219e", "sentence": "Location minutes away from downtown Dallas.

Natasha \u201c Manned the Desk \u201d. so they could come up. On Thursday night prior to my husband \u2019s early discharge because he was doing well Taylor arranged for me to move to a Handicap room again decreasing my stress anxiety. On Friday prior to my bringing him to the hotel Taylor made room adjustments so we could get a side table for next to the chair he would be spending time in reading while resting an additional desk chair to elevate his feet on Very important for Cardiac patients. She made it quite comfortable for the additional 3 days he would be staying and he REALLY appreciated it. On Saturday Taylor Valerie helped us to get to your pool area for some fresh air sunshine after his long hospital stay. We BOTH were very happy they arranged everything up there for his comfort including bringing us fresh cold waters. Your Food Beverage Supervisor Michael McCoy could n\u2019t have made our Room Service any more SPECIAL. He personally delivered our Breakfasts as requested the way MARIOT USED to DO ON a TABLECLOTH covered FOLDING TABLE with REAL DISHES UTENSILS NOT in a PAPERBAG your NEW WAY of doing things which we think is HORRIBLE.

Francis Michael McCoy delivered a GREAT morning meal with cheerful smiling faces which elevated our moods for the entire day taking our minds off our problems. There were even flowers on the table making us smile even more. Our trips to your Asador restaurant for dinner were very nice. The staff Niki our waitress made us comfortable the food was quite good. ALL STAFF was courteous friendly and helpful. That \u2019s WHY we have stayed loyal to Mariot for 27 years but the staff here were even more exceptional than usual. They genuinely seem to like their jobs their guests. We hope you will share these comments with all of them.
