The title speaks to itself. Mandarin Oriental Bangkok charges the price of exclusivity it is one of the most expensive hotels in Bangkok for a very overcrowded factory like and underwhelming experience. I even wonder if they do not overcharge normal customers while heavily discounting for groups as the overall dynamics was all by comfortable andor luxurious. It all started well though with the hotel reaching out by email to confirm arrival time at airport in order to arrange pickup. They forgot however to mention pickup was at airport exit number 5 and we ended up waiting 15mn at our exit gate number 9 until we decided to call the hotel and were informed we had to walk from our gate to the meeting point. It was very confusing as at the exit of our gates many pickup representatives we standing with name signs. Once at the hotel we were greeted by the hotel manager and an early check in 10 am was made available to us which was very nice. We had booked an executive suite with river view and ours was located on the 7th floor with stunning views from both the bedroom and the living room. However we were quick to realize that the room although kept in impeccable condition was aging and most of its equipments obsolete old technology no demotics old switches limited lights controls bad speakers old and non functioning cd player. In 2 words it must have been state of the art. 15 years ago. The hotel is facing Chao Phraya river has a swimming pool and a lap pool. However both are surrounded by the hotel \u2019s buildings and are lacking charm. Its has a gym and a spa but both are located on the other side of the river with a boat shuttle service provided to go there. It can take up to 1015mn to reach the gym from the hotel which is not at all convenient if you are limited in time as you need to add 30mn back and forth. The gym is well equipped but lacks charm and is also on the aging side. The biggest turndown was the heavy and loud crowd and the fact that the hotel hosts several functions weddings and corporate events. It is clearly running at the maximum of its capacity and as a guest it was very uncomfortable and upsetting. Breakfast for example was over crowded we could not enjoy a drink at the hotel bar on a Monday evening as it was fully occupied by a wedding attendants we had to wait 3 days for a spa appointments 10mn on the boat to be able to board. As the hotel spa was full we asked the hotel concierge for a spa recommendation nearby and were directed to a cheap unclean spa where they charged 2 times the prices of equivalent mid low range establishments in the city. A shameful recommendation. We managed on our 3rd day to try the Mandarin spa and it was up to its reputation great. Service is uneven ranging from amazing double turndown service to a total miss out. For example on a Monday our room was not cleaned until 530 pm although we turned off the do not disturb sign at 1230pm. The mixed feelings landed to only one conclusion not worth the spend. We were happy to pay the price of comfort and ended up in an overcrowded inconsistent and aging resort. We also as guests felt we were disturbing which was totally unacceptable no seats at the bar as they were reserved for wedding participants having to walk longer to the gymAs a corporate function was happening at the normal route was was closed having to wait 10mn on the boat to be able to reach the pier as a group was boarding a massive tourist boat. In summary. pay the high price of exclusivity to receive a decently exclusive treatment. The Sukhothai or the Siam are far better choices.
