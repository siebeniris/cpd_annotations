N A Usually i list the price but this was not my typical trip just tagging along for my girlfriends business trip. CALL BEFORE CHECK IN. GOODBYE ONE STAR right here 4 Seasons I had 2 hotels in shanghai for a 4 day period the Courtyard by Mariot Shanghai Jiading you can read my review. and this 4 Seasons i was not the person who reserved the rooms that was my girlfriend she was busy with work and had not checked in yet and would not until 7 pm that night being a seasoned traveler i knew there could be a problem SO i called the 4 Seasons and told them i would be checking in for my girlfriend who will not be present i had her reservation email passport and national ID card. they said \u00f6k no problem you can checkin for her and enter the room with those documentsi called twice and got that answer twice so upon arrival i went to the front desk and tried to check in they said i could not that meant i d have to wait for my girlfriend for 7 hours. I was eventually allowed check in after talking with them for a few moments but still i did my research and called and had proper documents this was highly annoying and shows poor training. ARRIVAL. CHECK IN the hotel was easy to find for my cabie and the area is very beautiful clean and affluent. check in as you can read above was less than ideal. slow and annoying although is was not the usual i ca nt mention how usual check in is. LOBBY. the lobby is immaculate which does not do the boring plain rooms and favors. there is a grand piano and lots of nice couches and shops they have a very unique money changer ATM it takes around 50 foreign currencies and converts them into fresh crisp Chinese RMB. Perhaps i m a hick but i thought that was pretty cool and new. Vaulted ceilings and long staircases THE ROOM upon taking the elevatorso nice they have like 12 of them. i entered the room and was like what. what am i looking at. it looks like your grandmas house i called the front desk and asked if this was the right romas my girlfriend who had stayed on previous visits raved about the niceness of it. they said it was the right room i sent my girlfriend a picture and asked she got very angry and called the hotel from her office they tried to downgrade us. GOODBYE THE OTHER STAR the worker came up to the room met me and took me to a proper room that her company had booked. My girlfriend was happy with the pics she saw i on the other hand was not When i m in a five star hotel i expect NOT JUST 5 star lobbies i do nt sleep in the lobby i sleep in the room the furniture looked like a holiday inn. the furniture was all mismatched had no theme again see my review of Courtyard by Mariot Shanghai Jiading that place was stylish but the location and no pool were less than ideal. although t i did not like the room i will mention what it contained the bed was soft and pillows good the closet was lit and spacious the TV was large and new the desk was old and ugly the chairs were a tad bit dirty and oldnot dirty but stained. the mini bar had glasses tea and coffee sachets. WIFI. the wifi was nice and fast free not they have premium for 20 i guess its even fasterTHE BATHROOM the bathroom was at least 4 5 star quality the toiletries were apparently girlfriend said so very high class and good the toilet paper goes down no problem separate shower and bathtub. RESTAURANTS. i did not try and pay restaurants the room included one free breakfastmy other shanghai hotel included 2 so that is another reason i did not like 4 Seasons. i had a quick breakfast i have a stupid habit of getting to airport way too early. the service was good the juice fresh the food godi did not eat enough to go into detail just fruit and one breadLOCATION the location seemed pretty central i was a bit sick so i did not get out much but there is a historic hutong Chinese villa. nearby and a nice outdoor mall food shop area. It was walking distance to my girlfriends office. POOL GYM the pool very nice dimly lita positive lots of lounge chairs towels on each table water dispenser hot tub. just one other couple in therecome on business people quit being so boring. there was a terrace by the pool we walked out there and the skyline was very beautiful we enjoyed that. The Gym was also satisfactory had clean towels and many types of drinks bottled water also water and juice dispenser genuinely pleased with the cleanliness and drinks equipment new and good enough for a hotel. CHECKOUT. I did not do the actual checkout but they did assist me getting a taxi and just like my other hotel talk with the driver and confirm which terminal of the airport i was going to. so like i said i stayed at 2 hotels in Shanghai one with very trendy rooms and no pool and boring location and one with boring ugly rooms good location and good pool. i would not recommend the 4 Seasons to anyone i believe there are hotels with better rooms and better price in the area.", "offset": [2415, 2639], "date": "2015-07-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "76bedd50-130c-4506-98a6-1a3d7909f53b", "sentence": "I had three separate check ins on this trip.

I recently got back from a three week trip to Asia and boy was it FANTASTIC. In three weeks I visited seven cities and stayed in six different hotels. The highlight BY FAR was the Four Seasons Hotel in Shanghai. Now this was my first time staying at a Four Seasons and I knew it would be nice but they just really truly blew me away. I can not say enough nice things about this place the absolute definition of being pampered. The view I had of Shanghai from my incredible newly remodeled room on the 27th floor AMAZING. I also arrived to find welcome chocolates and a hand written note welcoming me from their PR team. Talk about attention to detail I like being spoiled you all. In the four nights I stayed here I explored the hotel pretty well I enjoyed their incrdible breakfast buffet each morning that had both east and west food selections a fresh juice bar which I absolutely love and an omelette station where I just got the to make me scrambled eggs every morning. I also loved the little lounge bar restaurant downstairs on the first floor. I definitely drank too much red win here a couple nights but hey what are you gon na do. I had the pleasure of enjoying lunch at their incredible Chinese restaurant during my stay and WOW you all. The hairy crab dish. it blew me away. I am a food writer by profession so believe me when I say this was incredible and absolutely worth a visit. I also visited the Japanese restaurant while I was there because I just need sushi in my life at least a couple times a week and it did not disappoint. The concierge staff here was also PHENOMENAL. It was my first trip to Asia. I am a young lady traveling alone. Clark and Billy and the entire concierge staff made my trip SO much easier. I can not express how helpful accommodating and friendly they were. I did not want to leave the Four Seasons this was definitely my nice hotel of the trip. I would also like to mention I went over to Roof Top Bar at the Ritz Carlton one evening to visit Flair a popular bar they have on the 57th floor. Well it was closed so I went to the other bar they had on the 52nd floor. Disappointing but not the end of the world. The service here at the Ritz Carlton did not even begin to match that at the Four Seasons. My server disappeared for over 25 minutes not acceptable for a place this nice where you are paying that much for a glass of wine and she actually chased me down when I finally left without having been given a bill I actually left too much money on the table because I just wanted to get out of there at that point. The staff downstairs too in the actual hotel did not seem to be anywhere on par with the Four Seasons when I asked for directions needed a cab called etc. If you want luxury in Shanghai I would HIGHLY recommend the Four Seasons over the Ritz.", "offset": [1839, 1926], "date": "2016-10-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "d06fdfec-20f4-4583-b522-996b979d0fbc", "sentence": "NOT a Four Season Experience Need Massive Upgrade.

UNPARALLELED EXCELLENCE IN SERVICE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER DOWN. By way of background my husband and I recently attended a conference in Shanghai after which it had been planned for us together with twelve other conference delegates to travel to Beijing. Regrettably then after arriving at the airport our flight was cancelled without notice so our group of fourteen Australians found ourselves stranded at Shanghai airport with no Plan B and no accommodation booked. Eighteen months earlier my husband and I together with our two adult children had stayed at the Four Seasons at 500 Weihai Road and had been incredibly impressed with every aspect of the hotel and its service. With this in mind we phoned our travel agent in Towomba Australia requesting accommodation at this hotel. We arrived at the Four Seasons very late in the afternoon extremely tired and despairing after an 8 hour soujourn at the airport waiting to retrieve our luggage. To make matters worse we had been caught in a deluge of rain and were all saturated cold hungry and weary. Waiting for us in the foyer of the hotel was the General Manager Fredrik Blomqvist who remarkably remembered my husband and me from our visit eighteen months earlier. Our incredible stay in this glorious hotel with its lovely elegance its excellent staff and their matchless service unfolded happily from thereNothing was too much trouble for Fredrick and his team. We were immediately shown to the foyer bar to await Fredrick organising our check in. We were introduced to the Food and Beverage Manager Budi Widodo and the Director of Marketing Anthony Yeung. Budi seamlesly produced canapes and drinks whilst Anthony greeted every member of our group and dealt with a whole range of special requests. The welcome we received was just extraordinaryThe rooms we were allocated on the 27th level and above were just superb very spacious and well appointed. It was as if our every need was anticipated even with staff arriving in our rooms especially to dry our wet luggage. We had booked rooms with Executive Club privileges on 37th Level of the hotel and the Club did not disappoint. Once again Fredrick appeared out of nowhere to welcome us to the hospitality of the ClubWe dined in a private dining room in the Si Ji Xuan Restaurant and the food and service were fabulous undoubtedly the most memorable Chinese cuisine that my husband and I have ever enjoyed. The breakfast spread was just wonderful again we were personally greeted by Budi and then offered specially squeezed exotic juices. The Chefs could not have been more accommodating with special requests for everyone in our group. An amazing presentation of quality cuisine with accomplished Chefs and willing wait staff. In summary we can not speak highly enough of the experience we enjoyed at this hotel. More importantly we can not speak highly enough of the excellent service ethic which flows from Fredrik his leadership is exemplary. To every staff member from the front desk the concierge the porters the foyer bar staff the team in the Executive Club and the housekeeping team thank you for making our stay superb. We are a very well travelled group of people having enjoyed staying in many exclusive and famous hotels around the world. Fredrik and his team would have a lot to teach many a competitor because they truly delivered an exceptional experience.
