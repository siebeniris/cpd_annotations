The hotel is located right across the street from Perimeter Mall so you can park in the hotel garage free and walk to the mall and restaurants. that is really nice during the holidays when parking is a nightmare at the mall.

My stay was from May 31 Tues. Jun 4 Sat. I had previously stayed at CP in Phoenix last October. Mediocre facility. No parking. I could go on but will not. Soured me on CP. Atlanta CP Ravenna however renewed my faith that it earned my admiration. The terraced piney woods ambience is very real not staged. it is really lovely. The interior lobby is equally lovely tranquil with its beautiful fountains surrounded by foliage and terraced down to multiple levels of restaurants and areas of private relaxation to watch a mounted TV or read the paper without distraction. Moving on to the check in desk I must say I was very impressed by the CP associate who greeted me. She was thorough let me show you where and sincerely reassuring if you discover any issues with the room contact me. it is a rare thing for a check in front desk associate to step out from behind the counter and escort a guest to see where main floor amenities were located. Nice. One of the greatest features of this hotel was it is underground multi level parking deck. Loved it. Plenty of well lit parking and close to the elevator for access to main floor of hotel. I felt very safe. can not begin to tell you how much I appreciated the parking. I was a little disappointed that the breakfast buffet opened at 630 rather than 60 because I needed to be at work by 715. The hotel provides breakfast buffet chits for each day of your stay. Not exactly my kind of food high fat. Egg casseroles with veggies cubed potatoes sausage bacon muffins. There was oatmeal but not made with enough milk so it was porridge glopy to spoon out. There was a pretty good fruit bar. You had to request toast. They had good Texas sized wheat toast. The coffee was horrid. It was so strong I could not swallow it. There was a Sylvias coffee bar on one of the terraced interior levels that was a mini Starbucks. Limited hot beverage choices. They would not honor my Starbucks card. So I never had a decent cup of coffee at the hotel. The complimentary shuttle service was one of the nicest features. They will take you via the CP shuttle anywhere within a 2mile radius. Shuttle left the hotel on every quarter hour. I only had to share the shuttle with one other person each morning for my courtesy ride to work. Then at the end of my workday I called the concierge they gave me their business card for pick up. With the exception of one day they were always timely for my pick up. 15 minutes. I was assigned hotel room 842. The king bed was fine. Pillows okay. I asked for early wake up calls each day and they faithfully woke me you on time. The bath room was small wish with a tub ugh. To my pleasant surprise the bathroom lighting was quite good. I could actually see well enough to ap my makeup without over doing. The room had a good sized desk area with plenty of elect outlets. Plenty of storage space for my clothing personal effects. Mini frig nice. Electronic digital access safe in the storage cabinet holding the mini frig. Easy access. no key necessary. Push button keypad. Loved it. Perfect sized for storing my electronics while I was out to dinner. Another nice perk of the CP Ravenna is that it is diagonally located from the Perimeter Mall very nice mall. The Cheesecake Factory is at the same mall. So I was able to walk comfortably from the hotel lobby and be at the mall minutes later. Add another 5 minute walk from the mall and I was at the MARTA high speed rail station. On my last night I decided to ask the front desk if I could possibly check out since I would have to leave the hotel by 230 am for an early flight. To my pleasant surprise they actually said yes. They showed me where I could drop off my room key when I exited the next morning. There is an indoor heated pool but it was not well kept. Pretty miserable to be exact. Shame on you CP. A shabby pool did not belong at this lovely resort. I thought the hotel lobby staff front desk concierge shuttle driver cleaning staff were professional. They made it clear that they cared the guests were cared for. To recap I was very happy with my stay. The only things that CP Ravenna should try to improve are 1. the breakfast buffets morning coffee other guests agreed with me that it was awful and 2 a dirty pool in need of upkeep. Otherwise I enjoyed everything else about the hotel and recommend it to others.", "offset": [980, 1070], "date": "2016-06-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "f711887d-7f95-4a21-ad81-89d41850132a", "sentence": "Location Free parking and spacious room.

I booked it through Expedia which did not mention lack of free parking and a mandatory 14 daily parking fee. To further expand the parking garage looked unmaintained was under construction and very dirty. Moreover the wifi speed was so slow that I felt a necessity to run a speed test which said the download and the upload speed were at 28 Mbps. Crowne Plaza mentions that wifi speed can vary depending on a location but the speed at this location was so slow that it was impossible to do any work while on their network. They offer a higher speed internet for an additional upcharge which I think is deceiving in a way that it adds an unnecessary charge. Additionally the room did not have hot water in the shower and I was forced to shower in cold water as I had limited time to address that issue. Furthermore the bed and the pillows were extremely uncomfortable. I addressed the manager about the issues I described above and as a solution she offered to move to a different room. Unfortunately because I booked the hotel through a third party I was not able to cancel my reservation for the second day andor receive refund for my inconvenience. I would not recommend this hotel unles you do not mind unexpected additional charges for things that other hotels from my previous experience are provided for free ie fast internet and parking.

Bought three rooms through Priceline. Plus Had two nights last weekend for my daughter. so bought 10 hotel nights over a week. An investment of 160 with food and parking. Got a great deal and now I know why Checked party into three rooms. bad omen the fire alarm went off while we were checking in. In My first room the refrigerator did nt work so I went to get ice. ice machine did nt work. tried to call for ice. guess What. the phone did nt work. went to floor above no ice. same floor below. I went to the front desk to complain and request another room and was told that they would send engineering up I said no I want another room and received a new room despite the frigid response from the desk attendant Who did not speak to me for the reminder of our interaction. Super unprofessional. I was moved to another floor away from my party where Construction was occurring to a dingy room with The toilet seat detached and peeling paint but at least I could cool my refrigerated items. Then the real stupidity began. Apparently the night desk manager did not know what rooms we were in so she sent a security guy to knock on our door at 1230am in the morning waking me scaring the beJesus out of my fianc\u00e9 and I as we had four children in our party on the floor we had left. The phone had rung right after 12But we were unable answer it in time as we were wait for it. SLEPINGSomeone apparently had been knocking on the door of one of our childrens rooms in the middle of the night as well and actually opened the door. My future stepson said get out. Just one idiotic move after the other \u2026. Needless to say we had a poor night of sleep despite a college visit planned the next morning. I went down to complain at 1 in the morning. The hotel did provide me with some points as they could not give me a refund because I booked through Priceline and they paid for a meal. But the bad experiences continued. Like the these experiences. we had to continuously get re keyed at the front desk because keys would not work a clogged toilet garbage in the parking deck A toilet seat that was detached from the toilet when we got to our room cold dining room in lobby. the food was actually decent but I just did not expect this place to be such a mess. We had two rooms for three nights and one room for two nights. so on Sunday I felt the need to go check with the front desk to make sure that they knew we were checking out of one room and that we would be there for another night in two rooms and sure enough they did not have the reservation correct and we would have had our keys not working again if I had not checked as we would have been checked out. Sure enough the keys quit working. The general consensus was that despite this place once being one of the crown jewels at one time of the Holiday Inn chainAnd being in the shadow of The home office of IHG. the hotel owner right here in Atlanta. the consensus in our party is that The Crowne Plaza Ravinia is a mess. My understanding from speaking to several managers whom I had to speak with over and over again because of the problems is that the property is being renovated and is under new management. we will see but they have a long way to go.

Tons of photo ops. The mall was a short walk away. We had room service breakfast two days in a row. They forgot my husbands OJ each day but otherwise it was great. We were forgiving because the convention was super busy and they were so super nice. My only complaint the elevators were extremely slow.
