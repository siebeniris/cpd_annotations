Loved everything about our stay with Le Meridien in El Vendrel Spain. From the views to the cleanliness the Spa best facial of my life to the staff. Everything is 5 star except for the ironing board we received from housekeeping one day. Happy to overlook this because it still worked it just needs to be given away so a new one that is sturdy with a good pad can take it is place. We were thrilled with the overall caring attitude of the entire staff. The manager who checked us in came out the beach lounge area to check on us as we were getting a bite to eat after our travels. He asked us how we liked our room and if he could help us with anything else. Like this man the staff all tended to take care ownership and responsibility for the comfort of all guests. Very refreshing. We met with a friendly helpful and very delightful special events coordinator near the end of our stay and she showed us all of the spaces in the hotel then followed up with an email with additional information for us. We will be booking with her soon for our wedding for a year from now with Le Maridien. All of our friends and family who travel for this event will also have fun riding the bikes they have for rent at the hotel too Bonus.

We stayed here on a family holiday two adults and four teenagers. The accommodation was immaculate and very well kept. Cleaning was done whenever suited the guests and the cleaning staff were friendly. Beach towels were delivered to the rooms daily. Breakfast was fantastic and suitable for all palates and served on the sun terrace or in the orangerie. The beach was just in front of the hotel and had a selection of parasols or cabanas organised by a lovely guy called mustafa. Beach club served cocktails mocktails and light meals. The spa was quiet and had great facilities open 9 9pm. There was an in house exhibition of Dali sculpture during our stay. Even one of the teens was impressed. Our holiday was really fabulous and helped in no small way by the front desk staff especially Alesio. He even helped programme our sat nav when we had difficulty finding a location.

By far the best vacation I have had in a long time. The staff was exceptional. I arrived around 9 am they allowed me to use the spa to shower and put on fresh clothes. My room was ready at 11 am. I can not express the joy I felt staying here. Calafel is a middle class town that is four stops away on the train from Barcelona. The breakfast buffet is really GOOD. It offers something for everyone eggs bacon roasted tomatoes asparagus croissants pastries soya milk and regular milk cereal fresh fruit and lots more. Sitting out on the patio eating breakfast listening to the ocean what more could one ask for on vacation. Never ran into a long line. Their is a bank about a five minute walk down the board walk that I used to get euros just pick your language. I forgot the experience specialist name older gentleman but he was awesome. He mapped out sites for us to visit in Barcelona and Stiges. We took the train which is very easy to use and spent an entire day in both locations. Stiges had beautiful beaches and very good restaurants. I only ate breakfast at the resort because there were so many other restaurants on the boardwalk. Now I did drink at the resort and let me tell you about the best mixologist I have ever experience Juame please forgive me if I spelled your name wrong. He has a following and we all waited for him to work behind the bar I am sure the other staff were talented but they were not him. He made each one of us feel special this was a girls trip and we each wanted to bring him back in our suitcase. This is truly his passion and he would not just make you a drink but give you a history lesson on alcohol as well. My favorite was the Berry passion that was until he made me a blackberry mojito. We had to catch an early flight so we used the car service our driver Salvo was exceptional as well he showed us different attracts on our way to the airport. I will request him next year. Oh yes I have to go back my family and coworkers noticed how happy I am. The resort offered a lot of activities while I was there. Free wine tasting with music two nights in a row. Seafood night at the beach club. The locals are really nice also. If you get a chance to go to The Barcelona Mall please try the gelato shop I am lactose intolerant and they had plenty of fruit options and it was really good. You can see a 360 view of the city from the top of the mall and they had really good restaurants okay I am a foodie. do not pay to go to the top they have a free elevator escalator inside.", "offset": [1960, 2032], "date": "2017-07-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "family"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "5faf3159-a252-4d74-aa22-9b965d910b00", "sentence": "Perfect Hotel. Le Meridien Ra rescued us. We booked Le Meridien Ra while in Spain already at an awful hotel whose website was very different from reality. We were accommodated graciously and efficiently by a very efficient and courteous staff both at check in and throughout our stay. Everything about this hotelIs first class and elegant and truly 5star from the breakfast buffet to the Beach Bar for lunch. Saturday beach buffet is fantastic. You are treated with courtesy and deference by the entire team. GM Manuel is to be congratulated for his management of this hotel. Mustafa runs the beach loungers with efficient courtesy for all guests and the wait staff on the beach will get you a cold drink or snack whenever you wish.

Second the service from the bell boy to the beach staff every one has been so kind and so helpful we really felt welcomed. Third the room clean modern with a balcony that gave a very nice view on the beach. Very good bed. And the restaurant we were eating from the buffet everyday and the terrace almost directly on the beach gave an amazing view on the sunset. In the morning for breaksfast you can choose to eat on the other side in the garden were it feels so fresh and relaxing. The beach is large and it gives free sunbed for hotel guests.
