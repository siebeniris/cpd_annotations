Check in at the Red Level took much longer than it should have but that was our only complaint. The rooms were clean and we tracked in a lot of sand everyday traveled with children and every time the cleaning staff came in to clean there was not one grain of sand to be found anywhere. The restaurants were always pretty empty and the service was great. The beaches are beautiful but because of a dead coral reef a half mile out there were no waves and large patches of seaweed beds. I suggest water shoes. Great beaches in Luquilo with a great surf 10 minutes east on route 3. Rent a car at airport because 2 taxi rides round trip to San Juan or anywhere else on the island will cost just as much as a car all week. The PGA tour was held at resort but it was far from crowded because the resort is incredibly spacious. Golf cart rides whenever you need them to get from one place to another was a huge bonus with a toddler whom did not want to walk everywhere. Staff was very gracious and friendly. The grounds are as beautiful as all the pictures. We were able to really relax this trip.

This hotel is the worse hotel I stayed in my life. I am writing this review and I will get an answer from management with liesthat is all the know well how to do lie. I booked my trip and I was never informed that the main pool is not open. So not only Gran Melia has the worse part of the Puerto Rican beach also right now their main pool is not working. Here are all the problems I encountered and I tried to talk to a management and all lies or no answers. Over a month and still waiting for an answer from the GM whom has not had the professionalism to answer my personal email. This is my updated review and answer to Maria Rodriguez and tell Carlos GM that I need to hear from him and stop avoiding me. Dear Maria Rodriguez I am very disappointed on your answer. I can not believe that after my worse vacation you answered my review with lies. But to clarify my review and your answer please read this this is the letter I sent to Carlos DeFreitas and still waiting to hear from himDay 1 ordered room service since my best friend arrived at 10 pm. We got our food 2 hours later COLD. the person that brought our food was super rude and complain for 10 min about the hotel and that she was the only one working that night. She also forgot to bring our drinks and told us she could not bring them and left. I called the room service again and 1 hour later we got our drinks. So we got charged 80 dollars for a cold disgusting dinner with a service of a 1 star MOTELDay 2 called Red Level to let them know that my TV was not working. Nobody showed up. Same thing with my butler do not know why I have one when my phone does not work and I had to call from my iPhone. Also during my reservation it was NEVER mentioned that the main pool was under construction. If I knew I would not stay and I would it enjoy my reunion as we planned. Day 3 find a disgusting type of gecko in my bathroom. TV still not working and called again Day 4 went to breakfast buffet to eat MOLD French toast. I immediately informed the cashier and after 15 minutes and other people eating mold the product was removed. I asked to speak with the manager and nobody showed up. For your information it was CONFIRMED as MOLD and I also HAVE 4 witnesses about it. Day 5 woke up covered in mosquito bites because the air conditioner went off. do not know if had something to do with the problem you had at the villas the night before. Friend was worried because I could not breath because I am allergic to mosquitoes but I had a shot with me. I informed one of the managers and explain everything that has been happening and he told me he will all me back and that my air TV and phones were going to be fix. By the time I arrived to my room I heard the technician talking to the manager expressing how DUMB I was because everything was working. I got inside my room and checked and air and phones were working but not my tv. They came back with a remote because I am so dumb. I showed them yes this dumb ways nan thought your technician that the problem is not the remote. So they left. I got a call from red level telling me that the manager approved 100 off my bill. Yes I bet you also could not believe that after all they offered me 100. So she called back and said ALL CHARGES TO YOUR ROOM WILL BE COMPLEMENTARYCheck out time nothings was complementary. I paid 175 and Supervisor at red level was RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL. Almost lost my flight and I was not able to speak with you because you were there only for a few hours for a meeting not to talk to me as they told me. I paid for a 4 star hotel and I received a 1 star MOTEL serviceCould you please tell me if I was so satisfied with the service at red level I asked to talk with Carlos. Which complementary amenity did you send to my room. Why did I pay 175 for something that it was going to be complementary. The charges you took off where for movies that I DIDNT watch because my tv DIDNT work since day 1If you had all those attractions why every single guest I spoke to was very disappointed with thatWhy Carlos has not call me or answer my emailsLike I said on my review.

Service in The Market was generally very good. In Prime 787 service was awful. The waiter left our table without taking our order cleaned a drop of wine in a plate with his finger before finally deciding to change it and twice mentioned that the chef was not amicable. After all this he asked us to consider a tip in addition to the already included 16 service charge.

The staff at the kids club engaged our kids in numerous activities a treasure hunt water balloon fight hermit crab races on the beach movies in the beautiful conference center space with a legit popcorn machine when you include a massive pool and numerous water sports there is so much to do without leaving the property.

Whether you sit in between the pool and the ocean or take a walk down the beach the property blends the feeling of a newly renovated beach resort with a sense of being in a remote location where you really feel away from the hustle of dense urbanization where many of us live and look to escape. This is not the typical Caribbean beach hotel where you are on a beach with a string of hotels up and down with a sea of beach chairs and people in every direction. This experience is the exact opposite. You feel like you are away but the resort has newly renovated infrastructure to provide everything you need. The GM mentioned that they are adding even more amenities in 2020 with Top Golf a new sports bar concept a new gym and spa etc. etc. So this place is going to be even better when I bring my family back next yearI have stayed at hotels in the Bahamas Mexico Costa Rica and have never experienced value like this. I felt like the experience was in line with hotels where I have paid 8010 per night and the room rate is a fraction of that. The rooms compare favorably to other hotels in Puerto Rico that are charging 80 per night over peak times. I found the food to be reasonably priced based on my previous experience. In summary I highly recommend you go and check it out. No need for a passport.
