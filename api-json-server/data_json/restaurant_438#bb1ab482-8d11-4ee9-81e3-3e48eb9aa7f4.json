The hotel is extremely well located next to all the top attractions restaurants and the Palladium shopping mall. The rooms are clean with particular mention to the bathroom which was sparkling. This is very nice. The room itself. I had a superior room is fine. In line with 4 star standards. Free wifi. Robe slippers. Nice large size. Plus for ladies it has a vanity in the room so getting ready is easy. The bed was comfortable if you do not like medium to hard mattress then it will not be for you. Coffee tea facilities in the room just a kettle with tea and powdered coffee. There is only one room with Nespreso coffee facilities for those used to that at Acor facilities and that is the Deluxe room. Of course there is only ONE deluxe room in the entire hotel so the odds of getting it. Plenty of towels offered good and large in room safe. I have not sampled the food. Strong wifi and even picks up the wifi in the neighbouring hotel which is Ibis and belongs to the group. The couple negatives outside of the kettle in the room which is not a big deal the lifts are ridiculously slow which is not a game changer or a real problem and the hotel smells funny like cheap cologne. Not the rooms themselves but the halls and sometimes the reception area. Rooms do not all have very nice views mine had the backs of other buildings.

The rooms are good sized we had a shower instead of a bath in our room that was fine but after a long day walking and exploring Prague my partner wanted to relax her aching feet with a long soak. We had booked a room with breakfast breakfast was served downstairs and you could choose to eat inside or out food was good plenty to eat and a wide choice from cereals porridge breads and rolls fruit and hot cooked food such as sausages bacon mushrooms and egg. etcas well as tea coffee juices and smoothies. The entrance to the hotel is large with a nice bar area to the right. We arrived on Tuesday morning and as our room was not ready we left our bags with reception and went exploring on the day we left we had to check out by midday so again we left our bags with reception and returned in the evening when our transport arrived. We found the staff very friendly and gave advice on getting to different attractions we wanted to visit.

The deluxe rooms were very nice indeed. Wifi was free the bed was comfortable and the pillows actually had some substance to them. The room was quiet. Breakfast was just fine where there was pretty much everything you might want to eat on offer. The hotel is centrally located not far from Namesti Republicky station and the Municipal House.

I stayed two nights at the Century Old Town and left with mixed feelings. On the surface it is a very nice hotel very well situated. But like they say the devil is in the detail. Where to start. Many reviewers complain about the poor A C system and I can confirm that it is a bit odd indeed. We stayed in one of the meeting rooms and had to call someone to change the temperature every time it got too warm or too coldThe hotel has been refurbished in the last years to give it a modern look. that is fine by me but then do it properly please. While the hotel has a distinctive modern style it has kept some remnants of his previous glory. such as the super kitschy 80s90s golden elevator. The decorator must have forgotten about it. it is also excruciatingly slowthat is a detail but something else annoyed me a bit more. The stylish bathroom does not have space for personal items and the shower is completely open. There is no wall curtain or anything to contain the water. That means that after a shower the floor will be wet and it will stay wet for a while. I do not know what you supposed to do if you want to go back to the bathroom after you got dressed. Sorry that is not the best idea for a bathroom. The bed was very comfortable but the view which I normally would not care too much about was not exciting see picture. If I was the hotel I would pay the neighbor and get that wall painted. As the other picture shows the window itself was falling apart. Breakfast was fine. The juices are kept in a fridge for some reason. That means that you need both hands to open the door get the bottle remove the cap etc. not great when you are holding a plate of food. A juice dispenser that is easy to reach and operate would be better. Eventually that hotel has lot of potential but needs to fix a few things before it fully deserves 4 stars.", "offset": [1658, 1705], "date": "2017-07-10 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "98724e60-7fe4-4661-8e2a-e16cd302cc45", "sentence": "Nice hotel but poor service delivery.
