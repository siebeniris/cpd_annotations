The service at the Hilton is great every employee I came across was very polite and extremely helpful. The lobby is very well manned with staff and has a welcoming atmosphere makes you feel like you are in a nice hotel. I had forgotten some toiletry items and was given more than I needed to get through my stay which was very nice. They offer valet parking for 24 a day and that is the only option for parking through the hotel otherwise you are left to the streets and paid lots of downtown Anchorage. I put it down as a negative I understand paid parking downtown but believe they should be offering cheaper rates than other lots for guests. The actual room was nothing great actually I have stayed in more generic and less grandiose hotels with much better rooms. But I had a bed bathroom and TV so the basics were covered. I was at the hotel attending a conference and the conference facilities are definitely nice. Helpful staff easy to find rooms and plenty of space. The biggest downer was sitting in the generic straight backed chairs for 4 8 hours. Overall the experience was a positive one.", "offset": [856, 948], "date": "2015-03-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b8ff0242-df2e-456d-94c0-13202d690656", "sentence": "The front desk is AMAZING especially Jayce Jackson.

The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The amenities were fabulous also and the food and bar was great also when I arrived home \u2026 I realized I had lost a bag of souvenirs for my girls. I called the hotel and Jayce answered. She checked everywhere and also checked in the gift shop and found my souvenir bag \u2026 I am so grateful for their calm and courteous service. What an amazing experience. I will not stay anywhere else when ever I go to Anchorage. I highly recommend this hotel \u2026. Highly highly highly. Thank you for a wonderful experience.

A very nice downtown Hilton located among many shops restaurants and a block away from the mall if you forgot your dress blue socks like I did. The lobby is nice and comfortable. My room was up to par for a Hilton. Rooms are on the pricey side but not beyond what one would expect for a downtown Hilton anywhere. Interesting note this Hilton did not slide my bill under the door for automatic check out. Not sure why most others do. Breakfast at the hotel diner was pricey and forgettable.

Hilton you need to work harder to keep your name. Yes the hotel is in a good location and the gym is quite nice but beyond that it was very disappointing. It started at check in we are Hilton Honors and when the 3 of us checked in they gave us two watershum. welcome 2 of you. Regarding the room no fan in the bathroom only one towel hook w no towel rack very little drawer space very few hangers. We stayed for a week after being on a cruise ship for a week and laughed that we had way more space for our clothes in the tiny ship room than we did in our large hotel room.

Finally after giving them our confirmation number some young man who knew a little more found us a room on the 11th floor much much larger than the postage stamp it is n\u2019t on the Club Floor but we have Club Room access. Which is a joke. But of course the Club Room is not open on the weekends 2 of the days we are here. These guys must have a monopoly. the young people that are helping us are doing their best.
