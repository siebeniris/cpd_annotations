This was our third trip to Kauai and our first time staying at The Courtyard by the Mariot on the Coconut Coast. We stayed here for three weeks and enjoyed every minute of it. The front desk was friendly and helpful. We loved our room it was a garden view but we could see the pool and ocean. The room was fresh and clean. Bed was so comfortable and had lots of pillows. The grounds were kept perfect and were beautiful. Pool was nice especially at nite when they had the fire on around the water fountain. The location was perfect it was within walking distance to restaurants stores and shopping. We especially liked the walking and bike path that went for miles along the ocean.

Courtyard is in a good location with many restaurants and stores close by as well as being half way between the attractions of the north and south parts of the island. Parking apparently is now included in the 20 resort fee along with free breakfast for kids 12 and under and some other perks. Beach is beautiful and very close is a little area behind coral perfect for toddlers. Note that this area of Kauai has a steeper beach with many rocks and coral so swimming in ocean not advised.

Independently of that there are many stores in the area including two big supermarkets and a small mall Coconut MarketplaceThe check in and check out processes were fast and pleasant. The staff is very kind and helpful. Rates are reasonable not including breakfast nor parking. There is a big parking lot available with a cost of 14 taxes per day. We have had a very good and comfy room for four people we are a couple plus two daughters with ocean and pool view. There were two king beds with a small balcony with chairs coffee maker with complimentary coffee and tea and a small refrigerator. Views from our balcony were really nice and relaxing especially early in the morning and during the dusk. There is a garden near the shore with many and nice chairs available.

Also two of the towels while they may have been clean they had small stains on them but no bigie I just used the stainless ones. Also while there is a paper in the room telling you about the rooster noises there is nothing telling you about the risks of leaving the balcony open. I had an invasion of mosquitos I am not talking like 5 more than that. Maybe I should have known better but I still think people should be aware of that since the balcony view is so beautiful and its tempting to leave it open which brings me to the pros. I had a gorgeous view of the pool and beach. In whichever room you stay you most likely will have a beautiful view of one or the other and you will be able to hear the ocean waves. The hotel is right by the ocean I loved going down every morning to eat breakfast and walk by the beach. For breakfast I would recommend the pancakes or the french toast. Dinnertime there is excellent Dana is the best server there. just the live music and fireside made every night special. Loved the coplimentary mai tais. Also hamocksOveral the rooms were clean and the bed is super comfy. The front desk staff is very helpful as they offered to change my room or spray it after my mosquitofestation they sprayed it but mind you that did not get rid of those mosquitos. Also housekeeping and maintenance were very nice sometimes they would make friendly conversation with me as I walked byHotel is in walking distance from Longs Drugs CVS and the Coconut Marketplace. I loved seeing the random roosters and chickens every morning just randomly walking by and singing. So cute. I have no idea why people complain about that I found it so charming. Very kauai. Also I was welcomed by Princess the hotel cat who is adorable. I loved the whole Hawaiian feel of the hotel and watching the sunrise and sunset on the beach. The concierges Liane and Dana were the BEST. They were so SO helpful and attentive. They really helped me make the most out of my vacation and I am so thankful for that.

Definitely not up to Sheraton standard. I spent a week with my family 2 kids 10 12 at Sheraton Coconut Beach hotel and definitely not enjoyed the hotel on so many levels. To begin with we requested our room to be ready for 3 pm arrival through the mobile ap and the room was not ready. It was not ready even 2 hours later. They welcomed us with the fact that this is not quite Sheraton hotel and we can not use our status privileges. No breakfast included and pretty much we should have been thankful that we had a room there. Very unpleasant and rude welcome to this hotel. We spend over 80 nights a year with Mariot and have never seen anything like that. Next day different crew and the breakfast was included for us. Lobby staff was very unaware and incompetent in their job based on our stay. Breakfast restaurant Overall very inconsistent service as well. Our lattes had different price every day although our order was exactly the same. The kids juices usually were served at the same time with the bill at the end of breakfast. Rooms I can not quite picture where the remodeling part was. The rooms needed a deep cleaning for sure it felt like whatever they have remodeled they just left and forgot to clean up before allowing people in. The beds are very soft and uncomfortable the pillows are extremely soft do not understand the purpose of it. The daily cleaning service included just the fix of our beds and fresh towels. For the 4 of us they were leaving only 2 towels no matter how many times we requested them to make a note that we need four. One or two towels every day had some kind of stain spots indicating they did not clean them properly. The hotel is on the windiest beach on the island. The beach is nice but you can not really enjoy it due to the wind. The wind never stopped for the entire time we were there. This might be a reason to the tree to be so leaning away towards the hotel. The beach is windy the pool side is windy as well you can not find a place to avoid it no matter where you go. The fire pits around the pool are lovely in the evening but again with so much wind is hard to enjoy even a single drink. The tiles around the pool the breakfast restaurant and the lobby was quite slippery. There were a lot of signs about that but that can not prevent slipping.
