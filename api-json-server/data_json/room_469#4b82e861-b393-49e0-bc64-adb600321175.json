My family I stayed at their four bedroom villa Villa 3 from 31 March to 6th April 2015 and our entire stay was just perfect. We could not have asked for anything more. Right from our arrival at the airport to being received with cold towels by the head butler Nyoman Surantara to the send off by the private residences manager Mr Arya. The villa is exceptionally well appointed and maintained immaculately and stylishly. We had our 24X7 personal butler Arimbawa KusumaAri who served us with exceptional grace and an ever smiling demeanour. There was not a request that we made which he didnot fulfill from meals and tea coffee at unreasonable times to extra fans by the pool loungers to fixing reservations at the sea side warungs. His attitude and service orientation was excellent. As I would say of the over all staff at the resort. Friendly efficient and non intrusive. The pool at the villa is cleaned every day the house keeping staff sensitively wait for your convenience to make the rooms and clean the common areas. We used to breakfast at the Taman Wantilan restaurant at the resort which had a spectacular view of Jimbaran BayI could even ask for Vegimite Marmite with my toast here. Later in the day literally cross over from our villa to the Jimbaran Beach the resorts Coconut Grove and lounge or swim in the sea. The staff at the Grove made sure that we were served our cold water promptly and pool towels spread perfectly on the loungers and were always responsive to get us the cocktails when we needed them. The Sundara restuarant is beautifully situated just above the sea and for dinner besides the ambiance of the surf breaking right below us the food was a gastronomical experience. We were five of us in the family staying at the villa and each one of us agree that it was a superlative experience to have stayed here.

We had a series of small disappointments on arrival and the reason I think this is the most amazing resort I have ever visited is how thoroughly brilliantly and completely they were resolved within hours of being made aware of them. A ordinary hotel can not compete with the four seasons level of service. Our villa is generously proportioned twice daily room serviced so that the room and my sunglasses are constantly spotless. The plunge pool is perfectly proportioned and the view is glamorous. I would thoroughly recommend chef Kriss cooking class. He is incredibly knowledgeable kind and capable of answering all the curly questions I asked and the food we created was brilliant. I will always think of him and this magical escape when I cook bitter melon and his mothers rice. In my opinion it is incredibly good value. Next time I would come for a minimum of 4 nights the sunrise yoga was lovely and worth a repeat experience. The closest supermarket is 10 mins taxi away 3 ride which is convenient for supplies. If you have a bad back or do not like walking do not be put off by the size of the resort the hotel has buggies that will take you wherever and whenever you want easily move between pools restaurants the bar or spa.

It was the last of 4 hotels we did stay during our trip to Bali dedicated to 10 t Anniversary of our wedding. I found this hotel in the internet 10 years ago when we were planning our Honeymoon and immediately did fall in love with it at least according to pictures. We ended up having Honeymoon in Dominican Republic however I told myself at that time that once we will visit Bali we must stay at this one. So when was planning trip dedicated to anniversary did n\u2019t have a doubt on which hotel to choose to finish it in style and leaping ahead can tell that this was perfectly right choice. I did write to the hotel in advance to inform that we are coming on special occasion and asking for smth nice to be arranged. To their credit hotel \u2019s GM answered very quickly and promised that hotel team will take of our stay \u2013 and they really did. On arrival we were greeted with refreshing towel and welcome drinks. Lobby itself worth separate word \u2013. it is open plan with thatched roof structure situated on the very top of the hotel. As hotel is located on a quite steep hill and lobby overlooks the Ocean the view from the lobby is breathtaking. Check in done by Julia was very fast and efficient and by the end of the process General Manager came to greet us in person \u2013 which was very nice and pleasant touch. We were informed that due to our special occasion we were upgraded us to Jimbaran Villa on the renovated side of the hotel and then buggy brought us to villa. Our villa 26 was in the second row from the sea with wonderful Jimbaran bay view. Villa is really well designed with open air thatched roof living area huge bedroom located in separate building opening into huge dressing room and followed by gorgeous bathroom \u2013 with free standing huge bath separate shower and 2 separated wash basins. Also there is an open air shower which you can reach from main shower surrounded by small while very nice tropical garden. Between open air living room and bedroom there is an open plan patio with greenery small temple sun lounges and private plunge pool 3x4 m with great view over the ocean. On arrival we found in our bedroom chilled Champagne not Sparkling wine Spumante etc while rather real Lanson champagne from official supplier of British Crown along with fruits refreshing non alcoholic cocktails. yummy. and welcome letter from the GM. Villa does have all amenities you would expect form luxury 5 Star hotel. Hotel territory is really huge and unbelievably beautiful around 150 thatched roof pool villas are located on the hill descending to the sea creating a feel of an ancient village surrounded by lavish well kept gardens with a number of small ponds and waterfalls. Creating atmosphere of pure peace and relaxation hotel was more than 80 full at the time of our stay while when you are on the territory it seems that you are almost alone in the big green park. As territory is really huge you can always call from your room or any dining location you are in and ask for buggy to bring you to any spot within the hotel and this service is obviously complimentary. Hotel has 3 main pools \u2013 one with infinity edge and unbelievable ocean view. Water from this one freely falls over the infinity edge into the lower Waterfall pool. Finally the longest 56 m and probably the most used hotel pool is located right on the beach it also has an infinity edge and one can really feel like swimming almost in the sea as pool is only separated from salt waters of Indian ocean by narrow sand line. Hotel \u2019s beach club consists of 2 parts \u2013 you can either use sun lounges or cabanas for 2 near the 56 m long beach pool or use the separate dedicated beach club area located 50 further. Once you arrive to the beach staff is immediately coming to prepare the sun lounge with 2 white towels they use only crispy white towels for the sun lounges throughout the hotel one more sign of great hotel. being whit towels must be not old or dirty unlike many other hotels which are trying to masque in darker colors badly washed or old towels and also to propose you complimentary water with ice. Near the pool they also provide complimentary fruit infused water. Beach is sandy and entrance to the ocean is quite shallow so will fit both adults and also families with children. Also hotel has own Spa located at the very top of the hotel right near the entrance while we did n\u2019t use it so ca n\u2019t comment. Finally to entertain the guests hotel organize some complimentary tours of the grounds eg temples of the hotel orientation tour etc. several times per week as well as some sport activities and master classes. All these activities for the whole week are listed in the booklet every guest receives on arrival. There are several dining options at Four Seasons \u2013 main restaurant located high enough to provide panoramic views of the Jimbaran bay and where also the breakfast is served \u2013 we also did have breakfast and although it is very sumptuous I would say. and this is probably my only minor point of criticism in the whole review that it is still slightly overpriced as per Bali standards even for hotel of such caliber so if you plan to have breakfast better book it in advance it comes much cheaper in this case few other restaurants and bars and also several gazebos located closer to see for romantic dining. Finally they do have famous Sundara restaurant located right on the beach. The location and setting are awesome we were fortunate enough thanks to Julia form the reception to have a very nice table in the evening round table with sofa for 2 overlooking the pond pool and ocean \u2013 so wonderful and romantic. Restaurant is specialized on Asian cuisine and one of the peculiarities of the concept is that they offer all salads and mains dishes in 3 different sizes small medium and large. so one can choose either to take big portion of one dish or rather to taste few things by taking smaller plates. Also what differentiate the restaurant form others is that they offer cocktail pairing instead of standard wine pairing cocktails also can be ordered in different sizes and are all special ones. Just on separate note \u2013 prices in Sundara are very reasonable giving the caliber of the hotel can tell this as we did dine in all our previous hotels as well as in some other fancy places \u2013 eg St Regis Nusa Dua famous KayaPuti restaurant. We decided to opt for small portions to try more dishes and all food was delicious as well as cocktails and the service was second to none we were greeted by Mathieu \u2013 new hotel \u2019s Director of FB he was very nice and attentive trying to have a word with all the restaurant guests. Sundara manager also was checking whether everything is fine with our food and finally our waiter apologies forgot his name was perfect. It was perfect dinner with attention to every detail ie when I said the one of the dishes was slightly spicy I was immediately brought the watermelon to eliminate the spicy taste \u2013. never knew that watermelon can do it so quickly \uf04a. At the end of our dinner we were provided with nice complimentary desert with greeting for our 10th Anniversary \u2013 small while extremely nice and pleasant touch. Service deserves separate mentioning all the hotel staff really doing their very best to make all guests happy and they are really succeeding in this. They are trying to foresee and fulfill every small wish of the hotel guests and it is clearly visible and greatly appreciated. We really did have a wonderful stay and really did n\u2019t want to depart. We definitely will be willing and waiting to return and without any doubts can highly recommend the hotel to anyone searching for perfect getaway.", "offset": [1352, 1510], "date": "2016-05-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "fe34f141-efdb-43c6-bbdb-62fe7b465bb0", "sentence": "Great sea view.

This resort is by far the best I have ever stayed. From the beginning to the end everything was amazing. I am so happy the bf and I got to experience this resort perfect for our anniversary. Upon arriving at the airport we had a driver from the hotel pick us up. It was easy to spot since he was holding a sign for Four Seasons. It was a private car ac blasted with water bottles and cold towels for us. After a fairly short ride we arrived to the resort. The reception area was already breathtaking. Very open space overlooking the ocean. We were welcomed by a friendly staff with a cold ginger refreshment and more cold towels. She explained everything to us and gave us our key and showed our room on the map which was nearly at the top rooms are stacked. I was thinking to myself. holy crap that is gon na be a far walk from the front desk to our room. I did not realize they had buggys golf carts that takes us everywhere on the resort. I actually loved the use of buggys. You call and they come in a matter of minutes. It felt like my own personal driver around the resort yes it felt special heheWe arrived at our room and the staff member explained everything to us for us to use. I also liked that they you use a real key to enter. The place definitely has some traditional aspects to it but so modernize. We walk through the doors and first thing I see is the beautiful outdoor patio pool ocean view. I was immediately in love. The infinity pool was amazing. There was also a small gazebo area that you can sit with a ceiling fan. Also two lawn chairs to lay out in the sun. Of course all this was overlooking the resort and into the ocean. They have trees everywhere so it is not like you can see your neighbors or they can see you at least that is what I am thinking. Also there is an outdoor shower. Next there is two entrances into the bedroom both sliding doors. Since we came for our anniversary they had cake and a bottle of sparkling water for us. The bedroom was very spacious with a king bed and living room area with a couch. The bed had a canopy where you can pull drapes all around to prevent bugs when you are sleeping. The bathroom had separate toilet from the shower as well as a bathtub. I loved the bathtub they even had pillows attached for relaxation. I usually shower instead of bathe but the tub was too hard to pass up on I used it everyday. They had bath salts for you to use and incense sticks to light to give that relaxation vibe. I definitely made a cribs video of this place Since we were given resort credits to use we spent it on foods and drinks. Their breakfast buffet was delicious. There was a great amount of various selections from basic western foods like bacon and sausage and pastries to other Indonesian and Balinese foods that I enjoyed trying. They also had a made to order eggs and waffle station. Of course the view made it 10x better. Who does not like eating overlooking the oceanAnother restaurant I enjoyed was Sundara which I will review more details there. We were able to use resort credits here too so we had dinner and drinks one night and it was amazing. We had our own table in the front overlooking the ocean with live music definitely felt romantic. Also another tip that may help others since we were not aware at first. We knew we were really close to the seafood beach restaurants since it is all along the same street. But we thought it was still quite a walk from the resort to the beach restaurants and also sketchy to walk on the narrow roads. Long story short you can call a buggy from your room to Sundara and walk from Sundara to the beach and it is restaurants. And when you are done with the beach just walk back to Sundara and ask a staff to call you a buggy. We ended up wasting a cab fare since we did not figure it out til after. Lastly I like to talk about the phenomenal service from all the staff members. Everyone was so friendly and nice. They accommodate to whatever you need and just gave amazing hospitality. Their service definitely make staying at Four Seasons an awesome experience.

Given the size the large number of paths and stairs as well as tropical vegetation certain areas of the resort can seem a bit unkept due to fallen leaves and flowers. Some of the many gazebos are furnished with poorly maintained sofas tables and random kids furniture which negatively impacts the impression of the grounds. The beach is nothing to rave about like most beaches in Bali. The shore is fairly clean but the water quality is poor on most days. Shells and small pieces of corals make wading into the water especially during low tide cumbersome. Impairing the resort experience are the airport tower and the runway that are visible in the distance. The resort entrance driveway and small open lobby with a thatched roof are understated and modest leaving the show to the great view upon arrival. Unfortunately the furniture is dated and should be replaced to align better with other public areas and the villas. After a smooth check in with ginger based welcome drink and cold towel one is escorted to the villa by buggy. The buggy services came in handy throughout our stay given the size of the resort. The villa is modeled after a traditional Balinese courtyard house with thatched roof in a walled garden featuring a small plunge pool sun beds and a semi open pavilion with the main seating area. It features a modestly sized bedroom with desk and a comparatively large bathroom with dressing area bathtub and indoor and outdoor shower. Pros. Local design privacy decent wireless internet connection varied tropical fruit bowl that is replenished daily complimentary water in reused glass bottles great Samsung soundbar bluetoth sound system. Cons. Visible 1 2 cm wide gap under the full length of the sliding doors leading to terrace no blackout blinds only sliding wooden shutters that let in too much light swimming pool is small with loud water feature we requested to turn it off no indoor seating area not even an armchair standard pillows are too soft all four of them so had to request firmer variants bathroom is old fashioned and while well maintained it is showing its age noise disturbance from passing buggies in the late evening limited and average quality toiletries and amenities eg no sewing kit no complimentary newspaper or press reader access but copy of eg NYT available at beach clubThe housekeeping was generally thorough although somewhat inconsistent. On some days the facial tissue was not replenished coffee capsules were not refilled and the number of water bottles provided varied. We pointed these issues out and they were rectified swiftly. On the first day we requested to have the water feature turned off in the evening during turndown and turn on again in the morning to ensure water circulation in the swimming pool unfortunately this arrangement never worked and we had to call every day to have it taken care of. Turndown was average without any special touch or small token of appreciation that I come to expect at a resort of this standard. We only ate at the resort and were generally satisfied with the quality of the food as well as the service attentive and friendly. The restaurants were generally empty during dinner which rendered the spaces a bit soulless and the service a bit overbearing. As for the food we enjoyed the light dishes for lunch and dinner at the Sundara beach club with great happy hour and live music in the evening as well as the Balinese specialties at the intimate Jala restaurant. The main buffet restaurant Taman Wantilan was the weakest venue of the three as it served rather uninspired standard fare. Room service was prompt with good quality enjoyable local dishes. Daytime service at the Sundara beach club terrace was exceptional. The attendants regularly came by the cabana with cold towels water and snacks that included water melon freshly made and customized ice cream sandwiches pizza slices fresh coconut and more. Overall the resort is a near perfect getaway offering privacy and serenity laid back luxury and reliable service. A few tweaks including ensuring proper insulation of the villas consistent upkeep of all public areas consistent housekeeping and adding the one or other special surprising touch will make it a truly perfect beach resort.", "offset": [2209, 2936], "date": "2019-03-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "47d4c7a1-c130-408a-8c6f-a7cfc8d2e978", "sentence": "Amazing Resort but location let \u2019s it down. This would be a 55 rating if I was just rating the service and resort facilities. But the location is 25 or 35. The moment you pull up to the resort it feels special. The immaculately manicured and lush grounds evoke the quintessential tropical vibe. The thatched roof villas felt rustic and very Balinese but did n\u2019t sacrifice any of the luxury features you might expect from a FS property. We stayed in a two bedroom villa during our stay and absolutely loved it. The outdoor living room connect two bedrooms. There was also a plunge pool overlooking Jimbaran bay. Each room had a gorgeous bathroom with a huge soaked tub and an outdoor shower. The service at the resort was top notch. Every single person we came in contact with greeted us with a smile and was more than helpful with any requests we had. The friendliness and kindness of the staff felt very authentic. No request was ever to much. The staff did whatever they could to accommodate us. Breakfast is a real treat here. If you order the American breakfast room service it \u2019s quite an indulgent affair. Maybe the best room service breakfast I \u2019ve ever had. We also ate lunch at the pool and at Sundara. The food was very good but not great. Grabbing sundowners at Sundara is a must. Great drinks sunset views and live music. The only letdown for this hotel is the surround area and beach. Jimbaran is really quiet and there is n\u2019t much to do in the immediate area. Also Jimbaran Bay looks so picturesque from the villas or the lobby but up close it \u2019s a bit disappointing. The water is cloudy and brown. The beach is n\u2019t clean and there \u2019s quite a bit of trash. The portion of beach in front of the hotel is the cleanest and they do an admirable job of keeping clean. That being said if you were looking for a perfect white sandy beach with clear blue water this is n\u2019t it. You will have better luck with water quality at the souther tip of the peninsula uluwatu.", "offset": [1474, 1581], "date": "2019-07-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "0e97609d-38d3-41e5-8719-1887a390a1e7", "sentence": "The best in Jimbaran. Absolutely amazing. If you are looking to stay in a top notch hotel in Jimbaran then this is the one to stay in. Despite it being a big name hotel we really felt like we were in a boutique hotel. High personal attention from the staff and the villas are are splendid. We visited the other top 5 star hotels in the area and are very happy we chose Four Seasons vs the other alternatives. It is quiet and romantic if you need privacy but you can also experience a higher tempo stay if you decide to leave the comfort of your villa and wander in the hotel. We opted for an upgrade while in our Deluxe Jimbaran View Villa and were given a great deal to move up to the first row OCEAN VIEW Villa which was even bigger. There is even an outdoor shower that gives you the feel that you are taking a shower in the jungle. The food from breakfast or lunch in the room or lunch dining at SUNDARA are all a 1010. Spending the day at Sundara beach club is a must good food happy hours a great sunset live band at night and a beautiful view of the ocean. They have plenty of activities in the hotel itself. We tried the Surfing 101 lesson as well as the anti gravity yoga and they were really fun. Concierge is very helpful and will make great suggestions for some days nights outside of the hotel to make your Jimbaran experience complete. We stayed there for our honeymoon but noticed a lot of couples were there accompanied by their kids and everyone seemed to be having fun.", "offset": [736, 835], "date": "2019-08-17", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "1e3dce60-03e2-4dd4-998f-f9a3247fa080", "sentence": "Garden of Eden. I loved this resort. The hotel is modeled after a Bali village wealthy one at that with each residence having a regal gate. Once inside you have a fully private garden complete with plunge pool and outside shower. The Adam and Eve will come out of you as you bask in the sun dip in your pool and wander around your garden. The interior is just as impressive particularly the luxuroius bath. The staff was always very attentive to every need and extremely friendly. The breakfast buffet was impeccable with Western and Oriental cuisine. I swam in all three of the pools and really enjoyed each particularly the waterfall pool and Watsu pool. The seashore had variety as well. At one end is a nice sandy shore with good waves for surfing. At the other end was a rocky shore that during low tide was delight to wander about looking for tide pools to dip in and shells to collect. The only thing I did not like no fault of Four Seasons was the traffic. Bali has not invested in good roads and so traveling by car to varous destinations is aggravating. Luckily the Four Seasons resort will keep you captivated.", "offset": [339, 406], "date": "2019-09-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}]}
