The vent is too low on the elliptical machines and cold air blows on your head and neck while exercising is quite damaging the blood flow.

Never have I seen such lackadaisical service. Upon leaving Key West I used the highly touted mobile ap to check into the hotel. We arrived four hours later and waited in line to get to the desk to speak to one of the hotel associates. Despite having used the mobile check in function on the ap the process to actually receive a key to the room from an associate was a lengthy and tedious process. There is no separate check in location for mobile check in at this Ritz. After finally wading through the check in process the young lady at the desk informed us she would need to walk us to the room to show us how to get there. With two suitcases two carry on bags and hanging clothes we trudged across the lobby. After traversing the lobby being led by the Ritz associate we arrived at a short flight of stairs where we were forced to carry unassisted our belongings up the flight to a further walk to an elevator. We boarded the elevator and went up two floors where we carried our belongings past the spa and through a hallway of meeting rooms and guest rooms to another elevator which we boarded and descended one floor. We then exited the hallway and walked down another hallway of guestrooms before finally arriving at our room. Upon opening the door one could not help but noticed the frayed carpet in the entry portion of the room. We quickly changed clothes and headed to the beach. The beach attendant very quickly arranged our chairs and towels doing a wonderful job. We mentioned to him we would like to order food and beverage and he assured us he would send someone to take our order. 30 minutes passed and we had yet to see anyone with whom we could place an order. I finally walked back to the area where the towels were and found someone to take our snack order. We then left the beach and stopped in the downstairs restaurant for a meal. After giving our name and room number we were seated where we waited for service. The waiter finally approached our table and begrudgingly took our order not once during the entire meal did he address us by our name which I know to be something Ritz Carlton instills in their employees. After eating we asked for a glass of water. You would have thought we had asked the waiter to consume the contents of the Atlantic Ocean using a straw. As I write this I anticipate a canned reply from management copied and pasted word for word as seems to be their practice at this hotel. Even the responses from management lack the personal attention to detail Ritz Carlton has provided me and millions of other guests at the numerous locations in which I have stayed. In short it is borderline fraud for the name Ritz Carlton to be attached to this chain. It is sad that customers come to this location to stay thinking they are truly staying at a Ritz. They will be missing out on what makes the brand so well loved the wonderful service and attention to detail. Anyone who has come to trust the Ritz brand as I have will be sorely disappointed.

I had the best facial and outdoor massage ever. The massage would have been incredibly awesome inside too. Mabel is quite talented and ever so efficient. I saw they did outdoor massages on the website so I was eager to partake. After a great thorough facial I schleped in bathrobe and slippers down corridors and through the pool area to the very end close to the beach. It turns out my suite was just above but I had not checked in yet. There was disco Caribbean music surrounding us from a neighbouring property and delicious mouthwatering scents wafting through the music. Welcome to Miami. The massage was great. I totally de stressed as Mabel found places that needed attention that I was not aware. Then she topped it with a chilling yet very appreciated cool spray of a high SPF lotion and massaged it in to my warming epidermis. Elegant and naughty. Let me emphasise that this was the best massage I have ever had and if you read my other reviews I have had many. Alonso at the spa desk was quite helpful in arranging everything and the staff sent up a lovely gift to welcome me to the suite. Posh touch.

Not even the other Ritz Carltons in Florida have the same level of amenities as this place. For starters the Dilido Beach Club. They will take you right out to the beach set up an umbrella chairs clean towels and even give you a little table to put food and drinks on. They have a dozen specialty mojitos and daiquiris I had a watermelon mojito with fresh sugar cane. and they will bring them right out to your chair. You will not have to lift a finger and can just enjoy the beach. They will also serve you real actual food not just sandwiches and bring it right out for you to eat. I know of no other hotels in Florida that offer this level of service on the beach. The breakfast was probably the best I have ever had. Such a ridiculous variety of fresh fruit cured meats juices smoked fish pastries cheeses and granola. They also had an omelet station and would make whatever kind of eggs you wanted including eggs Benedict. Great coffee too. All this while sitting next to a floor to ceiling window overlooking the pool beach. They had the door open and a fresh ocean breeze was blowing in while we ate. I mean you feel like you are in heaven or something. The breakfast was included in our rate a total steal but they charge about 100 for a breakfast for two and I would actually say for what they offer it is worth it.

Beautifully appointed with plenty of seating including three chairs and two bedside ottomans. Redecorated flawlessly with lovely white paneled walls and soft touches including area rugs in the bedding area. The lanai was refurnished with a lounge chair table and two patio chairs. The spa was also beautifully refurbished. But I did n\u2019t see another guest in there 6 days in a row. Dining was very pleasant as well. The new lobby bar is very inviting and the resort fee includes two house punch drinks per day. Great place to take in the historic lobby. Also Josh rooms controller was very helpful with club access. I just had to check out the newly remodeled club. It was very quite and the club manager was clearly one of the handful of the leadership team that came from another Ritz Carlton property. The fitness center which I used everyday was about the same. It could definitely use more equipment. One gentlemen truly stood out. Emanuel at the pool had my chair set up in my favorite spot 30 minutes before I arrived at the pool each day. This is exactly what Ritz Carlton service is about. Perfect example of anticipation of guest needs. Top talent is hard to find in Miami and especially Ritz Carlton level of service. This is something you just understand or you don\u2019t. There were a few bumps with housekeeping and inexperienced front desk staff but this is perfectly understandable as they just opened and the previous staff mostly did not return. Also the pool manager was very welcoming as he has greeted me by name for at least ten years. I have stayed here well over 100 nights and I am titanium. I felt very appreciated and recognized as a return guest. My only questionable take away is that the hotel was kind of slow especially the spa. There did n\u2019t seem to be any grand reopening spa or dining promos. I thought that was odd. This study was magical and I already have three return reservation before summer.

The Ritz Carlton SoBe is finally reopenedI literally walked by in horror about 20 times during it \u2019s 2 12 year repair and renovation. I made certain to plan my return stay asap after reopening. Emily in guest relations made certain I had the perfect room. THANK YOU. My lanai room had a blissful pool partial ocean view on the 4th floor. Beautifully appointed with plenty of seating including three chairs and two bedside ottomans. Redecorated flawlessly with lovely white paneled walls and soft touches including area rugs in the bedding area. The lanai was refurnished with a lounge chair table and two patio chairs. The spa was also beautifully refurbished. But I did n\u2019t see another guest in there 6 days in a row. Dining was very pleasant as well. The new lobby bar is very inviting and the resort fee includes two house punch drinks per day. Great place to take in the historic lobby. Also Josh rooms controller was very helpful with club access. I just had to check out the newly remodeled club. It was very quite and the club manager was clearly one of the handful of the leadership team that came from another Ritz Carlton property. The fitness center which I used everyday was about the same. It could definitely use more equipment. One gentlemen truly stood out. Emanuel at the pool had my chair set up in my favorite spot 30 minutes before I arrived at the pool each day. This is exactly what Ritz Carlton service is about. Perfect example of anticipation of guest needs. Top talent is hard to find in Miami and especially Ritz Carlton level of service. This is something you just understand or you don\u2019t. There were a few bumps with housekeeping and inexperienced front desk staff but this is perfectly understandable as they just opened and the previous staff mostly did not return. Also the pool manager was very welcoming as he has greeted me by name for at least ten years. I have stayed here well over 100 nights and I am titanium.
