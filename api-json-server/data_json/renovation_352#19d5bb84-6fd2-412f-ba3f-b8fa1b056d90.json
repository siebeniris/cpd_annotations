This is the first less than stellar review I have written. I think our problems stemmed from inter departmental communication issues. We stayed in Room 31545 for 3 nights. First off the remodel from the old Sahara looks really good. The lobby casino and pool area all look great. The rooms also have received a nice update and they feel much larger than they are. Additionally the staff were generally very professional and upbeat. I decided to take the girlfriend to Vegas for a 3 night stay. I also wanted to set up a big surprise for my girlfriend which took some planning and help from the concierge and thanks to said concierge it went off without a hitch. Thank you Concierge Guy whose name I forgotAgain. I hate to leave a bad review especially for a place that has the potential that the SLS has but here goes. I will state upfront so as to avoid the appearance of being unfair. After the problems we experienced our Resort Fees were comped and we received a 50 FB credit which paid for one round of beers for me my girlfriend and our two friends at the Bier Garten. it is worth mentioning that the 30 per night resort fees which cover complimentary fitness center access local and toll free phone calls access to the pools and in room Internet access were 95 unused by anyone in our group. My girlfriend and my friends wife hung out by the pool for a few hours and I used about an hours worth of internet access. The problem started when we arrived back to the room very late our first night after being away for several hours. When we opened the door an incredibly unpleasant odor greeted us. If you have ever experienced the odor that occurs when plumbing is not vented correctly then you know what I am talking about. a raw sewage smell. I immediately called guest services to report the problem and was told someone would be by the room the next day which was fine by me. it was late. He suggested noon since I was calling at 3 AM which would allow us to sleep in. We left the room about 1030 that morning and were away until very late again. As soon as we walked in the room the smell had changed from extremely unpleasant to almost overwhelming. Obviously nobody had been sent contrary to our agreement to address the problem. I called guest services again and spoke with the same guy from the previous night morning. He remembered speaking with me apologized and told me someone would be by the next day about the same time nonThe next day after being away from late morning until early evening we arrived back to the room who is odor had gone from almost overwhelming to almost unbearable. Again nobody had been in the room to address the issue. I called guest services again and they finally sent someone to the room. The guy they sent was great like most of the staff but was unable to solve the problem. Instead he sprayed some deodorizer in the A C return which seemed to immediately help. It was a nice fresh smell. After leaving that evening for dinner and arriving back we realized that the deodorizer had simply combined with the sewage smell instead of eliminating it. At least the odor was new I suppose. I can only assume that the cause of the horrid smell may have been the cause of me and the girlfriend waking up each morning with extreme sinus congestion and sore throats which abated shortly after we left the room each day. I can guarantee that the smell was the cause of the need to launder every stitch of clothing we had taken even the clean unused stuff upon returning home and febrezing the heck out of our luggage. Also our friends across the hall began to experience the same odor in their room but only after the 2nd night and not as overwhelming as our room. All in all I could not recommend the SLS in its current state. I have to assume that not all rooms have this problem but since it happened in our room and a room across the hall I also have to assume that this is a known issue. But for the one and wholly undeniable issue the place is great. The problem is that the SLS is a hotel. Hotel rooms should be habitable. We enjoyed our time at the bar and casino but we paid for that except for one round of beers. The room probably should have been entirely comped but instead at check out I had to convince the lady at the front desk that I was supposed to be comped the resort fees for all 3 nights because her notes only showed comped for 2A swing and a miss for the SLS. it is a shame because I really wanted to be able to rave about this place.

We will not return to the SLS.", "offset": [233, 293], "date": "2016-04-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "92733ce8-4968-442e-9c09-b95620a0caa4", "sentence": "Wonderful Hotel and Casino for couples.

I have to finish with this for the price it is a really really good deal. It is absolutely worth the price we paid. I rated it only average however based on location the casino and the simple fact that it \u2019s just not up to the standard of the properties all around it.

I recently stayed at the Sahara for the first time for a business trip. My room was on the end of hallway and quiet. I liked using my room key to work the elevator. I also liked that my elevator was close to the self parking garage. It was always an easy transition. Parking is free like it should be. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. I skipped daily cleaning and was given a few extra towels when I asked. The Fridge has a small freezer section big enough for an ice pack. Ice is available on another floor. You need the upgrade to get coffee in the room so I went with cold coffee in a bottle. The pools all three were closed for renovation. As a swimmer this could have been killer but I was busy with other things. It was my fault for not clearing the situation ahead of time. I expect the finished product will be nice. What set the Sahara apart for me was the customer service. My business partner and I needed some immediate help having missed the closure of the FedEx Ship Center. it is an unmanned center I believe. We had urgent correspondence that needed to go out tonight. it is our fault that we waited. Symone was not only friendly but helpful. She showed a great deal of patience as she cheerfully helped us with scanning and transmitting a document. I loved that we chatted while she was willing to repeat the process or try again or whatever was necessary. I actually had a very stressful day waiting to hear from my godson who lives in Nashville because of the tornados. I do n\u2019t need to share details. Having to get this correspondence out tonight could have been another real stressor. I credit Symone with me helping to finish the day well. I did not mention my personal issues but I do not think it would have mattered. I expect she is the same with everyone. She is effervescent and would be a credit to ANY customer service team. So in the end it was a good stay. I heard from my godson and got an important document to its destination.
