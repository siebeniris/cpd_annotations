As if Hilton Head SC was enuf for us we ventured the other direction to the Hawaiian islands. We booked our weeks stay thru Costco that included airfare 2 rental cars and 2 rooms. Valet service is free on the first day then 30 day thereafter. There is also a 35 per rom per day fee that includes the 20 day self parking lot. Check. in was lengthy as we were trying to get both of our rooms near each other. We ended up 2 floors apart but that did not turn out to be a problem. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. Balconies a bit on the small side but every room offers a good view. Some of the views are partially obscured by the palm trees of the facility other times they add to the charm. The grounds are well presented access is very easy to everything. The swimming pools have extension canals where you can swim under multiple walking bridges to water slides and a kidie pool area with a basketball hoop set up. You are issued towel markers small cards that l get you a clean fresh towel daily but you must return the towel to get your card back. You may be charged for unreturned towels. Mind you we are paying over 3 bills a nite for our rooms and they are worried about towels. We got a 250 food credit per room for the week. Not including alcoholic beverages. I believe you can get soft drinks but they had be of the bar issued full of ice variety. We went out to Safeway 2 mi to satisfy our needs. There is a small fridge in the rooms so pack it wisely. There is an in room safe at 2 day paying over 300 nite. We ate a few times at the Black a Rock Steak and Seafood restaurant on site. Average entree was 36 41 each which incl complimentary bread butter and not much more. Although the prices are expensive the food was great. Service was spotty depending on your server not much in the way of views from your table. Expect to pay close to or above 100 for two depending on drink choices. The restaurant doubles as a cafe in the am for breakfast buffet. Supposedly valued at 30 the food selection is equal to Holiday Inn Express in variety and presentation. There are plenty of fresh fruits smoked salmon and 3 waffle irons to serve you. For some reason they really like brown meat. I mean that the sausage bacon etc is always cooked to a deep brown color. Do they know something I do not. Coffee is plentiful but the juice glasses are of the 6 oz size and do not seem to be filled too frequently without asking. They do offer fresh made to order omelets. They are great. If you do not like the looks of the grits like texture of the scrambled eggs be sure to persue an omelet you will not be disappointed. The cocktails are very good 12 and a good start to your premium meal. No soup no salad offered and veggies with the meal are minimal. They use large plates to serve and with the smaller portions it appears visually compromised. But like I said the food is very well prepared. At these prices it will not take long for your food credit to get used up. Room staff is very friendly as are most of the resort staff they always greet you with a smile and an Aloha as they pass by you. When you first drive up to the front door the valets will get your luggage and help you to your room. they will also fit you with a shell lei upon your arrival. nice touch. The facility grounds are well maintained. there is a 3hole putting green so so condition. putter ball free to use from the towel shack. there is a Koi pond around the Black Rock Cafe where you will find 18 fish that l eyeball you and size you up for dinner. The only negative I can say about the grounds are the wind blown napkins plastic cups that get caught in the bushes at the outside restaurants bars. I found it a bit disappointing that sipomething so preventable would be seen by the paying public. There are also some lawn games bean bag toss and a connect 4 themed that are fun to enjoy. Luxury prices yes. but I had stay here again just do not let the accrued bill get away from you. Very safe very comfortable. indeed a pleasurable stay awaits you. Every evening a half hour before sundown the resort performs an ancient ceremony of lightning the tiki torches on the property by a young ceremonial warrior who runs from torch to torch lighting them and concludes his effort by scaling the beach side of Black Rock to light the torches there. there is a narrator nearby who explains his ritual and the runner finishes his duties by bowing and paying homage to the Sun God Ra. then casting his sarong then his torch into the waves and lastly jumping the 30 ft or so into the water and swimming back to the beach. Do nt miss it. If you want to go to nearby Whalers Village for food dinner it is a short walk down the paved beach walk path filled with views and people. We ate at Leilanis one eve and had a great meal. You got ta try the Coconut Grove cocktail a bargain at 10. I splurged for 2 during my visit because they were so good.

As expected this is a mid range resort with access to a great beach and only a short drive from Lahaina. Overall the experience was fine. The staff is great. Rooms were clean. The food on property was ok. Honestly there was nothing major to really complain about but there are a few things that I want to share with others who are planning to stay here. One thing to note right off the top is that this hotel seems better suited for families than it is for couples and we stayed here as a couple. We booked a partial view room and upgraded to an ocean view room in the Moana wing when we arrived. This included access to a lounge for deluxe continental breakfast in the morning and pupus cocktails in the evening. Though we have no regrets with the upgrade we would definitely NOT do it again. The ocean view rooms do have great views so if you plan on staying in your room for a lot of your stay it might be worth it. For us we hit the beach as soon as we woke up and did not get back to the room until the evening when it was dark and not much of a view. The special lounge access was a bust. We decided that the only thing it was good for was to grab a few bottles of water in the morning and evening. We did not eat at every restaurant on property. The food we did have was ok except for the nachos at the Cliff Dive Bar do not order those unles you like cheese sauce nachos which I do when I am at the ballpark but nowhere else. but nothing special. I recommend planning to eat dinners off property. There are great places to eat in Lahaina Paia Fish Market Mala Ocean Tavern. Star Noodle that are easily accessible by the hotel shuttle. Or if you have a car there are wonderful places all over the island Maui Brewing Co Morimoto at the Andaz if you want an amazing dining experience try the omakase menu Mamas Fish House Sam Satos to name a few. The only meal I would recommend eating on property is breakfast. the Black Rock Grills morning buffet is a good way to start the day. If you can book the room with breakfast included I recommend going that route. The Beach As expected the beach is fantastic. What was not fantastic was the additional cost to rent beach furniture 55 for a cabana 45 for two chaises and an umbrella snorkeling gear and pretty much anything related to being on the beach except for towels. We felt nickeled and dimed for items that we thought any hotel would provide to guests as part of the resort fee or include in the 300 rate for a room night. As a beach hotel we thought the way the Sheraton managed beach amenities for their guests was lacking. Also because it is a public beach you are not supposed to take alcoholic beverages from the hotel bars onto the beach though I did not notice anyone really enforcing that policy. If we were to stay here again we would either bring or purchase a soft cooler and buy our own refreshments for the beach. There are a couple of fees to be aware of 25 resort fee which includes internet access and a shuttle to Lahaina and other SPG properties. 20 self parking30 valet parking. So overall the experience at the hotel was average. The Maui experience was amazing. We will definitely be going back to Maui but it is not likely we will stay at the Sheraton again.", "offset": [1944, 2012], "date": "2017-04-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "261a12ad-0cbf-4e6c-a20f-fc3fe4eb3b08", "sentence": "Location Great Rooms not so much.

What we had was a sliding glass door which opened on to a Romeo Juliet balconet which held no one not even room for a chair. If you read their literature it describes the room as 320 square feet and balcony. Very well misrepresented. While the room and fees left a bit to be desired all and all we had a very nice time.

Decided to stay here because of the location it is expensive but for a first time Maui experience it was acceptable to splurge out a bit. We self parked our rental car but then could not find the entrance to the hotel. No signage anywhere in the garage. We had to walk through a building rooms carry our suitcase and bags up two flights of stairs to get to the front desk. Noah checked us in provided outstanding service and we were given keys to our room. The room decor was nice it had clean bed sheets and bathroom towels somewhat off decor of an arm chair large TV mini fridge and a work desk with a chair. The view was beautiful. The downside of the balcony was that it only had one chair and a table. The bathroom was old the shower curtain had holes and tiles appeared to have mildew. The bathroom came with plenty of towels hairdryer and shampoos etc. and hairs of previous guests. The resort is beautiful nice short walking distance to the beach which also is a public beach. Not enough seating around the pool for all hotel guests and reclining chairs on the beach were by rental. The hotel provided pool towels with a towel card. One of the pool bars closed very early too early leaving the smaller one to be packed with people. The worst was the lack of restrooms in the lobby and the pool beach area. There was only one restroom with two stalls and one sink for the beach goers. Room service experience was great again expensive and limited for the breakfast items. We had to order and receive food the night before because we had an early wakeup call to go on a snorkeling trip kitchen is not open so early but it was much appreciated to have little options to order the night before. Restaurant experience was very good as well the food was delicious. Service was good too. Parking was 20 per day in and out privilege. Parking was also available outside our building which was better than navigating to and from the garage.

I was so excited to stay at the Sheraton Maui for my Honeymoon. I picked it so that we could enjoy the resort feel and my husband and I could just relax knowing everything was taken care of. We paid more than we would normally pay because we were interested in the amenities a resort provides. I really wanted it to be a special trip for my husband. Our first two days were relatively uneventful but not without hiccups. When we arrived the staff was pleasant but there was no lei or little special treat to make you get into the resort mood that I have experienced at less expensive Hawaiian resorts in the past. I let them know it was our honeymoon and we were n\u2019t even congratulated. We found our room and it was fine except that the AC is either on full blast or not at all. We went down to the pool and enjoyed one of the pool bar restaurants where the waitress was very nice and gave us some great recommendations for places to visit. We did notice as everyone else has mentioned that there were not enough pool chairs at the pool. The next day we noticed a steep decline in service at the restaurants. Our waiter in the morning seemed distracted and missed my husbands order. Finally we would n\u2019t care but we were in a hurry to get to the ferry and could n\u2019t wait for them to cook it for him. The waiter was very nice and offered for him to get whatever he wanted from the buffet but my husband was feeling grumpy and we had to go. The next day we tried to eat at the buffet again and my husband enjoyed his food but they ran out of a lot and had long wait times to replenish it 10 minutes for more oatmeal and no one came to refill our coffee or water which was frustrating because again we were in a relative hurry and the buffet was rather expensive. The next day we skipped breakfast at the hotel and ate off property but we came back to the bar restaurant we had previously enjoyed. This time the staff seemed again distracted no one came to greet us once we did flag someone down and ordered it took a while to get our food and no one came to refill our water or our drinks. The man who was working was covering too many tables which I think was the same issue at the buffet. The entire experience up to this point was not living up to what we expected service was lacking it did n\u2019t feel special and every little thing was an upcharge or a hassle. But we were still ignoring the bad and just enjoying the vacation and Maui in general. The next morning things got much worse. We were up early to take a day tour and noticed a paper posted in the elevator that said there was a work stoppage and that housekeeping service would be effected as well as the restaurants. It was worded in a way that made it seem like services would be slightly impacted and did n\u2019t spell out what was actually about to happen. When we got back from our trip there no more information slipped under our door or left in a message. There was trash left down our hallway and a pile of towels and toiletries on a table near the elevator. What the strike actually meant is that there is no housekeeping service to the rooms you can pick up your own towels though. All the bars and restaurants are closed. They do have a bunch of what appear to be teenagers serving a limited menu of maybe 7 items in one of the buildings and running the buffet. No one from the hotel thought that maybe they should consider people with dietary restrictions when making up their menu. The kids working the room seem nice but burgers in take out containers being served with plastic cutlery is n\u2019t what I signed up for when I paid more to stay at a nice resort. When you come back from a tour you do n\u2019t want to arrange for transportation to other hotels so you can eat somewhere else. The closing of the pool bar saddens us the most because we came here for the pool and planned to spend the last few days of our honeymoon out there enjoying the amenities and relaxing before heading back to work. Tonight they left trash bags by our door without any explanation. Judging from the debris in the hallway I think we are supposed to bundle up dirty towels or maybe the trash and throw it out there. It would be nice if they told us or updated us at all. I went to the desk last night to ask what they were going to do to make this better for the guests and all they offered was to waive the 26 daily resort fee. I feel like this is a good beginning but they act like not having these amenities is n\u2019t really a big deal and that they \u2019re doing us a favor by offering anything. I think that \u2019s BS. People paid more to stay here precisely for the things that are no longer available and the price difference when I was booking between hotels with fewer amenities and this resort was much more than 26 a day. I plan to approach the front desk again tomorrow and will amend this review if they do anything to rectify the situation. I bear no ill will to those on the picket lines. If this is how corporate for this hotel sees fit to treat paying guests I can only imagine how they treat their staff.", "offset": [3208, 3248], "date": "2018-10-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "4bdc9f8f-ed21-4adc-9113-293fdaec6082", "sentence": "We paid for a resort experience that we did not get. Beyond frustrating. I have never been so disappointed in a vacation hotel experience. Just got home from the Sheraton Maui. We arrived there on Saturday Oct 6th and had dinner and then a lovely day on Sunday by the pool having drinks lunch etc. We headed out very early on Monday to drive the road to Hana and got back 11 hours later exhausted. We learned about the strike when we got to our room and housekeeping had not been there. Thought it was odd and then called room service to order a glass of champagne to enjoy while we cleaned up from the day and mention that housekeeping had not been there. That was when we found out there was a strike and no housekeeping no room service restaurants were closed etc. So for the rest of the week we picked up our own coffee toiletries etc set out near the elevators bagged our trash and towels and set them outside the door etc. This is not the resort experience that we paid for and it is so extremely disappointing. It was our 20th anniversary trip. We do not normally spring for the big resort experience but this time we decided it was the time to do it and went for the resort and upgraded our room to an ocean view room. During planning months ago a family member even offered us their time share but we declined because for this special occasion we wanted the resort experience. Right on the beach drinks served to us while we lounge by the pool restaurants on site etc. So we were willing to pay and get all that for our special occasion. All that resort experience that we went for was gone. They continued their breakfast service on a partial scale and on paper plates. The only polside service was drinks at one of the bars the other was closed. And no food at the polside bar. The only food available was boxed hamburger hotdog lunches that you could to get in the inside bar. And the inside bar was only serving beer and soda. They told us we had to go outside for any wine service. The outside bar had awful wine and I get it it is not the place you go to for a glass of good wine. But being a wine drinker and seeing the case full of great wines in the restaurant that we could not get was another frustration. The notification on this is our biggest complaint. We knew nothing prior to going that this was a possibility and even after it happened the only notification was signs posted by the elevators in the lobby etc. I do get workers right to strike but this has severely impacted us and hundreds of others that spent big money and had our dream trips thwarted. KEEP YOUR GUESTS INFORMED. it is that easy to preserve good will. One other strike related event that was not right The striking workers were walking their picket line and not bothering us guests as we went in and out of the hotel. But one night there was an event on the lawn a reception for people that were there for a business convention. As we were headed out for the night on the beach walk we saw the striking workers had re positioned themselves from the hotel beach entrance to move down onto the beach just outside the reception that was taking place. They were yelling into the reception and trying to cause disruption to their event. Beyond rude. Just like our hotel room that event was I am sure booked months ago with no knowledge of the impending strike.

Try relaxing while listening to people chant for an hour it is great. We were initially disappointed to learn about the restaurants being closed but could have gotten over that. The protesting made it absolutely impossible to enjoy your time at the resort. I ended up talking to the protesters at some point and was told that they announced that they would be striking this month to the hotel 6 months ago if negotiations were not held and the company did absolutely nothing to negotiate with them until they started striking. So the hotel knew for 6 months that all of their guests experiences would be ruined this month they did nothing to work with their staff to resolve things did nothing to replace their staff and did nothing to notify their guests that their stay would be impacted by these activities.

We got breakfast at the one restaurant that was open on our wedding day asked if we could take it up to our room because we wanted to start getting ready and were told no this is not room service. Yeah thanks we had planned to order room service on our wedding day if only it was actually available. I am just glad my actual wedding was at a restaurant and not on the property. Some other poor bride did have her wedding at the resort while we were there and had protesters shouting at her wedding. She was sobbing. How absolutely unacceptable is it to know that this will be occurring and not give your guests a heads up. I have traveled quite a bit and have stayed at a lot of hotels ranging from quaint bargain places to nice resorts and I have never in my life been even remotely this dissatisfied. I would highly recommend avoiding this hotel. Clearly any hotel that does not bother notifying guests until they check in that their entire stay will be impacted by something this drastic does not value customer satisfaction and is not a safe choice to book.", "offset": [1670, 1747], "date": "2018-11-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "5fa510ed-30b1-41ec-8475-744cd1d6edcf", "sentence": "Thanks for Another Great Stay. We have been staying with the Sheraton Maui since 201 after a few years of trying out hotels on the other side of Black Rock. Even honeymooned here in 2016. Yet to have a bad experience this trip was no exception. My husband and I stayed in one of the newly remodeled ocean view rooms and my family stayed in one of the suites. Both rooms were clean and quiet. Upon arrival we were upgraded from a partial ocean view to ocean view with a king size bed near the suites where my family was staying which was really awesome and we were so appreciative. Though I see reviews that mention the room size we found our room perfectly sized for two people with 2 weeks worth of clothing in their suitcases. But maybe that is just me if you are visiting Hawaii to sit in your hotel room you are doing it wrong. The staff is one of the main reasons we continue to return. We spent a lot of time at the Cliff Dive Bar and had breakfast at the hotel every other morning or so. Every single person we interacted with was friendly and welcoming. do not ever change thatAnother reason we continue to stay here is the unbeatable location. Black Rock and Kanapali Beach is literally STEPS from the resort. We spent a lot of time snorkeling and swimming at Black Rock and it is insanely convenient to jump right back into your pool chair and mai tais. Whalers Village with additional dining and shopping is a 5 minute walk up the boardwalk. Lahaina is a 5 minute drive. The grounds are open and airy plenty of amenities without the feel of a mega resort which my husband and I both appreciate. We have recommended this hotel to friends honeymooning who had a wonderful time and to others who are planning trips to Maui. We will continue to do just that.

On this particular property there are limited stores and restaurants. We were also charged a fee to park a car when we did not travel to the hotel with a car.

We traveled to this hotel as part of a business trip. I will start with the lobby and go from there. The lobby is a large open air space which is great if the weather is nice. However we landed during a stormy rainy week and it was very cold and windy waiting to get through check in. The lobby s quite large. yet they only have two stations to check people in. The rest of the space is taken up by tour companies and the concierge. A re configuration of this space would alleviate people having to wait in rainy and cold conditions to check in and out. We were assigned an ocean view suite which had a really nice view of the front grounds pool and front beach area. I will say that although the room was nice. it felt dated. Maybe its the orange colors or the brown carpet. Carpet in a tropical location feels strange. But that could be just my personal opinion. The balcony was lovely. however we requested a room change the next day because I had preferred ocean front so I could watch the whales from our room. Thankfully they were able to do. We moved to the Moana building which is directly on the ocean not the beach. but the ocean close to black rock. We had a king sized room and although smaller than the suite the colors and decor were much better and the view was fantastic. 5 stars on the room and the view in this location. I will advise those that it is a long walk to get back and forth from main areas. so not for everyone. Pool areas were nice cabana and towels were confusing. There is a hut to get towels and they ask for your room number. yet people left towels everyday on their chairs and never returned so why bother. The guy at the hut were also busy selling sunglasses and other items including cabanas. although there was no information about this anywhere. So I do nt know if taking room number and returning towels is just for show. The beach is public. so sometimes they would give out wrist bands and sometimes not. This needs to be worked on. Onto the restaurants they were all kind of a disappointment. For what they charge for food and drinks which is to be expected in HI no matter where you go. You still expect a level of quality which we did not find in the food. The drinks were good. the Lava drink was quite tasty. Service was not noteworthy at any restaurants with the exception of Micheal at the Rock bar restaurant who makes a great drink and was very friendly. The Rock food was basic bar food you can order off the main menu which we did and it was decent. Nothing awesome. it was quite a surprise the the fresh catch of the day was 48 and price not listed on the menu. Our friends had wings and burgers typical hotel food but not what I would expect from a resort. We ate at the Japanese steak house and it was the one exception and quite good. We also had the breakfast buffet and although it had a wide variety and quality was good. it was 35 p. In this day and age when you get an almost identical spread at any Embassy Suites in the US it felt crazy expensive. Also buffet is somewhat outdated with people trying to be more healthy I think you could get away with those prices for a cooked to order breakfast where people feel like it was made just for them. Or offer options both a menu and a smaller continental buffet option. But that was the only option unles you wanted to go to Starbucks cart. My friend had oatmeal and coffee. he said that s the most expensive bowl of oatmeal I have ever had. The grounds and hotel location were immaculate and people were always working to keep it pristine. Pools were too cold to get into and maybe should consider heating them during winter seasons. Walking distance to the shopping village and also the beach walking path in both directions made this hotel stand out.

The other options are so overpriced I paid 20 for a veggie burger and bag of chips at the bar that you might as well just pay for the buffet and enjoy it. You can rent snorkel gear on the beach for a very reasonable cost 8 an hour. The snorkeling is some of the best I \u2019ve ever seen. We saw a turtle and it swam right up to us.

We arrived around 5 pm on 113. Check in was easy fairly quick. Because of the construction this was done in an open air area one level above check in parking. We used our suite night awards to upgrade to an ocean front room located in building 6 top floor. Room. Pros it was roomy appeared to have been renovated in the last year. View was outstanding overlooking Blackrock. Service was friendly mostly on time each morning. Had a fairly close walk to the fitness room. Our only gripe would be that our only option for this room was 2 double beds. Had these been queen size it would have been fine but when you are use to a king a double can be a little snug. I have seen many have issues with the length of the walk from building 6 to pool bars etc. Yes it is a hike but the privacy quietness made it worth it for us we do a lot of walking anyway. Pools. Were great we never had an issue finding a place to sit. If you wanted to get chairs that were also covered by an umbrella you had to play the put your things out early game which we did a couple of times. Since we were spending 400 per night we did not mind taking our yetis to the pool area frankly many others did the same. We did order a good lunch a couple days from the pool bar service was always friendly. Most lunch items were 1520 beers are 7. The only Con I can think of is they could use some more of the water pillows as these were hard to come by at times. The free sunscreen was a great amenity. Beach could not be better. Very wide this time of year if you like to snorkle you could not beat location. We had brought our own gear so we did this at least a couple times each day. Current waves were manageable. We actually went all the way around the blackrock outside area. Tons of fish. if you go earlier in the morning 8 10 there is a good chance to see the large turtles. We stopped at Wal Mart 1 mile from airport bought two beach chairs for 13 each an umbrella for 10 less than the cost of renting for one day on property. We did notice a short walk down the beach path. in front of another property they were advertising 2 chairs umbrella snorkle gear for two boogie boards a cooler for 99 for 5 days. IMO that would be a bargain even if you only used it sparingly over your week. Restaurants. The only meal we ate on property was at their Japanese Restaurant. Typical chef show ours was very entertaining. Food was more than plentiful quality was very good. Only Con is pricing but we knew that when we went there. My wife I are not huge eaters so we generally split entrees when we dine out. There was a 20 split fee here so she ended up ordering the veggie dinner which was only 22. I had the shrimp lobster which was 42. Wine split was 28 my beer was 8. One of the most enjoyable perks was we received free breakfast buffet each day because of my Mariot status. This was great. Not sure what the normal charge would have been but I am sure it was pricey. They had anything you could possible want. Made to order omelets egg frittatas scrambled eggs 4 or 5 choices of meat bacon sausages our favorite fresh mahi mahi tons of fresh fruit yogurt cereals pastries juices great coffee. Overall Resort. Excellent considering it is over 55 years old. Sure there are some areas that could use some additional renovation but overall we were more than pleased with our stay. Local Area. As great as the property itself is we really enjoyed the convenient location to visit other areas. Only a 10 minute walk to Whalers Village which has many stores several restaurants. We only ate here one evening bar at the Hula Grill. it was very good. As with all dining in Hawaii prices are fairly steep but we did not have a bad meal. One great perk with the Sheraton is they have a shuttle that runs every hour until around 100 in the evening to Lahaina. We used this every night to go out to dinner. It makes a stop at the Westin the Safeway the Outlets last stop is the Wharf. it is free you can catch it back if you plan your timing right. We ended up using Uber to come back each night that ran 13Al in all just a very good visit for our first time to the island.", "offset": [1308, 1347], "date": "2019-11-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "33f8fdda-5ad1-4505-8a28-34c2fa652141", "sentence": "Currently staying here and surprisingly disappointed. I am surprised i have to write a review on a public forum during my stay. I never review properties until I finished my stay. I am currently staying here and reserved a ocean view suite. Reservation was done 3 4 months in advance Imp later and we chose chose this property over other Mariot other brand properties due to a recommendations. Between points and cash I am paying 80 a night. This is for our 5th anniversary and I hiped up the resort to my spouse and I am regretting my choices. I try to not let small issues bother me but it \u2019s like death by 1000 cuts where several issues is making this stay pretty disappointing. First I am titanium elite member and at this location that does n\u2019t mean much as there are \u201c 30 elite members currently staying \u201d. Do n\u2019t count on using upgrade nights. It will be denied. So much for guaranteed upgrades from Mariot. Since we booked several months in advance we were hoping on the \u201c delux ocean front suites \u201d which have the best views. Essentially no rooms are available and upgrade requests are denied. Besides that no early checkin no room request preferences are honored Ie away from elevator etc. Late checkout is not guaranteed. Parking is taken care of for titanium so it \u2019s nice. But there is still 30 day resort fees regardless you use the services it covers. These DOES NOT include beach chairs and umbrella rentals which are another 60 a day. Just go down the street and there are rentals for 50 an entire week. you just have to drag them over to the beachSecond Property is still under construction since I booked it a few months ago I have checked in to see when it would be competed. Kept hearing Nov 2019. Today is Nov 26th and it \u2019s no where near complete. You will run into the construction workers with hard hats in the elevator. just not a expected view on a resort. Customer service is lack luster. If you ask for service there are prompt but there is no welcoming feeling at this resort. It \u2019s \u201c let me do my job and do n\u2019t bother me \u201d. Every thing from valet to bar service is the same. As other guests mentioned the WiFi is terrible. My 1 bar Mobile LET is faster. They have a complimentary photography session on the beach. But guess what their agreement with the photographer fell through it seems and the service is not offered. But still advertised. I had to make several calls to find this info. They were not apologetic about. Just a \u201c this is how it is\u201d. Now to my primary issue ignoring all others I booked an ocean view suite and per the pictures on Mariot website it looked like a full ocean view. Did my research on TripAdvisor other sites and confirmed the same. After the room upgrade request denial debacle we check in the room and what do we get a view of the breakfast area and some construction. It \u2019s not a full beach view but partial. I can sit here and argue the semantics of the beach view description but we essentially ended up with little or no beach view from majority of the room. the way the room is designed unles you stay to a corner of the room you do n\u2019t see the beach or black rock. Neither from living room not from the bed room. The curtains do it fold to the side completely so it blocks 13 of the beach view. I can post pics if I were n\u2019t on mobileIn addition to the view there are other issues. 1. broken TV in the living room of the suite. One of the previous guests must have thrown something at the TV and screen is broken. So we ca n\u2019t sit and enjoy the TV nor the beach view. There is no solution for it yet. In other hotels I stayed the AV person is sent out to immediately replace the TV or have some other arrangements. 2. Smallest balcony compared to other buildings rooms. This suite is located at the corner of the building thus has the small balcony due to architecture choices. Ca n\u2019t sit there and stretch my legs. 3 ft depth. Back to the wall and knee to the wall. Ca n\u2019t even enjoy the sunset from balcony due to the space issue. It \u2019s wide but that \u2019s besides the pointWhat am I paying the 80 a night for. I have had significant better stays at other resorts and regretting choosing this resort for my 5th anniversary. The biggest issue i have is the lack of response regarding the issues above. If they were accommodating I would n\u2019t be here writing the review. It \u2019s ridiculous that I has to follow up several times and still have n\u2019t received a response. \u201c Customer service manager will contact you \u201d is all I got. We have n\u2019t explored rest of the resort and wonder what other disappointments we will encounter. Disappointing and Regret might be few good words that would describe my stay so far.
