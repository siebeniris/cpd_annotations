We were in Bali on a holiday and there was a 3 day work conference course in Singapore for my partner and because we were so close he decided to attend. We had heard about Raffles but then again who has not. This hotel is legendary. When we arrived we were even more impressed as the white colonial building is even more beautiful in real life. As you pull up to the entrance of the hotel you are welcomed by an adorned uniformed Sikh doorman which sets the tone of grandeur from the moment you step out of the car. When you first walk through the spacious marble lobby its warmly lit and dotted around with period plush furnishings mixed with classic Asian rosewood furniture you immediately feel nostalgia sweeping over you as you are whisked away to the era of Hemingway and Rudyard Kipling. The service is impecibly attentive professional smart and friendly. We had booked the Palm Court Suites and they were enormous in comparison to standard hotel rooms. It was like having a one bedroom apartment. You entered the room which had an alcove or sunroom with a table setting which could be used for breakfast. The main room was a very large open room with a periodic king sized bed chaise television and wardrobe. The complete floor to ceiling marble bathroom was periodic with brass finishes. You feel like you have stepped back in time. As you leave your room the big wide verandah with the contrasting dark polish teak floors offer enough room for cane table and chairs in front of each room. As you walk down the verandah you can imagine Hemingway dressed in linen sipping on a drink. This place just oozes nostalgia and history at every turn and I loved it. The pool area was a nice spot to spend the afternoon relaxing and you can order lunch there and I was lucky as it was just me most of the time. The club sandwich is one of the best I have ever had but for nearly 50 so it should be. The breakfast buffet in the Tiffin room was a big highlight and fabulous. Beautifully English silverware white table cloths white gloves and fine bone china tea cups it was like having all your favourite high tea pastries and delicacies with the breakfast element. We loved it. The hotel is a 20 min walk to Orchard Road where the main shopping precinct is located. You can find all the major luxury department stores however as Singapore is extremely hot and humid I suggest you catch a cab and not walk. I made that mistake but on the positive side I went found the Singapore Art Museum which was a great find and nice cool escape from the heatFor us Singapore is not really a holiday destination as traditionally it is not a beach or surf holiday destination but rather a place for work or transit however we loved our stay so much that we would fly in especially just to stay at the Raffles again.", "offset": [2451, 2846], "date": "2016-08-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "cfcd5086-feec-4b92-9d30-f10fbbc52747", "sentence": "Majestic retains its presence.

There are many luxury hotels in Singapore. Among them Raffles Hotel which is said to be synonymous with Singapore is an awe inspiring hotel that people from all over the world would like to stay once they come to Singapore. We get the title of the best hotel from many groups every year and of course it is a 5 star hotel. Recognized not only in Singapore but throughout the world the hotel receives international celebrities each year. The Raffles Hotel which opened in 187 has received many celebrities such as writers celebrities and politicians as well as royalty and royalty including Prince Wiliam and his wife Cambridge for many decades. Yes. Located in the heart of Singapore this hotel is a huge favorite with guests and tourists alike. The white covered white chalk building is a colonial style with good old colonial relics creating an excellent contrast with nearby skyscrapers. Now it is a very popular Raffles hotel but from the beginning this building was not open we opened a bungalow with only 10 rooms as a hotel. Facing the front of the hotel is the Beach Road which at the time of its opening was called the beach house because it was by the sea. Later in 189 the current prototype colonial style building was completed and has received high praise from European countries as the finest facilities east of Suez.

The Raffles Hotel Singapore experience begins once you set foot onto the hotel \u2019s distinctive portico. Post rejuvenation the Main Building retains its signature neoclassical architectural features playing it all Corinthian and Doric columns Palladian windows and white marble colonnades at every turn. After being greeted by the hotel \u2019s iconic Sikh doormen in their distinctive white uniforms and turbans you are soon ushered past the front doors into the energetically bright Grand Lobby and the first thing that greets you is the glimmering contemporary chandelier above the grand floral centrepiece both of which stand out dramatically amidst the soaring Raffles white colonial proceedings. There are social spaces created on every level of the three storey Main Building and a casual tour of the premises as well as an inspection of the glorious architecture of the ceiling does generate the requisite awe and taking of ones breath. To pay tribute to the hotels long list of illustrious former guests each hotel keycard bears the likeness of a famous former guest of the hotel I had actress Elizabeth Taylor as well as author James A Michener keycards. Elsewhere hotel tours are conducted on a daily basis and a Hall of Fame on the second level showcases photographs taken of the various esteemed guests who have graced the hotels halls. If you visit the Grand Lobby during Raffles Afternoon Tea you might catch the lady who plays her harp with a certain world weary resignation and agitated anguish. On that note one does feel like a character from Pride and Prejudice traversing its hallways and adjusting ones imaginary breeches amidst the baroque music and posh colonial stylings. The hotels fitness centre swimming pool and pool bar are located on the 3rd level of the Main Building. Against the backdrop of azure skies behind the colonial structure of the pool house and surrounded by soaring modern buildings the swimming pool was very much the quiet and calm oasis hideaway in the bustling city area. PALM COURT SUITELocated in the historic Palm Court Wing with verandah seats which overlook the tranquil Palm Court the 70sqm Palm Court Suite plays it all romantic colonial elegance with its Raffles white interiors high ceilings whirling ceiling fans and polished teakwood floors while simultaneously being technologically updated with an abundance of USB ports and power outlets as well as a new iPad system which allows you to control the lighting blinds and sheers in the suite as well as summon your private butler to your suite. Despite the Palm Court Suite being said to be one of the brightest room categories the amount of natural sunlight which can enter the room through the windows is fairly limited and it may be that the suite is best enjoyed fully lit a la night mode. The parlour is furnished with a sofa dining table and television set. The pantry is stocked with both Nespreso coffee facilities as well as tea from The 1872 Clipper Tea Co specially curated and packaged for the property. A selection of snacks and non alcoholic beverages think soft drinks orange juice and coconut water are complimentary with various beers bottled spirits wines and champagne available for your libation pleasure. The bedroom is equipped with a four poster king bed power panels with USB ports on both sides of the bed twin wardrobes as well as a dresser with attached hair dryer. Those with Goldilockean craniums can place orders from the pillow menu which showcases various TEMPUR options such as the Original Long Hug and Millennium pillows. Elsewhere the marble bathroom features a free standing bathtub double vanities as well as a walk in shower with rainfall shower facilities. Bathroom amenities are from London based perfume house Ormonde Jayne with the range being exclusive to the property. Each suite guest gets the iconic Singapore Sling cocktail as a welcome drink which can be served at the Long Bar or enjoyed in the privacy of your suite or verandah. Whilst the lush landscape does invite its fair share of winged guests verandah lounging is essential if your suite faces the Palm Court. My commemorative Raffles heritage souvenir was a Raffles brass key holder. DININGBreakfast is served at Tiffin Room the hotel \u2019s North Indian dining concept which offers a semi buffet lunch and a la carte dinner. The space plays it all 1900s patterned wood and mirror wall panelling with their specialties served in the eponymous tiffin boxes during lunch and dinner service. For breakfast a variety of buffet items such as fruits cheeses and cold cuts pastries and salads complement the a la carte selections which includes the hollandaise drenched Crab Cakes egporn worthy Paysan poached eggs r\u00f6sti bacon panceta and the masala tinged Raffles Signature Omelette. Those seeking local flavours should skip the ubiquitous and coconut essence challenged Nasi Lemak and the thick skinned Wonton Soup with Prawn or Pork Dumplings and instead go straight for the scrumptious Me Goreng which is brought to great new places with the help of accompanying limes and a handheld squeezer. Other Asian delights include Congee Vegetable Dhal Curry with Prata and Japanese Bento with Grilled Salmon. The classic tiered Raffles Afternoon Tea now served at the restored Grand Lobby of the hotel includes various finger sandwiches think crab mayo with curry bread and smoked salmon with squid ink bread sweets and as many home baked scones as you can devour paired with your choice of Mariage Fr\u00e8res tea. The truly glossy socialite and tai tai can elevate their experience with a glass of Bilecart Salmon champagne and an additional item from the patisserie such as the Lemon Meringue Tart and Hazelnut Paris Brest. The cosy Writers Bar situated near the entrance of the Main Building has been expanded to a full bar with a range of craft cocktails wines and spirits. Inspired by an upcoming book by Pico Iyer the bar \u2019s first writer in residence the current cocktail menu includes the burdock centric and gin based Escape to Home to the savoury mildly spicy and tamarind intense Rojak Daron XO peanut calvados tamarind campari chilli gula melaka. The drink experience comes complete with an alcoholic palate cleansing welcome drink as well as white chocolate balls encasing liquid Raffles 1915 gin. Given the fairly upscale pricing of the cocktails my Rojak cost S38 one should view a Writers Bar visit through gustatory as opposed to buzz seeking lensesThe hotel has called upon various acclaimed celebrity chefs to headline the progressive dining programme. Playing it all peony inspired and feminine shades French restaurant La Dame De Pic by Michelin starred chef Anne Sophie Pic serves exquisite creations by way of set menus which change seasonally and the opening marks Anne Sophie Pic \u2019s debut in Asia. The former Bar Billiard Room BR has been reimagined as BR by Alain Ducase a Mediterranean sharing and grill concept from the French Michelin starred chef which will incorporate the original concept \u2019s energetic bar setting when it launches later this year. Elsewhere \u517f y\u00ec by Jereme Leung is an upcoming contemporary Chinese fine dining restaurant located on the 3rd level of the Raffles Arcade which will mark the return of celebrity MasterChef Jereme Leung to Singapore. Dining concepts located within Raffles Arcade include the Malayan plantation inspired Long Bar the iconic home of the Singapore Sling cocktail and countless fallen peanut shells the lushly landscaped Raffles Courtyard which offers cocktails and Southeast Asian plates in an alfresco setting. communal dining steakhouse concept Butcher \u2019s Block famous London concept Burger Lobster and GATHER a crepe and coffee concept. The latter three concepts are scheduled to open within the next few months. CONCLUDING THOUGHTSThe much anticipated revival of Singapores Grand Old Dame feels like a decidedly glossy and unapologeticaly commercial affair in spirit with the pricing across the various FB concepts of the hotel generating enough eyebrow raises to fulfil the weeks facial exercise requirements. While the butler service was comendably flawless and the Palm Court Suite well appointed and comfortable the overall Raffles Hotel Singapore stay somehow lacked a certain hospitality heart ware element with the experience especially as a first day guest missing a sense of occasion and warmth and instead being all brisk clock work efficiency in delivering its slice of historical legacy. Rafles Hotel stands for all the fables of the exotic East the playwright Somerset Maugham famously said. The Raffles Hotel Singapore is certainly a legendary ultra luxurious experience like no other but the fabled Grand Old Dames fantasy offering is probably an aspirational unsustainable one strictly for the bucket list.", "offset": [8255, 8534], "date": "2019-08-03 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "200b21b0-982d-418a-8320-42934d82aac9", "sentence": "Great stay at the newly remodeled Raffles. We had a spacious and comfortable suite. the service was excellent. We liked te historic charm of Raffles. We had one excellent breakfast in the Tiffin Room. However at our one dinner in the hotel at the gourmet Chinese restaurant. the service was inexperienced and the food was poor. I ordered sea bass which arrived strangely on a bed of boiled egg white and was about the size of a silver dollar. also the room was frigid. A truly disappointing experience compared to our wonderful dining in other Singapore restaurants.", "offset": [328, 442], "date": "2019-09-18 15:16:51", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "35607e36-c1c3-419a-a868-d8e5a0b984c1", "sentence": "Lunch buffet i Tiffin room. After the extensive renovation of Raffles Hotel it was with high expectation I revisited the Indian lunch buffet in Tiffin room. The staff was very stringent on opening hours so to arrive 5 minutes before booking time at 120 hrs resulted in one of the hosts sending us to wait standing in the lobby of the hotel as there were several hosts I expected to be advised when we would be welcome but this did not happen so I had to try another time to get our table and the hostess looked surprised we were still here and showed us the booked table. The staff were disappointingly self centered and although plenty of staff the service was slow and it required several requests to be able to settle the bill. The buffet which I before considered the best Indian meal in SEA have been drastically reduced to 3 small tables cold hot and a small dessert table. The smaller buffet is now supplemented with some of the staff serving dishes at tables as well as Naan bread this is not working very well as the staff not have feeling for when each tables has started their meal. I love the previous freshly prepared Naan bread w wo garlic but this is now served only and it appeared greasy and not as delicious as before. The curries and condiments I also found less delicious as previously and the visit turned therefore into a disappointment.", "offset": [731, 879], "date": "2019-10-21 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}]}
