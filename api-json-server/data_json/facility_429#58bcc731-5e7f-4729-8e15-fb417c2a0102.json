So hotel can be quite warm compared to other hotels and venues in Bangkok. I booked a Club Room. The AC was not working properly so the management moved me to a much smaller and recently renovated room. So I m paying for a Club Room without receiving the room amenties. Club Room does not seem worth the extra money. There is no breakfast. Instead you join the masses for the mediocre buffet in the lobby. Afternoon tea is a bunch of little cakes. Cocktail hour iis fruit cheese peanuts and a few warm dishes like spring rolls or satay. Nothing very impressive. Room service very bland. Sea bass was dry. I suspect it was taken off the dinner buffet. Chicken was also dry and lacked seasoning. Breakfast arrived without the bacon ordered. On the plus side the lobby cake shops sells some very nice salads. Much better and cheaper than the bowl of lettuce offered on room service. Gym has 1 set off free weight at 5 pound intervals. There is 1 smith machine a preacher bar with ez bar and 1 chin up rack with cables. Lots of outside members in the gym so you will probably have difficulty getting to use the weights. Plenty of treadmills. Unlike my 2 gyms at home there is no coconut water available which comes from Thailand. Sport massage at spa was a joke. I actually feel asleep. I got a much better sport massage from True Spa in Zen Tower for about half the price. Tailor in lobby spoke very little English and could not answer questions about fabric origins. Concierge recommended Embassy Tailors which was better but not much. No mother of pearl buttons available and does not actually carry the Thomas Mason fabric advertised on its website. Claims to have Thomas Pink fabric and expects you to take there word for it. As a diabetic on a gluten free diet paleo there was very litle food I could eat in the hotel. Too many buffets. The hotel could use a cafe where you can order quality meals off a menu. Something free range and organic would be appreciated. In general staff needs English training. Hotel botched up my airport pick up and fast track apparently due to language issues. I would avoid this hotel and SPG properties in Bangkok. The Lebua Peninsula Renaissance and Novotel are much better choices with better food facilities and customer service.", "offset": [2267, 2384], "date": "2015-02-16 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "440e7b23-3a2d-4d11-9362-8b9685bdf699", "sentence": "Excellent facility and hospitality.

This is a beautiful and clean hotel. However we faced many hiccups during our 3 nights stay there. 1. My tour agency helped to make this booking for me via bokingcom. it was stated in the booking form that we are eligible for a free bottle of sparkling wine. After checking in I realised that I forgot to remind them about the sparkling wine. So I spoke to the front desk staff about it and they assure me that they will check and get back to me. No one contacted me till the following day. I called and reminded them and again they said they will check. it took me a 3rd reminder to finally have this minor issue sorted out. 2. My family of 4 booked a family room. I did not realise that it was actually 2 adjacent rooms but that was fine for us. However in each room we were only given 1 set of toothbrush. I had to call house keeping to request for additional toothbrush sets. This is a minor oversight but it could have been easily avoided if the reservation dept or front desk have better coordination with the house keeping dept. They knew upon checking in that there were 4 pax as they requested for all our passports. Even if they did not know I think it is only appropriate to always allocate 2 sets of toothbrushes in each room just to be prudent. 3. During check in we requested for the luggages to be delivered to our rooms. After checking in we stayed at the lobby for about 15 20 min to discuss the itinerary with our tour guide. When we finally went to our rooms the luggages were not delivered yet. Not sure of the standard turnaround time for luggage delivery but we were a bit disappointed that the service was not more prompt. 4. When I was trying to call the house keeping for the toothbrush I had to make the call 3 times because the first 2 calls were not attended to. I do not ever remember making a call to house keipung in a 4 or 5 star hotel where it was not answered. But for this case the call was unanswered not once but twice. I guess they must be short of staff. All of the above are not what I would call a deal breaker as they are what I view as minor hiccups issues. But nevertheless it is disappointing that a hotel of this standard is making so many mistakes oversights. Pros. the location is superb near the BTS but slightly away from the main road. Lots of food option behind and near the hotel. staff are all very friendly and try to be helpful whenever we approach them. breakfast is fantastic gym is good. Pool looks beautiful though I did not use it. The hotel is located about 80 m from the Lumphini park.

Other managers like Christian and the concierge Thiplada greeted us by name as we passed through the bustling lobby always checking to make sure that our stay at the Athene was perfect. Nan and Alice in the Club Lounge quickly learned our four childrens names and developed a warm relationship with each of them.
