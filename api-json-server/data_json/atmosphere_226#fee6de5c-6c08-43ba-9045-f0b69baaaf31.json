This was undoubtedly my worst SPG experience. Strike one the water in my shower did not get hot. I made a call to the lobby and waited. After waiting 30 minutes I had to just deal with a cold shower and get on with my day. I stopped by the lobby on my way out and requested a room change. I was given new room keys and was told to leave my belongings with the lobby personnel since my new room was not clean yet. After a long day I came back to the hotel tried to get in my new room and the key did not work. I headed back to the lobby to be told I had already checked out. Luckily there was still a room available so all seemed good. Strike two we had to request a fridge in our room. My roommate is diabetic and she needed to keep her insulin cold. Strange enough that not all rooms have fridges but ok. We waited and waited and no fridge came so insulin was kept in an ice bucket. Along the way we also requested extra towels they took over an hour but eventually came. The cups we requested never did. Strike three on both mornings we were woken up before 8 am by housekeeping. On the second day we failed to lock the latch and housekeeping actually came into the room. In my experience hotels provide housekeeping staff with a list of the empty rooms but not this one. I was told by the lobby staff that housekeeping does not KNOW which rooms are still occupied and they have to go to every one.

The lady told us she \u2019d check again and give us a call in the next few hours. A few days went by and I called back to follow up. The lady on the phone this time may have been a different gal checked on it for us and told us the pants were found and they were given to one of the employees family members. NOT COOL. I mentioned we called in shortly after we left and we \u2019re told nothing was found. so what \u2019s going on. No explanation but were told they \u2019d be ready for us to pick up when we retuned. Upon getting them back they had obviously been worn washed and dried in a dryer. Fabric was ruined a bit the pants shrunk and they smelled \u201c used \u201d. These two pairs of pants were over 150 each and brand new had n\u2019t been worn once before this experience. I know this ca nt be normal policy but very shady practice here makes me wonder how often this location \u2019s workers help themselves to other people \u2019s property assuming if it \u2019s left behind its up for grabs. what a great perk. Good location decent rooms but nothing special for the price paid. Also careful about changing your mind missing getting in on time as they have the most strict cancellation policies 100 of the room charge 48 hours in advance. You could call in a couple days ahead of time to change booking and they \u2019l still charge you full price for the room. might as well keep it rather than cancel at that point. Breakfast was just ok. Buffet cost extra and was dry. I travel regularly for work and am an SPG member with this hotel chain and its partners this is the worst experience I \u2019ve seen had in 6 years.
