This is our second visit to The Naka Island we first visited in 2013 and enjoyed it so we thought we had return. We chose the Toyota Camry and speedboat option for transfer. The journey from Phuket airport to the pier is around 15 mins so the extra for a BMW 7Series was not worth it in my opinion. The team were waiting and the airport and the transfer seamless. Our arrival experience was as good as before they make you feel valued and told us that last time we stayed we were in Villa 11 but this time we would be in another Villa fairly close this acknowledged that they remembered us from last time. The rooms have changed little and are still well maintained although mosquito screens have been incorporated in the sala style bathroom and toilet areas to avoid running the gauntlet with the pesky little things when you visit the loo in the nightThe front of house staff remain excellent and very professional. The team in the Z bar were great and we enjoyed 2 for 1 happy hour most evenings. Food is variable the buffet breakfast choice is great but you never know how long you will have to wait for menu orders sometimes they were with you in a few minutes but often they took a while longer. We had dinner in both restaurants and generally speaking the food was good and not too expensive. My only gripe is the variability of the staff in Tonsai some were great but others did not seem to care or just lacked training. They had two nights with a buffet theme but we chose to order off the a la carte menu and on these nights the service was noticeably poorer. Notwithstanding service issues the menu is far more extensive than it was in 2013 and there are good choices for all western international and Thai dishes well cooked and tasty. Overall a great stay and would return.", "offset": [0, 45], "date": "2016-03-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "d7e3bc9b-31c3-468b-b425-c7b87c1c8e6a", "sentence": "Lovely hotel. Naka Island is a gorgeous place and we had a lovely few days here to start our honeymoon. Beach front pool villa room 66 5 nights half board. StafAl the staff are friendly hospitable and incredibly helpful. Everyone greets you as you walk around the hotel grounds. Welcome is really friendly with some nice touches. RomThe rooms are gorgeous but rustic expect lots of wood but great views. The coffee machine is a nice touch and the air con is powerful. If you want privacy and a bit of beach go for a beach front villa rooms 65 a 69. NB 67 and 69 do not have pools so go for 65 66 or 68. You get a bit of private beach with steps into the water. it is nice but not amazing. The hotel provides lots of bottled water which was really helpful. The garden areas are really nice and well maintained. BeachThe general beach is nice and the view is good. MosquitosUse the mosquito coils every night and a bit of spray and you should not have problems with mosquitos. Also leave the fan going in the bathroom to keep it cool and deter the bugs. RestaurantTonsai is great for breakfast and dinner the food is fresh delicious and spicy. Great pad Thai satay and spring rolls. Lunch here is great club sandwich or a burger are good options. We found My Grill a little style over substance and the food lacked texture everything seems to be oven cooked or fried nothing seemed to be grilled or caramelised. Avoid in the pool seats there is no breeze and the view is better from the restaurant deck. Surf and turf is good. Avoid the scallops. Wine is understandably expensive. BarZ Bar is nice for an evening drink the view is nice and the drinks are good. Try and watermelon martini and ask them to remove the basil. it is a good walk to Z bar from the restaurants but it makes the drink worth it. Order a buggy if you struggle walking or prefer not to get sweaty. PolThe main pool looks lovely but we did not use it as we stayed in our villa and used our pool and the sea. GymGreat gym facilities. They have pretty much everything and there a small fridge with cold towels and water. They could use one more treadmill. SpaExcelent massage and a very relaxing experience. The grounds of the spa are a bit rough and ready in places and the area seemed deserted. there is not much focus on the spa which is unusual for a hotel with spa in the name.

I do not want to spend to much time on reviewing the resort because I feel the pictures speak for themselves brilliant. My approach in holiday planning is usually to read the bad reviews because the topics of the respective complaints put things in perspective. Where you can differentiate good from bad is service and in particular how the staff deals with an actual issue I am NOT talking about removing bugs that I can do myself. During our stay in July 2017 which was the Grand Finale of four years of working and living in Asia there was an actual issue during our stay. However the fact that I am not going into details shows how great the staff as well as the management of the resort dealt with it. This is in line with the overall experience we had with everyone from the chef his sous chef and the whole restaurant staff who were always offering to accommodate special requests which we did not have because we stayed for eleven nights and they were worried we got bored with the offering. Also everybody else and Oliver Constant guest experience manager if I recall this properly in particular were making this a great and memorable experience.

Reviewing the Naka Island Luxury Collection resort has been one of the hardest reviews for me to write mainly because of the conflicting pros and cons. For the most part the people were very nice and super helpful however as a five star property Naka has things and practices in place that were uncharted territory to me. As a person with very discerning taste it \u2019s hard to comes to terms with all that I loved about the resort versus what I could barely tolerate. First The Beauty 1. The Ferry fabulous and on time every time. The captain was always friendly and welcoming. A short but fun ride2. The buggy service almost instantaneous when we called. Our favorite driver was Ole. One night when we came in from the marina on our ride to the villa Ole showed us a staffer who was fishing for squid. That was an unexpected but super fun experience3. The Z Bar simply one of the most spectacular views ever. We drove to the southern tip of the island Nai Harn in search of a beautiful sunset but it was there at the Z Bar all along. The sunset and the view were breathtaking besting Nai Harn and even the view behind the Big Buddha. However for it to be so pricey the food was alarmingly average. Our favorite waitress at Z Bar was Mew. She always remembered how we liked our drinks4. Free Ice Cream a nice treat for hot and bothered guests every day from 2 5 pm. The ice cream is \u201c homemade \u201d and served in a delicious waffle cone. Definitely something to write home about5. The Staff Genuinely friendly and helpful going above and beyond to make your vacation memorable6. The waffles the best waffles I ever had at a resort \u2014 maybe even a restaurant. I had to have one everyday. Our favorite cook at the waffles stand was Save. She was very sweet and delivered the waffles to us just the way we liked them each morning7. The pool villas are spacious with lovely views and in some cases easy beach access. The And1. Upgrades and special treatment usually bestowed upon elite gold and platinum members were hard to come by at Naka. I \u2019m not referring to the benefits you get for being elite in Bonvoy I \u2019m talking about the extras that die hard Mariot loyalists receive from management to show their appreciation. The staff at Naka is either unaware or just unwilling. They are strictly by the \u201c book \u201d with upgrades early check in and late checkout we had to plead our case for the level of care we are so used to getting from big names like the Ritz Carlton and the Mariot. When hope seemed lost a manager named Or came to the rescue fulfilling our requests for early check in and a better view. She really aimed high to make us happy but we definitely had to work for it. 2. The room design was the worst to me. Why. Well the only part of the villa that \u2019s air conditioned is the bedroom. The bathroom shower dressing room and closets are essentially outdoors. On an island where temperatures top 95 degrees and humidity is upward of 60 everyday taking a shower felt useless when we were just overcome by the humidity and heat as soon as we stepped out. 3. The villa is meant to have an authentic Thai appeal but instead It was often undone by the appearance of mosquitoes geckos grasshoppers cockroaches gnats and ants as there is really no defense to keep them out \u2014 they crawl right under the doors and through cracks. The doors are light and partially open half screen doors. Running a bath in the garden was a nice concept until a large lizards crawled through the water. I was grossed out by gecko droppings all throughout the room too. Maybe I \u2019m just too much of a city girl to understand the appeal of bringing the great outdoors indoors. The Beasts1. Mosquitoes if you \u2019re prone to mosquito bites bring lots of repellent. I begged for repellent everywhere I went and used so much of it but I still got bit up. All of the dining is outdoors without air conditioning and bugs have a field day. Unfortunately I was on the menu each night so enjoying a meal was virtually impossible for me. I ca n\u2019t blame them for the mosquitoes but I do blame the resort for failing to have an indoor dining option. Sadly they were in the room as well \u2014. It was just no escaping them. Thank goodness for the bed with a mosquito net2. The Beach it \u2019s so rocky. You ca n\u2019t walk a pace without stepping on shells branches or rocks. You must wear water shoes to walk the beach. I could n\u2019t believe that a five star resort has n\u2019t dedicated more resources to making the beach more apealing3. I booked a promotional stay \u2014 Stay 2 get the 3rd night free. The night before check out I asked why it was n\u2019t applied to the bill and they explained that there was no record of it. Just so happens I had a print out of the confirmation which I shared but it was just embarrassingly scrutinized. I went to my Bonvoy account and sent an image of the original reservation but that was n\u2019t enough they said they would have to investigate. The next day I was informed that the reservation department confirmed the promotion but they could n\u2019t explain how it did n\u2019t show in their system. Spending my last hours proving myself for a promotional rate was not all what I expected from a five star resort. 4. Power outages they should tell guests to expect occasional power outages at the resort. I was horrified when everything first went black. I was informed that it happens and power would only be out for a few minutes. Due to the nature of the resort it \u2019s understandable in someways and in others \u2014 not so much5. Dining under trees instead of an umbrella at a five star resort. Trees are great for shade but they \u2019re also breeding ground for bugs bats birds and you name it. Not what I consider protection. Overlooking these small but important details was certainly a demerit for Naka in my bok6. Massage the hot stone therapy was n\u2019t the best I had it was n\u2019t even In the top five but that \u2019s was n\u2019t the thick of it. I was highly offended that the masseuse wore a mask during the session. It was the first time I \u2019d ever experienced that. As a germaphobe I get it but in hospitality I do n\u2019t. Imagine a doctor doing that. Thankfully I am not sickly nor do I have concerning acne scars or blemishes on my body. This was by far the ugliest moment of my stay. Would I return. No. Even though there are plenty of reasons to do so but for me there are just too many reasons not to. In fairness if you want seclusion that feels like a world away breathtaking beauty and a dedicated team of professionals who provides excellent customer service I highly recommend Naka Island \u2014 it is truly a cut above all the rest in this regard. If you have discerning taste repulsed by animal droppings and grasshoppers in your room want your beach chair and umbrella set up for you expect full air conditioning have fear of mosquitoes are afraid of creepy crawlers expect privilege and flexibility this Resort probably should n\u2019t be your first choice.", "offset": [824, 873], "date": "2019-07-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "e22e6a55-6c5e-4f59-b63c-350aff631d49", "sentence": "Nice hotel with excellent service but 35 star place for 5 star prices.

In summary not a bad resort but hugely expensive for your overall experience and does n\u2019t look after Bonvoy Members.", "offset": [3946, 4062], "date": "2019-11-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "36548cf0-bab8-432b-a6f8-3830c7d47397", "sentence": "Naka is one of its kind. I find it extremely appealing because it \u2019s one of those secluded resorts that requires a boat ride away from Phuket mainland BUT only 10 minutes from the marina and 25 minutes from the airport. It \u2019s the only resort in the island. However it \u2019s not entirely void of people either as there \u2019s a small friendly community in the island accessible by bicycle from the resort. It is so hard to find a resort in Phuket that could match the overall setting and the layout of the individual villas. The bathroom is naturally ventilated with an open air bathtub an outdoor shower an indoor shower with steam room. It \u2019s rustic overall. Staff are great. Food is decent. Definitely my favourite place to vegetate and space out.

We stayed at Naka for 9 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The staff are extremely helpful and welcoming. Special thanks to head chef Kumar and his team at both Tonsai and Rum Chapel restaurants as the food and service was excellent. It was nice to have the choice of an al la carte menu on a full board package although drinks are very expensive. The hotel team overall are great and the hotel is well deserved of a five star review. The hotel is remote but excursions offer pick up from the hotel jetty or the speedboat operates 247 to Phuket. PS the older style thatched roof villas are prone to leaks in the roof as we experienced during an afternoon downpour. The outside shower is great though the mosies can be a real pain if they take to you.", "offset": [564, 682], "date": "2020-01-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}]}
