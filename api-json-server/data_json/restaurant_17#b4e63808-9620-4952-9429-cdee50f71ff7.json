This was the second time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel. We needed a good base of operations for consult with a cardiologist at St Josephs Hospital and this location was perfect. There was no need to get back in traffic on I285 to reach the hospital which was maybe 15 miles away. The room was comfortable and clean. Great water pressure in the shower. Loved the cooked to order breakfast. Harold made sure we had everything we needed from the breakfast buffet. he is a very pleasant fellow. There were cookies in the lobby in the afternoon evening but we did not get a chance to try them.

My stay was 7 nights. I did not rent a car but used the hotel shuttle which took me anywhere within a 3 mile radius. All drivers were prompt friendly and professional. My wait times for the shuttle were very reasonable. I ate in the restaurant a couple of times and found the food to be good and very reasonably priced. I did have some trouble with my television and called the front desk. Literally within 10 minutes my television was replaced with a new larger set. The front desk staff was very helpful with restaurant and shopping suggestions and even gave me a free beverage one morning when I slept in and missed getting a newspaper. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. Location cost staff free shuttle within 3 miles restaurant outside sitting areas Close to shopping restaurants movies.

Our stay was almost flawless but we had a couple of hiccups that marred our stay a bit. Hotel itself is very nice looks like it is pretty updated and well kept. The front desk staff was very nice and hospitable. We got in on a late flight so we were very happy with how quick and easy check in was. When we got to the room we were fairly pleased. Room looked clean no weird smells or anything. Though not too long after getting to the room we experienced a couple of inconveniences. We wanted to order room service but after attempting to call 6 times and the phone ringing with no one picking up my husband ended up having to leave our room and head downstairs to put in our orders. Then when he got down there they informed us that only the appetizers and sandwiches are available to order within the last hour of service. Ok not a big deal. So my husband gets back up to our room and we decide that while we wait we will watch some tv. Aand the tv did not work. So we go to call about the tv and we no get no answer once more. Not a great start to our stay. Everything else was fine though. On the plus side one of the mornings we had breakfast at the buffet and the service was so AMAZING.

We stayed here for a weekend recently for a college reunion get together. First problem started at check in. We checked in unloaded luggage while I waited in lobby my husband went to park car. Came back with a ticket for pay parking. Told the desk clerk who did not check us in we were guests why were we charged. He then went to explain since we were there visiting or for a meeting even though he said we were registered. Finally the clerk who checked us in was free gave us a parking permit. I asked why that was not given when we checked in said he did not know we were parking. You have to park in garage in most cases there is some Disabled Parking near hotel a few Diamond members parking we are diamond but none available. They did reimburse him for the parking charge. We were given a room on the top floor but it was an adjoining room one of my preferences is not to have that. One strange thing was the doors. The door into room obviously opened in but the closet door opened out so did the bathroom which was unusual so you have 3 doors opening into each other can hit someone. The safety bar in shower was not put in correct location unles you were going to straddle the toilet to get in out no way you can hold onto it while in shower. Apparently one of the 2 elevators was broken but no sign was ever put on door to let people know. So always a wait full elevators since hotel was full. The housekeeping staff also had to use that one elevator with their carts laundry so with that people luggage carts long waits.

I ordered a simple omelette as my wife but she got pancakes also. We waited over 45 minutes and THREE ATTEMPTS got 2 other folks \u2019 omelette twice then no omelettes but got French toast before our food was finally ready. My waffle and our coffees were ice cold and our granola with yogurt was soggy as heck by this point.
