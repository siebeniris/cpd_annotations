Comfortable bed we loved the down. Complimentary bowl of fruit and a card as a surprise for our 5th anniversary. That was really thoughtful. The location is right near the wharf. Perfect if you are going out to dinner. it is also an ideal location for whale watching super early. You can grab Starbucks right nearby and walk on over. Cafe Treiste is also really close and the coffee and food are AMAZING Next to walking trail to the aquarium but this will depend on if you like to walk. You can also rent a bike. Cons. Courtyard facing room on the top floor. This was supposed to be quieter but the noise from the street was loud most of the night. The glass on the sliding door must be really thin. You can hear everything cars bars music people shouting etc. This did not work for us. it is unreasonable. They need to upgrade their rooms by adding some sound proof curtains so people can actually sleep during their stay. Once we moved to the full bed farthest away from the window there were double beds the noise was less jarring and we fell asleep. The 19 parking fee and 20ish resort fee together seemed a bit pricey when you are only staying one night. We were excited to use the Keurig. We have one at home. Just be sure you use bottled water to fill it or your coffee will taste horrible.
