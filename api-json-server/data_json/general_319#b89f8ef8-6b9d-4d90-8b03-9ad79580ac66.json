My teenage son and I stayed for 2 nights to look at some schools in the DC area. We had a lovely room with 2 queen beds and a large bathroom with 2 sinks which is always nice. The in room breakfast was hot and brought up right on time even at an early hour. The bar area is formal but the staff is not they were very friendly and accommodating and the concierge had good restaurant recommendations. The location can not be beat close to lots of transportation and in the wonderful neighborhood of Dupont Circle. The design of the hotel is formal and on the fancy side so if you want something of modern design this is not it. Of note you do have to pay for wifi but it is fast. I was mistakenly billed for parking even though I did not have a car and they rectified it right away. Also the people in the room next to us were up early and we could hear them talking through the connecting door. Otherwise the hotel was very quiet.

The Fairfax at Embassy Row is tucked away on a charming corner of Mass Ave. The hotel lobby is small but welcoming and the people were kind and helpful. The hotel has a little of that historical feel and it has a warm presence to it. The room we had was on the small side but looked updated and was very clean. The bed and the pillows were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was also clean and seemed like it had been recently updated. The room seemed very quiet as well. The location was perfect for someone who wants a mix of local and access to sites. The Dupont Circle Metro station was an easy walk. You have walking access to many different local restaurants varying in price and selection. We had pizza from a wood fired oven one night breakfast on the circle and falafel for a snack. Local watering holes with plenty of local beer to enjoy as well. If you want convenience you got it. Starbucks Subway Panera and a CVS drugstore are right there for you. Grab a coffee fill up with snacks at CVS and take the Metro to the Smithsonian Museums. I had no real concerns but it is worth mentioning that the wifi is not included and at 13 a day was disappointing. Our room also did not have much of a view but we were not there to appreciate the view from the room. This location and hotel were just perfect for our stay. We were there for a few days to relax and take in Washington DC for the 4th of July.

We stayed four nights at the Fairfax in mid April. Upon booking we were not aware that the hotel would be performing renovations during our visit. After following TA before our arrival I reached out to the hotel beforehand via email with some of my concerns. They did not respond to our email. The renovations have closed the whole front of the hotel and they have moved their check in operations to a side entrance and what seemed to be a banquet room. Our check in went very smoothly but when we went up to our room we were very disappointed. We had booked a king sized bed and were given a room on the 4th floor that overlooked a brick wall. I immediately went back to reception and talked to Que who had checked us in. We were iPrefer members and were hoping for a room looking out into the street area. We were told that the only king sized rooms on that side of the hotel were suites not stated anywhere and that she could not move us then but if we were willing to move the following day she would get us a better room. We agreed to this and spent the first night in our original room. While the bed was comfortable the room was extremely musty and we both awoke feeling very stuffed up. In the morning I went back to reception to find out the status of our move. Que was off that day but luckily she had spoken to others so we were told to pack our belongings and they would move them later in the day. We headed out early to explore the city and upon our return to the hotel we were delighted to be moved to a king suite on the 8th floor thanks Que. This room was much larger as was the bath with great views. We were very happy for this. Room. The bed was very comfortable with nice linens and comfortable pillows. We had a small pullout sofa large flat screen tv and huge bathroom. The shower pressure was excellent and we never ran out of hot water. Neither room we were in provided bathrobes but I left a note for housekeeping and they left us two to use for the rest of the stay. The room had a mini refridgetor and they left two bottles of water daily. Our 2nd room was very quiet less musty and we slept well. Amenties While we did not use the workout room we walked everywhere and were too tired to work out after we did check out their facilites and were impressed with what they had to offer. Cold water can also be found here. We did not eat breakfast there or any other meal. The \u201c restaurant \u201d was a converted banquet room with a few televisions and a make shift bar that one would see at a banquet. You could not sit at the bar but we did get drinks and sat at one of their tables. We like to have a hotel with bar restaurant to use and were disappointed at this set up. As others have mentioned we recieved no help from the doormen except one held the door for us once when we were leaving. They literally watched us get dropped off by a cab take our bags out of the trunk and walk to the doors. They were too busy talking to each other not a good first impression. One of the best things going for this hotel is its location. It was a 15 20 minute ride from the airport with little traffic. There was a Metro stop a few blocks away and we were about a mile from the White House. We tried to walk whenever the weather allowed us. Otherwise we used the Metro and Uber. Overall we loved the city and had a pleasant stay. I am not sure if we would stay here again. There are a lot of hotels in DC to choose from I guess we will have to see what they have to offer after their renovations are complete.", "offset": [2543, 2625], "date": "2018-05-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "54cb68b1-1018-4003-9158-1964f84cb142", "sentence": "stately but effected by renovations.
