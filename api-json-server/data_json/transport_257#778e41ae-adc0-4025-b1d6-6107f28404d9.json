This hotel is located proximate to the state capital building which is in the heart of town. If you are lucky enough to get a room with a view of Lake Monoa you will enjoy one of the best views in the state of Wisconsin. Unfortunately that is the best this hotel has to offer but their service and amenities go down hill from there. Acomomdations. The rooms are date and need a refresh. Hall ways and common areas are simple and a little worn. Their amenities are fine but nothing that is on par with the location. Bathrooms are small and cheaply appointed. The shower curtain was too small to cover the arched shower bar. Sink water pressure and hot water was very weak despite strong pressure and good heat in the shower which was quite odd. Service Our room was not cleaned until after 60 pm and housekeeping removed some personal items which could never have been mistaken as normal room amenities or trash not all were recovered from the hotel. They attempt to run it with a skeleton staff resulting in a very low level of service. Simply try calling the hotel to speak with someone and you will wait on hold for 20 minutes or more with no apology when they finally do answer. Restaurants. The breakfast at Capitol Chophouse was good with cooked to order omelettes and a buffet. Staff was slim in the restaurant and the ambiance was average. We did not patronize any other restaurants in the hotel. Overall there are likely better choices in this liberal college town.

Leaving 3 stars 1 front desk personnel were awesome super nice and friendly. 2 Location can not be beat 3 we got a good price would not have been happy paying rack rate.

They definitely got the most important part of the hotel experience down but sadly it drops off from there. Please check out my pictures they tell the story better than I can. Where do I start. Our room had a bathtub I have not seen one in a Hilton quality hotel in a long time. It almost seemed treacherous. I am a healthy 40 male and I was a little nervous. The shower head was the basic type that looks like it was army issue. The room had those old AV jacks from last century. Curly cue CLF light bulbs plain basic outlets cracking wallpaper and water stains on the counter. Many of them. The air conditioner was so loud it kept me up for awhile so I turned it off. Overall just a worn feel to the room the one pic is of the bottom of the full length mirror. Like I started with we got a great price on the hotel. I looked up what regular price would have been and I was astounded. The Concourse was the same price. Final note. I had like to preempt the management response. None of this is your fault. the owners of the hotel need to reinvest in their property. It just is not Hilton quality IMO.

Had a miserable stay. When I am at a hotel the ability to have a good nights sleep is paramount. It was a complete miss at this hotel. And you can not even get a free cup of coffee in the morning to attempt to cope. The AC unit is a lousy noisy ineffective demon. When we checked in the previous folks had the thermostat at 65 and it was cold. I understand why now after waking up sweating in the middle of the night and then waking up again when the AC kicked on. We set it on 68 at night. The AC is so loud that you had have to increase the volume on the TV 2 3 times to be able to listen. then the guilt of blasting your hotel neighbor with the TV would kick in and you had drop it back down. The TV had CC that worked most of the time so that was a compromise we figured out on day 2. For whatever reason the WiFi would not stay connected to my phone either. it is a Iphone 7S so may be a nuance of an older phone but it was a continual struggle that I did not experience in Racine the previous several days at a Doubletree. We had issues with check in as well the individual at the desk was training and did not authorize our key cards for the garage so we were trapped in the garage for 10 minutes until an awesome shuttle driver let us out. We also had to request the complimentary 2 bottles of water for our brand dedication aka silver. and while I am being completely annoyed at this hotel. we did not get room service for a single day and got a note under the door that management will enter our room if we deny maid service for 24 hours. What the hell is that about. The Doubletree we just left in Racine offered free points if you declined room service. that is the first time I have ever gotten a form letter like that for having the DND sign on the door for a day.
