As is the case at most resorts there are pros and cons but our most recent stay at Inisbrok this was especially true. We had not been in three years and booked their holiday rate which was fair at 189 night. We traveled with our two sons 4 and 1 12 and there is something for everyone. Golf The Copperhead and Island courses are about as good as it gets Pro greens fees are a bit steep at 200 165 con. Copperhead was pretty wet in spots balls plugging in fairway on 1229 despite no rain in days and as mentioned in a previous review some of the bunkers were hard lacking sand. think brown sand not white beachy Florida sand. The twilight rate kicked in at 2 pm sunset 545 and when told our 14pm tee time was moved back due to am fog delay I asked about the reduced rate and the pro told me about some no issues package but still charged us full. A single at 209 moved up to join us and got twilight rate. We got 16 holes in so I have an issue with that. Island course is nice pro and when I arrived early for our 8 am tee time the gentleman in the shop could not find the booking on the tee sheet con. Apparently the young lady in the main shop booked us for Jan 31 not Dec 31con con. Fortunately the first group let me go ahead and I zipped around in 2 hours 20 min bonus pro. the only issue at Island was the gator coming out of the water on 18 cart path that scared the daylights out of me. Pol Pros. Main pool THE LOCH NESS is great for young kids shallow end with sand and 2 slides. There are five other smaller pools around the resort. Cons. Both days at the pool 1227 1228 there was a 2hour wait for a towel. Its 80 and sunny the week after Christmas I understand it is packed but that was a bit ridiculous. Note there is no lifeguard and deepest part is 4 ft. Service Stan the man at check in was extremely helpful with our bags and other items and gave us some nice tips. The trams are great very convenient given the resorts 90 acres. The resorts consists of 28 or so buildings all named after famous golf courses so if you are not near the pool course spa or wherever you are going you will need your car or tram. My driver to shuttle over to Island course was already outside after my call and walk outside 2 min. Fod OK but they nickel and dime you here 50 for breakfast. Ie. kids meal cereal and strawberries or banana 49. My guys chose strawberries and they charged an extra 4 for that. That was last we saw of the market salamander grille. 20 breakfast buffet for cafeteria style scramies. We went to Publix and bought stuff for the rest of the week. We had a more enjoyable meal for dinner at Chilis for less money with drinks. Also 350 tax for a cup of coffee. I requested some activities online dinner reservations were made and I got a call that these were booked but a spa service for my wife the only call I got was the day of saying I missed the apt. The park is nice with shuffleboard basketball courts and mini golf. Fun for the fam. Overall our family enjoyed and we will definitely return having learned from where to save from this experience.", "offset": [1438, 1521], "date": "2015-01-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "58e38961-a17b-4622-9e1b-b18c9385cf36", "sentence": "Nice Resort But A Bit Dated.

With it being a golf course it was confusing at first trying to find our rooms the place is huge.

I was VERY skeptical of keeping my reservation after reading some recent reviews. However I do not have many complaints. We stayed in the Lahinch building which was close to the main pool. The room was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. The air conditioner was missing the dial which was fine by me because I like it cold and it was already set on high. However my nieces would probably disagree. The carpet appeared to be new and was plush. I do not think the room had been completely updated but I could tell changes had been made recently. We enjoyed the Loch Ness Monster Pool and slide. The young staff members with the towels were very friendly. We ordered chicken nachos while at the pool. They were decent but a bit expensive at 16. All of the shuttle drivers were incredibly nice and helpful. Greg even gave us tips on taking the Joley Trolley to Clearwater Beach which worked out great for some souvenir shopping. I found Honeymoon Island to be much prettier personally so I am glad the shuttle there was included in our stay. The shuttles depart from the resort at 10 and 130 and pickup from Honeymoon Island was at 4. They supply pol beach towels for you as well. We used a Groupon for this trip. I would have liked if the 80 something in fees was included in the Groupon price but it is what it is. They did not charge us extra for having three people in a room so that was appreciated. I feel like I got my moneys worth and it was a nice trip overall.

We booked directly through Inisbrok website. We saw the Kids eat free with each paying adult and the 5 pools really hooked us into booking this resort. I think it is important for everyone to know that the 5 pools are not all like the Lochnes pool. There is ONE big pool with sand area slide and waterfall feature. The other pools are like ones you would find at a hotel small and provide no towels. The only plus side of the small pools is that there is hardly anyone there. As for the food we were under the impression that kids eat free applied for all meals. We were never informed at check in and had to find out AFTER we ate that kids eat free deal is only breakfast and only at one dining location. Would have been nice to know upfront before we booked but even the website does not clarify. Also the waitress did not seem to be aware of this deal either she had to go get the manager.

I was greatly disappointed with my experience at the resort. My pregnant wife and I being racial minorities felt like we were not welcome in a few incidents. The check in experience and an encounter with a security guard left us frustrated. We had high expectations from the reviews and recommendations of others and were shocked by some interactions with staff. This was not expected from a well known and fine establishment such as yourselves. We arrived for check in around 330pm and walked up to Sylvia who was focused on her computer. She did not look up greet or acknowledge us as we sat there waiting for about 20 sec. Then Geri called us over to check in. She lacked warmth in her greeting and told us that our room was not yet ready which we expected. Geri told us she would call us when it was ready. While we were with Geri we noticed an older white couple walked into the lobby to check in and Sylvia welcomed them with a friendly attitude before they were at her desk. We waited at the Loch Ness Pool until 4 pm and walked back to the lobby. Geri told us it was still not ready. When we asked about the check in time policy she said that it was only a couple minutes after 4 and that there was a large group of people checking out hence the delay. That is understandable but she was not even apologetic about it as if to say that is too bad. Again she told us she would call us when the room was ready. We sat in the lobby for about 10 to 15 min. before Sylvia walked over to us and told us that we were being switched into another room. This was appreciated but why was not this done sooner if you all knew that there would be a delay with check inI already addressed my concerns about Sylvia and Geri above. Before my wife and I left the property we decided to sit at the Copperhead pool to read. Nobody else was at the pool at the time. A few minutes after sitting down a security guard drove up to the pool and told us that someone called about the gates being locked to the pool area. He asked us how we got in and we told him we came through the gate and it was not locked of all the times that we were at the pool we have not had any issues with the gates being locked. After he checked one of the gates and repeating that someone called about the gates being locked he said While I am here do you have a guest pass. Fortunately I had it with me but since when did we have to have a guest pass to access the Copperhead pool. None of the other guests that we had seen during our stay had to display a guest pass nor was there anyone checking. He looked at my pass tried to make small talk and then left. We were surprised about the encounter and the fact that he did not check any other gates to see if they were locked.", "offset": [1875, 2024], "date": "2018-08-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "ae33448f-7477-45ac-aaca-08de525458a4", "sentence": "Disappointed.
