The resort is built into the cliffs and therefore there are lots of different levels but this just adds to the charm of the place. Everything from the food to the staff to the grounds to the beach is wonderful. If you are looking for a lot of parties and noise then this is not for you but if you want to totally relax and eat well then this is the place. We stayed in D block which we were extremely happy with the location just above the beach and probably in the middle of the resort. The beach was gorgeous never a problem getting a bed in the sunshine or in the shade. The bed cushions can be used as floats which was an added bonus. It is totally private so no public access to sellers or anyone other than guests staff. The beach bar is open all day and most of the night and instead of wandering up you could just wave your flag from your bed and get the cocktail of your choice delivered with a smile big up to Peter for constantly coming over to see if we wanted a drink. There are lots of things you can do pedalo kayak paddle boards water skiing snorkeling etc if you wish to. There may only be 3 restuarants but the food in all of them was amazing highly recommend the Baileys Ice cream. You do need to book 2 of the restuarants for supper but we had no problem getting tables in them when we wanted inside out. Breakfast lunch was equally as good with lots of choice and always friendly attentive staff. At this point I would like to mention Philip and Simone in the Palazina. There are 3 bars in the evening including a Martini bar the cocktails are also of a high quality. There are some free trips from the resort. We did Duns River which again was really good fun need water shoes so if you have them take them. We also did the afternoon shopping trip but found we were kicking around for an hour waiting to be picked up. It was good to see the local town though and everyone we met outside the resort was friendly too. There is a well stocked Gym which I did not use due to the lack of correct footwear I may bring them next time. it is overlooking the sea with a smoothie bar right outside and a small pool which only ever had a couple of people around. There is also a very small private beach below the waterfall which was a lovely suprise. The Spa was amazing little huts on the top of the cliff facing the sea. There is also a lake with turtles 2 tennis courts bikes a peacock 2 parrots one that will talk. Oh an Au Naturel beach if that is your preference if it is not you will never encounter a naked person so do not let that put you off the resort. Okay so some of the rooms may need updating a bit but this did not spoil our holiday in any way we did actually get offered a different room but decided to stay where we were as the location was better for us and they offered to sorted the issue lack of plug socket for the coffee machine nothing major. Yes there a lot of steps but to be honest we were glad of a bit of exercise due to the amount of food we were eating and cocktails we were drinking. There is free wifi throughout the hotel although it may not be super fast it was perfectly adequate. There is no obligation to tip at all although we did on occasion the staff were all helpful friendly regardless and you certainly do not feel that they are expecting it. So if you are looking at this as an option then just book it.", "offset": [2642, 2945], "date": "2015-01-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "501ef30a-e7e9-4ac0-a2ed-257c0cb7b89d", "sentence": "4th visit already booked 5th planning 6th. This was our 4th visit and yet again we really enjoyed staying with our \u2018 Jamaican Family \u2019 we have stayed at many hotels throughout the world but none compares to the warm friendly welcome received from all staff at Sans Souci. Having stayed here before we knew exactly what to expect and would comment that if you are looking for a glossy marble gin palace then keep away this is a more old colonial style hotel and is a quiet relaxing place to stay. The rooms are rather dated and fixtures fittings etc are old but an extensive renovation project is planned from mid July until beginning of November in fact the hotel is closing for the summer weeks \u2013 I do hope they do n\u2019t lose any of the old world charm this hotel has. The hotel is about 1 \u00bd 2 hr away from Montego Bay it \u2019s quite a long journey but allows you to view some of the countryside. The welcome you receive on arrival is great and as a returning guest it \u2019s very easy to relax back into the Jamaican laidback way of life very quickly. We would like to say a big thank you to Alecia Thomas for sorting out our room restaurant bookings in advance she is so helpful and efficient it will definitely be noticeable when she goes on maternity leave \u2013. Guest Services definitely only functions properly when she is thereThe hotels 150 suites are set in 7 three story blocks spaced around the acres of beautiful gardens there are quite a lots of steps as part of the hotel is on a cliff side \u2013 if you do have mobility problems the hotel will transport you where ever you want to go in the grounds. There are several routes to each destination and most of the steps are of a very low gradient and are not too taxing. There are two restaurants for lunch Bela Vista beach grill for jerk burgers sandwiches etc and the Palazina restaurant for a more formal luncheon there are also a couple of snack places to get food and of course room service. Evening dining is in one of 3 restaurants Bela Vista no booking but you may have a long wait for a table. Palazina and our favourite Casanova \u2013 this is more formal dining men must wear long trousers shoes \u2013 ladies have a chance to dress up. All of the staff who serve in the Casanova are truly outstanding especially Melesia Davis who took great care of us yet again. What makes the staff attitude even remarkable is the fact that NO tipping is allowed although you can take gifts. On Tuesday it is the Beach Party and Friday the Starlight Gala. We along with quite a few other guests do not like these large \u2018 cruise style dining \u2019 events and prefer to use room service this is also very good and enjoyable to sit on your balcony to eat your evening meal. There are limited places available at the Palazina on Tuesday as an alternative we do wish an alternative was offered for Friday night. There are two beaches both are quite small but well maintained the main one and the naturist sunset beach. There is an impressive range of activities available throughout the day if you wish to participate plus a number of free excursions are available \u2013 check these on their website before you pre book any travel company trips as you may get them free in resort. One of our favourite activities is Thursday night Wine Cheese tasting run by Hugh McKoy and Lennon Williams great fun and quite informative. Anyone who likes water sports is in for a treat there are many available and all are free of charge including diving watersking etc. There is also a Nurse available on site 24 hrs a day which unfortunately I nederd to use this time and must comment on her helpfulness and the efficient Doctor who was called in. I could go on even longer about our favourite hotel but instead will offer to answer any questions on the resort \u2013 just contact me and I \u2019l help if I can.", "offset": [496, 767], "date": "2015-05-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "e95aa7ff-5ee7-47fd-9eb6-1f200703f52a", "sentence": "Best Vacation Ever. My Wife I just returned from a week at Couples Sans Souci and have nothing but praise for the entire experience. Yes as others have stated the suites are beginning to look a bit \u201c tired but ours was meticulously clean. We stayed in a 1 Bedroom Beachfront B21 which was central to all the activities that interested us. I understand the resort was close to capacity but it \u2019s so well laid out with a multitude of different features. that we almost felt we had the entire place to ourselves. I could go on and on about the food service entertainment but that \u2019s already been covered by hundreds of previous reviews. CSS not only exceeded all our expectations but in fact blew them away. In the past I \u2019ve always considered \u201c Sandals \u201d to be an excellent resort within this price range but in my humble opinion CSS makes Sandals look more like \u201c Galoshes \u201d This was our first trip to CSS but will definitely not be our last. We have found our \u201c Jamaican home \u201d. We now fully understand why the staff greet you at arrival with the statement \u201c Welcome Home \u201d.

The therapists at the spa are very talented and caring. It is relaxing to have a massage in the outdoor gazebo right on the ocean.

Some notes from our trip June 24 to June 30 98 freaking awesome1. USE CLUB MOBAY. Oh my what a difference. And someone said earlier loved loved LOVED walking ahead of the immigration line in front of everyone else but embarrassed so much I could not even look them in their faces. Club Mobay departure lounge and it is rum punch gets you right where you want to be for the trip back. Was so great that we could eat our lunch there before we left2. Couples massage worth every penny. Loved being out in the Hideaway hearing the ocean feeling the breeze and receiving that magical rubdown3. Champagne cruise Can be turned into a Rum Punch bonanza after seeing Easton KRAZY. the day before and being on the speedboat with Amalaki Jr and Deron. Those two wonderful aqua men really touched our hearts as they said their goodbyes to each other in front of us and Deron said goodbyes to others as we traveled up and down the coast. Tear jerker moments4. SB loved the people loved the staff. Everything about SB was so fabulous5. Pregame Breakfasts and other room service Take advantage of it. Having croissants and fresh fruit delivered early in the AM so we could sit on the balcony and enjoy those early sounds was so calming and peaceful to us. Breakfast later at the Palazina was icing on the cake6. Entertainment and nightlife All sounded great from our room. because we are in our 50s and could not make it past 930smile emoticonThe 2 of the Not so god7. We could NOT get cold water to come out of any spigot. Try taking a shower with very hot water that could nt be cooled off. The most the cold faucet would give us is very warm water after running it for 20 plus minutes but at least it did not burn us then. We resorted to filling the tub early in the AM and letting it sit all day so that when we returned from SB we could jump in there to get cooled washed off. We did let maintenance know once but they came in let it run 12 more minutes after we had already left it ran for over 15 and it started to become cooler so we figured this must just be the way it is. although our other two times we stayed this was not an isue8. The first two times we stayed here the welcome was amazing. we had no sooner get stepped out of the arriving bus and someone came right up to us and said Welcome home. Heres a cool towel. Would you like some champagne. and then would direct us what to do and where to go. This time no one there at the front door to greet us. We walked into the lobby and stood there looked around tried to get our bearings and had to ask someone sitting there Should we come check in. To be fair we were then offered the towel and drink after we had started the check in procedure. Guest services did nt seem to be welcoming either and when I asked about romance rewards repeaters they said we had a slip in our envelope and that was that. We never got offered repeater Tshirts or any water bottles etcfrown emoticonAgain to be fair when mentioning this at checkOUT the dear lady did get us our tshirts9. Lastly Jamaica is a tropical island and we understand seeing lizards bugs etc. However in our bathroom all over both sinks and counters were tiny ants. Everywhere. So I left a note for housekeeping that possibly could they spray or something. I had also left little bags of goodies for housekeeping daily Seemed to have worked. BUT these darn little ants migrated into the bedroom area on the dresser and in my clothes. Just had to do the shake shake shake method before putting anything on. We LOVE this place. We WILL return.

I honestly do not understand why people think this resort is so good. On top of the dirty tub when we arrived to the sugar bowl infested with ants in the game room every restaurant in the resort being closed every Tuesday and Friday so your forced to eat the Beach Buffet or room service broken outdated furniture in the room to the coffee drink stained sink. I really do not understand why people keep coming back here. Here is a copy of my reply. Hello Shanice and Renae Yes we felt that the resort was not up to the standard of the rave reviews we read and recommendations from our travel agent. Rooms were very outdated the tub when we arrived had hair in it and looked like it could have used a huge overhal. Even after the maids came and scrubbed for 45 min it still looked dirty. Room service trays were left outside our room for days at a time and we had to call after the food started to become rancid. Pool area was extremely dirty water was dirty and full of bees and bugs areas on the concrete were sticky where drinks were spilled were never cleaned up the whole time we were there. Table clothes were flipped over and reused at lunch and dinner service we witnessed this. Not sure if that is standard practice for a Five Star resort but it is very unsanitary. I understand that Couples has a not tipping policy in order that all guests receive the same service but when your employees are not motivated by tips it also ensures that all guests receive mediocre service. Not only that. but many activities were disorganized started late and while breakfast was served at 730 the omelet station was never ready until 80. It seemed like this was the running theme throughout the resort the entire time we were there. One Staff member even asked my boyfriend to go get him a drink at the bar when he went up then complained that it was warm. Definitely not 5 star service would not you agree. Most of the Staff was VERY friendly. Vanya Aken Christopher Kirk and Marcia and Simone in the spa were very nice and provided excellent service. However we were trying to enjoy a drink near the pool area and one of the workers literally closed the umbrella right above us and said I got ta close this area up now. The same thing happened while we were at dinner at the beach grill. We were trying to enjoy a cup of coffee by the water after our dinner and the waiter literally took the table cloth off the table and said I have got ta clean up now. Wow. This was not the first time this happened to us. Dun River falls was excellent but as our guides helped us up the last leg of the trip he said you tip me now and walking through the gift shop area was like running a gauntlet. We were harassed the whole way and were afraid to even look at anything because the vendors chased us down. This made us want to get out of there and we did not even buy anything although we wanted to. Maybe if the both places paid their employees a decent wage there would be motivation to do a better job. I understand that your trainees only get food in exchange for their work then they are let go after two or three weeks. This is no better than slavery and I highly doubt we will EVER go back to Jamaica let alone a Couples Resort. The entire vacation cost us over 40 plus an extra 70 on spa services and souvenirs at your gift shop PLUS over 200 in tips yes we tipped your employees secretly because we felt so bad for them. So for almost 50 we expected so much more. Since you are not paying your employees and your rooms are extremely outdated I have to question who is making all the money here. The owners are obviously not investing in the property or their employees. I realize that you are updating part of property but the whole resort should be torn down and started from scratch in order to be rated Five Star. We have been to many areas of the Caribbean and have never had any kind of experience like this and have spent MUCH less and that included our tips. We will be spending our money elsewhere and sadly will not be recommending Couples to anyone and will be letting our travel agent know of the experience we had here.", "offset": [3706, 3852], "date": "2015-07-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "7bdf9fde-c22b-4dbb-a01e-219cdf5f2f4c", "sentence": "Third Visit. Always Special. This was our third visit to Couples San Souci in Ocho Rios and I will say immediately that we will return. This visit was short two nights. they were closing the resort for renovation and understandable there was some reduction in the scope of activities and amenities.

My wife has had great experiences at the spa. The food is always good but it would be nice to having a couple more dining options. We love the beach grill and bar. Could almost just live right there.

As I write this Couples Sans Souci is closed for renovation. However renovation will not correct the problems that my wife and I encountered on our trip there from June 30 \u2013 July 7 2015. We have been to many clothing optional and top notch resorts in the past and if you look at my user profile you can see some of them that I have reviewed on this site. We booked a week at Sans Souci at the recommendation of some friends. Their website noted that the resort would be closed for renovations from July 9 to mid October but that there would be no decrease in activities offered or the level of service until closing and also no decrease in the rates. I researched the resort and found that it had a lot of good reviews and repeat guests but made mention of some stairs. I am partially handicapped and not real good with stairs but our friend recommended we request a room in Buildings A or B which are on the flat area where the restaurants and beaches are located and on that basis we booked it with a request for a room on the first floor in Buildings A or BWe arrived at Montego Bay on schedule on June 30 and were whisked to the resort on a crowded bus for a two hour ride and a half hour stop at a bar mid way. We arrived at the resort at 40. My wife and I were in the back of the bus and six or seven other couples got off before is. We were more than ready after that long bus ride to get settled in our room. However upon entering the resort \u2019s lobby we see only one Admissions clerk. We found later that the other clerks were being laid off slowly as the closure date approached and the Admissions area was one of the first to go. The six couples are queued in a line before us. By the time it was our turn to check in it was 445. The clerk processed our papers and in 20 minutes the porter took us to our room which was on the third floor with over 30 steps. We told the porter the room would n\u2019t work because of the stairs and he returned us to the Admissions clerk Shawna who was waiting to go home. Shawna was visibly irritated and told us there were no other rooms available. She said requests for special rooms are not guaranteed. By this time it was 515 five hours since our arrival in Jamaica and we were tired stressed and beat. I told Shawna the room was n\u2019t acceptable and asked for a refund so we could stay at another hotel with flatter grounds. At no time were we given to option to go to a different Couples resort without all of the steps at Sans Souci. Shawna called her supervisor Miss Clarisa Jones who heard our story sucked her teeth and said she would have to look for something else in our current Building Building G was we later discovered which was high up on the cliffs. Miss Jones disappeared as did Shawna. We sat in the hot lobby with no drinks no food and no other people. I walked out at 545 and again at 615 and asked the bellman what was going on. In each case he went to find out but did not return. Finally at 630 the bellman and Shawna came to take us to our new room which was on the first floor of Building G However because Bldg. G is on a cliff we had to walk DOWN 15 stairs to get to the room and so it stands to reason that we would have to walk UP those same stairs multiple times every day. I pointed that out to Miss Jones and she said it was better than the third floor and advised us to call for a shuttle to go to a beach or restaurant as they were long walks. We were unhappy and Let Shawna and Miss Jones know it. However her attitude as we found to be common among the staff was one of complete indifference. This was our room and that was the best she could do. I felt sorry for the bellman dragging our bags up and down all those steps so I slipped him a tip which he promptly turned and gave to Shawna. I asked why he gave his tip away and he said \u201c we have to share \u201d. Lesson learned \u2013 do n\u2019t tip or tip very surreptitiously. We learned to do the latter and found that to get good service you have to tip \u201c under the table \u201d. We brought lots of singles and fives and tipped very heavily. While unpacking we checked the mini bar fridge and it was empty. Couples has a \u201c personalize your own mini bar \u201d service and left a checklist of items we could order however the mini bar was supposed to be fully stocked upon arrival and we were extremely thirsty. I called the operator and informed her we had an empty fridge and she asked what we wanted and said someone was on their way up to stock it. By then it was dinnertime and we went to the lobby to ask for a ride to the restaurant but there was nobody there. The bellman out front told us the shuttle was not on site and the only place to eat was at the beach party \u2013 all of the restaurants were closed on Tuesday our arrival day and. So we trekked down and up and down over hills and cliffs. The property is absolutely beautiful. But by the time we found the beach party down many twisting paths and stairs we were pretty exhausted and feeling ripped off. However we decided to make the best of it. We were pre paid and had no other option. We nibbled at dinner. mostly jerk chicken and ribs from the grill because everything else was literally covered with winged termites which were attracted by the spotlights on the beach and at the outdoor buffet stations a little too much protein for me. We walked back to the room \u2013 another 30minute trek in 90 humidity and found that our in room mini bar was sill empty. I placed another call to the operator and at 930 PM the night manager Coral and an attendant came with some items for the mini bar. Of the six items from their list that we had requested they were able to provide only three diet coke sprite and water. Ice was not provided. Coral later sent up a fruit plate and a bottle of champagne however mini bar service was spotty all week we never knew what we would find or not find. We spent most of our time on the au natural beach. It is a beautiful beach in a very pretty setting at the mouth of the White River yet segregated from the rest of the resort by a peninsula containing an inholding \u2013 property not owned by the resort and there was heavy construction noise coming from there daily. We never had any problem finding chairs or shade. We found a very nice driver who drove us there and I asked him to be back at 430. We tipped him well. The service at the beach was for lack of a better word indifferent. There was no drink service we had to walk to the beach bar for drinks. No little flags in the sand. Lunch buffet style was very limited. We saw many left over items from prior night \u2019s dinners. It was impossible to get a sandwich or anything not on the steam tables. All week the beach bar constantly ran out of basic items such as sprite water ice straws diet coke and glasses among other essentials. At 430 we went to the service road to wait for the shuttle but the driver we later learned had been put on a different project so he did not show up. A lifeguard on a bicycle rode by going up the hill and I asked him if he could call the lobby and ask them to send a shuttle. He said he would. 15 minutes later he returned and whizzed past us on his bicycle shouting \u201c the shuttle is coming. It \u2019s right behind me \u201d. Another 15 minutes and I asked another pool attendant on a bicycle to call us a ride and he said he would laughing as he rode up the hill. 15 minutes later we decided to walk very slowly. Eventually we made it. Shuttle service was more reliable on later days as we learned to call the lobby from the beach bar. And the drivers learned that we tipped discreetly. We had dinner at the beach bar and grill which was the only option available as all other restaurants require a reservation one day in advance which we did not do as we arrived late due to service issues described. We were told by a staff member that the staff that could not be placed at the other Couples Resorts almost all of the blue collar types were being laid off for 3 months with no guarantee of a job when the resort re opens so morale was poor. As the week went on and the number of guests dwindled so did the number of staff the level of service and the variety and quality of the food. One day I was walking to the beach bar at the au natural beach and I slipped into a shirt to avoid sunburn. The beach attendant \u2013 the same one that promised us a ride on the bicycle \u2013 ran over to me and demanded I take my shirt off as no clothing is allowed. I told him it was only for the walk to the bar. He ordered me to take the shirt off or leave the beach. I took the shirt off went back to my beach chair grabbed a towel and threw it over my shoulder as I walked to the bar. The beach attendant literally glowered at me but hey there were lots of people with towels around their waists so what could he say. The lifeguards and pool attendants were only infrequently at the au natural beach so it was no big problem but bespeaks of the kind of service we experienced throughout the week. There were absolutely no activities offered at the beach. I do n\u2019t know whether this was because the resort closed two days after we left or if it is just the way it is when you have a no tipping policy. So in summary Couples San Souci is a nice quiet hotel on the cliffs with nice beaches and an indifferent staff especially the lobby and admin folks not so much the drivers bellmen or housekeepers. Service is better if you tip so forget the no tipping policy. It is probably a good spot for a romantic get away but for us every day was a hassle just getting from point A to point B and dealing with the indifferent and often rude staff. I feel like the resort should have reduced the rates for this week prior to closing because the service was not good. Of course after renovation they can say all these problems were fixed. But their renovation will not touch the indifferent service. This is a hotel to which we will not return.", "offset": [9828, 9888], "date": "2015-07-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "ed7ac5f9-3285-4114-99bd-8f84890056c6", "sentence": "10th Visit to CSS Was Very Good But it Was n\u2019t GREAT. As the title of my review states this is our 10th trip to CSS so yes I know about the stairs and yes I know that some tiles in some of the bathroom may be chipped and yes I know that there is n\u2019t a marble entrance and grand chandeliers in the lobby. I \u2019m so over that. However what my husband and I have come to expect is EXCELLENT customer service from almost EVERY staff member and unfortunately that was not always the case on our last visit. Let me preface my review with the following information 1 We travelled to CSS in June because the resort was going to be closed for renovations during our originally scheduled trip which was set for the middle of July so we could be at \u201c home \u201d for my birthday this rescheduling was handled thankfully by my AWESOME travel agent with the promise that NO RENOVATIONS would begin prior to July 9th 2 we were at CSS from June 24 to July 4th and 3 the message from Couples and CSS \u2019 management and Marketing team was that guests at the resort prior to the start of the renovations would NOT notice any change in the level of customer service. In my humble opinion CSS and its management did not live up to the promises made in items 1 and 3So I do n\u2019t have to drone on and on I \u2019m going to list just a few of the issues we encountered during our 10 day stay there were others1. At breakfast in Palazina we had to wait for 30 minutes in order to get a napkin Only 1 place setting at our table had a napkin normally not a big deal. We asked the person who seated us for another napkin and received the answer that we are used to hearing \u201c no problem mon \u201d. However there must have been a problem because it took almost to the end of the meal for us to get the napkin and that was only after multiple requests and then the young lady had to take a napkin from another place setting which was not replaced for the next guest. I heard later from other guests that staff had been reduced in the Laundry in anticipation of the closure. So promise 3 was not kept2. On our first day as we walked to the beach after breakfast around 9 am we passed Block B and could already hear construction noise and see construction debris in the stairwells. We also heard from many guests that they could hear construction in the rooms next door to them and the noise was loud. Also many guests complained of no water or all hot water and other issues which could possibly be traced back to the early construction start. So promise 1 was broken on our first day. 3. During our stay SB ran out of alcohol several times by 2 pm. Guests were told by the bartenders that they would n\u2019t be able to replenish the bar for awhile and they might be able to get a quicker response if a guest called in the request. I called from the beach more than once to get bar basics sent over \u2014 sparkling wine rum and vodka. This is an all inclusive resort. A bar should NOT run out of alcohol by 2 pm. There had never been an issue with alcohol replenishment at this bar on our nine previous trips that required my plea for more alcohol. So once again promise 3 was broken4. At the Beach Party and at the Starlight Gala normally if we finished a glass of wine or a cocktail it was quickly refilled or a new drink was brought to the table. This trip you finished your drink and the staff took your glass. You had to repeatedly ask for a new drink. We spent much of our time explaining to first time guests that it \u2019s not normally like this. Once again promise 3 was broken5. One of the air conditioners in our Penthouse Suite started to leak I called the front desk and a maintenance person arrived very quickly however he said he was n\u2019t sure if he could fix the problem. My husband suggested it was probably an issue with either the Freon or a drain was plugged. My husband also assisted him by handing him tools while he was up on the ladder working on the unit. Thankfully my husband is handy. Should my husband really need to explain to the maintenance worker how to fix the A C. I do n\u2019t think so. So promise 3 broken again. As I said earlier in my review we love CSS or we would not have spent our hard earned money there on 10 trips if we did n\u2019t. I have written other Trip Advisor reviews that were positively GLOWING for CSS so it was difficult for me to right this hence the amount of time it has taken me to write this review. Our trip was very good and I can only say \u201c very good \u201d because of the staff who tried to do the best they could in a bad situation that was not of their making and because we met some great new friends and renewed our friendship with our old friends. But this trip did not live up to our previous nine trips. I am disappointed in Couples \u2019 and CSS \u2019 management for not living up to the promises it made to its guests regarding the level of customer service and not starting the renovation until after all guests had left the resort on July 9th. I admit it. I drank the Kol Aid and believed what they said. This was a mistake on my part. My husband and I have booked 3 more trips to CSS and 1 to CTI in order to take advantage of early booking perks so our next trip is scheduled for January and I hope the excellent customer service and the wonderful staff that we love will have returned. If not one advantage about booking early is that we can cancel the other trips and get our deposits back. CSS is an AWESOME resort. I hope our experience is only a momentary glitch and I can wholeheartedly recommend CSS to friends and family once again.", "offset": [4701, 4936], "date": "2015-08-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "73d04c75-b0df-4726-9f8c-2f3e9eb0a7cb", "sentence": "We Found Our Favorite Couples. This this was our second visit to Couples San Souci and our 8th visit overall to a Couples Resort. Our previous visits have been to Couples Swept Away 4 times and Couples Negril 2 times. Take a peek back at those reviews if you are interested. I wo n\u2019t count a \u201c Trading Places \u201d visit to Couples Tower Island. We bailed after 2 hours and took a cab back to San Souci. Yup San Souci became our favorite Couples despite a few concerns we had prior to our departure. Those concerns included the number of stairs hurricane Dany the heat and humidity the current renovation etc. But not to worry about a thing every little thing was all right actually perfect for us. Before I continue with my review I highly recommend our \u201c GO TO \u201d travel agent Mitch Toren mitchtripguycom for some options. Mitch is the guy to contact for any of your vacation plans in the Caribbean. If there is a deal or low rate he will find it for you at top of the line resorts. Because of the renovation blocks A and B nearest to the beach were unavailable as well as the Palazina restaurant. Last year we were in D block D2 to be exact and were surprised when we ended up this time on the top floor of G block in G14. This was a big concern because it is difficult for us to go up and down the many stairways from the room to the restaurants to the beach and back again. But we took our time found a number of pathways that included inclines rather than stairs and since we only made the round trip to the beach once a day it worked out quite well. We noted that the rooms in G had been freshly painted the bath room immaculate. It appears that there was major work done across the entire resort. The view from G is incredible. It is a suite with large balcony. Lovely place for morning coffee or evening Champaign. Highly recommended. We are booked to return to San Souci in April 2016 and originally requested A or B but are definitely changing our request to GBecause of the renovation they had do shift restaurants around but that was no problem. We dined at the Palazina at least twice. Casanova twice room service once plus attending the Repeaters dinner and the Beach Party. Food excellent as usual. Service superb. If you are able explore the resort. Lots of hidden surprises and charms. If this is going to be your first visit take the tour they schedule at least two times a day. I do a bit of scuba diving and took advantage of the included diving twice this year. There is a wreck of a 150 ft minesweeper Kathrine deep canyons in the reefs plenty of coral fish and almost everything you would expect plus a highlight of a pod of three Dolphins that decided to check us out. I do believe a video of the Dolphins is already on YouTube search San Souci Dolphins. If you \u2019re not yet a scuba diver take advantage of the included Discovery Dive. The excellent dive crew will train you and take you out to one of the many reefs for a short \u201c Discovery \u201d dive. If you have looked at the couplescom web site or read other reviews of Couples San Souci you will have already learned there are two beaches. The main beach textile beach seems to start filling up between 9 and 10AM but never seems to be crowded. If fact the entire resort was n\u2019t crowded the year because of the 72 rooms in A and B were being renovated. We do n\u2019t go to the main beach it appears nice but we spend all of our time at the other beach called \u201c Sunset Beach \u201d SB in the \u201c Au Natural \u201d area. SB is a small but deep beach that also has a sizable pool Jacuzi bar and grill. Have Veronique or Tanisha make you a Bushwacker. The water this year was much better than last December. Very clear and not turbid from wave action except for the last day where we got some waves caused by Dany. The White River empties in to the Ocean at SB and you get some interesting effects from the mixing of fresh and salt water. I like to snorkel at SB and you can clearly see the less dense fresh water on top of the denser salt water and the refraction when they mix. Many choose to take the lounge chair cushion to use to float on the water. Lots of fun. CAUTION there are lots of rock and quite a few sea urchins so it is best to bring water shoes. Entertainment is excellent. Silver Birds Steel Drum Band is not to be missed. Edgar makes the best omelets of all of Couples Resort. So despite the stairway issue Couples San Souci became the favorite of all four Couples Resorts. That is not to say we do n\u2019t like and do n\u2019t recommend the other Couples except for Tower Island we were not too tipped over about them. Each Couples Resort has a different vibe and each Couples Resort offers something unique. But as you get older you get pickier and we are picking San Souci as our favorite. Read the reviews of the other Couples Resorts that I have written over the past four years and the reviews others have written. Your mileage may vary to each his own no problem. Bottom line. We are already booked to return to Couples San Souci in April 2016 and are thinking about booking August September 2016 as well. We also will be in Couples Swept Away in December 2015 and Couples Negril in January 2016.

We have gotten into the wonderful routine of going to Sans Souci each May and November. To say we enjoy it there is an understatement. We are already booked for May of 2016. On our most recent trip we arrived at a resort which was reopening two blocks of rooms 72 units and the reopening was a bit behind schedule. The staff had to juggle room assignments to try to keep everyone happy. Our room was supposed to be in A block but was not quite ready for occupancy. Our first three nights were spent in C block before we moved to the newly renovated A2. We were the first couple to use this room and we love the location the remodeled room and especially the bathroom and awesome shower. The staff had their hands full dealing with some vacationers who were not that pleased with their reserved rooms not being ready but we are very gracious and acomodating. Resort credits were given to ease the discomfort and they were quite generous in order to keep their clientele happy. Returning visitors are the lifeblood of this resort. Each November and each May. we see many of the same couples that we got to know in previous years. And every Wednesday evening there is a special dinner polside for all of the returning guests. And it appears that this dinner is attended by most of the couples staying there. According to the staff about 70 of the guests spend time on Sunset Beach where the people are unbelievably friendly. It is very easy to make friends there. Some of us plan return trips year after year. We love the beach there as well as the pool the swim up bar the water volleyball all without dealing with wet swimsuits.

There are few things in life that are better than sitting on your balcony in the early morning and watching the sunrise as the resort slowly comes back to life. Unfortunately the wafting smell of cheap American cigarettes andor pot smoking limited our time on our balcony. It \u2019s too bad that the rights of those who choose to smoke supersedes the rights of those who choose not to smoke or suffer from allergies. A possible solution might be to restrict smoking to upper floor balconies or to a separate block of rooms. Many guests would also appreciate a \u201c no smoking \u201d policy enforced in all pools and around the pool decks2. Couples resorts is for couples. Some couples enjoy the company of new friends and old friends from previous vacations. We noted several times at the Palazina that many of the tables set for 4 were regularly seated with 2 guests only. This resulted in groups of 4 waiting for a suitable table or sitting at separate tables set for 2 which were readily available. A possible solution might be to have all guests \u201c wait to be seated \u201d and have a hostess direct couples to an appropriate table3. The food at the resort is beautifully prepared and seasoned however it was served cold on more than one occasion. We experienced cold food at breakfast lunch and dinner at most restaurants with the exception of the Casanova. There are a few other reviews on this site that have also mentioned cold food. This seems to be an isolated issue from one week to the next and from one restaurant to the next. I do n\u2019t know if the kitchen staff are preparing the meals too soon ahead of time or if the servers are n\u2019t getting the food to the tables in a timely manner. Some additional staff training and supervision should help to address this inconsistency4. The new rooms in Blocks A B are quite nice. It \u2019s a shame that the high quality of materials used for the tile floors glass showers bathroom fixtures have been compromised with substandard workmanship. We do n\u2019t spend much time in our room and do not expect or want the Ritz Carlton. The renovations are a nice upgrade but do n\u2019t seem to represent a good value for what it most probably cost5. The entertainment is getting old especially for repeat guests. The trapeze act was a nice addition last year. however the steel drums playing contemporary American music instead of authentic Jamaican Reggae got old several years ago. We much preferred being entertained by the 3 older Jamaicans The Cibonites and the resort guest from Florida that sang and played his own personal guitar at the Beach Grill and Martini Bar6. The sand on the beach is eroding. This is most probably a global issue rather than a problem unique to Couples Resorts. The watersports staff do an excellent job of cleaning and grooming the beaches every morning. A possible solution to the beach erosion might be to install a breakwal similar to Braco however I ca n\u2019t begin to imagine how much that would cost. Couples Sans Souci represents great value for the money. We are definitely looking forward to returning. This resort is currently at the top of our price range for a vacation destination.

We have been to all 4 Couples resorts stayed at 3 of them. Couples Swept Away 7x Couples Tower Isle 2x and just went to Couples Sans Souci for the first time this year. We did a trading place day at Couples Negril during our last stay at Couples Swept Away. With that said. Obviously Couples Swept Away has been our favorite Couples resort but after going to Couples Sans Souci have to say. Couples Sans Souci is right up there with Couples Swept Away as one my favorite Couples resort now. We travelled mid July for a 10 night stay and split time at Swept Away and Sans Souci7 nights at CSA and 3 nights at CSS. Even though our first time at CSS was a short 3 night stay I was still very impressed with CSS and all it had to offer. Looking back know kind of wish we had more time at CSS but we know now. I do not have to go into the property itself that you probably have read in other reviews already. but I will have to say and repeat what others have said the property is simply beautiful. I will note my cons about CSS and please know these are just my opinions in comparison to the other Couples resorts we stayed at and are NOT cons to ever deter us from returning because without a doubt God willing and if life allows it we will definitely return to Couples Sans Souci. There are less food options at CSS than CSA CTI. We stayed in E Block in a Deluxe Ocean Verandah though room was clean spacious more than adequate space storage and also centrally located on the resort it could use a little updating particular in the bathroom. As I noted less food options here at CSS than the other Couples we stayed at they did offer room service which they only offer continental breakfast items for room service at our other favorite CouplesCSA. Quality and taste just as good as the others perhaps better at CSS at least that is what my wife said about the lobster. I mentioned earlier we split time this year at CSA and CSS and each Couples resort has a night out of the week that they feature lobster at all of their restaurants for dinerwhen in season. and she had lobster at both and like preparation taste better at Sans Souci over Swept Away. And in regards to what I mentioned about room being updated they do have other blocksA B. that were recently and renovated at CSS. I personally like the spa better at CSA than CSS. CSA to me has a more calming spa type atmosphere ambiance CSS does offer the massage locations on the cliffs with sounds of the ocean waves clashing against the cliffs that you do not get at CSAThe beach. Still hands down I prefer the white powder sand beach at CSA over CSboth the main au natural beach at CSS. The main beach at CSS is small a little rocky and visible seawedI know seaweed is nature and not a fault of CSS. but CSA clear calm soft white sand beach in and out of the water stil is best beach out of all the 4 Couples resorts. Again our opinion. Yes CSS is a private beach and you do not get outside vendors walking the beach selling their wares as you do at CSA but that is just one aspect that we love about the beach at CSA. We love the interacation with the Jamaican people culture so the vendors that walk up and down the beautiful beach at CSA does not bother us at all. In terms of the service and employees compared to the other Couples resorts the staff at Sans Souci were ALL fantastic. Again this is my opinion it seemed however the employees at Sans Souci were a lot more relaxed happier. not saying that the employees at the other Couples were not any of those things either BUT just the feeling we got from the employees at Sans Souci when we were there. It is rare we even saw employees eating at the restaurants at the other Couples we have been toif even at all. AND we did see some Sans Souci employees able to eat in the main buffet restaurant and getting to enjoy all the wonderful food and offerings we all get to indulge in. Just as I think it should be. I know perhaps some companies particular in the food service industries view that as a No No but in my opinion if the management at CSS allows their hard working employees this benefit my hats to them a 2 thumbs up and a bravo to them for allowing that and not frowning upon it. Shout out to Tanesia in Guest services to put up with all my questions before we left on my vacation and putting all my concerns at ease. I am sorry I did not take down more names personally but honestly have to say from the enterainment staff to EVERY staff member at CSS you are all AMAZING. this goes for management to you run a tight ship Please do not change ok does this put us in for a few extra raffle tickets for ther grand prize awarded at your lovely Guest repeater dinner on our next visit hint. hint LOLI kind of geared this review mostly based on comparing to other Couples we have been toin particular Couples Swept Away. there is so much more I can say about Sans Souci but if you were on the fence and in the similar circumstance we were in meaning you have been to Couples and a many time repeater of one particular Couples resort and thinking of trying another or different Couples resort and looking at Couples Sans Souci you will NOT be disappointed especially if you like the Couples brand.

Winter Vacation 2017. Well no Sandals again this year as they remain overpriced. At the recommendation of our wonderful Travel Agent Ornela Storey from Carlson Wagonlit Travel in Burlington Ontario we did the Couples Sans Souci in Ocho Rios Jamaica. After the process of elimination we were booked at the Couples Sans Souci in Ocho Rios Jamaica. After last year \u2019s great experience we flew Air Transat again and were not disappointed. Since Air Canada Vacations no longer uses mainline service you are stuck with Rouge so again on the advice of our agent we made the change and were pleasantly surprised from start to finish. We will be requesting Air Transat from now on. At the Couples Sans Souci in Ocho Rios Jamaica we selected an Ocean view one bed room suite. We were advised that the area we were in had lots of stairs which we found difficult at first but by the end of our two weeks we built up great leg muscles without going to the gym. We read a few reviews from people who were disappointed with the stairs and I say shame on your travel agent. Did not use one shame on you. This particular property has 2 beaches one is located in the lower section of the resort in front of the beach front rooms and the other Sun Set Beach which is clothing optional with all the facilities. Being a couples only resort no kids was again refreshing. 150 rooms with two beaches means you can always find a chair at the beach or by the pool. Most times during our two week stay we felt that we were the only ones there and the resort was at capacity. This was the feeling of a lot of the couples we talked to. The grounds are well kept and safe for the most part and lighting on the many stairs at night is an issue and the little flashlight we brought was used at night. Three pools one over at the sunset beach and two on the other side one being a swim up bar. Bryan the bar tender at this bar is the best I have seen. His talents should be at Vegas. Both as a mixologist and entertainer. The other pool is the \u201c mineral \u201d pool that uses tested mineral water from the nearby mineral spring. Water Aerobics is held in this pool which was very enjoyable however one must be careful as the pool bottom is very slippery. Three restaurants plus a bar grill over at the sun set beach. The fine dining restaurant is the Casanova with a top notch chef and menu for dinner only each night except Tuesday and Fridays where dining is on the front lawn as a beach party on the Tuesday and Gala night on Friday. Room service is also a fine choice and found to be speedy. The Palazina Italian is a lunch buffet and dinner choice not so formal as the Casanova but has a full service dinner menu and your only other choice on Tuesday if the beach party is not your thing but book early as it books up fast. The Belevista Beach Bar and Grill is a great lunch choice with the best burgers and soup the islands have to offer. We found that the dinner menu was more challenging for this location as most of the food seemed to be done off site and was either cold or dried out. All in all this is one of our favorite food resorts with the best soups in the Islands. One issue we found is this is a resort that does not ask about food allergies so if coming the onus is on you. We found peanuts in the salad where normally you would not expect them. The rooms were split into two major sections where the difference was Ocean view is high up and takes stairs to get anywhere and beach front were at beach level. The Ocean front seemed to be larger rooms with huge balconies. A tour of the Beach front rooms shows that most if not all rooms have been tastefully renovated. The Ocean view rooms where we stayed was clean but very tired. The motel style tub and shower and single vanity made for difficult morning and dinner preparations. Paint can only cover so much and it is due time for some renovations in this block. The rooms are well stocked with daily mini bar restocking and can be customized to your tastes. Standard water sports are available with a 6 day twice per day SCUBA. In the two weeks we were there we never saw a shortage of water sports equipment and the staff are second to none in helping and teaching you. Overall we really enjoyed our vacation this year and can say that this resort is far superior to many of the Sandals locations of equal room and service level and all at half the price. An update to the rooms in the Ocean view area would make a huge difference and hasten our return to this wonderful resort.

So my husband and I just returned from a one week stay at CSS where we renewed our vows. Everything I read before hand seemed a little biased from what I will call Couples Groupies so I am going to attempt to give a thorough honest review. We had a wonderful time. The workers at the resort truly made the place better than it is. They are so nice and really ensure that you enjoy yourselves. The waitstaf bartenders housekeeping and especially the social directors. Mickhugh was the best. RomWe stay in block A 2nd floor and had a great view. The rooms are recently updated and are very nice and clean. They are not extravagant but have all the necessities for a comfortable stay and the beachfront rooms are close to everything which is nice because of all the stairs at the resort. FodThe food was very good. All very fresh and tasty. There could have been more variety. The buffets on Jamaican night and the Starlight Gala were incredible. BeachThis is my only complaint. The beach is small and the water has a lot of seaweed. Definitely not what is shown in the pictures. They do make an effort to keep it clean and there is not much else they can do but I would have preferred more of the white sand beaches and clear water that Jamaica is famous for. Pol3 pools on property we hung out at the one with the swim up bar. Never too crowded always had a chair and float. Great view. Also several hot tubs on property. PropertyAbsolutely gorgeous. They take great care to keep up with the landscaping and it shows. It is beautiful. There is definitely a Jamaican vibe throughout the property and it feels very private even with the resort booked to capacity. There are lots and lots of stairs so if this is an issue for you book elsewhere. EntertainmentThe staff is great and there are a variety of activities from crafts dance classes history lessons etc. The entertainment staff is great. The nightly entertainment is awesome. The water sport options are endless and the staff is so helpful. There is never a lack of anything to do. We also did the included excursion to Duns River Falls which was incredible. Definitely a must do. But be prepared for the hassle of vendors when you leave. Au NaturelWe did not participate in the AN beach pool but we did visit the beach after hours for the beautiful sunset. The beach there is bigger and prettier but the water is not. The water is also smelly at this beach. Vow RenewalThe staff was great at making sure everything was taken care of. The minister was very kind and made the ceremony very personal. We had the ceremony in the gazebo and it was beautiful. The photography was just ok. And when it came time for us to choose photos the photographer was a little rude with us because we did not buy many of the pics. Even if they were great we probably would not have purchased many because it was just a vow renewal and they were expensive but his attitude was not necessary. I told them up front that we would only be purchasing a few. We opted for the private dinner in the gazebo that evening which was very romantic and the food was great. This also came with a 25 minute couples massage the next morning which was phenomenal and had a great view. I also had my hair done in the salon for the renewal. The stylist was so kind and friendly and did a great job. Trading SpacesWe did spend one day at Couples Tower Isle on the trading spaces pass so I will give a short review here. The beach there is much nicer. The food was also a little beter or maybe it was just nice to have a change from the daily menu at CSS. The vibe there is more South beach than Jamaica so I did not like that but it was a beautiful resort. It definitely feels more like a resort than CSS by design. The pool here is nice but does not feel as secluded. The atmosphere here is more party than romance. The biggest disappointment was the staf they were rude in comparison to the CSS staff. The bartenders were not accommodating at all and acted like it was a bother to fix a drink. The guy doing beach service actually said to us I take care of you you take care of me even though there is a strict no tipping policy of staff. The watersports staff was nice and helpful and we enjoyed several of the activities there. There is also little shade at the beach or pool at this resort. If we go back we will definitely stay at CSS and maybe visit CTI again for the beach. Overall CSS is a fantastic resort. My favorite thing about it are the atmosphere and the people. If you are looking for a glamorous resort this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for a Jamaican experience a relaxing romantic vacation with beautiful scenery and fun times this is definitely a place to go.", "offset": [3220, 3273], "date": "2017-06-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "30afc3fd-09cd-4409-ad75-065b4624f4fe", "sentence": "Great Anniversary at Couples Sans Souci.

Food was okay not nearly as good or as much variety as other resorts. Staff seem to be rather lazy for the most part not nearly as outgoing as at other resorts.

Like some of the other reviewers we rarely revisit resorts we have been to before. It seems a revisit never lives up to the first time you experienced a new place. It was with this concern my wife and I decided to make a return trip to CSS. My concerns were heightened as I read a few negative reviews on TA before our trip. I should not have been concerned. From the time the bus door opened and we heard the first welcome home until our last goodbye hug with my fellow left hander Andrea of the wait staff our stay was incredible. Random thoughts of our stay. While this property is loaded with charm it is the staff that makes up for any short comings in other areas. Due to the rains they received shortly before our stay there were not as many flowers in bloom yet the grounds were still beautiful. Our room in the A building was kept spotless by Natoya and the third floor view was incredible. If you end up in the A building area be sure to stop and see Anita and Crackers hanging out in their cages. Some reviews I have read complained about too many cats. I counted about six different ones and the only one I saw begging was being fed by a guest. I think it is important to remember that the cats are there for rodent control and I have never seen any rodents so they must be working. Others complained about the age of the resort or the number of stairs. To us it just adds to the wonderful character of this resort. Never would have thought that Edger at the omelet station could be replaced but Carol sure does a more then capable job. Loved being greeted by her song. Qwayne Q at the swim up bar is my new favorite bartender. Sorry Julia. If you are thinking of trying the couples message ask for Ruth and Thelma. The first couple of days we were there found us having trouble finding lounge chairs. By coincidence there were cruise ships in town that day and day passes were available to cruise ship passengers. Hm. No cruise ships plenty of chairs. Hm. Hm. Hope Couples management looks into this. On our last trip we befriended Mickhough and Baby A of the entertainment staff. It was wonderful to catch up with them and renew the friendships. They are truly great ambassadors for Couples. Becky was a joy and great addition to the entertainment staff as well. We had a riot watching a group playing soccer in the field next to the pond. Half wore no shoes and no one wore shin pads but talk about great athletes. Wow. If you get a chance to catch a game check it out. And I am not a soccer fan. The food was about the same as last year real hit or miss. We ate at Casanova twice. The first was so so the second outstanding. Same with meals at Palazina especially lunch. The one area this resort could really improve is the food consistency and food options. Room service was spot on this year. Next year we will do something we have never done before return to a resort for a third straight year. There is just something we find so relaxing about going to CSS. it is just a great way to recharge our batteries before going back to our busy lives in the real world.", "offset": [2107, 2172], "date": "2018-03-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "8291c07e-e7d2-4b8e-9312-096b0a97d420", "sentence": "Another great peaceful vacation.

The staff and food were fantastic along with the unlimited drinks which we had plenty of Shout out to Devon at the Beach Bar and Mario at watersports. Another high point was that we felt like so many times we had the whole place to ourselves. especially early morning and night swimming we did not sleep much. I am not sure how full the rooms were but it never even felt close to crowded. We tried the au natural beach a few times the regular beach and swam in every pool and jacuzi they had covered every part of the absolutely gorgeous grounds and never wasted a minute. Couples massage was really nice and the excursions on point. Definitely recommend Blue Hole. I even used the experience to propose to my girlfriend on our 2nd night at the waterfall we found tucked away by the spa. she said yes completing the best vacation we both have ever had.

We stayed in the renovated block B on the 3rd floor. A beautifully spacious quiet room with the coldest air conditioning. The bathroom was large the mini bar stocked daily with our favorites and quite honestly one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. We spent every single day at sunset beach even in the rain. The breakfast buffet was our favorite meal. So many options. The excursions were easy to book. The long transfer from the airport was not bad at all and being at a more secluded resort definitely had it \u2019s perks. The other guests we met were very kind many of them repeat guests.

We recently returned to our home from home and again enjoyed every single minute our our stay. From our welcome back to our au revoir nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful staff at CSS. Since our last visit two years ago CSS have appeared to bring the Christmas decorating forward which was a delight. The decorations looked beautiful they had the largest gingerbread house I have seen in my life. There was a tree lighting ceremony which was well attended and the canapes were greatIt was exciting to hear all about the renovations which will take place next year. I believe that blocks A and B had previously been renovated a short while ago but they too are to receive an upgrade. We stayed in a suite in C block this time and it is indeed time for a little love and care to be given to these rooms. Although cleaned daily to a great standard the decor is very tired. That said we were in the middle level of the resort so not too bad with climbing the stairs or descendingThe food as always in each of the restaurants is superb and I would not have any complaints. There is always an abundance of choice in the Palazina buffet restaurant and sufficient choice at the Bela Vista during the lunch service if you do not want to do to the buffet. Casanova is always good. We had room service one evening I had the spaghetti bolognase which was super good. and the service was fast so the food was not cold I guess that is a benefit of being close to the restaurantAs I have said in my previous reviews of this gem of a resort it is the staff that make the difference. ALL are super courteous and helpful and enjoy spending time with you. Albert the gardener is always a joy to speak to. There are far too many wonderful people to mention and it seems a little unfair to give any names. However one must try Roses special cocktails containing coffee liquorIt was great to see the entertainment team again Giovani Fayon Tanesia and everyones favourite Jamaican Irishman Mickhugh. it is great when they remember repeaters and makes you feel kind of special. It was also lovely to see Coco when she and Alex performed at the one of the special event evenings on the lawn.

We came to get away from our daily life. Sans Souci means care free and that is what we encountered. When you arrive at Montego Bay you go to the Couples lounge they give you a drink set up your ride to the resort. That ride is not provided by Couples but outsourced. We enjoyed that the driver provided us with a great tour along our route which was nice during the close to 2hour drive. The roads are in good shape and there was not too much winding along the way. When you arrive at Sans Souci you are greeted with a cold towel and champagne. They then take you to your room later bring up your bags for you. Everyone was always extremely friendly. TIP. We were able to make some reservations ahead of our arrival for both of the restaurants that required it as well as for treatments at the spa thank you Delen. When we arrived at about 6 pm we went to the Bela Vista for dinner where one does not need reservations. TIP. menus at the restaurants repeat on certain daysnights so look at the bottom of the menu to see if you should make a reservation for the following night at a different restaurant. We stayed in a Penthouse Ocean Suite. We were put in a room in the Dahlia block that had 2 rooms and 15 bathrooms. The room was large and had a stunning view. We were able to hear the entertainment in the Balloon Bar during many evenings but were still able to relax in the rom. Other nights the entertainment is in the Main Lawn near A and B blocks and we did n\u2019t hear that much. We did attend andor listen to the entertainment and have to comment that the performers were great. We loved that in this small resort 148 rooms I think there were lots of places to explore. Yes there are a lot of stairs but that adds to the charm of the resort and the stairs were not steep and in no way compares to the stairs say in many places in Greece. Some places we loved were the gazebo as well as sitting by the mineral grotto where you get a pedicure by the nibbling fish. The food was delicious every night. This was true at the restaurants as well as the events that we went to including the Grand Gala as well as the Jamaica night which ended up being their 14th Anniversary Celebration. Carol at the egg station in Palazina in the morning was always singing and made consistently delicious food eggs omelets poached and fried waffles and pancakes. Our night at the Casanova was also great we ate outside and enjoyed the show that was happening at the Balloon Bar that evening. Food at the Palazina was delicious as well. Lashana a server we saw many times always had a smile and was charming to talk to. We very much appreciated the reasonable portions we got eac meal. We never felt we over ate and knew we could always order more if we were hungry. Janel the cook at Sunset Beach grill was also always friendly and great at preparing delicious burgers chicken etc. During out stay we took advantage of the trip to Dun River Falls. TIP. Ask when the cruise ships will be in town and pick a different day. Your stay includes a trip to this unique experience climbing up the falls. You work as a team helping the group climb by holding hands. You absolutely need water shoes and will get wet. TIP. If you do n\u2019t have water shoes you can purchase them on the way to the falls as they stop at a store along the way. Folks ended up with water shoes with Jamaican colors and paid less than I did for mine on amazon. We were unable to take other trips like the glass bottom boat snorkeling etc which are also included in your trip due to high winds. The Entertainment at the resort was top notch. We had a group of youngsters on Steel Drums we loved and were also treated to a great Reggae show by Fredie McGregor. Mikhugh did a great job as an MC as well as giving us Jamaican Trivia. He was always around and also demonstrated a great attitude as did everyone working at Sans Souci. We spent our days at Sunset Beach. We found the main beach to be clean and the main pool in front of A and Blocks to be nice but enjoyed the au naturel experience available. We never had an issue finding a lounger at Sunset Beach. Yes there are rocks when coming into the water so wear your water shoes maybe the ones you got on the way to Dun River Falls. and you wo n\u2019t have a problem. The Sunset Beach Bar had top notch brands and drinks I think were better here than at other bars. A shout out to Julia at the SB Bar who was always friendly and made great drinks. As others have said in other reviews do n\u2019t wait until your last day to give the Au Naturel side a try. Overall we had a great 7 care free days away from home where able to completely disconnect. I wish we could have stayed longer. I found the resort to be in great shape and know that after the refresh in the next few months things will be even more amazing.", "offset": [4732, 4860], "date": "2020-01-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}]}
