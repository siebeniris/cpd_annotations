Breakfast is also incredibly busy around those times so try and get there early and take it back upto your room. Rooms are self contained and there are gorgeous little delis all around New York to pick up fresh ingredients if you want to make something instead of eating out all the time which can be costly.

The Tourist information and recommendations for things to see and places to go were good. The personnel was mostly very friendly. The breakfast situation is a mess. When the hotel is nearly fully booked rush hour atmosphere does not nearly describe it. The space for all these guests is simply totally insufficient during breakfast hours. People sitting or standing everywhere at the computer desks in the entrance lobby close to each other like in a subway during rush hour and eating their breakfast from cardboard plates drinking out of plastic cups using plastic knives spoons and forks. After three days of going through this stampede we decided to pick what we need and have breakfast in our room. Therefor I heavily recommend a room with kitchen. The kitchen comes with everything you need. So we toasted our bagels wich I liked a lot with no hassle and had breakfast in a relaxing atmosphere. Well different countries different cultures. We as Germans have a certain breakfast culture and enjoy having breakfast with no excessive noise crowded places. people around desperately looking for a place to plant their plates eating from REAL plates and so on etc. Besides that the amount of waste that is produced every day was really shocking. Sure you save personnel and huge dishwashers. As a couple who tries to preserve resources and take care of the environment this was troubling us.

Also lacking were any drawer storage for folded clothes. We wound up using two drawers in kitchen area. the bath had a lovely large shower but the lack of shelves for toiletries made it a little crowded. A wall above the commode is large enough that it could accommodate several shelves. The housekeeping staff was very considerate as we had several special requests. A complimentary breakfast is served but we only tried it twice as it left a lot to be desired in both selection and replenishment. Both times we observed they started clearing out the food well before the ending time. The selection consisted of bagels cold cereals. a prepackaged mystery egg dish bananas orange juice and coffee. Was tempted to sneak down to the Holiday Inn Express a few doors away. In the evening a complimentary happy hour is offered with a choice of beer or soda.

The room was pretty big and very clean comfy bed and air con heating with Wi Fi and a fridge hob toaster etc. The shower was great. And also we had a safe to keep some of our items secure. I think the hotel has recently been renovated and our room was nicely furnished and as mentioned very clean. and our beds and fresh towels each day. We stayed here for 5 nights and I thought with being so close to times Square area and Broadway it would be much more noisy but it was not at all apart from a few sirens which you would expect in NYC. The location was fab. What could have been better was the breakfast which itself was lovely and lots of choice but super busy each day. Our first morning we headed down at 830 and we could not get a table and guests were eating in the reception area. The 2nd day we went earlier around 815 but still stood to eat and took some stuff up to our room. The other mornings we went later around 9 and got a table. The elevators were no problem on our first two days but at breakfast time and arriving back to the hotel they could be super super busy and jam. Packed where at times I felt unsafe and not able to barely move as other guests would come in due to waiting so long. On checking out we were able to leave our luggage and collect later as our flight was later on. We had a cab booked for us for a pretty good price too back to Jfk.

Some good things some not so good. This hotel is hard to rate. My basic test Is it clean and does everything work as it should. Then I grade on the curve because you neither expect a Motel 6 to be like a Mariot or a Mariot to be like a Motel 6. The room was larger than many in Manhattan but could have been a bit cleaner the window shade was filthy and there were marks on some of the walls. No carpeting and a dark brown floor made it hard to tell if it was dirty. It looked basically clean. The bed was quite comfortable. Water pressure for a shower was a bit of a pain. Room furnishings were quite spartan and getting a bit tattered. I would have said that the room looked as if was furnished by Ikea but I have been in European hotels in the last year that literally were furnished by Ikea and they looked better. No lamp or power outlets at the desk a big WTF. WiFi worked OK. Mentioned a maintenance issue to a maintenance person who shrugged it off. The breakfast was a big disappointment. Eggs and sausage were cold and dry even early in the morning. No muffins rolls. The rest of the cold offerings were OK but clearly NOT one of the better hotel breakfasts including in NYC. The staff is good friendly and helpful although obviously the breakfast staff needed to stay on top of things a lot more. Three elevators and no particularly long waits. Business center OK. The location is a mixed bag. it is on the south end of Times Square I could see the New York Times building out my window and a five minute walk to the subway or Port Authority Bus Terminal and one minute or so to the M20 bus but what a minute that is. My wife did not feel safe as there literally were a half dozen presumably homeless people sleeping or otherwise passed on the sidewalk adjacent to the hotel. Another half dozen or so were panhandling. Obviously this goes on to some extent in many cities including smaller ones but there seemed to be a pocket concentrated adjacent to the hotel that made it a bit scary to walk there. This problem is greater it seems than with hotels further up Times Square. The hotel was OK for a night although it did appear that the rate dropped after we booked and we still paid the higher rate and I would rate it higher if they did a better job on some of the basics.
