They lavished her with sweets. lol cookies and small cakes. I did not know they also make specialty cakes for occasions until a nice lady working in room service told me.

We normally went to the Atlanta location but due to declining levels of satisfaction on the last 4 visits we decided to try the Ritz Buckhead location. We arrived to find that the ownership had changed. As out of towners we were rather dismayed that we had not been notifed in any way prior to our arrival as we may have re thought our plans. We entered the main dining room and were seated. Positives. The service was fine and the staff was tuned into our toddler grandson. Santa Mrs Clause were a delight. They clearly loved what they did and our grandson was delighted. Negatives. Entering the dining room we noticed the room was 23 empty and stayed that way all afternoon. The dining room was not warm or festive as the lighting was bright not subdued. it gave us a cold cafeteria feeling. The food was just adequate most dishes were barely warm. The piano highlighted in the center of the room but was never played. Mimosas were ordered and arrived in very small flute glasses. Usually high end holiday brunches include a mimosa etc. NOT here. When our bill arrived the 750. total showed a 12 charge for ea of the 3 mimosas. The whole experience did not even come close to any we have ever experienced in our 30 years of high end holiday brunches. The festivity was not there. if it were not for Santa Mrs Claus making it special for my grandson I would have spoken to a manager before leaving.

I had a three night stay for business and this hotel met expectations based on everything I had read in prior reviews. The hotel is well located in Buckhead convenient to both Phips Plaza and Lenox Square. As many have mentioned the hotel is currently undergoing a top to bottom renovation that will refresh all the public spaces and rooms. Other than the temporary entrance and corresponding awkward walk through the bar lounge to get to check in this was not an inconvenience. I kind of like all the dark wood in the hotel and hope they keep some of it as it has a nice feel compared to the super industrial modern that so many hotels are decorated in. The room was definitely dated the carpet was worn and the furniture has seen better days. That said everything was clean and the room was quiet. The concierge lounge was outstanding definitely one of the best in the chain. It is very possible to have a full breakfast and dinner there. The lounge staff took care to get to know me and it seems many other guests as well. Service was fine though nothing special. I did not get the feeling that anybody went out of their way to help but they were there when needed. One example I needed a quick trip to Target across the street and the front desk informed me that the hotel shuttle driver would be happy to take me. Upon asking the valet attendant to call the shuttle he seemed pretty bothered that I was requesting it for such a close walk. It was late at night and cold I was not wanting to walk. At the end of the day I did walk rather than push for the ride.

I have been going to this hotel since 1984.

This location fails miserably. Okay change the \u201c style \u201d to modernize it. I am okay with that. Changing to glass cheesy disco style balls over the downstairs bar I may reconsider but so be it.

Hotel not full. Was met with a smile and no offer to do anything at all. Stayed 3 nights. So disappointed. That little extra \u201c niceness \u201d. That little extra attitude of \u201c we care about you as a guest \u201d.

Cut out as much as possible at club level diminish service raise incidentals stick guests in uncomfortable situations all to make a bit of an extra buck at the expense of total guest satisfaction.

We arrived Friday Aug 16th to stay one night and we are immediately impressed by the doorman registration and even the valet service.

We went up to check out the club level lounge and stayed there for about an hour. we came back to our room to find a bottle of champagne and a small cake and a note telling me happy birthday.

We loved our stay so much that we are going back for my girlfriends birthday in November and made the reservations through the Mariot customer service number but immediately after making the reservations called the hotel and much to my delight Mary picked up and she said she would try and help me out again for my girlfriends birthday.
