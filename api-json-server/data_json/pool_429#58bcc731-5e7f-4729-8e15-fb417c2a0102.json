The breakfast buffet is amazing. Everything you could possibly want to eat. We found that the restaurants upstairs were a little on the pricey side as well as the buffet for lunch and dinner. The A La Carte menu in the dining room I found was very reasonably priced for the serving size. Mind you a coffee was 200 baht which is quite expensive 8. We found the Central Embassy across the street. You can walk up and over as trying to cross these streets you take your life in your hands. On the 5th floor is the food court. Not like the Canadian food courts. These meals are amazing for the price they charge. All four of us ate here for the price of just one meal at the Chinese restaurant in the hotel.

The Sunday brunch buffet though was as excellent as what others described with a large selection of sea food foie gras steak even Peking duck. A chef also came around to let guests try one of his cryogenicaly processed deserts to the delight of many who puffed dry ice fumes while eating. So this brunch is by far the best Bangkok hotels are offering and I had been to a few. The swimming pool is not large but still sizable for a downtown hotel. The guests there are a mix of conference people and families. No flocks of tourists nor screaming children while we were there. all were thankfully civilised. There is a short walk to the Skytrain station although halfway you can duck onto another hotel and negotiate your way thru air conditioned walkways and escalators to reach the train station. The area is more CBD and luxury residential so to go to tourist mecca of Siam say you will have to take a few stops by train.

Athene would have escaped my radar unles it had climbed to the top on TA. I was somewhat surprised on this and decided to give it a try. Athene is indeed an excellent hotel. though there some minuses as well. LOCATION55 for locationLocated behind Okura Prestige the location of Athene could hardly be better what comes to central Bangkok. The Sky Train is close by but unlike Okura there \u2019s no direct walkway to the station. This does not really matter as the walking distance is minor. just round the Okura building Park Ventures. and you are there. Other hotels nearby include Indigo and Conrad. I stayed in Conrad in December 2017 and unles they renovate the property completely I would not recommend it. BUILDINGThe Athene building was built in early 20s in BK terms it \u2019s not spanking new. The hotel was previously Plaza Athene and as such I recon it never got much attention. The building has 29 floors and the pool and gym are on 4th floor. Only the top level floors have floor to ceiling windows. ARRIVAL AND FIRST IMPRESIONS55 even though the grand lobby is bit old school. When entering the building it is obvious that it has been there for a while the grand lobby looks bit old fashioned but the face lift they have done recently has done a miracle the lobby looks fresh and elegant in a classical way. The service at the lobby was also excellent relaxed but courteous at the same time. As my room was a Club Prestige I was escorted to the Club Lounge for check in. The Club Lounge was on 26th floor. After the fresh and elegant lobby it looked bit \u2018 worn \u2019 as if they had n\u2019t touched the Lounge when doing other works. I \u2019l come back to this later. ROMCoridors 25 room 55One thing that caught my eye was the carpet on the corridor of the 26th floor. It was stained looked old and was a mismatch with the otherwise elegant colour palette in the lobby and especially that of the room. Also the lighting in the corridors was not up to date. The Club Prestige room was at the corner facing Okura Prestige Hotel and Ploen Chit Sky Train Station. The rooms was very elegant again in a classical way. There were hints of Thailand in curtains and pillows. Blue gray and white looked good together and even managed to hide the places that had not been renovated. Bathroom had not been touched much and it was the only minus I have for the room. The bed was excellent just as expected. Also waves for the TV placement. POL45 for the refurbished pool areaThe pool area has been fixed too. The new decking and artificial lawn hide the horrid old teracota tiles. The pool is ok size for a city centre hotel bigger that what it seems in the pictures. There are several 5 star hotels in Bangkok with better pool area hence just 45. It is still good but not excellent. The bar restaurant next to the pool looks very nice. CLUB LOUNGEFor looks 45 for food and service 55Compared to the rooms the Club Lounge which I would have expected to follow the same style greys and whites looked bit scruffy. The carpets looked new but it looked like they had n\u2019t touched the furniture. Also the old carpet in the corridor could create this effect the beige red carpet really does n\u2019t look good with the new colours in the rooms. The Lounge was surprisingly empty when compared to many other hotels in Bangkok. Even just minutes before the evening cocktails ending there was plenty of nibbles left. The food at the Lounge was better than in many other hotels in Bangkok. BREAKFAST45 for the breakfast. The breakfast was as expected not the best in Bangkok but very good still. The breakfast area was also large enough even during busy hours there was space. Service was again excellent. CONCLUSIONSAthene well deserves its 4 5. I generally like new hotels more. Athene is like an elegant lady in her 70s civilised and stylish in an understated way. If they \u2019d still have the corridor carpeting in all floors renewed it could well be the most elegant hotel in Bangkok.", "offset": [2611, 2697], "date": "2018-08-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "617edc87-f150-472b-a4b4-13abd2db350e", "sentence": "Not \u201c cosy \u201d enough for my taste but I felt safe and the pool was a bonus.

Thank you Kraisorn and everyone else. It supposes to be a luxury hotel but the hotel really do not care about the details. If Athene wants to be 5star and be qualify as a luxury brand the management has a long way to go. I want to emphasize that I \u2019m reviewing a LUXURY 5star hotel instead of a business hotel. We were there to celebrate my mom \u2019s birthday. They did email me and ask me if we want a complimentary blueberry cheesecake or Chocolate vanilla cake for her. Someone ca n\u2019t have chocolate in our group so I replied to the hotel with the choice of blueberry cheesecake. Guess what we received. A Chocolate Vanilla cake. I appreciate the offer from the hotel. However a 5star hotel should handle this more carefully. If you are doing this to make your guests feel welcomed maybe you want to make sure you do n\u2019t mess it up. Upon Check in I realized I upgraded to the Royal Club room with Club Access in my ap two months before my arrival date see photo below. When I arrived I was told the upgrade does not get me club access. I show them the reservation page on my Mariot Ap and I clearly stated \u201c ROYAL CLUB ROOM with Club Lounge Access \u201d. The front desk went to the back office with my phone and came back denying it. The manager on duty bargain with me back and forth about it. From one day access to three day access until front desk manager came out after 30mins and told me she \u2019s going to honor it. It \u2019s seriously annoying and what a joke for a 5star hotel. Guest rom1. The countertop of the bathroom is always messy and dirty after they clean up the room. Most of the luxury hotel MO Four seasons Fairmont \u2026. etc will clean up your countertop and organize whatever you have on it and put them on a clean towel or so \u2026 2. Carpet is extremely dirty in the guest room. My son spent 10 mins walking on it barefoot after the shower his feet were dirty. I am very surprised to see this happened at a luxury hotel. 3. They do n\u2019t offer any amenity for kids besides crib. This is very odd for a luxury hotel. At least carry kids toothbrush and slipper since your carpet is super dirty or make the hotel a business hotel instead of a luxury hotel. I suggest the management to check with other luxury brands to make sure you are updated with this. 4. The AC was broken. The temperature stays at 21 degrees the whole night and we had to call them to come and fix it. The swimming pool is very dirty too. However Sunday brunch at Rain Tree Cafe is highly recommended. They offer a wide variety of half shell oyster grilled lobster sashimi and A La Carte menu included in the buffet.
