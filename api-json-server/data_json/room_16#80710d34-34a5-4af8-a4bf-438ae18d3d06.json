First one should know that arrival is not like the typical in that you pull in on street level and then go up to the 12th floor for check in and then up another elevator to your room. But while this was our first time staying here it was not our first time visiting ie for lunch. so we knew this but others might want to know this. We were upgraded to a Suite which was lovely and very large but there were some weird things such as absolutely no clocks anywhere. this is a suite that has an entrance hall a huge living room and a large bedroom and a bath and a half. Not a single clock. And I had to laugh the make up mirror was mounted at waist level I kid you not. Hilarious. The internet came and went during the entire time we were there. Something that was really a disappointment was The Spa which we did not even get to experience because of it is location and how much effort it would take to get there. I had made an appointment about a week before arrival and was told that it was on Floor 11. Well I thought that meant that after going thru all the floor changes described above that we would just put on spa robes and go down a few floors. But no it meant going down to the huge public lobby on 12 and then transferring to a totally different elevator down to 11. If someone had explained this when we made the appointment some weeks earlier at least we would have been prepared. They knew I was traveling with my incredible special needs son and they should have given a better description of all this. On the plus side was the restaurant Deca. Our dinner was very good as was breakfast the next morning. Service was great as was the food. So congrats to Deca on all that. But the worst part of the stay was this there was no mini bar in the suite and when we called to express our dissatisfaction because you really do count on that even for something small. they said that Yes they had recieved many complaints about that. What. I do not understand how a hotel especially the Ritz can say they know guests are dissatisfied and yet they do not change it. The person said she would send a couple of OJs up right away comp but an hour later we had to call to see where they were.

My last couple of stays at a Ritz Carlton have not met the expectation of the brand. and while I enjoy the merging of the rewards program with Mariot I wonder whether that merger has had an affect on the experience. only 2 positive things to say about this trip at the property. the location is prime in the heart of the truly Magnificent Mile and all it offers with proximity to the Pier and the hustle and bustle of the world class shopping and the view from my room was spectacular by virtue of booking a bit pricier class of room than the standard KIng about 500 night I was on a higher floor with lake view with slightly more square footage which was squandered on the hall and bathroom rather than the living area. I looked on their web site in order to more specifically identify my rooms class but could not find it. that is it location and view. the service while not poor was perfunctory. now the negatives. first as other reviewers have pointed out the decor furnishings etc is tired scuffed furniture carpet showing wear etc. at a less than Ritz brand that might be acceptable I suppose the trashy dented white small fridge that looked like they picked it up at Howard Johnsons going out of business sale was a head shaker especially since there was a perfectly good built in one that apparently used to serve as a mini bar an in room amenity which they have eliminated. the power strip that they laid up on the bedside nightstand was helpful for those of us with devices etc but there are ways to deliver outlets more befitting of the brand that used to be. the one flat screen was smaller than most luxury brands living area screens and I guess would have sufficed had it worked. after having a guy from maintenance come up and disconnect connect it and mentioning it was a regular issue. when it went on the blink the next day I gave up. and btw it may be a quirk peculiar to me but when I stay at a luxury brand I expect HD programming especially on the sports channels that benefit most from HD. to have the Golf channel in standard definition at a Ritz Carlton is just embarasing but as unsatisfactory as the private space was the restaurant bar area and lobby were worse. granted they were undergoing renovation maybe still are but I value the public space in a hotel nearly as much as I value the room. I love a vibrant bar with engaged servers. neither was the case here. 4 barstols and a couple of guys who looked like they would rather be almost anywhere else. with some kind of dental convention there no room to relax and enjoy. my beef is that I booked directly by phone with the property as I usually do to avoid miscomunication but was not given a heads up as to the renovation that is also less than I expect from a luxury brand maybe it is time to reconsider what Ritz Carlton represents.", "offset": [941, 1060], "date": "2017-06-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "ac612b4e-7110-4775-8127-fd3b57490c99", "sentence": "Disappointing.

The floor plans for the rooms needs improvement. The staff was very friendly. The turn down service was nice and of course there were complimentary slippers but nothing really special that would make me want to come back. There was no sauna in the fitness area which is a norm at most hotels and no whirlpol hot tub. That was disappointing. The bed was not comfortable either. It seemed to sink in on one side very uneven. Another disappointment. I would think that the Ritz would have more and not less amenities. I really wanted to have a Ritzy experience but it was not luxurious to me just a basic hotel room in a nice area of Chicago. The guest check out was the best part.

I managed to book this hotel as part of a flight package for work which was nice since we were meeting at the hotel for drinks and having never stayed at a Ritz Carlton before I was excited for the opportunity. I found it quite strange that upon arriving through the revolving doors from my UBER ride I had to take the elevator up to the 12th floor to get to the lobby. I found this strange because everything on the ground floor indicated that I was walking up to and into a Ritz Carlton hotel. This was a little disappointing and much less grand than I was hoping for. Anyway up to the 12th floor and the doors open to a very open and luxuriant lobby. Finding the check in desk was a tiny bit confusing since it was at the complete opposite end of the room to the elevators and there were directions to multiple other places like the room elevators the bar gym restaurant etc. Either way I \u2019m not wholly bothered by any of this it was just a bit fidly from entrance to check in. Check in 610Once at the check in area I waited for a brief moment while the person in front checked out. A lovely lady whose name I forget at this time sorry helped me out and turns out after looking at my driving license address that she was new to Chicago and came from where I had departed that day. It was quieter so we chatted for a little while about old home and new home but eventually we ended our conversation and she showed me to the room elevators although I had already seen where these were en route to checking in. One thing I would say is that the communication from the staff was perhaps a little casual for a 5 check in but I was fine with this. Room 810Having arrived at about 4 pm I wanted to make the most of what was going to be a very comfortable room an executive suite. My reservation showed a Michigan Avenue view but as it turned out I walked into a big corner room with views of Michigan Avenue and the John Hancock Building. I always do a quick walkthrough when I get to my room and everything was in place and well appointed. I did n\u2019t see any personalisation on the tv which is sometimes quite nice to have but I was n\u2019t here to watch tv. I was overwhelmed by the views there were 3 large windows 1 in the sitting room and 2 in the corner bedroom. The seats in the sitting room were comfortable but the bed itself was the most comfortable I \u2019ve ever laid in so I was excited for a good nights sleep. There was however a large flat screen tv atop a chest of drawers awkwardly positioned in the corner somewhat overlapping one of the windows. The room itself was a little basic and outdated but nicely appointed and comfortable. The bathroom though that was top notch top notch looking at least. Bathroom 710Everything was laid out nicely I had 1 dressing gown since it was just me staying multiple towels hanging in lots of convenient places and there was also a nice selection of bathroom supplies. The lighting in the bathroom was nice too especially in the walk in shower. The toilet was clean and operated well it was a basic toilet though. I tried the shower out and the switch changing the flow of water to from the tap shower was fidly and would n\u2019t say out for the shower to work so I jimmy rigged a wedge to keep it out. This was frustrating because I \u2019m no inspector gadget I could n\u2019t quite fix it with what I had. Eventually I kept pulling it out and held it out long enough that I could enjoy the very large shower head. Temperature control was easy and water flow was perfect. This shower was lovely to be in it was big enough and high quality enough that I could just stand in it staring out the bedroom window through the open bathroom door. Do n\u2019t worry I \u2019m quite sure that no one could see inIn room dining 710I wanted to enjoy a nice morning sunrise looking out to the huge lake next door but it appears that I was quite turned around and could n\u2019t tell north from east. Oh well I still had my breakfast ordered for 615 which eventually arrived at 620 so pretty darn close well within the normal 15minute window. Since I was up already I managed to get to the door after he had rung the doorbell a feature I loved about this room. Esteban took over the door holding duties and pulled in the cart with my breakfast. It smelled very good. He asked where I wanted to eat but correctly assumed that I would eat in the sitting room facing the John Hancock Building and a large part of the lake. The food was good albeit the bacon was a little overdone and crispy. I had the poached eggs with hollandaise hash browns and corn cakes which was all delicious along with a glass of iced water and a small carafe of coffee. I took my time as the sun was slowly rising to the east of me. I had figured where I was facing by this time. To be expected it was expensive. 40 all in but it had to be done since I was without my wife and kids this time. Ordering food for 4 hungry mouths in the morning with in room dining is never cheap so we do n\u2019t usually do it. Conclusion 2840I was just here for the night so I did n\u2019t get to fully experience the hotel amenities rooftop bar gym pool massages etc. so I ca n\u2019t comment on them but I \u2019m sure they were of a high standard. I did however manage to leave my credit card at the bar after signing off the night before having enjoyed a Lagavulin 16year Menu price 20 billed price 22 so a is match here which should be addressed by management. Needless to say the staff were great and as I was checking out they asked if I had received my card back to which I replied \u201c no \u201d. They called security and arranged for them to bring it up to me. After checking out I sat in the comfy looking chairs in the lobby thinking about what I was going to do next. After the security guy came up and handed over my card after checking I was who I was suggesting I was I walked over the elevators and went down 12 floors to go out for the day. In the meantime I had left my bag at check in and was handed a ticket and told that upon my return the bag would be downstairs with the bellhop. All in all this was a very pleasant stay and I \u2019m betwixt between 3 or 4 for this place but upon my experience with the staff and general quality of the furnishings and food I am leaning towards 4. There were a few niggling details but these did n\u2019t affect my stay. I would certainly come here again and I \u2019m sure that my wife and kids would love to next time as well.", "offset": [687, 911], "date": "2019-09-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}]}
