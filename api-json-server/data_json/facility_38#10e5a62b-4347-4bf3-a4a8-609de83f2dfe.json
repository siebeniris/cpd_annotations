The worst 70 I have ever spent was taking my husband and son here with the expectation that we would receive an out of this world experience right. wrong. Family oriented. I do not even see how this property can morally accept children. We originally intended on staying here for five days and four nights. It was our first time in Miami and we wanted it to special. We booked one night with the intention of continuing our stay if our young son could enjoy himself inside of this property that purports itself to be family oriented. Our special trip began with our room not being ready at the designated time. Could we have been offered a discount for the inconvenience. no. how about a glass of house wine. no. a juice box for my son. no. But we did receive a barebones apology both before and after. Lo and behold we finally get to our room after an hour ordeal just to walk right into the stench of pot that enveloped us as if we were inside of a coffee shop in Amsterdam. The real fun started when we did not have anywhere to put my sons juices since the fridge was stocked with drinks provided by the hotel. The prices for the items inside were so over the top expensive that I had to do a double and triple take just see if I were reading them right. My husband called downstairs to complain about the hideous pot smell in the room and we were told that someone would be right up. We waited almost 40 minutes before my husband started spraying his cologne all over the place to attempt to rid the room of the smell. We went off to the pool to only be halted by some man yelling a hey you at us so he could confirm that we were staying in the hotel. Very Classy. Once inside we were attended almost immediately however that was the first and last time we seen anybody approach us for any type of accommodation. Fast forward 2 hours into it and some extremely rude woman approaches and reprimands us for having brought potato chips and a Snaple lemonade down to the pool for our son. She was so rude that I had to restrain myself from the words I wanted to use toward her while my husband just placated her demands. She told us that we have to take your son over to the patio for that and that we had to purchase anything and everything directly from them. My husband relented and eventually purchased two drinks from the bar and was absolutely livid that he was charged over 50 for two of the crapiest drinks we have ever ordered from anyplace we have ever been. The people working here should be wearing ski masks and that was strike two. The final blow comes with more pot smoke wafting around the pool area. Fed up and frustrated we decided to go back to our room and depart the property for an early dinner. Upon our return I took my son back up to the room to get changed while my husband stayed in the main lobby. I returned 20 minutes later to discover my husband attempting to discard of two working girls who despite him having told them that he was married with his family went on to persist in selling their illegal services. I went up to the front desk and was ready to scream while the man standing there was trying to tell me I had to wait my turn while the hooker filled lobby was trying to pick up any man with a wallet and a pulse. I received yet another crappy apology and was sent on my way. Thank GOD that we did not pay for the following nights ahead of time. This hotel is pure debauchery without a shred of decency or respect for those who have children with them. We have received better accommodations and experiences from 3 star airport hotels than we did from this hotel that purports itself to be one of the finer hotels in Miami beach. We moved immediately over to the 1 hotel the following day and were literally sighing with relief when we got there. I could not help but describe my experience with Fountainbleau with the agent who took care of us upon check in. Even she could not believe that a hotel would demand that a little boy remove himself from the pool for drinking an innocent lemonade just to force his parents into spending some ridiculous amount of money at the bar. 20 minutes after we got into our new room someone from the hotel brought our son complimentary juices and some other miscellaneous items with a handwritten message that we enjoy our family vacation. We had a wonderful rest of the trip in Miami and met some really great families that we hope to stay in touch with. I would never return to his hotel and have decided to share my experience with other parents so they can avoid the nightmare that our family experienced on our recent vacation.", "offset": [0, 55], "date": "2019-05-21", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "3cf4eb9b-58bb-4751-831a-41619faa7130", "sentence": "Way overpriced needs huge design update.

The Fountainbleau is more like 4 separate hotels and we were a long way from the front desk several long hallways stairs elevators. sound proofing left a lot to be desired club goers partying all night and housekeeping staff talking in the hallways all morning. No room service on our second day there and no apologies for it and very bad attitude when we asked for clean towels. On our third day there we had to line up to get a wrist band before we were allowed out to the pool area. This had not happened on the other two days but it took over 20 minutes in this line by which time my over priced coffee and muffin were cold. No security check on the way back in from the pool but not allowed out there without a band. made no sense. Anytime we left the hotel we had to call our own taxis. While the staff out at the pool were exceptionally nice you ca nt get service on the beach without downloading an ap to order your food and drinks. After doing this we still got our order cancelled because they could not find us on the beach. Extremely frustrating.

After 30 minutes at the reception desk I left for my room. The front desk neglected to tell me that the Tresor Tower was testing the fire alarms and the elevators were not functioning. I was then told the only access to my room was via stairs. After climbing 8 flights of stairs I called to ask how when my luggage would arrive. I was told the elevators being out would not be an issue as they would use the service elevators to bring luggage. That would have been nice to know prior to taking the stairs. An hour after checking in my luggage arrived. I had to make 3 requests to have it brought up. Clearly off to a bad start with service. Beyond that the room was very dated.
