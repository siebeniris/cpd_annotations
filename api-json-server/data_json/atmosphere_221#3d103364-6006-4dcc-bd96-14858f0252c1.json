The Ritz Carlton experience is always phenomenal. My trip began with Room 923 a one bedroom suite 2 bathrooms 2 balconies large sitting room a spacious bath with marble floors separate tub and shower and a reasonable distance away from the elevator. I prefer traditional furnishings and despise modernism like you get at the W or LMeridien hotels. I am a baby boomer I travel frequently and prefer full service luxury hotel acomodations to select service appointments. I asked for an upgrade received it and was very pleased by this room. This room was delightfully classic in furnishings yet modern enough to appease the new Generation Y traveler. I felt at home. There is lovely cherry paneling in the lobby area and in the elevators. I loved the morning coffee service in the lobby. The restaurant is lovely and was delicious. They do allow pets as long as you provide a deposit at check in. Most of staff is delightfully charming and accommodating. TIP. If you have a hybrid or electric vehicle your parking MAY be free if you self park. Free hybrid parking is not available however if you valet park. Ask for this parking perk when you are self parking. I liked the Signature Shop very small and quaint. I would have shopped even more if there were room in the hotel for a large gift shop with more choices as you find at the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco. There are at least 2 floors of meeting rooms all of them lovely especially the Boardroom. You pay for internet in the Business Center located on the 2nd floor a feature which I did not use on this visit but will prepare for on future visits. While one particular bell person was a bit direct with me English as a second language can at times find way to a misunderstanding I believe the Front Desk staff truly captured my heart and always made their first impressions their best. Thank you for making my Saint Louis experience a delightful memory.", "offset": [104, 153], "date": "2015-01-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "cf1c4437-dc8d-455c-be1e-f0b850579c51", "sentence": "Great overall experience.

We just completed our third stay at this lovely property in about a year and a half as in towners just wanting to get a night out. And we would never do this at any other hotel in St Louis as we have really found our home away from home. From the moment we called to secure the rate room we wanted till the time we had to leave everything was wonderful. This time most of the success was thanks to Jason the concierge. While we had not actually met him on our two previous stays he knew who we were and he had helped us to make contact with someone at the Chicago Ritz Carlton over this last Christmas that resulted in a very generous upgrade there. But honestly Jason is truly one of the best the very definition of service and friendliness. Again we stayed in a huge suite with two Juliet balconies overlooking the Carondelet Plaza. We were in the Club section and as always the staff in the Club were prefect. Lovely food presentations throughout the day. Our suite was just steps from the Club perfection. The suites have been completely redecorated this even since our stay just four months ago. They have a very contemporary super elegant feel. Mostly silvers and grays. Glitzy but still classy. The Club remained unchanged in terms of d\u00e9cor and that is lovely. In our experience Ritz Carlton hotels as elegant as they are do not really have over the top bathrooms and frankly that is okay. So very many hotels that have bathrooms namely the tubs that are SO over the top frankly are not all that user friendly for my special needs son. The tub for example being too huge for him to navigate safely. So I do not mind at all that Ritz does not generally do that. BUT what I do wish is that the shower and the tub too would have the hand held shower hose type attachment together with the regular show head. I mean hotels have had those for 15 years easily and it would be so much easier for me with my son to have that. The only thing this time I wish had been different was the restaurant availability. There are two dining venues. The Grill and The Restaurant. The Grill being sort of clubby with roaring fire and deep leather booths. That is where we would choose to go and so we called down to see about getting a booth and were told that would be no problem this by the front desk. When we arrived we were advised by signage that The Grill was closed on a Friday night and to go to The Restaurant. There we were informed that due to Valentines Day which was still 4 days away there was only a Price Fixe menu multiple courses for 9 person. This after we had just been told by the Front Desk that we had have no problem getting a booth in The Grill. CRAZY. We promptly left the Hotel for dinner at another restaurant not affiliated with the Ritz where we have been before and is just steps from the hotel. And it was fine. But we would have just as well been happy staying in the hotel and I would think they would have liked to have our patronage there too. But certainly do not want to end on a down note in any any way. We really love this hotel the people the elegance the location. it is all lovely.", "offset": [1301, 1429], "date": "2017-02-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "af5875c1-6056-4a7c-a2a7-c9868a7ea4f8", "sentence": "See you in St Louis.

Horible the once proud hotel is a shell of its former self I recently stayed there in one of the suites and during the course of my stay 2nights 3days the room was not cleaned once and something as simple as restocking the coffee both of which were requested 3 times was not done at all during my stay. On Saturday evening I went to the front desk and complained. I was in town for a funeral and told them I needed the room cleaned by the time I got back from the memorial service that evening. I had guests with me and I had planned on entertaining them in the suite after the service. When we arrived back at the suite that evening nothing had been cleaned wet towels on the floor from when I raced out to the funeral were still lying there un made bed etc. It was completely embarrassing as I know had a roomful of guests.

We were staying in Ritz Carlton St Louis during the summer this year. Unfortunately besides having good experience with the hotel facility we were having a horrible experience with the reception.

The manager obviously has apologised the week after when we have realised that we were seriously overcharged. The money was eventually refunded but we had to wait for it for a very long time. It was over 1000 dollars and the amount was significantly high to our budget. We have also spent a fortune on the phone bill as our phone provider is from Europe. The battle was long and never ending. If not for our German Bank helping us to recover the money we would not have had it until now.
