The hotel is a beautiful blend of old world charm and contemporary touches. Our room was comfortable and larger than the typical hotel rooms. The gas fireplace in the bedroom and a Nespreso machine was a nice touch and the walk in closet was large enough to accommodate our winter wardrobe. Staff was friendly and professional. Valet parking was efficient. Turndown service was great. At night there would be jars of water placed on the night stands and refill the jars the next evening. The hotel was not a ski in out property and you would need to take a shuttle bus to the bases. Ski Concierge right near the Blackcomb base was top notch. Staff at ski concierge was extremely helpful with our equipment rental and storage offered hot chocolates and cookies apres ski. We did not have to walk in ski boots back to the hotel. Skiing was never made easier. Daily morning coffee in the lobby complimentary wine tasting hot chocolates and smores in the afternoon. The only negative was the food. We had dinner at the Sidecut restaurant. Food was mediocre and service was slow. We also ordered room service for breakfast. Room service menu was limited and food was not too outstanding. We ate out a lot as there were so many wonderful restaurants in Whistler and the food was definitely better. Wifi is complimentary up to two devices. Hotel parking is CA39 per day.

Hotel has all the look feel and service you had expect from the Four Seasons. In some ways that is reflected most in the small things concierge driving me to a late night pharmacy ski concierge loaning my son a pair of boarding boots as his had not dried out overnight etc. Of course the price reflects that but given the general price of accommodation in ski resorts it was more reasonable than it might otherwise appear. We had a deluxe exec suite for our family of 4 2 adults and 2 kids. This was our second visit to the hotel both times in the same kind of room. This time our room was not as well located overlooking the main entrance or quite as spacious as the previous one but it was still fine and that is the luck of the draw I guess. The suites are a decent size and the second shower room is a real bonus with a family. We added a rolaway bed but in hindsight that cramped the living room a bit too much so next time we had make the kids share the sofa bed as it is large enough. Staff all very efficient and friendly. The hotel was very accommodating towards families and clearly understands that just because you have kids it should not prevent you staying somewhere nice and enjoyable. Even though the hotel is close to the Blackcomb base the ski concierge is very handy. One of the staff a woman whose name I do not remember but appeared to in charge was especially helpful when I was rushing to get my son to Whistler base one morning. My only complaint would be relating to the Wi Fi service. The hotel allows only two free connections per room and if you want to switch them between devices in the family this requires intervention from the service provider. The charge for additional connections was insulting something like 20 a day. We paid for family sized room and like most families we carry multiple devices for both work and pleasure. Making it hard or expensive to use them is a bit insulting and strangely out of keeping in a hotel that is otherwise so service and family orientated.", "offset": [43, 120], "date": "2015-04-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "c24104d4-fc42-4bbf-82f9-b7cb9c98d06d", "sentence": "Sublime Four Seasons Resort And Residences Whistler.

As frequent users of five star hotels domestically and in Europe we have always had Four Seasons hotels on our travel radar screen but have never actually stayed at one. I happened to stumble across founder Izy Sharps book about founding and building the brand so we decided to make a point of staying at a Four Seasons as soon as possible. We booked a premium suite on the Four Seasons website at the best price rate. This rate had a cancellation window of seven days with forfeiture of one nights deposit on late cancellation. We are firm believers in not using middle men and always deal directly with the chain when making bookings as we think that doing so allows the brand to offer the best rate and most favourable cancellation terms as promoted on the Four Seasons website. We invited some friends to join us at the Four Seasons and we were surprised to note that they received a similar room for a considerably lower price by arriving without a reservation. I reviewed the terms of our booking and noted that we had no recourse as we had accepted the terms and conditions at time of booking. Well enough I have no problem living up to my commitments but I also reserve the right to feel slightly offended at being somewhat abused for booking well in advance and booking directly with the hotel. We were also somewhat offended by a mandatory 40 night valet parking fee no self park option. I do not like to have other people drive my car and dislike being nickel and dimed on a very expensive hotel room. In the vein of nickel and dime my wife had some very important technical work to complete online and required a high speed internet connection to do several hours work while we stayed at the hotel. 20 per day for high speed internet at the suite rate we were paying was an irritation. As to the Whistler property itself the room was very nice and the service we encountered was uniformly excellent. The hotel is VERY family oriented as are most hotels in Whistler and as this was the July long weekend the place was full of children. The main dining room Sidecut has a casual atmosphere yet prices are comparable to the most expensive restaurants in Whistler Sidecut also has the added burden of being overrun with kids. So for family groups this might be seen as an upside. It should be noted that the Four Seasons is located at a distance to the central part of Whistler so dining options are limited without a walk or a shuttle ride which may or may not run late enough to allow for a visit to some of Whistlers best restaurants. On the other hand it is located close to the ski slopes. We enjoy paying top prices for top facilities when we travel but completely dislike being left with a feeling of being taken advantage of. We will not return to the brand for this reason and will not return to the Whistler location because of the relative unattractiveness to us of its restaurant.", "offset": [1870, 1983], "date": "2016-07-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "bc177c68-228b-40a4-9017-7060d6a71b0d", "sentence": "Mountain High Four Seasons Whistler.

We had a large room with sitting area and an enormous dressing room and cupboard space at the entrance to our room. We are not skiers but guessed this is designed to cater well for the ski season and all the skiing kit. Anyway we enjoyed the extra space. The hotel felt warm and cosy and the weather was getting cooler so the fires in the room and in the main reception and dining areas were welcome. Dining was good for steaks in particular. Breakfast was also good with cooked food to order. I ordered a fruit platter and there was so much it lasted me for two days. They even packed up the surplus in a doggy box for me to put in the fridge in the room. The biggest drawback was the parking. We opted to park our own car but had to go to the town car park about 1 Km away. Not exactly close by. We still had to pay for that privilege.

This is not a great family resort. let us start with the king bed only option. If you have three kids and they are huge there is going to be a brawl for who gets stuck on the sleeper sofa. The concierge team is a mess. None of our reservations were in place despite reaching out three times prior to arrival. Three times I emailed the concierge and was never answered. I had to call the concierge the day I was flying in to make sure I had a car to pick us up. She said I did not and after ten minutes she said I did. When we arrived our lift tickets spa reservations dining reservations and ski rentals had to be dug for altered and amended. It was a mess. Furthermore we had dining reservations we knew nothing about that we missed and which required a 72 hour cancellation and came with a penalty for not doing so. The hotel took care of the penalty and tried to put everything right. they always do. If you have adult kids there is nothing for them at this hotel. Unles after eight hours of skiing they want to hit the gym or pool. That can be nice but my kids were looking for a nice pub style place to hang in for the apres ski scene. It does not exist at this hotel. Go to the Fairmont for great atmosphere food and vibe. There are limited places to dine. A pop up ramen place. And Sidecut. The service at Sidecut is slow. The in room dining is overwhelmed and equally slow. Neither are worth the wait. The spa is decent. I had one treatment with a gal named Jackie which was excellent and another which was horrible. They sell reusable water bottles for 44 dollars in the ski shop. buy one or bring your own. there is no water in the room well there was not in mine. Unles you want to buy the 7 Evian. I have lymphoma so I am always thirsty. Our kids were constantly complaining they were thirsty. Apparently Whistler has great water quality. I wish they would put a note in the rooms saying it was ok to drink from the tap The was a water dispenser station at the bell stand but it was broken when I tried to use it. there is a ton of no mans land on the first floor but I dare you to try and get a drink after a day on the slopes. It was 35 mins for my husband to get me the equivalent of a hot toddy. I did not ski because I am no longer able so I explored every inch of this hotel. Room decor is eh cold and drab.
