I am a frequent guest at Mariot Hotels mainly staying in the USA. I have found the Mariots outside of the US can be very different in many ways. So I try to manage my expectations although I am always hopeful. I can usually count on the JW Mariot to be above the standard. My family and I traveled to London for our last summer vacation. There were many positives about the Grovesnor House. The location is perfect for seeing the best of London. Public transportation and Hop on Hop off buses are a short walk from the hotel. Hyde Park which is adjacent to the hotel is wonderful for walking jogging or just taking a nice break from the busy streets. As frequent guests we were able to take advantage of the Executive Lounge. The breakfast spread was impressive and delicious. The evening cocktail hour spread was almost a complete dinner. If you are looking to save a bit of time and cash definitely do so by having breakfast at the Lounge. The rooms were always cleaned perfectly and seemed to be done by housekeeping with perfect timing. Housekeeping was friendly and courteous. Room service was quick and accommodating. Now the negatives First be sure you get dropped off at the correct entrance. Our Taxi dropped us on Park Lane which is not where reception is located. There was a doorman there but he acted as if we were lost and did not offer to open the door or take our bags until we started dragging the in ourselves. The rooms are just okay nothing special. Like most EU hotels the rooms are smaller than in the US but with high ceilings. I agree with an earlier contributor. The beds are terrible both lumpy and hard. The beautiful high quality linens used to dress the beds do not make up for uncomfortable mattress. We had two rooms with four beds and all of them were the same lumpy and uncomfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful when approached but seemed wary of everyone. We actually sensed a level of paranoia in a few. On one of our first trips back to the hotel after a long day of sight seeing we were stopped in the lobby by an Associate with a clip board asking if she could help us. Her tone was aggressive and she actually blocked our way to the elevators until I explained we were guests of the hotel. Although casual we were not dressed poorly otherwise we could understand. Honestly I felt as if we were not welcome which gave me a slight sense of paranoia too. As an Platinum Elite member this was indeed strange. The hotel is in the same historical building as the Jumeirah Apartments. I believe many of the Apartment owners visiting families must be staying in the JW as the hotel seemed full of Arab families. A few of the more independent children of these families had free rein over the hotel including the bar in the late evening. Strangely the parents were not with them. This too was surprising to us. Finally the hotel is undergoing a renovation. I must have missed this when I booked and read the reviews as I would have made another choice. The hotel was clean and we were never disturbed by construction but I always steer clear of hotels under renovation. Experience has taught me it is never a good thing. In the end we enjoyed our getaway to London and will look forward to visiting again. However the JWM Grosvenor House will need to improve on customer service mattresses and overall guest relations as well as completing their renovations before we will venture there again.", "offset": [1478, 1518], "date": "2015-08-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "a7d6b6a8-855d-4804-aabd-8599051a6d04", "sentence": "Not a 5Star Property.

My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for an awards evening event. I booked a Deluxe suite so that we could have access to the Executive lounge as we were arriving in London at lunchtime. We were disappointed to find that we could neither get lunch nor could we get an alcoholic drink of any sort in the lounge. The bar in the lounge apparently opened at 5 pm but we were due at the event at 6 pm so there was no point in going to the lounge first. The only food we could get at 145 was afternoon tea which is not really what you want at that time of day. We had to go out for a sandwich. The breakfast the next morning was very good indeed with plenty of choice of hot and cold food. However there was a distinct shortage of bowls for the fruit salad spoons for the cereal and cold milk for the tea. I know I can live without these things except for cold milk in my tea. but we are in a prestigious hotel in the middle of London and you do expect for the cost of the room that the staff will remember to replenish the cutlery and plates. For some reason some hotels do not cater for the English habit of cold milk in tea. If I am abroad I can understand it but not in my own country. I know this is an American owned hotel but it is also an icon in London the capital city of England. The room was very nice except for the view of the heating system rather than the promised London parkland. However for one night that was not particularly important. If you stay at this hotel and want a view you had better ask in advance. I do not think the lounge access is worth the extra money to gain entrance. The Wifi is fine in the lounge but non existant in the rest of the hotel unles you pay. Pretty old fashioned in this day of technology.

I have stayed here before the last time I was in London a few years ago and had a good stay. Unfortunately my week long stay this time around is not off to a good start. After arriving at the hotel after 2 pm my room was not ready which is understandable but disappointing non the less. I was asked to wait in the lobby or lounge until my room was ready. I was told that they would check on the room status and inform me once it was available. Well after a few hours of waiting near the front desk I walked up to check the status. Room was ready but no one advised me despite seeing me in the lobby. My luggage had already been delivered so I imagine it had been ready for a while. I was also pretty much ignored while some of the staff roaming the floor conversed with other guests. They have a lot of staff walking around but many are not friendly. Some are just plain rude. The staff at the Starbucks need a personality. Not sure what is going on but this is not the same hotel I stayed at before. I do have to give credit to the nice lady at the concierge desk who secured tickets to a football match this coming weekend. She was quite officiant and good at her job and I am appreciative with how fast she set it all up. Now to the room. They shoved me in a room on the first floor that makes me feel like I am in a dungeon.

As part of our 30th Wedding Anniversary celebrations our Daughter arranged a Champagne Afternoon Tea at The Park Room of Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane London. We arrived a little early for our 5PM tea spot on a busy Friday afternoon. The whole hotel had been decorated beautifully for Christmas. Arriving early gave us plenty of opportunity to explore the hotels public areas and listen to the pianist in one of the lounges. At 420PM I enquired if we could dine early and the staff hurriedly prepared a table in the centre of the Park Tea Room. The tea room overlooks Park Lane at Hyde Park. We were entertained by the flashing lights of Winter Wonderland opposite. After introductions by our waiter Altay we were served a glass of champagne each. Other afternoon tea options not including champagne are available. Service was attentive without being obtrusive. There was a high ratio of staff to customers. After the champagne each of us was presented with a tiny schot glass of a pinkish purple liquid topped by white candyfloss was brought to the table. It was a Blood Orange smoothie and was delicious. A cake stand was brought to our table. It was topped with a miniature nutcracker soldier standing amongst the cakes. We were told that we could select our choice of jam to compliment the scones. Being a traditionalist I chose strawberry but my Wife chose rhubarb and ginger and raved about the flavour. So much so that I was sent across to a stall in Winter Wonderland to see if that jam flavour was for sale \u2013 she was disappointed when it was notWe were surprised to see that there were only five largish finger sandwiches on offer. Ham mustard beef and horseradish seafood chicken mayo and cucumber. We each chose our favourites and cut those we could not agree on in half so that we each shared our favourites. We need not have worried because as soon as the sandwich plate emptied Altay appeared with a tray of replacement sandwiches. In the end we both had at least two of each variety. We both found the slightly warm fruit and plain scones crumbly and a little dry. I have previously mentioned what a hit the jam was and this was complimented by rich smooth clotted cream which served to hold the very crumbly scones together. In fact we had to eat our scones and cream with a cake fork. The tiny delicate cakes were excellent. The photographs attached show the variety. I had a dark chocolate which had a sponge base and mousse topping held together in a dark chocolate case. Each cake had been described to us by Altay and had significance to the Nativity story. One represented shepherds and another the angel while another cake was likened to the Three Wise Men. The cakes were very rich and one would have been enough for most people. Altay offered to box up those left over and as we were about to leave presented us with two cake boxes to take home. It was not until we arrived home that we realised that the cakes left on our cake stand had been supplemented with macaroons and black forest gateau. After we had eaten our cakes Altay came across with a tray of savoury brioche buns topped with smoked salmon prawns or a savoury egg concoction. We thought it odd that they were served after the cakes but hey ho they were very good. By this time we were replete and could not eat another thing. As we thought we had finished Altay and a waitress present us with a decorated plate wishing us happiness on our 30th Wedding Anniversary. Altay made a little speech which was touching. We had not told the staff why we were there but I suspect that they had picked up on the type of celebration when the booking was made. We were instructed to take the miniature nutcracker soldier home as a souvenir. We have made a hobby of partaking in 5 high class afternoon teas around the world. While I would rate the tea in the Park Tearoom highly I was a little disappointed by the quality of the scones and the number of cakes on offer. The service was impeccable and the venue convenient for the shopping centres of London. I am a part time wheelchair user. I was very surprised when I asked about the availability of a disabled toilet to find that it was down five steps. I enquired if there was a route to it without having to negotiate the steps. I was told that from the Park Room there was not. It would have been impossible for someone permanently whelchairbound to access that toilet. Also I noted that the red emergency pull cord was too high up to reach if a disabled person had fallen to the floor.", "offset": [1776, 1887], "date": "2019-11-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}]}
