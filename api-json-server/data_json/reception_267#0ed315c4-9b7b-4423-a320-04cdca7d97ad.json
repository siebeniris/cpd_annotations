This is going to be my new favorite place. Normally we go to Barnsley Gardens in Adairsvile as we love the countryside the cottages and used to love the food. The food has gone way down and the prices up so now that we have come to CE I honestly probably will not go back to Barnsley again. First they have done a several millions of dollars of renovations updates to the entire property recently. They are also building a huge grand ballroom for events and they have a new Italian winemaker if you are remembering the not so great wines from years past as I did. and they have won several awards for the new wines. Apparently they outsource the grapes for all of the wines except the Muscadine ones which is good since Muscadines are native to GA and grow fine here. We got the Romance package which included meals bottle of wine and rose petal turndown perfect for our anniversary getaway. We loved our King corner suite it was huge. The linens were wonderful nice TV nice refreshment center that included a fridge I would suggest that they furnish at least 2 bottles of water for arriving guests and great large bathroom with huge tub. D\u00e9cor was nice very clean and lovely overall. oh yes huge foyer area with large closet. Check in was very smooth and I love that they have staff from various countries like they do at the Ritz. Also the nametags state the first name and the city or country they are from just like the Ritz. I have already reviewed the restaurants that we visited except Paddys Irish Pub which I can not find on TA to review but it was awesome. if you read the history it is a real pub built in Ireland and transferred over rebuilt very cool which were all wonderful. Though we did not do any spa services we did walk the grounds on the walking trail and over to the Spa building you can stay in that section too must be 18. Very relaxing beautiful with a view of the pond. They have a more health oriented restaurant there too which I can not wait to try next time. Another thing to mention is that the winery is the building you see when you drive up and the Inn is over to the right and if it is raining or just blazing hot you can catch the constant shuttle up down which is a nice touch. I had also ordered an amenity of fresh flowers to be in the room upon arrival which they were. We did the wine tour tasting upon arrival Friday at 3 we were the last ones in which is unfortunate as we missed the first half hearing the tour guide since we were so far back. the part we heard was very interesting. Then upstairs to the tasting that was fun. Chris was our person he was extremely knowledgeable about wines in general as he had completed a sommelier course. Then we did a wine flight which is 8 tastes in the wine bar market area. The layout is awesome with foodstuffs cute wine items to purchase. We did not do it but they also have a culinary school on the other side of the wine market. Also I love the fact that they had music all over the place. Sat pm they had someone playing the piano under the atrium area near the Versailles restaurant they had a guy playing guitar singing at the pool all day Saturday pool hot tub area huge gorgeous. there are servers you can order food drinks from perfect a guy singing and playing music in the Irish pub Fri Sat and a cool DJ Saturday evening playing Motown current dance music in the huge nicely appointed lounge that has 3 pool tables. Also at 4 on Saturday they had a mixologist demonstration tasting with 4 different cocktails very cool free. All of the events options were on the cool little newsletter they give you upon check in which is such a smart idea. We met the President CEO in the Versailles restaurant Sunday am though we did not know his title he was just bussing tables like the servers. We chatted with him for a while. I told him he was working hard he said he did not consider it work since he loves what he does the day he does not he would quit. Very cool. Upon our departure he was back up near the front desk saw me carrying my vase of flowers and he immediately told our bell person to get me a box for my flowers they had that for me lickety split to keep the flowers from toppling over. that is the kind of service that puts a place over the top for me. We wound up joining the Wine Club they can ship the wines to you or you can go and pick them up and they have a little reception with cheese etc. you get a free glass of wine when you do it this way how cool. All the staff spoke to you and were friendly and courteous even a couple remembered it was our anniversary and said Happy Anniversary. Would mention the place was very well staffed as they had weddings both Fri Sat evenings and this did not detract from the level of service with regards to any aspect of service. Couple of notes 1. our room door deadbolt did not close well. the safe did not work but we notified the front desk they put in a work order even offered to bring us a new safe. 2. bought a fridge magnet we like to collect these from every where we go at the gift shop they only had 2 both had little chips on them but I wanted it anyway the girl did wrap it up nicely in a cute box for us. 3. I would suggest they put 2 waters in the suite fridges for arriving guests they do this at most upscale places. I would highly recommend this place for locals for a weekend getaway or for someone having to travel in it is just a wonderful place with outstanding service delicious food and some pretty good wines. it is a resort place that you do not have to leave the property for anything except to go home which we hated to do.

The chateau is absolutely beautiful from the inn to the pool to the winery to the spa. The biggest and truly only complaint I have is that the amenities listed on the website are NOT consistent with the hours they are actually open. We came Monday Thursday and the website AND the brochure in the room itself both had pool hours and restaurant hours listed incorrectly. They stated Fleur de Lis was open for breakfast daily but it only actually has breakfast on weekends. The spa itself was also hard to find without asking for directions. The pool bar was listed as opening at 11 daily but really opens at noon throughout the week. It would also be nice if the winery was open later than 7 pm. The gift shop was unable to break a 20 bill which was also slightly inconvenient and the treadmills and elliptical machines almost all had tv screens that were not functional which was disappointing. The pool was lovely and spacious with plenty of comfortable chairs and umbrellas but the waterfall advertised by the website that allegedly pours into the hot tub was not running at all. The pool bar staff was awesome Crystal gets five stars hands down. Dinner at Marc was unexpectedly awesome particularly the Brussels sprouts and the charcuterie board that was far superior to the one offered next door in the winery. Robert our server was super friendly and knowledgeable and took plenty of time explaining the dinner features to us and making us feel welcome and special. We got tremendous enjoyment from the after dinner house made caramels with duck fat. Absolutely mouth watering. The lemon pepper wings and the snake bite drink at Paddys were both excellent and the price was right for the pub fare. The room was very clean and well appointed and the beds were extremely comfortable as well. From a cost standpoint the room rate was totally reasonable the spa services seemed overpriced as well as the majority of the food and drinks but that is to be expected at a nice resort hotel. Yoga for 15 at the spa was really enjoyable and the tennis court hourly rate of 25 seemed reasonable as well.
