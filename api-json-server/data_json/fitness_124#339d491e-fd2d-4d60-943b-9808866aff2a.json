I was given a voucher for afternoon tea and my best friend and I decided to take it this weekend following a girlie spa visit. We turned up ahead of time and after a short wait in the busy bar we were seated in the main Opus One dining room. The waiting staff were very attentive. From the menu we decided to have the Gentlemans Afternoon Tea. This comprised warm pork pies mini fish chips and mushy peas mini Yorkshire puddings with roast beef and gravy sandwiches and scones with clotted cream and jam. We also sneakily shared a bottle of Proseco. Well it was a treat after all. The afternoon tea was amazing. We tried valiantly but could not quite eat it all. we left a couple of sandwich quarters and one scone. Pots of tea followed the alcohol. All in all a great treat and well worth the price. My one complaint. The lighting. The huge chandeliers are lit in red which gave a very disorienting glow to everything. We struggled to read the wine menu as some of the type was also in red so virtually invisible. We had to take a photo of our experience and this made me look like I was in a bordello.

The welcome at reception was outstanding. Juan Carlos was both efficient and friendly and was an excellent example of the can do attitude that usually sets Radison hotels apart from the competition. Our room had a fantastic view across the city and was very nicely set out with a lovely bathroom. Everything was spotless and perfectly prepared. The Spa is great with one of the best hotel pools that we have seen in a city centre hotel. We had it to ourselves when we were there and it was a great place to relax. Good sized Sauna Steam Room and whirlpool. All of the facilities were really clean and well maintained. We did not use the gym which was compact but looked pretty good. The bar is a very impressive space double height and smart. Cocktails were well made and delicious and the bar service quick and accurate. We did not eat in the hotel. we just do not generally and breakfast was not included in our rate. Both restaurants looked very good though and they offer the Steak or Lobster menu in one of them. Overall a very very good example of what Radison do so well high standards and the best of staff everyone we met from the chambermaids men to the Manager when we checked out was really friendly and positive.

Me and my husband visited the Radison for his birthday just this week. The hotel is gorgeous. very modern clean and bright. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a big bed and clean bathroom. My only complaint about the bedroom is that it was ridiculously hot all night and we had the air con on full blast and it just did not seem to cool at all so this did make for an uncomfortable nights sleep. We used the pool and gym facilities in the hotel and I must say they are great. My main issue with what happened on my stay was breakfast. We went down and queued for a good 10 minutes before being seen to. The lady asked us our room number and proceeded to tell us that breakfast was not included in our room price. Now when I booked the hotel I made sure that breakfast was included as it was my husbands birthday and when we stay away breakfast it always a key part highlight to our stay we really enjoy it. I told the lady that I defiantly had breakfast booked it states on my confirmation booking email which she then asked to see so my husband had to go all the way back to the room for it on returning I could not load my emails as I had no internet. The lady went to see a manager and when she returned she said that it did not seem to be included but In this time I had found my confirmation which stated I had booked and paid for breakfast it was not good enough that she could see this I then had to go to reception and prove this to the manager who did not say a word apart from look and say to the lady you will have to give it them and walked off. It was so rude. We got no apology. Nothing. I had paid like everyone else but was made to feel like I was being given a favour too. I did not like how it was handled at all. Also I must add some of the staff were a little rude mainly in the restaurant area. Not what I expected really to be honest.

I believe the rooms you pay more for on higher floors however we had no complaints and had a good view. We used the gym and spa facilities that are included in the price. The gym is very modern and has plenty of machines to use. The spa area is cosy but nice my only criticism was that the jacuzi was not that warm and I did not stay in for long however I had no complaints with the rest of the spa. We paid for breakfast when we booked the room and it is well worth the extra cost. There was plenty of choice continental or cooked breakfast and also choice from the \u00e0 la carte menu included in the price. the eggs benedict was superb. We parked on a secure car park near to Deansgate at a cost of \u00a3 15 for 24 hours which was a 10 minute walk away we did not mind the walk as it is flat and allowed us to explore the area.
