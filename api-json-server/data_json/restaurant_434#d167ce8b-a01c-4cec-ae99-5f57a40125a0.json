I have been to over 20 all inclusive resorts in the past 20 years and I have never felt the need to write a review until now. We returned yesterday from a great week at Fiesta Americana Condesa Cancun. We were a group of eight consisting of two young families with four children that are under four years old. Every one of us had an excellent time. Each staff member that we encountered accommodated our families needs over and above our expectations. The front desk staff were efficient friendly and accommodating. The night manager of the main buffet restaurant was amazing and made us feel like VIPs despite our children being. well children. Each of the a la carte restaurant menus was made available to us and we loved all of the offerings. The food was absolutely the best resort food that anyone of us had ever had and the service was excellent to. The daytime food options were plentiful two restaurants coffee shop smoothie station snack bar daily grill burger grill pizza place seafood shack and everything was delicious quick and presented nicely by friendly staff. Also the night time sushi bar was top notch. Bar service was very good with a good selection of quality spirits available. The kids loved the facilities for children and the parents enjoyed how laid back and accommodating the staff were. The only real downside to the resort was the room. Although it was kept clean and tidy by the housekeeper it was a bit dated the a c was a bit noisy and the double beds were a bit small. Not bad enough to complain to the front desk about but it is the reason I give a 45 instead of a 55 overall rating. I can not say enough about how great the service and food was. This is the first resort that I have ever thought that I will return to some day.

I was also very happy to see J a server in the main dining area for breakfast each morning. Most of the other staff members were extremely nice and a pleasure to be around.

We just returned from a 6night stay at Fiesta Americana Condesa in Cancun. We got 4 days of sunshine and 3 very rainy days. The sunny days were spent at the pool which we LOVED. The pool service was wonderful and the kids especially loved the smoothie bar pizza and hot dogs. We loved the fresh grilled chicken by the pool. We were a little disappointed that the kids pool area with slides was not there anymore but my 10yr old had fun nonetheless. The infinity pool was the perfect depth for her to walk around comfortably with her head above water and that made this mama feel comfortable. We just wished the pool were open later at night and that there were more food options and activities open later outdoors as well. Food and drink services closed at 5 pm by the pool. We liked the buffet restaurant with the made to order quesadillas and omelets in the morning. It did not seem to have air conditioning either which would have been nice. The asian themed restaurant by the pool and beach was delicious as well. The kids enjoyed the sushi bar every day. We never got to try the steak house as we were never at the hotel between 2 and 4 to make reservations. We were a little disappointed in the Mexican restaurant as there was minimal seating and our party had to sit at separate tables. The traditional singers were great though. Speaking of singers the Michael Jackson show was our favorite. We could not believe how much he looked and danced like Michael Jackson. We really felt like we were at one of his concerts. We enjoyed the coffee shop inside the gift shop very much as well. Room service was used one time and it was fantastic very prompt. The rooms were nice but very damp. The sheets felt wet at night. it is a humid climate so I am not sure how that can be controlled. The air conditioner could have been a little cooler as well. With the modern decor there is a glass window separating the bathroom from the rest of the room so there is zero privacy which made it difficult for us as a family to change clothes etc. The rain shower was awesome. The facilities were clean. There were a lot of leaks in the lobby though on the rainy days. They had to put towels down on the floor. All in all I had give FAC an 8 out of 10.

There is some construction going on in the resort but it did not effect our relaxation or our vacation at all. They are in the process of renovating the restaurants we were told they should be finished by the first of the year. The beach is beautiful there was some seaweed but not enough for it to be a crisis we all know being by the water anyplace there will be some. They do come by and get most of it off the beach. The beach at this resort is absolutely beautiful it is a large beach with plenty of chairs. The resort has an upper pool and a lower pool with a swim up bar and a pirate ship for kids. Out by the pool area has a ton of different food options from the grill to the fish tacos fresh smoothies pizza etc. We spent most of our time by the pool looking at the ocean. We had the pleasure of having Jose and Angel as our waiters. These two men are amazing they were always there we never had to wait for a drink we would turn around and there they werethey have several restaurants on site our favorite is the Kalmia this is a buffet style with a different theme every night of what will be served. In here we found Reyes he is also an amazing waiter. We saw him for lunch and dinner and had J for breakfast. Both of these men go out of their way to make your time with them unforgettable. We also used room service Pilar was who took care of us there she went that extra mile to always make sure we had everything we needed. The hotel has shows at night every night being a different one. The Mexican and Michael Jackson show are our favorite. Though they are often overlooked the men outside who greet you when you arrive also need to be recognized as well. Arriving to the hotel we were greeted by Campos with a hug and a smile. It is nice when the staff remembers you from the year before. Every time we passed him outside he was always able to help us in where we wanted to go and if it would be a safe destination to go. Last but certainly not least is Fernanda she is in guest services. I can not say enough about this woman. I have been coming to this resort since 197 and until her it was just a nice resort nice staff and good food. This woman goes absolutely above and beyond for the guests. We had certain requests with out room and she made it happen. We were greeted everyday with something special in our room. She made time to come find us everyday and make sure everything was good if there was not she would have made sure it was taken care of. This is not a job for her it is her passion and she does it well. We will continue coming to this resort every year hopefully even twice a year going forward because of her and the staff. We told her before we left we can stay at any hotel it is only a building with a room to sleep in with this resort it is the people that bring us back year after year.

PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEW. I just returned from here staying June 27 through July 2 2018. I booked this trip through a travel agency who used Funjet Vacations as the marketer. I have special needs which is why I went the travel agent route. This resort is booked as one of the leading handicapped accessible resorts in Cancun Mexico. NOT. I use a walker to get around. There was only one ramp to one restaurant and only on one level at that. There was an extremely long circular walk to get to the kids pool and you could snake around that pool into a second eating area from the back if you chose. My granddaughter had to fold up my seated walker carry it down steps then come back and get me help me down the steps and there are no hand railings anywhere. There are not roll in showers in every room but walk in showers and they are fine but will not accommodate wheelchairs or walkers unles you book one of three such rooms. I went to the pool one time went to the far restaurant one time and that is it. In room majority of time. Elevators very small will accommodate a wheelchair and maybe two other persons maximum at one time. Steps everywhere steep steps. So if you are mobility limited this is not for you. The beach area was not as portrayed. At the edge of the sand where the Caribean Sea meets the edge is a domed wall of sand dirt etc topped by a ton of seaweed. They removed the seaweed the first morning we were there and never after My granddaughters watched very morning unfortunately. I could not traverse that hill and who wants to trudge through seaweed. I asked the hotel staff about it was basically ignored with a shrug. The food needs improvement the girls tried all the available spots and were not impressed. The times I dined the food was okay. Not worth the cost of the all inclusive trip. We were ready for McDonalds upon return to the states. Now some menu selections were better than others. We are not drinkers so I can not comment on the drinks. There are some good points to this resort also. The security was very good with guardhouses and checks made of all comings and goings. I was impressed with that. The rooms were humid but that is to be expected. They were very clean tastefully decorated overall good staff to maintain the mini fridges with water and drinks. If you had a need just call and it was taken care of. Unfortunately they could not create handicapped accessibility at the flick of a pen. Most of the staff was helpful and courteous. Antonio was my to go person and he was extremely concerned about my inability to navigate the resort and he helped my granddaughters find the least amount of steps required for me to try and maneuver. But these steps are steep and no handrails making extreme difficulty. I think my girls enjoyed the trip but it was misrepresented to me. Not sure whose fault that is. the travel agent is looking into the matter as we type so I am not laying blame with this resort. There is construction going on and unfortunately being room bound was horrible as I was very close to the areas. Awful noise jackhammers pounding 247 almost. I actually cried the second day I was there but soon realized I had no choice but to tough it out. If you are all healthy no physical limitations even with your children. this would be a very safe clean pools awesome teen area for you to try. do not plan on fantastic food but overall acceptable. This is not cheap but it is a beautiful resort beautiful gardens beautiful view. I will not go back myself neither will my girls because of the inability to get to the water safely and cleanly.

The reason our review is a 4 and not a 5 is simply because of the construction. At the time of our booking in early 2018 for our June trip we did not see any big disclaimers or warnings concerning the severity of the construction. The pictures on tripadvisor and other places are not accurate concerning the current layout of the resort and its restaurants. If you are planning on staying here in 2018 please at least read the first paragraph below regarding that. This is our only negative regarding our stay and the remainder of our review is the positive. We have stayed here in the past and have also stayed at the sister location in Cozumel because we love the service and food so much. We have done multiple all inclusive resorts and will more than likely choose this chain again for our next trip to Cancun or Cozumel. We like it that much. HOWEVER if we would have known the severity of the construction going on this year 2018 we probably would have tried another resort. There is no doubt that once this is all completed it will be beautiful. But right now it really takes away from what we remember and loved about this place. First there is really no main lobby bar. This is a bummer given the fact that the main lobby bars are a great place to hang out during the evening between the pool bars closing and before and after dinner. And the bar area they have setup for the interim is not great \u2026 The other downside is how the restaurants are shifted around and combined with each other during the construction phases. The Cevicheria Bar is one of their top drawswhich was still delicious. but it is currently on the side of one of the buffets on a heavy walkway. Not really as enjoyable when people are walking all around you as you are eating. The noise for us was not as much of an issue as others had. But we were on the 4th floor and spent most of our time hanging closer to the ocean side of the resort. They did offer a daily resort credit during our stay which we used for a couple of things but we would rather have traded that for a visit without construction. For us the whole point to doing all inclusive is not having to worry about paying for additional things once we get there. Now the positivesThe Cevicheria did not disappoint as usual. Fish tacos ceviche and fried calamari were all just as delicious and addictive as we remember. As others have mentioned the items at the grill are delicious as welchese fries cheese sticks onion rings burgers hot dogs etc. We also liked the pizza shack crepe bar and sushi bar. No complaints about the formal dinner restaurants. And the buffets are just fine for a quick breakfast or lunch. Lastly big shout out to our beach area server Angel. Such a genuinely nice guy who wound up being the server in the area we hung out every day during our trip. Drinks were never less than half full before he was by to get the next round.

There was enough storage space an in room safe iron blowdryer. Housekeeping was excellent and came twice a day. On the first day our AC was not working but after about 6 hours they finally fixed it. Housekeeping came and mopped the place up. We were not happy with no AC and no electricity for the first evening of the trip but there were no issues after that. We expressed our dissatisfaction to the manager Edgar Rodriguez and he listened and even provided complimentary massages for the ladies in our group. It felt nice to be heard. This is where this resort is different from the othersFOD Excellent even for vegetarians. We tried out different wines restaurants polside. The food at this resort is head and shoulders above other all inclusives. We have been to Palace Ziva Paradisus Karisma and Barcelo resorts. This one topped them all. Service in all the restaurants was excellent. There is poor ventilation in the restaurants and it was uncomfortable at times to enjoy the good food and service.

Instead there were glasses and straws and even sunscreen floating on top sand at the stairs and the prev days drinks on the ledges. The pool is missing some tiles has paint chipped off around the walls and the fountains have algae on them. I hope the management puts some work into the pool area since that is where the majority of guests spend their time. Pool bar needs to be revamped also. it looks completely worn. Service again is excellent. Our server Gema was awesome. Love the polside food and something different is offered every day. paella banana splits fresh coconuts. We loved this aspect. Chef Josue is excelentLOBY the new bar and restaurant are open. Yes there was construction and it did not bother us or impact our vacation at all. We were happy to see that this resort is trying to update its facilities for the enjoyment of the guests. We just hope they can finish with the pool and the old restaurants too. Concierge was excellent and front desk staff was helpful as well. ENTERTAINMENT. Great shows activities team Ariel Raul etc are excellent. The gym needs better ventilation and fans. We did not do any excursions this time but AquaWorld is on site to arrange. We did a nice photo shoot and got lovely pictures to remember the holiday. In short this resort will deliver on great food and service but needs to continue on with these renovations. I would not hesitate to book it and will certainly return in the future.", "offset": [2690, 2753], "date": "2018-07-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "6895102d-0f03-4876-9bc2-9a38e0e1f1d9", "sentence": "In the past year they have done some renovations resort looks nice. The food is always so good and the staff is very friendly. The air conditioner in the rooms does not take care of the humidity so it always feels like the sheets are wet. The 2nd time around I paid for an ocean view room upgrade from last year. Come to find out ocean view really means partial. If you want ocean view they call it FRONTAL view. I did the 90 minute presentation and was told I would get discount excursion tickets but that was not the case. The representative dis mot extend me any discounts even after spent 25 hours in the presentation and it was the person who did the presentation that introduced me to the excursion rep. So hence I spent another 15 hours of my short vacation searching online for options. Upon leaving I let them know and they told me that I should have told them I had taken the presentation. Maybe my mistake but I assumed that by having the presentation rep walk me over and introduce me to the rep at the excursion desk that was a given. Oh well just money and time lost. Other than that I think it is a great resort to stay. I have to special mention of our waiter at Kalmia restaurant JJ Juan Jose. Just awesome service. He was very helpful delighted my daughters with trucks and brain teasers. These folk are just great all of the them.

I have stayed at several all inclusives and the staff at this hotel is the best. The hotel is clean and just the right size not to big and not to small. The buffet could have a few more selections but overall was adequate. Restaurants were really good. Loved the atmosphere of this hotel my kids loved it as well. I had some negative experiences with Expedia and this hotel. First I upgraded to have 2 oceanfront rooms and only got an ocean view rooms. I have tried to get a response from Expedia 3 times and have not heard anything from them. The hotel says it is Expedia \u2019s fault. I saw this in some other guests review prior to my stay. The beds are definitely double beds not queen beds. Do not upgrade I paid extra for two rooms for 6 nights for nothing and the hotel or Expedia do not seem to care. One other issue was transportation. I bought a private minivan round trip thru Expedia which was thru super shuttle. No issue getting to the hotel however return trip was unsatisfactory. We were told by the Expedia rep that the van would pick us up at 920 for a 1225 departure. We waited 20 minutes no van. We talked to the rep and at first he said our departure time changedwhich it had not. so they would be picking us up at 945. At 100 we checked back he then told us traffic was bad. At 1020 the van finally arrived and the driver told us they forgot about us.

The room was large and clean. The hotel has an average buffet for breakfast. For lunch there are 4 places around the pools. A hamburger hot dog place Italian Oriental and seafood with the best shrimp tacos ever plus the buffet. For dinner there was Italian steak buffet and really great Mexican with a shrimp and chicken dish. All the food was good and plentiful. The staff could not have been nicer. The whole hotel was always neat and clean. The only suggestion that I would make is that they need a couple of adult areas. I suggest the swim up bar and lobby bar after 8 pm.

Returned from an absolutely wonderful week in beautiful Cancun. Fiesta Americana Condesa had great rooms wonderful service and fantastic food the fish tacos were my favorite. This resort had areas designed for quiet and relation while also higher energy areas to hangout during the day. During the evenings there was great live music and also shows. While there was not a dance club on site unlike other Fiesta Americanas I have been too this resort made going downtown to the clubs bar very easy. One surprising thing was that their wifi was very very good. Perhaps the most significant aspect of Fiesta Americana Condesa was the pool deck staff. Raul Uriel Sophia and Jaime were the absolute BEST. Their continuous energy and helpfulness provided hours of fun and even a great workout courtesy of the Zumba lessons. If I had to cite one area to improve on it would be the wait times to get into some of the restaurants but that was easily delt with but the other ample activities to partake in during the wait.", "offset": [373, 520], "date": "2019-06-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "4d36076a-2dac-468b-b423-845d9910940e", "sentence": "Average has potential to really stand out but it does n\u2019t. We decided to stay here after cancelling 2 other new resort openings which was receiving not so stellar reviews. We had 9 nights and when we first arrived I was concerned about 9 nights. Layout arrive at lower area considered basement and escalators take you to the lobby where the sign in is to your left coming off the escalators with the main bar directly in front of you. To the left of main bar is a walkway where you \u2019l find the wedding office the gift shop which also has a small capucino and cream frappe machine with small bites the ice cream donut crepe area the kids club very small. and it dead ends to the spa gym area. To the right off the escalators and from the main bar is a walkway to where you \u2019l find the Italian restaurant steakhouse and then the Mexican restaurant. Straight ahead and down a slight ramp is the buffet dining area. The main bar also has a sushi area inside it as well as an area to where you can walk outside. Once outside there is an upper infinity pool area where you \u2019l also find an area where they make pizzas. Down the path is the larger pool with a swim up bar and another bar above it. The restaurant attached was closed and did not appear to be in the process of opening anytime soon. As you walk around towards the kids water slide area is the fish taco seafood eating area. Between the fish seafood area and the pool bar is a grill area for burgers dogs nachos fries and a bit more. Food The food areas by the grill are open during the day along with the buffet but the 3 restaurants Mexican Italian and steak are only open in the evenings. The steakhouse requires reservations to be made in person only the day before between 2 and 3 pm. Our last night the buffet had Asian theme for dinner and I was served raw chicken so while the fried rice was good I did n\u2019t touch the chicken. Pool. Unfortunately for a full day the main pool was so low water was n\u2019t even going through the filters and the water was getting gross and very cloudy. They did n\u2019t close it. I reported it to management manager was in a meeting and was told they were working to fix it. It was n\u2019t working properly until the next day. I was also told someone puked in it 2 days earlier and they did n\u2019t close it. We stayed out of the bottom pool for about 2 days due to how dirty it was. The upper pool on the day following the lower pool being low was also so low it was n\u2019t hitting filters nor was water flowing over the side for the \u201c infinity \u201d effect. Sickness. I developed a gastro issue on the 7th night which continued for about 8 hours. We met people who had members of their party also get sick one had been sick since We d through sat when they were leaving and the other person developed some type of ear problem both saw on site doctors is my understanding. I had taken antibiotics with me in case travelers diarrhea developed and had started taken it that evening. My husband came home with it. More on the food The buffet options were small so I was very thankful they had the grill and seafood area as my husband ate at the seafood area and I ate either pizza or fries. I did enjoy the Asian menu the buffet has at night if you do n\u2019t want the buffet so I was thankful for that as the buffet was hit or miss for me. Mostly miss. The restaurants are very small. The food was mediocre with fairly limited options. I will say the swim up pool bar was just a big ole party every single day with the entertainment staff cranking music all day from around 10 am until late afternoon. The beach was nice and while there was seaweed it was n\u2019t a large amount except the few days bad weather was in the area. It did keep me out of the ocean though. I\u2019m just not a fan of having it wrapping around me so I just stayed out. At the bottom of the stairs leaving the property to get on to the beach are guys who stand there ALL day to sell cigars and other things. They is literally someone there ALL THE TIME who will yell up at you when you walk by the top of the stairs. They did n\u2019t bother us too bad just always thereRoms. It was n\u2019t anything special as it was about the size of a regular hotel room. So merely FYI be prepared. We did NOT have a balcony but loved our view of the \u201c lagoon \u201d as we were on the 8th floor. Caution as our room was HOT. We had the air checked a few times and finally got a fan. We heard others complaining about the temp in their rooms as well. It made sleeping difficult. I will say the room did appear clean and the beds were very comfortable. We had an issue daily with wash clothes though. We were a family of 3 yet would be left only 2 wash clothes daily and had no conditioner when we arrived. I bet we called almost daily to ask for wash clothes and conditioner shampoo or soap. One day we did n\u2019t have any wash clothes. I never understood that. Mini fridge. Be advised if you ask for additional items in your fridge you would be charged for it. So if you call and request additional soda or beer you \u2019ve then exceeded your \u201c daily allotment \u201d and will be charged. We hardly used our items and honestly I got a bit paranoid about taking anything out of it. Alcohol If you want a name brand ask for it. Otherwise you \u2019l get the cheaper. They do NOT have Bailey \u2019s or Kahlua brands but generic versions. TIP. Bring your own cup glass for drinks. They do have straws but at one point my husband got a beer and he could n\u2019t drink it was the cup stunk too bad. I regret not remembering to bring my own. The best thing this place has going for it is the staff. Probably the friendliest group of people I \u2019ve ever encountered at any resort. They make this placeThings they can do better 1 pool cleanliness. The pool would be great if only they spent more time cleaning it. There are a ton of people in it and not enough done to keep it maintained. There was a lot of \u201c stuff \u201d floating on top of the water and in the pool. Honestly it was gross and you either had to not think too much about it or just not go in it. Those were the only 2 options. 2 Grounds. Again this goes with pool. It \u2019s unfortunate that people go on vacation and tend to be rude neglecting to pick up after themselves. I guess they think they can trash the place. While the staff has a huge job picking up after the slobs there \u2019s still more that needs to be done with trash broken glass etc. which we saw. I will say the bathroom by the pool bar while only 3 stalls always seemed to be clean. Also it \u2019s time the umbrellas were replaced or repaired as each one we used had something broken on it. We rigged it but. just saying. Teen club located in the front of the resort considered the back of the resort if from the pool area and in an area that we did n\u2019t care for. While they claim to open at 3 we went at 3 on our second day and waited around the place was deserted. It would have been a prime target for bad things to happen if someone wanted it to as it was creepy. We did n\u2019t like the location AT ALL as it seemed far from all other things. We did not allow our child to come or go on his own nor did let let him stay long when he did go. The staff who was there did not interact with the kids at all FYI. Summary. While we made it through the 9 nights and enjoyed it I would say this is a resort for less nights. It definitely had a party vibe to it which we could do without but it \u2019s not like would deter us either. It \u2019s close to the airport so transport is pretty quick. Also the only places to get any air conditioning is the restaurants and gift shop. We are returning to Cancun in Nov but have chosen a different resort and we are NOT thinking of booking this one for our return. So while I ca n\u2019t completely knock it I ca n\u2019t rave about it either. Again the staff makes this place and why it even got an \u201c average \u201d. I will say the food was a bit better than Hyat Ziva rooms were cleaner as well but it ca n\u2019t touch the food at Hotel Xcaret with a ten foot pole as it had the best food of any AI I \u2019ve ever stayed at thus far.", "offset": [4964, 5082], "date": "2019-07-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "de678c37-d576-4483-98c8-9e8f25a27d3d", "sentence": "Overall it is Nice and Clean resort hotel.
