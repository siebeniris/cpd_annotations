Here on business I appreciated the efficiency of check in check out as well as a good breakfast buffet in the One South restaurant. The Fitness Center was also well equipped and the machines were in good condition. The room was very nice I believe recently renovated with plenty of room for both working and relaxation. Location is also good especially if you are in town for a convention at the convention center as I was. The only poor experience was that they only had one bartender even though the hotel was fully booked making for extremely slow service. I must note however that the bartender was doing his ultimate best and literally running back and forth to serve people. so hats off to his efforts.", "offset": [248, 352], "date": "2015-10-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3fc36387-614a-4b5f-b10d-f3d88eca095d", "sentence": "Needs a lot of work.

Nice Hotel. All of the people who work at the Indy Hyat were pleasant and very helpful. We had to take our car out 3 5 times a day over the weekend. The valet guys always had it ready and waiting. Parking in downtown Indy is not convenient. Anything we needed the answer was always yes. Our room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was great. The only reason I would not give this hotel 5 stars is the building itself. It is a sprawling multi use structure that connects to the mall and convention center across the street the signage could be better. The view out of our window was of the duct work on the roof of the adjacent part of the building. The hotel part is nice with visually interesting lobby areas and seems to be updated and well kept.

One night stay for our anniversary. I booked online through the hotel and filled out the special request section. I had requested no feather bedding a higher floor and an updated room if that was a option. Upon check in the reception clerk acted as if she had no knowledge of my request. I do not understand the option of filling out a special request section if no one is going to pay attention to it. Upon entering our room we found feather pillows and feather duvet. I called the front desk and asked to please have the items replaced with non feather items. We ended up leaving for dinner after waiting a hour for items to be replaced and still no one showing up. They were replaced during our absence. We had issues with our A C the temperature in our room dropped to 61 degrees even though the thermostat was set on 74. Maintenance was sent to our room and he told us that there is a glitch in the system and he did not know when it would be fixed. Basically the higher you set the thermostat the longer the A C runs because the system does not know it is putting out cold air it is trying to raise the temperature. Very bizarre that the A C does not work properly in a major chain hotel. Room was tiny and odd shaped. No bathtub and the shower ceiling was so low that my husband was almost too tall to stand up straight to shower. This is not a hotel I would choose to stay at again if in the area.
