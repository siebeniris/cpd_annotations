I stayed at the Bristol Hotel in June 2015 for one night at the start of a two week trip to the US. We arrived in the evening to a very helpful staff member on reception who made us feel very welcome. My husband and I stayed in a street facing two doubles room whilst my grandmother stayed across the corridor in a superior king. Both rooms were clean comfortable well decorated and well appointed. We did not find street noise to be an issue although we were on a higher floor and very tired after a non stop flight from London so probably could have slept on the street and been undisturbed. The hotel offers free wifi and this was a good speed. The hotel is very conveniently located for downtown and the Gaslamp as well as the harbour. There is a 71 just around the corner which is very useful for stocking up on essentials as the water in the room is 6 a bottle. The parking onsite is valet and cost around 30 a night. San Diego is a beautiful city and I would happily have stayed at the Bristol for longer to explore more.", "offset": [0, 22], "date": "2015-07-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "ac912a5b-47ac-419a-a216-8315bb1aebb4", "sentence": "Good but could be great if they improve F.

We do nt drink so champagne was nt necessary although it was offered. And the room on the top floor was just to cherry on top of a quite wonderful experience. Clean amenities comfy setting hospitality on point. The parkin for 23 a night is steep 16 if you have hybrid. so i just parked up the road fo free. Anyhow.

Wow. Amazing property. I loved the modern decor and the welcoming staff. Our room was perfect with an amazing view 907The bed was plush and so cozy.

Most people complain about the expensive parking but really this is the perfect location to walk mostly anywhere so normally I was freaked out about this fee since almost all the reviews complain about it. But TRUST me its worth it. Steps from Horton Plaza and a ton of good eats cheap and expensive alike. Cofe Cap Machine in the Lobby was awesome. I met one of the staff members asking about where to thrift in the area and she was AWESOME her name is Hope. She really needs a place at the front desk wink wink. We were with a group of people that were in and out and the Hotel was very accommodating to our event. My husbands Bike broke down and the parking attendants and maintenance staff were very helpful and even offered to help jump start his bike.
