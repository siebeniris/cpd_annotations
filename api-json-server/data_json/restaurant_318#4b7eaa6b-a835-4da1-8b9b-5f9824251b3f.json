Always one of my favorite places to stay in Vegas just can not beat the location can actually walk to many attractions other casinos avoid the perpetual Vegas traffic gridlock. Obviously an older property with some updating was disappointed that the 24 hr coffee shop had closed but still a lot of energy fun. Ate at the Steak House one evening with 3 of us splitting the prime rib entree sampled 3 or 4 appetizer side dishes which were all delicious served in a timely friendly manner. The rooms were very nicely decorated with new furniture flooring non carpet thank god very comfortable beds. The bathrooms could really use some more updating bathtub faucet appeared to be ready to fall off but overall a very pleasant stay.

Returned late last week January 21 2016 from a fun vacation business trip in Vegas. The one big letdown was this hotel. Pro Prime location on the central strip The Center Cut Steakhouse Generally pleasant and helpful stafCon The room. We had a bad impression from the start. Our room 172 was at the very end of two very long hallways. The white entry door to the room was scuffed by several horizontal black marks. Inside the window had a decent view but it was filthy. The electrical outlet in the corner was cracked and could be a fire hazard No refrigerator or cofemaker although we saw two fridges parked in the hallway outside other rooms. One remained there for the entire duration of our stay. I have stayed at three Caesars properties in LV over the past several years including this one.

The room itself at Flamingo Las Vegas was clean and the maids were quite efficient. The view out to the garden was nice and I could see the High Roller at the LINQ Hotel clearly. Sadly it was an older room and for some reason there was no rug on the floor which makes it easier to clean but amplifies any noises from the hall or rooms nearby. This being The Strip some noise could be expected but my spouse and I were unlucky enough to be next to younger people with no training in how to behave at late hours. On one night they were so noisy with extremely loud laughter and loud conversation with every 10th word being a profanity. We called hotel security at midnight and again at 3 AM. Security came by the first time we are not sure they came by at 3. We were ready to move to another room the next night in order to get enough sleep to get up early for our return flight but the front desk staff informed us that the thoughtless neighbors had checked out. The room was unoccupied that night and we slept well. The Flamingo Las Vegas is close to so many other hotels for gaming and we did like the buffet and Mexican restaurant Carlos and Charlies.

The addition of the Linq is great since they made best use of the alley way behind the casino. there is a bunch of great shops and places to eat as well as some entertainment back there. You can not beat their room rate but the rooms are average. They have upgraded rooms called Fab Deluxe that are still just average. I like the fake wood floors because they seem much cleaner than carpeted flooring. But the rooms need a big serious upgrade. The hotel is only 15 minutes from the airport. Love that.
