We recently stayed here for a family wedding. we were very excited about the opportunity to stay at this very lavish type hotel in Toronto. Room was fairly large and very clean bed was exceptionally comfortablebut it was the small things that got a bit on my nervesFirst me and my wife both lead very busy work lives and we had to bring 2 cars to the hotel was not pleased to find out it was 12 per car per day to park in their lot. I was shocked I said excuse me did I make a wrong turn somewhere and end up in Niagara Falls. 24 a day just to have cars there was very disapointingnext in the room went to connect to the Wi Fi only to find out it was not free. they had hourly daily and weekly rates. who does not have free Wi Fi now. The Westin Prince that is who. you have free Wi Fi at frigin Tim Hortons come on Westin Prince get with it. but it does not end there. my wifes cell phone was having an issue and she needed to call work guess what. No free local calls from our room. 1 per 30 min phone call. you got to be kidding me. Even funnier we had a telephone in the bathroom in case we needed to make an important 1 30min local phone call from the Lou see picture. I guess if I was Donald Trump and I was staying at the Westin Prince for business I certainly would not have cared about all these extra charges. but we were very disappointed with them. The hotel is fantastic but we will never stay there again until they rectify those things as we just think charging for the things everyone else includes in your stay makes us wish we looked for another place to stay. at least hide the cost of parking and Wi Fi in the cost of the room 12 for a car in the room price would not even been noticeable. get it together Westin Prince you can be so much more and do so much better.", "offset": [205, 497], "date": "2015-07-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "3f3739c2-3821-45d8-b9c9-d0a8036a639e", "sentence": "They upgraded us without even asking parking was also free.", "offset": [0, 59], "date": "2015-12-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "7111f5c9-64f9-4ddd-84f1-29340f5265be", "sentence": "Uptown Gem. we have stayed many many times at the Westin Prince. If you are in Toronto and do not need to be right downtown it is a great option. Surprisingly there really are no nice hotel options between Yorkvile and the 401. We love the Prince because we often drive and parking is very reasonable compared to downtown hotels. In the summer it is got a nice outdoor pool. The rooms are fine.

My friends and I booked a girls trip to Toronto and had an unimaginable and horrible experience with another hotel who flat out canceled our reservation. There we were in another country with no place to go. Luckily I have AAA CA in Canada. and I found the Westin Prince via their website. We booked it online and drove over after our horrible ordeal. The hotel is beautiful. The man at valet was cheery and very welcoming he let us park by the door momentarily while we checked in. The woman at the desk could see we all looked a bit tired and run down due to our frantic last minute search for a place to stay. We told her what had happened and to our surprise she upgraded our room free of charge from the basic one we quickly booked online. We were ecstatic. Check in was rather quick as well. The woman was very thorough. I had my friends wait while I went back outside to park the car. The lot was great right across from the entrance. The room was amazing extremely clean. Fridge coffee beds were ridiculously comfortable with a pillow top and down comforter. Bathrooms were also very clean and quite nice as well. I assume with the way the hotel is built there is a view from every room unles you are on the opposite side of the building. We could see downtown from our window at night and an amazing sunrise in the mornings. By car downtown is about 20 minutes. Not a bad drive at all it was nice because the area that the hotel is in is quiet so there is not any rustling of the city if you prefer to have that turn down from exploring the city all day. There are also a few restaurants a starbucks and tim hortons right outside the hotel great for us because we did a few long drives to Niagara and Tobermory so we were able to stop there and jump right on the highway also very close to the hotel about 5 minutes down the road. Speaking of the men at the door were extremely nice and helpful about places we should visit. They gave us a bunch of pamphlets to look at and that s how I chose to take the drive to the Grotto in Tobermory. Amazing choice so glad he gave us those booklets. They all seemed quite interested in what we did daily we had say hello every morning and when we returned at night all the staff welcomed us and some asked what we did for the day. It was just a really pleasant stay and if there was anything getting me back to the Toronto area it had definitely be a stay here at the Westin.", "offset": [388, 494], "date": "2016-08-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "9247eaae-ce8f-464e-be54-ac648b05b709", "sentence": "Went for a couple hours for a work party professional atmosphere.

My partner and I spent a weekend night at the hotel at the start of an Ontario road trip. The setting of the hotel in a bit of an urban oasis is great and there is much to like but it does not live up to the four stars and actually seems to fail the Westin brand from my experience. We arrived at 40 there was a room for us but I requested a southern view. Apparently there was a room available but needed to be confirmed as ready for occupancy. We parked brought in our bags and cooled our heels in the lobby while we waited. it was 5 PM before we were able to access our room. An offer of some sort of compensation would have been welcome a drink breakfast voucher coffee. The room was perfectly adequate. The room needs a refresh although the wooden furnishings look new and I quite like the European design. Everything was clean and in good shape. The room features a window wall which was great for views and letting in light. The bathroom is large and marble. Towels are plentiful and typical Westin great. Shower is good and there is a separate soaker tub. I anticipated a stellar sleep experience. This was not the case. Pillows were terrible. The bed sagged to the centre a King bed. you had the option of either a heavy duvet or one that was not adequate. This is typical Sheraton Westin and needs to be remedied. There was noise from the road which I did not expect at all. After a sleepless night tossing turning and basically making do I gave up. There is much that could be great here and just a few things that keep it from being so in addition to the bed and sleep experience paint and refurbish yes but I have stayed in places that needed it more. Outlets by the bed please. Decent coffee options a proper fridge not the cooling centre housekeeping communication so that rooms are open to guests we were not the only ones waiting.

I was unaware that the Prince Hotel accepts dogs. We arrived on a Thursday and had a very nice corner suite for a 3 night stay. On Friday shortly after 10 pm a little dog started barking constantly. I am certain front desk received calls from everyone on the floor as they said they were aware of the situation when I called down. Security came up several times during the next hour. Other hotel guests were out in the hallway demanding refunds. A mother of the bride was distraught as her daughters wedding was the next day and they needed their sleep. After an hour of constant yelping and barking we closed the double door to our room and turned the radio onto static to try and block out the noise. On Saturday night we were awakened at 230am in the morning by pounding on the same door and more dog barking. This continued for half an hour. Our room was nice the breakfast was good the location is convenient. Front desk comped us for our parking when I complained about the dog. I appreciate the gesture but feel the hotel should have dog policies in place. The humane society or police could have been called to have that dog removed. Perhaps dog owners should all be placed on the same floor. What about paying quests who have pet allergies. Does the hotel really need to welcome dogs when situations like this arise and are not taken care of promptly. Is the hotel in need of business that they have to accept dogs and in turn annoy and perhaps turn off other guests from returning. If owners are leaving their dogs perhaps the Prince Hotel should have kennels that they can check their dogs into while they go out. Does the Prince Hotel really want to get into the dog kennel business.", "offset": [931, 1000], "date": "2019-11-04 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}]}
