The manager made sure that our meeting room was well appointed and that our internet was functional. Snacks drinks were good although there was no bottled water the second day. The room was nice and clean and so was the bathroom. The dinner was great in the main restaurant and the management was very acomodating to open it up after hours to our large party. The bar food was also very good. The breakfast left something to be desired. I ordered a breakfast instead of the buffet. The scrambled eggs were awful the toast was quite cold dried out but the service was excellent. The elevator situation left something to be desired.

The fitness center was also much bigger and better equipped than you might expect free weights kettle bells a nice universal machine and cardio equiptment.

Nice Staff. Our transatlantic flight was cancelled and the next one was 12 hours later so we were all dispatched here for the day arriving at 8 am. The hotel is a better quality airport hotel I have stayed in a lot worse and some better. The rooms are clean. On arrival over 100 people were seen by only two beleaguered receptionists the hotel manager was nowhere to be seen. I was lucky and was at the front of the queue but by the time I had checked in and finished my breakfast the rest of my jaded grumpy and angry fellow passengers were still only being checked in by 2 people over an hour later. The breakfast was average. The lunch however was simple yet surprisingly good and tasty with lots of fresh crisp salad and french green beans. The wifi was ok. It is only free in the lobby but on the first floor rooms by the list the lobby wifi remains accessible in the rooms fortunately where I was. However the best thing about this hotel is the staff. They remain bright and cheerful. One especially good example of this was the warm cheerful and kindly Jimie from Security. With a kind word for everyone he meets and going above and beyond the call of duty by lending me his own personal phone charger when the hotel did not have one he gets my vote for employee of the month.", "offset": [777, 918], "date": "2017-01-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "c438d5d4-1a73-4bdc-b6ae-1e6446342260", "sentence": "One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. As a world traveler I feel that says something. Staff is rude and slow to do anything hotel is in a remote area with little to no services in the surrounding area Laguardia Airport has one of the worst reputations out there room has no amenities. this is a very frustrating hotel to stay at. The only polite staff at this hotel are the cleaning and maintenance crew. I interacted with no less that 5 of the front desk crew and 2 of the security staff and each of them acted like every interaction was a burden. I was ignored at times. I was asked to come back and deal with another shift. I even had them roll their eyes at me or had one female employee glare at me while I talked to another front desk clerk. Three times I had packages delivered to the hotel and each time they could not find them for over 30 minutes said things to me like it must not be here. why did you get a package delivered to a hotel and even said try again tomorrow maybe someone else can help you. Each time the package was 5 feet away from them behind the desk and it took no less than 3 people to find it. The AC did not work which can most likely be linked to the picture of the filter I have included. The hotel room has an old VGA TV with no HDMI options. Meaning there is no option to connect any external devices like a computer Roku Firestick gaming system etc. Even with a down converter the ports available do not work. The TV remotes only work if you literally stand right in front of the TV and work a little better if you mash the buttons almost to the point of breaking. There are less that 35 channels and half of those are repeats of sports and CSPAN channels. Ooh. but there are 5 Korean channels so you can enjoy those. The rooms do not have a mini fridge or microwave. The view overlooks the airport so you can get your entertainment from watching planes take off and land or listen to the constant construction pounding that literally shakes the entire building. If that is not enough for you there is also the 247 traffic of the GCP that provides constant honking reving engines and emergency vehicles. This place is horrible. Mariot really needs to retrain the staff that is obviously only used to only having guests for a layover and then kicking them out.", "offset": [95, 293], "date": "2017-10-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "f591167c-0940-4a4e-b7f9-5d7758236b59", "sentence": "Under Construction. My husband and I stayed here courtesy of Delta Airlines after they cancelled our flight and we experienced customer service issues. First and foremost this hotel is under construction. We heard construction equipment early in the morning which was unappreciated since we did not check in until after 10 am. The website advertises two restaurants but we called the front desk and were told the restaurants had not yet reopened and in room service was not an option. On the plus side the staff was very friendly and the rooms were very nice and had been updated recently. The beds were comfortable the room was very clean and the bathrooms were newly renovated.

The floor was vinyl very uncomfortable. The thermostat did not work it was in the 80s outside and I was freezing in the room. Not a comfy sleep. The shower is a bad set up too. The water pressure was so low I could hardly wash the shampoo from my hair. The restaurant was closed and I was not told at booking. They did not even offer a complimentary coffee or ice water for the inconveniences. I was told to walk to the Plaza.
