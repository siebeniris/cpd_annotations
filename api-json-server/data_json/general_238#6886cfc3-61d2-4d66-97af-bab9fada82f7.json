To say that we had a great time and LOVED every experience that this resort had to offer is hard to put into words. My husband who is an avid golfer was very impressed with the golf courses and he appreciated the caliber of the rental clubs that were offered. For me the scenic beauty of the resort and professional attention and kindness of the staff made me feel relaxed and rejuvenated from our cold weather New Jersey home.

This was great as we did not make it downstairs until 11 some days and did not have to worry about people saving chairs. Pool is great and well maintained. Somewhat limited number of chairs. Restaurants were great and while expensive earned the cost of the dinner. Buffet for either breakfast or dinner is not worth the money. If you do go to the buffet for dinner skip the wine bar as you only receive house wine and it is not worth the cost. You can also find somewhat less expensive dinner options off campus.

I recently stayed at the JW Mariot with my wife for a long relaxing weekend. It turned out to be anything but relaxing upon arriving and checking into our room we were greeted with bedding that was either dirty stained or something you otherwise would not want to sleep in. See photo attached. We then proceeded to head back down to the front desk only to wait in line for to explain the issue and show the staff the picture. The person working at the front desk was apologetic and after asking for a new room rather than new bedding. we were assigned a new room. We made our way to our new room only to find that this room was missing a TV remote. Not a big deal something that you do not want to have to deal with. Well come to find out that the dirty bedding and missing remote where the least of our issues during our stay. The new room that was assigned to use backed up the elevator and the head of the bed was perfectly aligned to the elevator shafts. All day and night all we heard were elevators opening and closing. all hours of the night. In the 4 nights that we spent at the resort not one night did we get to sleep. I do a lot of traveling to give you an idea I have the second highest rewards status at 2 hotel chains plus a handful of nights at other chains as well. As a matter of fact I am sending this from a hotel room. I always say it is unfortunate that I do not get to stay at Mariots that often due to a business arrangement this past stay makes me question those thoughts. In all of the traveling I do I have never had an experience with a room like the one my wife and I experienced. While I am not a gold or high level rewards member with Mariot I would not have expected this experience after what we encountered in our initial room. And not to mention the money that was paid each night for a room plus the services drinks etc. The unpleasant experiences did not stop there several times while at the tiki bar were we greeted by unpleasant bartenders. One time in particular stood out to both my wife and I We sat down on Saturday afternoon for a drink and lunch. Let me start by saying we were the only ones on the one side of the bar and 2 bartenders were on duty. After ordering our drinks I asked the bartender if we could order food and in response we got you will have to wait I have drinks to make. Taken back as we were the only ones at the bar we waited and waited and then after about 10 min the bartender came back to get our order. I would understand if the bar was packed and all the seats were taken but with 2 bartenders on duty and only us sitting on the side of the bar it did not sit well. My wife and I work extremely hard and we were looking for a nice relaxing getaway. One where we could catch up on our sleep no kids to wake us up and have a nice peaceful and relaxing time together.

It was the best service we have had during a vacation since our honeymoon. and we \u2019ve gone on MANY vacations since thenThe grounds are incredibly well manicured. Rooms are renovated and modern. The shower was awesome and I loved the toiletries. One downside for me was that I found the bed to be a bit hard. Granted I \u2019m 7 months pregnant and uncomfortable no matter where I sleep but I wanted to see if housekeeping could help remedy the situation. One phone call to housekeeping and I came back to find a delightful pillow topper on my bed. Two thumbs upRestaurants were great. We ate at Maia fantastic breakfast buffet Quin \u2019s great views and great burger and Kane my favorite Hawaiian Asian fare. My biggest complaint was that we tried to eat at Kane \u2019s for a second time after sundown but it was completely dark. We found out later that it \u2019s a law to keep lights off near the beach during the turtle nesting season. Since Kane is essentially on the beach I \u2019m guessing they have to keep the lights off. Just a heads up. We decided to stick with Kane during daylight hours. It \u2019s deliciousOur last day we got a day pass to the spa. Insider tip. if you are going as a couple for a getaway and want to get away from the massive swarm of kids at the 2 pools more on this in a bit THIS is the best place to be. The spa charges 35 person for access to their facilities 2 wonderfully quiet outside pools and hot tub plus inside there are plunge pools a sauna steam room showers and lockers. It was heaven. There is polside service with a healthier menu than the other restaurants. When we were polside at the spa it honestly felt like a different resort. We have a child at home and decided that we absolutely have to bring her with us next time. The resort is such a fantastic family resort although we had a great time flying solo. There is so much for the kids to do. There \u2019s a kids club 2 pools frozen yogurt shop and the beautiful beach. It \u2019s kidie heaven. Getting back to the massive amount of kids at the pool. My ONLY complaint about the hotel is regarding the pools. They are a bit chaotic. By 8 am nearly all the chairs were \u201c reserved \u201d at the pool we did see someone come around once and place cards on unattended chairs with a note that their things would be removed an hour later if they did n\u2019t return. However we only saw them once throughout the day. There are no lifeguards at the pool. Therefore it felt like the wild wild west. Many children were n\u2019t supervised by parents. Kids had insanely large floats rafts in the pool one was a 9 ft long by 6 ft wide unicorn float. and they were throwing balls across the pool and over peoples \u2019 heads saw multiple people. myself included getting hit. The pools are way too crowded to allow the huge floats and allow ball playing. Again I have a kid and I \u2019m not a crotchety type of person. I love to have fun with the best of them. But even I thought it felt a bit crazy. It would be nice if security monitored some of the wild stuff going on at the pool. That being said the pools are warm and clean. We spent a lot of time wading around in them. Just be prepared to dodge kids left and rightWe did n\u2019t want to leave. We will absolutely be back in the near future.

I asked how many chairs she needed. she said 5. I calmly told her as soon as all 5 in her party wanted to sit at the same time I would gladly move.

My stay at the Marco Island JW Mariot last week was one continuous disappointment. From the moment we checked in and the front desk person did not know what to do regarding welcoming a Platinum Elite member to not being told about the services that accompanied the upgrade to the Sirene Tower that I paid for to an overall drab and outdated interior lack of elite service and down right unsanitary. When we checked in to our first room in one of the old outdated towers we found used bandages just under the dust ruffle of the bed. When wiping down the surfaces of the furniture in that room with a lysol wipe the wipe was BLACK obviously no cleaning taking place. No robe or slippers in the room. Very disappointing. When we learned about the new Sirene tower option from friends no one told us about it at check in even though we asked about upgrades we moved that night. They happily took our extra money per night gave us our bracelet key but did not tell us about the services that came with this tower private pool gym breakfast concierge. We had to discover it all on our own. Service was poor from the majority of staff. For example when I asked an individual wearing a staff shirt in the lobby where the gym was he pointed and said First elevator first floor and walked away. Later I learned that there were three gyms he could have informed me about including the one I had paid an extra resort fee to have access to which should have been evident to him since I was wearing my JW Mariot key bracelet. When I made a complaint to Mr Marsh the front desk manager the morning after our check in he just stood there and bobbed his head said sorry and walked away. Not note of apology or any follow up from him. The Spa was also a disappointment. Old outdated and dirty and did not feel luxurious. Things like iced wash clothes outside the steam room are not present. No ambiance or spa feel. Might as well have been a Massage Envy. I had planned on spending a couple hours there after my service but it was so small and the steam and whirlpool area was worn and dirty I decided against it. The waiting room in the spa before your service is not very inviting and it is so small that many women had to stand while waiting. I had my massage and left. The icing on the cake for this trip was how many people got sick from the food that was served al fresco during our conference. I do not know what these people are thinking but they would put out lunch items such as potato salad and onion dip and creamy dressings in the sun and NOT ON ICE. My husband was one of the individuals who became violently ill after lunch one day and did nit recoup until the next afternoon so missed an evening event and morning activity. The hotel was over run with three large conferences during the time we were there so I think they do not worry about guest service since they are at occupancy every night. They are selling a dream to event planners but the reality is a small nightmare. My one and only thanks goes to Hope in the private concierge lounge that I was never made aware of till check out. She listened to our concerns and complaints and comped items from our bill.

Luxury Trip gone WRONG. With this being a JW I had very high expectations for this trip. Let me tell you do n\u2019t waste your money. I had booked a gulf pool view room which cost extra. When we got up to our room we discovered the view was of some construction they were doing and of the condo next door. We talked to the front desk and they refunded us back some of our money since we did n\u2019t get the view we reserved paid for. The next morning I woke up and had bites all over my lower legs and feet. I did n\u2019t think anything of it because no one else in my family had them. We stayed a total of 4 nights and everyday I kept getting more bites. Again I was the only one who had them so I just assumed it was mosquitos. The day we got home my husband woke up and had bites all over his body. After doing some research we found that it \u2019s not uncommon for bed bug bites to have a delayed reaction in some people. It is also common for the bed bugs to only bite 1 person in the bed and not the other which would explain why I developed the bites first. We had to get our home sprayed for bed bugs because I wanted to make sure we did n\u2019t bring any home. In addition to this we stayed over the Fourth of July. It was very busy especially the pool area. You had to get down there so early to get chairs and so many people would go down there and put towels on the chairs to reserve them when they were n\u2019t even at the pool. I have 2 young children and it was almost impossible to get through the pool with them. Both pools had multiple people throwing balls back and forth and they would get annoyed when I would try and swim in between them with my kids. A lot of the workers also had attitudes. I will say all of the waiters waitresses were very polite to us. The worst was the people who made the pancakes omelettes at the breakfast buffet. They had separate lines for omelette and pancakes and it was hard to tell the difference if it was your first time there. If you went to the omelette line and asked for a pancake they would get so much attitude. I would also go up and order pancakes for myself and 2 children and they would get annoyed if you asked for more than 2 pancakes at a time. To make matters worse a couple days after we got home Mariot charged our credit card 2 times for our stay. They over charged our debit card thousands of dollars and when my husband was getting it taken care of the hotel employee made it seem like it was something that happened quite often so make sure to double check all of your charges. The only positives of this trip was the food. We ate at the dinner and breakfast buffet the pizza place and the pool side food service. It was all delicious. We also did a private fishing shelling tour with Six Chuter Charters that was the highlight off the trip. Mariot also put on a good firework display.

W stayed in Paradise by Sirene because the remainder of the hotel was filled with 2 conferences. The Mariot is a standard 4 star big hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Check in was easy. The room was as advertised. The restaurants were always busy so there were some delays which got some of the people around us upset. The beach looks like it is now dealing with the Sargassum Seaweed google it problem affecting Mexico and the Caribbean. There was 10 feet of seaweed to get into the water and then the waves washing up on the shore was filled with the seaweed. This is not the Mariots fault however it is connected to the hotel. The pools were clean and active. The adults only pool was quiet and had a beautiful view on the 5th floor. We did one Mariot sponsored excursion Sail and Shelling with Captain Shannon. This was a low key casual trip in which you take about a 40 minutes sail exploring the sea for dolphins etcand end up on a small island looking for shells Cpt. Shannon was very informative.

This was our first stay since the new Sirene was built. We used 10k alley which was great for the family. We will without a doubt return again. Other reviewers on this site have commented on the resort being expensive. I agree with it being expensive but not excessive for where the property is. My only complaints on expense are that the buffet breakfast charges for children over 2. It was hard to stomach paying 12 for my 4 year olds breakfast which every morning consisted of a donut and a bowl of cereal. I think they could raise the free breakfast age and not lose a lot of money. Everything else is within expectations for a meal here or there but we definitely left the property for more affordable options at times. My biggest concern is not necessarily with this property but is with the declining state of the Bonvoy Rewards program since the Starwod merger. I am a platinum elite member and lifetime gold who was staying on points. I called in advance to ask if there was a way I could use more points or pay some money to guarantee a room with a view. The person I spoke too said occupancy was low enough that an upgrade would not be a problem. When I arrived at the property I mentioned this conversation and the front desk agent got on the phone to talk to someone and told me that no upgrades were available. I asked again whether I could use additional points or pay more money and was told no. I went on the Bonvoy ap which showed I could book an upgraded room for about 100 more per night than the standard room so I know it was not true that an upgraded room was not available. The silver lining here is that it turns out that the room we had was still excellent with a good view but the point is that I felt misled and undervalued as a rewards member. Thus my comment is simply that reward members should not go in expecting upgrades especially when staying with points.

Arrival experience As soon as we drove in we saw 6 valet attendants all huddle up hands in pockets and one of them was leaning against a vehicle. One of the attendants finally came over to talk to us. He said \u201c hey what \u2019s up \u201d did not greet us properly and did n\u2019t even offer a parking option or explain the difference in pricing between valet and Self park. At the check in desk we were greeted by a female staff member that was training and Brook they were nice friendly and assured us we had a great room. Once we arrived at the room we were a little disappointed due to the fact that there was no complimentary water bottles the iHome station was broken and the mirror left light did not turn on. Other than those small issues the room was great. We went to watch the fire show and enjoyed a nice dinner at 10 K where Rene who was amazing made our drinks and took out meal orders. The next morning we went to Maia for breakfast where Eloy explained the buffet and a la cart menu. We went with the Bufe selection which was such a great choice. All thanks to Lucy at the omelette station who was genuinely happy to be there on her birthday. After breakfast we went to the pools walked around the beach had Menchies and took our Froyo to the Adult only area in the 5th floor. Once we arrived at the Adult only area we did n\u2019t know that if you did n\u2019t book a room in that tower than you did n\u2019t the privilege of enjoying the adult only pool. The attendant for the Adult only pool was kind of rude and made us feel unwelcome since we were not staying at that tower. Another couple went in after us and the attendant treated them just as rude and the couple even commented on how rude she was. Since that was our last stop before checking out that kind of put a dent in our experience. Other than Brooke Rene Eloy and Lucy I hope they get recognized. the service aspect of JW Mariot was not there compared to other JWs we \u2019ve stayed at specially when every time we stay at Mariot hotels we are always celebrating something. In this case it was a late valentines celebration that went unnoticed by the staff. OVERALL we had a great time the food was great the bed was amazing pools were heated which came in handy since Florida was undecided on having winter or summer weather.", "offset": [911, 1009], "date": "2020-02-23", "cpt": "4", "category": "general"}, {"id": 47, "uid": "3fa3636d-1929-453a-af4a-a0b7329177e3", "sentence": "Carpet and rooms are dated.

I agreed and they took my name and email adding it to a list of several others. Several weeks later and several calls to customer service agents it turns out I was never signed up for an account and there was no current promotion matching what desk staff promised.
