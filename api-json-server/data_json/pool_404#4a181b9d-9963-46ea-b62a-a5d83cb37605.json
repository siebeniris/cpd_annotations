The hotel lobby is fabulous. lots of entertainment dancing action people watching two bars in lobby. The room we stayed was Garden Lanai. Second floor of 3 floors.

The room is a good size with king bed and big pull out sofa my two boys slept on. Also had a balcony with a partial view of pool. If you want a larger deck area with no view for privacy take a first floor. If you want some view take 2nd or 3rd floor. Pools are great swim up bar beach right next to pool. Beach is clean and has some surf to play in. Good restaurants in hotel. Fun rib place on top of hotel with a bull ride. My boys loved it.

The beach and pool areas are nice and the service overall was good.

Not to mention every single one of the staff members bartenders front desk pool staff etc were so welcoming and helpful. Especially Angelo one of the doormen at the front of the hotel. Angelo was so friendly and helpful. He recommended many different places to visit in San Juan and Old San Juan. It appeared that he enjoys his job very much and loves meeting new people to share his love of the island. Through the El San Juan concierge we were able to book a trip to El Yunque. We regret not signing up for the snorkeling boat cruise excursion. Next time. They offer many different excursions in and around San Juan. So easy to do and the hotel does all of the organizing. Hotel is also a short cab drive from Old San Juan about 20 each way. This hotel is definitely the hotel to come if you are staying in the area of Carolina.

Incredibly nice staff all of whom were very friendly and helpful they always seemed to be on hand when we needed them. The lobby is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen vast and high ceilinged with plenty of polished marble gleaming wood and sumptuous furniture. The casino was great and had all the standard games. The dealers were very sweet and funny. They seem to have thought of everything and even provide you with sunscreen and mosquito repellent on your way out to the pool although I did not see a single mosquito the whole time we were there. The pools were perfect. The temperature was good and there were so many pools and hot tubs that if one got too busy for you you could move on to another one. Or you could take two steps out of the pool and be right on the beach where they provided lounging chairs free of charge. Our first night we were in a room on the 3rd floor that had a view of the rooftop facing the street but the next night we were upgraded because it was our anniversary very kind of them. to a higher floor with a window facing the beach. A few nights later the water broke in our room so they upgraded us to the best suite in the hotel YAY. If you can afford the suite on the top floor it is totally worth it for the views and the comfy robe but the room itself is almost identical to the less expensive rooms in size and accommodations.

Excellent staff. Repeat guests to this hotel but my first time. We were looking forward to beach dining casino dancing in the lobby. I guess the concept has changed with the new owner and that brought about some changes we did not like 1. Casino closed so that put a damper on those in our group who wanted to gamble. 2. Casino workers picketing at front entrance and on beach. They harassed you when getting your towels and were annoying with chanting. Most of the time you really could not hear them over the crashing waves or music at the pool. By the end of our stay the bullhorns were taken away so it was fine. Two things should have happened the hotel should have let us know the casino closed they gave cab fare to the Ritz and the protesters should not have punished the guests. Owner and Union lawyers need to work it out and stop using the workers as pawns. The new concept brought much higher drink prices and fewer restaurants Marea was terrible so we canceled our Meat Market reservation and ate off site the rest of the stay. Polside option of Tuna Crudo over breadfruit was super if you added a squeeze of lime or salt. The hotel gave free drinks and massages at the pool but if you were not there to hear about it you lost out. They were always coming around the pool with little tidbits and that was really nice. Also we were supposed to be given letters upon arrival notifying us of the issues with the protesters and we were not. They gave us a credit to our room for some inconveniences we experienced because we paid a very high room rate and the rates dropped due to protesters so that was helpful. The local dancing was good on Friday but slower on Saturday. This was one of the main reasons for staying there so that was a bit disappointing. I guess they changed the policy on admission for locals. Too bad because that is a unique feature they should not mess with.

A few wonderful staff who stand out. There are many things you need to know in advance of staying at this property. The first is that this is the ONLY beachfront hotel open in Isla Verde. The Ritz is still closed as is the Intercontinental next door. We usually stay at the Intercontinental and have for 15 years. I did my due diligence about 2 weeks in advance since we needed two connecting rooms one needing a handicap bathroom. and I wanted first floor so my father would not have to take an elevator up and down every day. My mother Miller communicated with Yvone and Ruth who assured all our requests would be sent to the front desk including making them aware that we would be arriving earlier than check in time. CLEARLY they could not honor our requests and should have said this in advance we would have planned accordingly to take a taxi into Old San Juan. We did not get to our rooms until 530 pm after looking at various other rooms they wanted to put us in that were considered upgrades. We booked 2 pool villas the upgrade was to a first floor ocean view but it was really a garden view. NOTE The only true ocean views are from the tower rooms that have NO balcony or the second floor of the Ocean Villas. One concern I do have is that they sell day passes to locals for the price we paid to stay here it should have been private to hotel guests only. It was evident who was not a hotel guest rethink this policy Hilton and remain classy. Also they kept saying the property was full no way was that true. We arrived on a Friday and it certainly did not seem at capacity during our stay. The property is certainly overpriced for what you get I understand they have to recoup when they were closed from hurricane but cmon Hilton. Really 30 p for breakfast buffet that never changes the menuSugestion Keep the lobby coffee bar open longer than just 6am2pm. Some of us like coffee after 2 pm.
