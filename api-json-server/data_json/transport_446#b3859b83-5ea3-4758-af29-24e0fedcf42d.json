The hotel is located in Covington KY just across the river from Cincinnati making it convenient to see all the sights. While it is at the end of hotel row it is an easy walk to downtown. The neighborhood is old but we felt safe walking around even at night. The room was large and had a view of the river. The comp breakfast was terrific with lots of options. Only issue the location of the waffle maker led to a crowded corner. It might be helpful to move it to the center island. Fresh fruit yogurt basked goods variety of cereals plus eggs bacon sausage etc was plentiful. Options changed daily which was a treat. Pool was clean. Fitness center was small but satisfied my needs.

We are Hilton Honor members and always stay in a Hilton Family hotel because of the curtious service comfortable clean rooms and delicious complimentary breakfast. Boy was this place a huge let down. Upon check in it was rush rush rush even though nobody was waiting. The clerk went over everything in a fast monotone. She never mentioned anything about parking and entrances but we figured that out pretty easily. We came to Covington to go the Newport on the Levee and take a ghost tour. We stopped by the front desk to ask about transportation to Newport. Yet another front desk staff member looked at us like we were nuts and said. yeah there is a shuttle stop down the block in front of White Castle gave us a map. We walked to indicated shuttle stop and 2 shuttles passed us by in 20 minutes pick up every 15 mins. Finally a 3rd shuttle stopped and picked us up and stated the pick up was on the other side of the street even though there was a shuttle stop sign where we were standingUpon returned we tried to purchase snacks at the only snack vending machine on property. It took the dollar bill and showed 10 on the machine. We made our selection and it sent the dollar back out. Frustrated we returned to our room called the front desk to ask about any other snack vending. We were told the machine only takes quarters if you need change we can give it to you. a sign on the machine would have been niceAh. that nice Hampton Inn breakfast was just another let down. Very crowded. One of the employees nearly ran me over on 3 separate occasions but she did say sorry honey. They offered make it yourself waffles that was very popular because the sausage links gravy and scrambled eggs were absolutely horrible in taste. We have never thrown away a plate of food before now. They were often out of coffee creamer etc. It will now be necessary to go out for breakfast. Our room was clean but the public areas of the hotel were filthy. There was a big wad of chewing gum on the elevator entrance that was there during the 18 hours we were there. The carpet was dirty in the hallway in the lobby area and all the way down the hallway of our floor. While the rate was only 150 on a Cincinnati Red game night not the reason we were here but frankly we feel robbed. We will never ever stay at this location again and would discourage anyone else to stay here. There are several other non Hilton Family hotels just down the road. The shuttle makes stops to Covington Newport and riverside Cincinnati. There are way better options if we had only known.

I am not familiar with Cincinnati area. Needed a place to shower and lay my head while child was at Childrens Hospital. The hotel itself is great. Served is purpose. I did not check out any amenities did not care about a view good thing bc I did not have anything exciting to look at. Bed was perfect room clean and spacious. Things outside of BW control are my reason for an overall low review. The liquor store and smoke store only feet from the BW their patrons made me nervous. I71 was closed for construction during the time of my stay. There are other bridges to cross to get in to Cincinnati however my biggest complaint is geared at the city of Covington there are no street signs at intersections. So when given directions such as turn right on 4th street finding 4th Street is a crapshoot. Google Maps GPS was worthless in this area.

At first glance our room was great.

The river view included the parking lot a river wall and tres I barely could see the water but the bridge and seeing Cincinnati buildings were okay during the day. Housekeeping was to re clean the room and the manager reduced our bill however the amount that was to be taken off the total does not match my calculations and she did not want to speak about it upon departure.
