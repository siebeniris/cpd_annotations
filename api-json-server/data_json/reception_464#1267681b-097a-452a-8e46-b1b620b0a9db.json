This hotel is very close to the main routes around Jerusalem and the light rail. The Knesset Israeli Parliament and the Museum are also a short distance away. I stayed here because it was also the venue for a conference that I had to attend. The rooms were average with nothing exceptional to remember. The menu for breakfast and dinner appeared to remain absolutely the same for 7 full days which was not only boring but the food was bland. There was a variety of meat dishes on offer but it was as if they were devoid of flavour. I ate purely for sustenance and took every opportunity to eat out. I am mindful of Sabbath and Jewish holidays but this was my first ever experience in Israel where I felt that I was given a raw deal for not being Jewish. During Sabbath Friday night dinner Saturday breakfast and dinner the main restaurant was closed off to those of us who were not Jewish or at least Orthodox and we were served in a smaller hall styled venue. I have no idea if the food was the same but it remained uninspiring. There is free wi fi for about 2 hours in the hotel lobby or you must pay for this service to be available in your room. The aircon was faulty did not heat and made a intrusive amount of noise. Although we were a couple they still saw it fit to give us those horrible single mattresses pushed together which meant that one of us kept falling through a crack in the middle for the duration of the nightThis is a hotel that I will happily avoid during my next visits as there was no redeeming feature that would attract me back.", "offset": [1055, 1174], "date": "2015-05-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "abf86e51-facd-4db7-bfc8-802ae56c4319", "sentence": "An adequate but overpriced stay.

The annual conference of Jewish Genealogy was held at the Ramada Hotel Jerusalem this year. It is a an annual conference held at different venues mainly in the USA and occasional in European cities. I was hesitant to write this review because I could not find anything good to report which made me feel very uncomfortable. On arrival I drove up to the main foyer. The security guard sat at his post and told me that I should take my bags out and leave them with him while I parked the car in the basement. He sat there watch me lug my suitcases out and never left his chair for a moment. I ask him if there was a porter and he pointed to a desk inside. I went to look and there was no one there. This guard never got off his chair to help me and watched me put everything on the pavement. I them parked my car in the basement. The smell in the basement was overwhelmingly discusting. Rotting garbage and sewerage. I went to collect the bags with a porter and then I checked in. The check in was not bad. Certainly not warm and friendly. I got to my room and the electronic key did not work and so the porter went down to change it for me. The room was on the 9th floor and near to the lift a nice plus. The rooms are fairly large and furnished about 30 to 40 years ago. old and shabby. There is a desk chair and a coffee table with one reading chair in a double room for two people. The bathroom was ok. Cheap products and a shower. The shower had a very poor shower head but all this did not both me. I ran the shower and up came the smell from the basement. Awful and discusting. There was black mould on the sealant and round the glass partition on the tiles. The electronic key only worked once. I started having to go back down stairs to get it reconected everytime I came back to the room. I got the regular key and used that for the rest of the week. Enough with all this. The food was overpriced badly prepared and generally inedible. It takes some doing to mess up a toasted cheese sandwich and chips. The bill was 60shekels with a bottle water. A complete rip off. Then came breakfast. the usual Israeli fare but pared down to the minimum and poorly prepared. The waiters were un obliging and surly and most unhelpful. I felt I was intruding on their time just by asking a question. The chaos reigned in the hotel which being a polite way of saying it was awful. Lunch was much of the same. The housekeeping was ok when the came which was late in the day which suited me. Mostly the attitude of the staff was bad. They either ignored you made you feel like they were doing you a favor and in the end I just did not bother with them. I can not name one smily face. I have no idea why the conference was held there. I suppose they got a good deal and it was cheap but nasty it was and is.

I unfortunately arrived early before the check in time and they could not be bothered with me. When I did check in they did not give me the room I had requested. When I asked the girl at the front desk to change my room for the one I had requested she was very rude about it. I had to go to the manager to get my room changed. For the entire time I was there the people behind the desk never ever smiled. There was never any large bath towels in the room I had to call the front desk constantly to have them send bath towels to my room. The carpet in the room was never vacuumed and the cleaning of the room took about 5 minutes at the most. I was present when the room was cleaned. The a c turned off automatically even when I was in the room sleeping. They are strictly kosher so there are two different restaurants. They did not have enough staff for either one and there were very long wait times for food because of this. There is a very nice breakfast buffet but you are not told about it when you check in you have to learn about it from other guests. There was a coffee service during lunch time at the conference but it required payment and you had to go to the front desk to get a coupon showing you paid for it. There were lectures during lunch time at the conference but it required the payment of 35 again at the front desk for the food. The food consisted of small tea sandwiches and salads 35 really.

Do your family members pussy foot around telling you what to do. No they do not. Neither will the staff at the front desk of Ramada. They are authentically kind friendly and helpful. If you ask a direct question you will get a direct answer and that is that. The Ramada Jerusalem is kosher mehadrin meaning that Jewish law meets the most widely recognized level in the country. Your food will meet top standards and all of your Israeli friends and relatives will feel comfortable dining in all of their restaurants. The elevators function automatically on Shabat. They have their own synagogue services on Shabat as well. The hotel is modern bright and comfortable enough to meet snooty American standards I was happy there. The bathroom is American style they provide toiletries and also have a well stocked convenience shop in the lobby as well as an art shopFOD.

Transportation. This hotel is one block away from the train and bus service. An attentive armed guard controls which taxis enter the premises. Inside security will gladly hail you a cab. However if they do not like the looks or afadavit of your taxi on arrival he can not enter the premises this happened to us once. Keep in mind that in Israel you DO tip wait staff in restaurants including the hotel. but you do NOT ever tip the taxi driver. The people watching in the Ramada Jerusalem bar area is frequented by families dating couples and pretty much everyone.
