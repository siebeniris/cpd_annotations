The amenities your own GATE to get in and out of the California Adventure park lovely lobby and pool fabulous restaurants and EVEN five park hopper passes given upon check in are SO worth a splurge. AND my wonderful daughter knows how much I love Behind the Scenes opportunities at Disney and scheduled a 6 am PowerWalk through CA for myself and my husband. WOW. It was lovely seeing the park basically empty as the sun was rising over Buena Vista street. The powerwalk is no joke we were walking at a super fast clip almost running really. Dave our fitness trainer that morning was very kind to share that this experience was a true powerwalk and the group had to keep up and stay together. HE gave us an opportunity to change our minds and then off we went. We were a group of 9 or 10 and Dave shared many many stories with us as we passed different structures buildings.

Our family splurged and spent one night at the hotel. Due to past experiences with Disney magic we held great expectations for our stay. We arrived very early 615am on Wednesday of Spring Break. The valet staff was not very explicit about how to best handle our bags were we supposed to unload our cars onto carts to be held until our rooms were ready or would they do it for us and would there be additional fees. Nor were they very friendly. Another disappointment was the frustratingly slow free wifi. Each of our 8 family members bailed on the wifi and used data to get anything done on email and social media. We had two rooms one for our 4 20something kids and one for us parents and grandparents. Both rooms were outfitted with only 2 coffee cups. although it would have been easy to call for two more why not just stock it with 4 cups. At the end of the stay we tried using the phone which was unplugged when we first checked in to call the bell desk for our bags to be brought to our cars. The phone rang and sounded like it connected I could hear bumps and bangs in the distance but no one ever came on the line. Ultimately we sent two people down to the bell desk get things rolling. On the positive side the place is gorgeous. We enjoyed some time in the lobby the gift shop and at Whitewater Cafe. Overall the staff was friendly and helpful. Many of the staff had been with Disney for many years 2 of the bell staff had worked for Disney for 20 and 26 years. Our beds were luxurious and comfortable. just the ticket after a long day in the park. The absolute highlight for us was the pool. And we did not even swim. We enjoyed two restful afternoon breaks polside on the comfy loungers. A special shout out to Michael who was our server on Wednesday afternoon he was friendly and attentive and put up with our familys brand of joking with our servers. He dished it out too betting our soon to be 25 year old daughter that he would have her glass of wine at the lounger before she could run up to the room and back for her ID. He was right. The hotel also allowed us to leave our car for free until midnight. and use the pool for the day after we had checked out.

To be fair the rooms need it. We stayed in room 4010 with a pool view and loved sitting on the balcony and watching kids swim and play. For me the three biggest points to staying here1.

No Murphy bed like the newer or refurbished DVC properties have. The toilet and tub shower are separate from the sink vanity dressing area. I enjoy using balconies but unfortunately this one overlooked the \u201c backstage \u201d area of the hotel. As masters of illusion you \u2019d think that Disney could work some of their magic to seclude these service areas from guest view. Instead I was treated to the sound of construction equipment and shouting. We ate at Storytellers \u2019 Caf\u00e9 and White Water Snacks neither of which was remarkable. We should have been able to go right downstairs to our pool for a quick dip and then back to our room but unfortunately the entire pool patio area was closed off for our entire stay this really detracted from the themed experience for us \u2014 it felt like half of the hotel was closed off.

It was so nice to walk from our room through the lobby into Downtown Disney and to the Disneyland gates in a leisurely 10 minute walk. No tram no bus no boat no train and no corresponding lines or waiting just to get to the gate.

A small refrigerator is also available and a pod coffee tea machine.

Ask the bellhop where the easiest entrances and elevators are to get to the parks our bellhop gave us great tips on how to get to where we needed to goit is a rather large hotel and has an entrance to Downtown Disney and a direct entry to California Adventure. We used the CA entry often the line was usually shorter and sometimes it was easier to walk through CA and out to go to Magic Kingdom. The lines during magic hour do get very long. Be prepared to wait and go early they do move you quickly through but word of advice pack everything you need in clear plastic bags in your bag. They have to look through everything and are not allowed to unzip it takes time to unzip everything so clear bags work like a charm. You get searched every time you enter Disney property not each time you enter the parks through the normal main entrance so you can parkhop with out being searched. We used the Disneyland express bus to get there from the airport and it was very easy Once again the bellhops gave us tips on where to wait and which bus just to make sure we got on the correct one. The reason for 4 stars is if you do have a little one a tub would be nice and the beds being very tall. They had bunkbeds before and now they are gone so now kids share a bed.

This is a DEAD honest review of our stay September 2018 at Disney \u2019s Grand Californian Hotel. We arrived after a 14 hour flight from Australia to LAX airport to be told upon climbing aboard our Disney Coach Liner Bus that they were unable to drop us off at the entrance of Disneys Grand Californian Hotel because the valet entrance section is undergoing a refurb so they need to drop us off across and down the road at another hotel and we would have to walk across with our bags you can imagine how fun that was after flying for 14 hours 3 kids in tow plus 6 bags and a baby car seat. Upon checking in we were greeted with fire alarm sirens going off in the foyer as this week they were testing the smoke alarms several times during check in we were interrupted by the noise which had our 3 year old on the floor crying scared. Our room was n\u2019t ready which was expected as it was only 8 am in the morning we were happy to lounge by the pool and ride the slides until our room was ready. Entering the pool area we noticed the large pool that contains the slides was under renovation too so the slides pool was not in use for our entire stay we were guted as this was a huge drawing card that attracted us to the hotel. We had spent some time planning our vacation and YouTubing clips of the pool area the kids were so excited to be staying there. I expressed my disappointment to the pool staff who mentioned we could walk across the road to their other Disney Resort and use their slides whilst Grand Californians were out of action. So off we went we hiked across the road 10 mins to their other Disney Resort to use their pool slides. You can imagine we were pretty hungry at this stage so we ordered food by the pool with their cabana staff. We perused the menu which had all of 6 items on it to be told only 4 options were available that day so with limited choice we ordered a few meals to be told their hotel too is under renovation so all meals wo nt come with fries today so our sides would be carrot sticks. HANG ON are n\u2019t we in the Fries capital of the world the USA. The only person that would have been happy with the carrot sticks sides would be Bugs Bunny. YET they could deep fry the kids chicken nuggets to the point there was only a coating on them and no chicken inside. So off we went back to the Grand Californian as our room was ready. Upon receiving the room key I expressed our utter disappointment regarding the non working slides so they very kindly upgraded our room from a garden view to a partial pool view nice touch. The next day we headed off to Disneyland the happiest place on the planet. At lunchtime we decided to return back to the hotel for a swim to cool off before heading back for a fun afternoon back at Disneyland however whilst we were walking through the lobby back at the Grand Californian Hotel they wheeled an elderly DEAD person right out in front of us and our 3 children out to a waiting van. This is no joke. I thought to myself why would n\u2019t they wait until much later in the evening to move the body to limit families witnessing what we saw but then I thought to myself with rooms averaging 90 per night they needed to re let the room out again. Upon check out the next day I discussed my concerns about what we witnessed as a family the day before and that my children had been asking concerning questions. The lady at the checkout desk pulled over a manager that was barely out of pubity and he claimed the man was just asleep he shrugged the whole incident off. I am a women in my 40 \u2019s my husband and I know what we witnessed without going into further detail in this review. Honestly I would have thought a senior manager would have been called over given the severity of this. Perhaps offering an apology or even a counselling session could have been a good start. All that being said it was still a magnificent hotel just metres from the entry to the parks and with the comfiest beds you \u2019l ever sleep in even Goldilocks would return back.", "offset": [1408, 1595], "date": "2018-09-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "12992684-b8b7-4edc-9a62-254be7ad7c10", "sentence": "Good convenient but problematic security screeners. This is the best of the 3 Disneyland hotels due primarily to its location adjacent to California Adventure. The convenience is the best feature and the main reason we stayed there despite the rather steep price. The rooms were clean and furnishings in good condition. Bathroom did not have a tub but had the best shower we used during our week trip to Southern CA. Beds were a bit high for some reason but fine. Thermostat worked well and the heating cooling is central and quiet overall. There was some noise from neighboring rooms so not the most sound proof rooms but it was not that severe. The lobbies were spacious and nice and the check in process was very fast. The pools were fine although they did not seem to all be heated and the biggest one with the slides closed at 5 pm for unknown reasons on of our days there. Our only complaint about this hotel was that the security guards who check bags when you leave the hotel to enter Downtown Disney or California Adventure were quite rude in one and only one instance. Basically one security guard was indiscriminately waving some people without bags past the bag check so they could go straight to the metal detector but forcing others to go to the other bag check line due to someone holding up the other line. Happened several times where she would wave some people without bags by but made me to go back to the other line for no reason. Security supervisor was unsympathetic and told me to complain to Anaheim City Hall.", "offset": [722, 878], "date": "2019-04-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "cdc91401-1e5d-4120-8f0c-2544da2261b4", "sentence": "Beautiful hotel but not very organized. The hotel is beautiful. The private entrance into California Adventure is a big plus. We booked a 3 bedroom suite for our group of 8. It was pricey but it was for a special family trip. I was expecting things to run smoothly and a hotel of this caliber to be professional and organized but we had some issues. I requested ahead of time a tub in one of the rooms since my 3 year old has sensory issues and ca n\u2019t take a shower yet. I also requested a monorail view room for the kids. I understand these are both subject to availability. Upon check in we found out neither of these requests went through ahead of time and at the time of our arrival there were n\u2019t any tubs. We were given pool view rooms which were so noisy. There is construction going on for the pool bar which affected the kids nap time and was n\u2019t very relaxing. We had grad night 2 of the nights we were there which was noisy at night. We could hear loud music and screaming. We had a grocery delivery. Bell service forgot to bring one item up to the room so I called downstairs and was told they could n\u2019t deliver it unles I was in the room so I said I would pick it up on our way back to the room from the park. I stopped at the desk and waited. only to find out that it was delivered to the room while we were gone even though they said they could n\u2019t do that. Then they called to say they had an item for me but I said no it was already delivered. At check in we gave 2 credit cards so my mom could put part of the cost on her card. They swiped it had her sign the paper work and it seemed squared away. At check out things were confusing and the bill did n\u2019t show this request. It took so long to get this sorted out at check out that we had to leave before it was sorted out because our bus was waiting. Pretty frustrating. We all felt that the pools were chilly. The small kids pool really should be warmer. The kids were shivering in the water. The pools at the Disneyland Hotel are better overall. All in all a beautiful hotel. However next time we would choose the Disneyland Hotel again over this one.", "offset": [763, 870], "date": "2019-05-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "c23710db-9ec6-4d77-93f0-625cbc9dab11", "sentence": "you are paying for location it is still a massive crowded property. it is wonderful to stay here for the proximity to the parks. As someone else mentioned never before have we paid this kind of price for a hotel but it was a special trip and we wanted to make it extra memorable. Check in takes much longer than it should at such a luxury facility. Lines are long and the actual process is lengthy compared to any other hotel we have visited. The rooms are fine on the small side compared to something like HGI. The hotel is very clean the housekeeping staff is just wonderful and goes the extra mile to provide excellent service. The restaurants are expensive but the menu is not appealing to vegetarians. Disney has replace real veggie burgers with the Beyond Impossible burgers throughout their properties taking away an option for people who do not want to eat animals or anything that looks like an animal. We did not find anything appealing about Napa Rose or Storytellers NR is trying too hard to be over the top and sometimes you do not want a buffet. The pool bar is fine food is not great but it is fine as long as the live music is not on. Craftsman Grill seemed to be having lots of issues when we were there. As an example of what is wrong with the food Avocado Toast is on every menu but they take a simple and good food and try to make it gourmet which actually ruins it. Rather than fresh avocado on fresh bread there is a thin smear of an avocado paste like material on dry white sourdough with some oily balsamic glaze drizzled on top. it is tasteless. We ended up surveying all the restaurants and going back into the park for dinner because there was nothing just simple and good. The best food we had came from room service. This department went over and beyond expectations. There is not anywhere to relax at this hotel other than the noisy and crowded lobby or the overly crowded pool area they have crammed too many rooms into this space. We would stay here again for the park access and we enjoyed our time. There are lovely staff members here that and the location are what makes this property luxury.", "offset": [1060, 1150], "date": "2020-02-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}]}
