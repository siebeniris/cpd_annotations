I spent 5 days at this hotel attending a conference held on site with three colleagues. The conference facilities were great with large keynote room and smaller breakout rooms. The breakfast lunch and break food was fantastic. Beautiful property with cascading waterfall and full size tropical plants and palms. I do not have a problem with stairs but my colleague hesitated to go to the lounge area because of the flagstone steps. We ate in the hotel restaurant and had great entr\u00e9e salads and a nice pesto shrimp flatbread pizza. The hotel is across the street from the Perimeter Center Mall which has several great restaurants within walking distance Seasons 52 Capital Grill The Tap and Magianos. We were farther away from downtown Atlanta than I realized so we ended up not going in to the city. Traffic is horrendous. It was a 30minute cab ride from the airport at about 55. I learned from conference attendees that the hotel shuttle will take me to the MARTA Dunwody train station to the airport for 250. The bellman said it is faster than driving during peak commute times. I felt very safe here and will give that a try.", "offset": [0, 37], "date": "2016-03-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "26c23deb-25df-4538-810e-5ade753ae709", "sentence": "Needs to be Updated. Crowne Plaza Ravinia is located in a very convenient part of town. It is in the Northern Perimeter of Atlanta near the mall. Many eating venues such as Cheesecake Factory Magianos Sage and many others are within walking distance. The hotel atrium is very inviting and well cared for. The rooms are spacious. However they need updating. The toilet sits low and requires you to hold the handle to completely flush. The tiles are old and have mold in the caulking. The shower curtain was yucky.

This was my second time at the Crowne. It is a beautiful location and easy to walk to dining options after a long day of meetings. The room was very clean and comfortable. I appreciated how quiet the room was despite being located right across from the elevator. Although there is no ice machine on the floor ice is easily available in the c store. I wish the coffee bar were open throughout the day. Also the meeting rooms were kept close to freezing temperatures which was distracting.

I had seen this hotel many times when I was in the area but had never stayed there before. Our conference was held here so it was a chance to check it out. I loved the room very clean comfortable beds nice bathroom. Staff was very friendly. Conference facilities were perfect for us. I think that by the time we were done we had been almost everywhere in the facility. Great food for our conference meals even for picky eaters. Loved the outdoor garden right outside the restaurant.
