We stayed here for a week in early October. We chose this hotel for it is proximity to both Phoenix and Scotsdale as well as the many pools and water slide. Check in was fast and easy with friendly desk staff. Our room was on the second floor which was much faster to access by the outside staircases than the elevator. It had everything needed for a hotel room mini fridge fairly large bathroom bed and tv. The only thing missing would be a small microwave. The air conditioning worked well but was quite loud at night when it would turn on. Our room had a small balcony overlooking the parking lot but was a close walk to the water park area. Major negative was the fire alarm going off at 4 am for 30 minutes straight. No real fire and no explanation of why it happened. The water park pool area was really spacious. We had no issues finding the perfect spot to get some sun. We took a soft side cooler with some waters and had inconsistent results. One day we were not allowed and had to leave it at the entryway but other days we entered without issue. For being in the desert the pool water was almost too cold at times but we made it work. The water slide only operates during certain times and you have to ask for it to be turned on but it was fun. We also tried the mini golf which was a little dated. The shop in the area had unique things and friendly staff. The one hiccup we had was nearing checkout. We called the desk to ask to borrow the luggage scale to make sure we packed ok for the plane weight limits and after much bouncing around were told they do not have one. Come on Hilton how can you not have a luggage scale. Next time I will pack my own but this should be a common thing in a hotel. Overall the location was great about 15 20 mins from everything.

We stayed at this resort for six nights during the first week in April. My husband and I traveled to the resort with our sons ages two and four. I will say I was very nervous about our stay due to the negative reviews. We were pleasantly surprised and happy with our stay. While we did not enjoy not being able to check in until 40 especially after traveling all day with two little ones we understood that early check in was not guaranteed and the regular check in time is clearly stated as being 40A lot of people have remarked about the difficulty getting chairs at the waterpark. We had no problem getting chairs all week. Yes we did get in line before the park opened but never once was it more than ten minutes before the park opened. I can assure you you do not have to get in line at 70 to get a chair. I do think that management could certainly add more chairs in the open spaces to avoid this issue. There are a lot of empty spaces that could be filled with chairs. While I do think that people who reserve the chairs should be using them you also have to take in account that there are a lot of activities around the pool area that people can partake in besides swimming. For example our kids loved the lazy river we would often leave the pool area and spend an hour or more floating in the lazy river. People can also play mini golf basketball or tennis. One solution that they use for this problem is to remove the belongings from unoccupied chairs. I can assure you I would not have been happy if I returned and my stuff was removed as others had their stuff removed by management. We saw them take belongings including purses and cell phones. I do not think this is a good solution to the problem in the least. Add more chairs problem solvedWhile we enjoyed the water park we also enjoyed the relaxation and quietness provided by the pools associated with each building. Again there were always plenty of chairs at these pools and we never had an issue getting a seat at this pool at any point during our stay. While we were disappointed our suite was not located in the updated building our suite was sufficient for us. Yes the decor is not modern but we hardly spent any time in our room anyway. We did not ever turn the tv on. Room service was always very prompt and our room was always clean by 10 in the morning. We ate at both of the on site restaurants and enjoyed them. The pool had typical pool food and drinks yes they are over priced but are n\u2019t they always. You are paying for the convenience of eating and drinking polside. The servers were great. I really liked the fact that they had water stations throughout the pool areas with cups and ice cold water and it was free. Workers were constantly refilling them with ice and water. Yes the water park does get a little run down through out the day but for the most part it was clean. I truly think the workers try to keep up as best as they can. They are continuously coming around to pick up trash and empty garbages throughout the day. They could do a better job of cleaning the main pool within the water park I think it just gets run down due to the high usage. The other pool by our building was very clean and well maintained. Yes the lazy river was slow but it was not the end of the world. My kidos loved itI am also not sure why people have posted about parking being an issue. Parking at the resort is FREE. we have been to many resorts where we were charged for parking each day. We NEVER had an issue getting a parking spot and always noticed empty spaces again we were there during a pretty busy week. The hotel is located around a lot of great restaurants.

The Pointe Hilton at Squaw Creek was one of 6 hotels my family of 5 3 kids ages 16 14 11 stayed at during a trip out west. We rated it 5 out of the 6. We were there for 2 nights July 5 7 2018. We checked in quite late at night and check in was a breeze. The reception man and the bellman who showed us on the map how to find our room were extremely friendly. It was a nice introduction to Arizona. Being northerners the heat was expectedly overwhelming even at 10 pm. Our room felt as though the ac had only been turned on a short time before our arrival because it was n\u2019t very comfortable. We went straight to bed since we arrived so late and did n\u2019t have any trouble sleeping. We were concerned that the ac was n\u2019t working but by the time we awoke it was clear that it just had n\u2019t been on long enough to do its job. The water park was fun for about 20 minutes for my kids. As others have said the pictures make it look much better than it is but that is to be expected. I \u2019m sure younger kids under age 7 would have been occupied longer. We shot some hoops at the water basketball area and went around the lazy river a few times. The pool was clean. My husband had a beer for 7. Since the kids were bored with the waterpark area quickly we went to the pool at our building. That pool had a swim up bar where we got a yummy cocktail for 11 each. The kids were bored there quickly too but my husband and I stayed and relaxed for a bit. The water temperature at all the pools was refreshing not too cold and not warm. There was a hot tub area that was simply out of the question considering the heat but it was quite spacious and adjacent to the swim up bar. The space for the number of people at the water park and the building pool was perfect but July is off season. I can see how during peak season it would easily get too crowded considering the space. The room was relatively spacious and I appreciated the sink being separated from the toilet shower. The pull out sofa was sufficient for my 16year old. We were in the North Pointe building on the first floor room 12 1 Bedroom Agave Suite. I was told at check in that we were in the newly remodeled building. The room seemed a bit run down with very shoddy workmanship poorly done tile ceilings etc. It was not Hilton quality and \u201c newly remodeled \u201d. must mean within the last 10 years. Our slider door overlooked a brick wall as many have shown in pictures. It was n\u2019t bad but it was n\u2019t good either \u2026 simply not a typical Hilton. Outlets for charging devices were inconvenient and I was glad I brought long cords and a multiple outlet plug. It was clean the grounds and the room. Shower water pressure was very disappointing. Would I stay there again. If it was convenient and I got another good room rate and I was passing through I would stay there but I \u2019d probably look for something better first.", "offset": [1239, 1333], "date": "2018-07-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "982224d5-066b-4fa0-a298-6b903b7d0b34", "sentence": "Absolutely great place to spend your spring break as temperatures are still below the 90s.

They have a few healthier items. There are mixed alcoholic drinks and frozen drinks Sadly they use mixes which are all full of sugar. Beer was the best option. This is a Hilton pool and they should be embarrassed. It should not be open for use. We walked back to our building and stayed at that pool. It had a pebble bottom clear water and a swim up bar.

We will be back.", "offset": [134, 220], "date": "2019-10-15", "cpt": "3", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 30, "uid": "f0c9a6c8-80fb-41e6-bb3e-e9aae108a63d", "sentence": "I would give 3 stars out of 5. The campus is clean and pretty. The staff at checkin were not welcoming and did not explain anything about the property the amenities or give us the vouchers for the breakfast that was purchased with the room. The rooms need to be updated. The sofa appears to be from 1989 and the decor is outdated. The sofa sleeper was okay for my 6 year old daughter but would not be suitable for adults. The sofa sleeper was broken and took two people to pull out. The was a small fridge with no freezer. There was a small coffee maker but no microwave. The staff at the River Ranch were not welcoming either. The area had poor signage and staff did not take the time to explain the layout. The pool area was nice and big enough for all the guest with plenty of shades and lounge chairs. They did have one water slide with it is own small pool. The two restaurants on the resort had good food however the staff were rude. One waitreas slammed my daughters plate down right on her menu she was coloring on without saying a word. At Ricos I asked for shredded cheese for my daughters pasta and they brought shredded parmesan I asked for shredded cheddar and was told they do not have that here however they do because it is available on the breakfast menu. On Sunday at 11 am I called the full service salon that was to be open until 7 pm to get pedicures and was told their was only one person who does pedicures and she was not in yet and could not accommodate three people today because there were a few other people also waiting and that she would not he back until Wednesday. The cabana pool side bar was closed. I feel that the resort was not very accommodating.", "offset": [1597, 1633], "date": "2019-11-15", "cpt": "3", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 31, "uid": "2bd2c6d1-26c6-4d9d-96d8-f251118f104e", "sentence": "Would go back. First time visitors had a great time. Rented a casita and enjoyed the pools. Staff is super friendly which makes for a great experience. Ate dinner at the Hole in the Wall which was good. Kids lived the pools and they are heated which was awesome. Casitas need updating and the only other recommendation is to keep the main pools open later than 7 on a weekend.

Our family stayed in a casita for 4 nights for a family wedding. We arrived to a musty dusty room that had not been redone in at least a decade. Dirty carpets and drapes with dust on them not great for those with allergies in the party. Our maid service was spotty at best. The unit kitchen had no supplies not even dish soap. The River Pool area was old showing wear and tear and a lack of maintenance. The gift shop had a broken coffee machine and staff with attitude during a busy time of a holiday season. The restaurant was terible bad service that took over an hour to serve us 3 burgers with only 3 families in the place and several employees milling about. the food was blah.

The good I was upgraded to an Agave Suite which was nice. The rooms were nicely upgraded and the furnishings were up to Hilton standards. The room was spacious and housekeeping was excellent. The pools were clean and well maintained minus the lazy river temperature. The staff was friendly except for check in. The challenges The check in experience was terrible. I arrived around 10p after a long flight ready for some relaxation. The parking lot was dark and I parked at the front to check in. The agent was short and borderline rude. She confirmed my ID my credit card and handed me the keys. When I asked about where to go from there she refused to provide additional help and pointed me to the concierge for additional help. I asked about breakfast as a Diamond member and she said it was not included. I would be provided a 10 per day per person up to 2 food and beverage credit. I asked how much breakfast costs and she said it costs more than that. I later found it out it was 22 per person plus tax plus tip. The hotel does not comply with Hilton terms and conditions and refuses to provide a continental breakfast to Gold or Diamond members. The 10 is more flexible but DOES NOT cover the cost of the most basic item at breakfast. Complete scam. The hotel also charges a 35 plus tax resort fee for things like internet toll free calls and access to the pools. I do not believe this business model it is unethical and it is clear from the check in process and disregard of Hilton policies that they do not intend run an ethical business. The lazy river was ice cold the first day we were there. there is basically no flow to the water and it was freezing cold. The second day they seemed to have fixed the water temperature. Would like to have seen the tennis courts stay open later too. They closed at 6p. Otherwise the stay was good. The hotel is nice and the pools were clean. The rooms were clean. The bed was comfortable. Everything in the room was functioning. If you are Diamond or Gold I would not recommend as they do not want to recognize your status and benefits.", "offset": [1317, 1430], "date": "2020-02-23", "cpt": "3", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 37, "uid": "9ce01fa0-5474-4947-b3ee-3b5101197f76", "sentence": "Not worth a penny I spent here.
