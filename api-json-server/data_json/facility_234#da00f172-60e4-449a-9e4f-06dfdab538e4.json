We went to the lounge near the lobby for a late dinner and about halfway through a lot of people came to the bar obviously coming from a large convention or meeting.

Whilst the hotel the facilities and the location are very good there were a number of disappointments. These included. Restaurants were disappointing. Plates were cold food not hot and expensive.

We felt that because we had secured a good competitive rate through Hotels. com we were given second class treatment. Final Bill included 45 of incorrect mini bar purchases so guests need to be wary. Hotel seems to focus mainly on parties booking short term breaks for weddings and golf weekends and to be less interested in encouraging guests booking a 2 week leisure holiday break. We very quickly found good local restaurants for Breakfast and Dinner better choice better quality much lower prices and no mandatory 21 service charge.

In celebrating a post day wedding anniversary and enjoy the Annual Holiday Lights Ice we stayed here one night. I have been here before and this hotel property is a bit out of the way but set in hills of Austin. It was designed primarily as a golfing resort and recently purchased by Omni Hotels. This property is shared between the hotel and Barton Creek Country Club. I forget it is better to valet the vehicle than drive a long way to the parking garage which is pretty small but free. The walk from the garage to the lobby is a mess where directions is sketchy and have to walk on the road and on the golf cart pathway. Upon entering the lobby our room keys were waiting and a bellhop help with our luggage to our room. Omni always make you feel special and making your experience feel luxurious. The room was huge where originally reserved it using a Black Friday special. I even received a 10 resort gift card. Our bellhop alerted us a future 100 mil expansion is being planned to upgrade this property but did not have exact details. I can predict a few from staying here and touring this resort where improvements need to be done since I stay at large resorts often. The lobby was decorated in with the holidays and explored the shops which seem to be located in different places so walk around and explore. The shops carry many items and apparel not found in stores in Austin and high quality. The fitness apparel was impressive. I definitely need to return here just to shop for myself and gifts for others. There was a temporary shop open for the holidays selling candy cookies and cupcakes. You could even decorate your own holiday cookies. In the same shop you can buy tickets to ice skate next door in a enclosed club house. It was a small ice rink where outside get your skates and inside had plenty of seating to watch. There is even a fire place and a bar serving alcohol drinks and fresh hot chocolate. Ice skating was fun and be sure to wear a light jacket. Afterwards headed to a bar on the second level and had a very good mixed drink with a two person band playing tunes. Very relaxing. I noticed there is a fine dining restaurant and a more casual one on the property. In walking outside at night a light holiday tree was lit up but next to a golf cart pathway where had to avoid from getting hit. There is an outdoor pool but too cold to swim however there is a heated spa and an indoor pool located in a fitness facility. This fitness facility is huge and will please all who are into sports. The relaxation spa is located here too and also the store selling fitness apparel. With all it offering to please there is some huge improvements that need to be made. First the hotel was built before the internet so even though the WiFi is good there are not enough electrical outlets in the room to charge devices so make sure to bring a travel power strip. The outlets look very old and looked like it was falling apart. Our room was infested with ladybugs and know why since we have same problem at home. The TV was a flat screen but the service was still old school where you could still purchase movies at high prices where most travelers just watch streaming content on tablets or use USB devices connected to the TVIt still had a mini bar with key to purchase drinks and snacks where most hotels have abandoned this and only provide a mini fridge. The outdoor pool facilities are weak compared to Hyat and Mariot properties that had lazy rivers slides and multiple pools including an outdoor cafe and bar. Golf cart pathways or a golf green should no be butted against the back of the hotel where you expect a courtyard or swim facilities. The hole behind the hotel needs to go and replaced with swim facilities or place to hang out and explore similar to Hyat Lost Pines Resort. This place needs to be more family friendly where a playground is missing. Basically needs to be less of a golfing resort and more a family friends adventure resort. The parking garage walkway needs to be improved. Sweet tea is missing from the gift shop. The elevator are slow scary and tiny. When you enter is creeks and hear cables making squeaky sounds. As an Omni Select Guest member I did not get my free breakfast drink delivered to my room but got a voucher to get a free drink in the gift shop. I also had to fix the leaking toilet myself. With all this we still had a great time and excited to see what Omni will do to this property.", "offset": [2335, 2460], "date": "2016-12-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "fddc7d05-1727-4819-a835-3b9fd6e7d453", "sentence": "family getaway.

She seemed annoyed by my questions and particularly by my children ages 11314. They are very respectful and polite. She was rude and would cut me off during my questions. The toiletries are cheap the activities advertised for family are practically non existent. The spa was all booked and the entertainment at the bar on Friday night was really bad.

So this place is not awful in any sense of the word. But I have been spoiled in my 40 years and I was sadly disappointed. This am not Vegas. This am not even Austin. So it is an ok place. But not one of the 8 workers helped me with my suitcase as I was walking in and apparently they did not look twice at my 72 year old step mother either. Wtf. The desk staff was nice. Ask for champagne when you register. it is there but it is not on their automatic response. The bar is cool. Fastest service of anyone all weekend. The rooms are nice but older. you will get lost in the poorly marked hallways but sooner or later you will find your rooms. Of the three rooms we got only mine facing the golf course and pool seemed to have the best view. We did not have a balcony which would have been nicer but that was not an automatic either. The dining room downstairs was ok. Check menu first to see if you want it. Though the waiters were nice slow slow slow was the issue. Those poor underpaid workers work as if they are underpaid. The breakfast buffet was not really worth the money. Same buffet every morning. And it went all that. Omelet bar was good but everything else is ho hum. I did not play golf but I am guessing that if you are going for golf that is who would give the A rating. People had weddings there but I would not want that venue. There was a small restaurant with a balcony which was good. But under staffed. Speaking of which there is NO where to read a book quietly. The lobby is too loud the pool is crawling with kids and there is people everywhere else you had think you could go. All I wanted was a rocking chair on some balcony outside. The gym was good. There was an indoor pool which was ok. The nature walk is a joke bring stable shoes it is treacherous. The min golf course is like the one in my backyard. The massage was awesome though. there is a sauna and wet room that were not working there was a hot tub that was too hot and not relaxing since people were constantly walking through since it was on the only walkway. The tranquility room is funny. it is got some couches facing windows to a lit rock wall. I was waiting for it to turn into a peep show. It could have actually been better if there was more light so that maybe I could have read that stupid book I brought to read during my weekend spa getaway. Whew. Did I help at all. there is an HEB grocery store and fridge in the room if you want. The bathroom was nice. I stole cupcakes that were only meant for a kids decorating bar in the lobby but come on. it is sugar in a public area and it was calling my name. I had go back to this place if it were worth my while but I am not gon na lie. Lake Austin Resort was way better and prettier and I actually read a book there. Maybe this place would be a great day trip massage and. well. Maybe that is it. I was so bored. What a shame. But it did not completely suck.

OMG I have stayed at OMNI Resorts and THIS was not Omni caliber AT ALBUYER BEWAREdid not think too much of it at first but the second class citizen treatment started at check in. The lady had her nose high in the air and I felt like I was talked down to when checking in. I dismissed that as the clerk or whatever they are called having a small mind. I agree with the other reviewer leaving a comment about this place being a maze. Unles you know where you are going or are paying very careful to the signs one would get lost. Initially when I walked in the room I was very impressed with the size of the room and the high ceilings. Taking a closer look would provide a different picture. I was on a working trip so naturally I needed to plug in my electronics. The plugs at the desk were in a lamp. The lamp was totally dated and the outlets were loose they did not work at all. I called the desk and to my surprise the engineer and his helper came quickly. Their solution was to put a clunky extension cord on the desk to plug in my laptop and phone. FINE it was late and that is the best I had and I need to get some work done. I decided to unwind change and wear the provided robe. It was nicely folded on the bed. When I unfolded it it had hair inside. It also had a scent of cologne or something of the like. I know there should not be any scent at all. VOMIT. I called the front desk again and the person that answered said that they would send a fresh robe. I am still waitingDisgusted I decided to have a cold drink of water and get ice. I opened the ice bucket to get ice down the hall way and GUESS WHAT. There was a pool of water in the bucket meaning that someone had used this thing and it was never cleaned. EW. I did not even bother calling the front desk because I was tired it was late and it just was not a priority at that point. The next morning I stepped in the shower and noticed there were hairs on the walls in the shower. I was running late already so I rinsed off and went on my way. At check out the lady at the desk did not look surprised at all when I told her all this. All she did is offer to take off the resort fee.
