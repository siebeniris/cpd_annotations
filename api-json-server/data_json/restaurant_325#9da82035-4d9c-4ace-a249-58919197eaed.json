I was here for four nights on a business trip and really enjoyed my stay. The location is great right off of I10 and surrounded by everyday dining and shopping options. I stayed on the I10 side of the hotel and just did not experience the noise level that some other reviewers did. Maybe I was just too tired but I slept just fine. My room was large and very clean. There was more than adequate work space a small refrigerator and a comfortable sofa. I also had a small balcony which was nice but clean. not so much. You can not keep birds away but I am not certain the chairs or floor there had been cleaned in some time. I just threw a towel on the chair and it was okay but not very inviting. Another very minor issue was that the shower head in my room lacked sufficient pressure unles you adjusted the head to that one blasting stream of water. The coffee shop doubles as the bar in the evening and there are multiple very comfortable lounging areas throughout the lobby area. The Starbucks on site is nice but know if you go around the wall toward the pool area and public computers you will find the complimentary coffee. I came back to the room after work one day to freshen up before dinner in and out in 15 minutes or less. I think it was around 40. As luck would have it housekeeping knocked on my door in that little window of time. I asked her to please give me just 10 minutes. She never came back. No real harm done but it was the one service issue I had the whole time I was there. I enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to return.", "offset": [1160, 1264], "date": "2015-05-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "aa5a23f8-c1dd-4ab6-9803-bea3d572044a", "sentence": "nice and quiet room.
