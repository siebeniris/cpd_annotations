We immediately notified the hotel and no one came to clean the bath room. Because there were 5 in my family we needed to get 3 more bath towels. It took over 5 hours and repeated requests to get these towels up to my room.

You could also walk or catch the trolley to the cruise port do not get a taxi. or stroll along the River Walk which is nothing exciting but a nice thing to do. The kids loved that there was a Starbucks in the foyer. there was also a small convenience store on site.
