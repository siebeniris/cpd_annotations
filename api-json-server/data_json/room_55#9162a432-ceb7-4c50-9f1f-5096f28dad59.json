From booking the reservation to setting up the surprise for our unsuspecting Bride every staff member was above and beyond outstanding. They completely accommodated everything we could possibly ask and all with a very friendly and welcoming flair. The rooms were sleek and beautiful with a unique modern meets classic feel. The location was ideal one block from Times Square surprisingly a quiet street. Everyone was just as enthused as we to pull off a wonderful surprise. I would absolutely recommend and again book a stay at the Muse. If only to come and visit the wonderful staff let alone the awesome unique hotel itself. Thank you again to all those who gave us their all and made that night one for our Bride and her friends to remember forever as the time we had a true adventure in the heart of New York City.

Overall a very pleasing stay. Modern hotel with nice large rooms and large bathrooms. Very nice and helpful staff. Close to Times Square and not far from the 42nd Street subway stop.

The hotel is ideally located for a theater weekend which was my goal. there is construction along Broadway so going west from the hotel will involve massive crowds but is not that part of NY charm. I arrived at 1 pm well before official checkin time. Not only could they find a room they upgraded me to a wonderful corner room for my three nights. The room was spotlessly clean everything in the bathroom worked and it had the most powerful shower I have experienced in any hotel EVER. Fantastic. Staff on check in and every contact were friendly. it is not a formal service but engaging and personal. They might not know your name each time you walk by but they smile or say hello and make you feel welcome.

Although the balcony view is not a great city view it is still great quieter than you had expect being a block off TS and the balcony is very spacious also. The best part of The Muse is the staff everyone is abundantly welcoming and helpful. They have wine hour every evening mingling with other guests is nice.

Klimpton did a great job at putting this space together. Great locale near but not on top off times square and again the quality of the buildings and furnishings and the level of professionalism and service will drive us back here next time. This is the quality one should expect at this price point. Only downside is we were looking forward to dining in house at Nios but they had to cancel our reservation because they were filming a TV show in the bar and it went over. and I could not even score a walk on to the set.

The decorations and comfort of the bed and chairs were great as well the curtains blocked out the city lights and in the morning we really did not hear any noises which was nice. Never even heard other guests. The shower was beautiful and relaxing AWESOME rain shower head and also a detachable shower head. We were able to sleep in relax and enjoyed our time in the room. We could walk to Times Square and centralPark from the hotel. I will post a separate review of the restaurant next door attached to The Muse which was disappointing and we also encountered a front desk member who used bad language and was more interested in chatting with a gentleman that helping guests but I wrote to them personally about that. The bathrooms downstairs in the lobby were pretty fantastic and it was nice to have a wine reception before dinner. The ladies at the front even helped me print show tickets which was very nice. In general I would say if you want a hotel that is close to the theater and Times SquareThen stay here. The only reason I would not is because I like being able to eat at the hotel I am staying at just like I have at other kimptom properties.

The showers stalls are spacious with 2 different kinds of shower heads the water pressure is good and the beds are super comfortable. The staff was friendly helpful and aiming to ensure you have a great stay. The free happy hours in the evenings is always a fun treat. it is nothing extravagant but free wine at the end of the day is a wonderful cherry on top of a hectic day of business wandering touring the city.

The staff acknowledged Moms birthday from the check in and Brenda very kindly left us cupcakes and a bottle of wine to celebrate in our room. As always wine hour is a great event to talk to people from all over. The rooms are very clean comfortable and modern. The only complaint I have is getting a cab is very difficult and we were worried about getting to Port Authority on time. Guests need to be warned and I think the doormen need to be a little more proactive in their assistance. They give up. I ended up using Uber but cancelled it after I was able to flag a cab myself.

Bar none this has been the worst hotel experience I have ever been subjected to in New York. Upon check in I was advised that the bar and the restaurant are closed until further notice for renovations. Yet the blurb on the hotel site says newly renovated. So at 730 pm I asked for a nearby restaurant and was directed to the Irish Pub next door. Inedible food. not their problem. In the lobby of this hotel there is literally NO WHERE to sit in a chair with a back to it. The five seats are all benches which look like they were form last century filthy and torn. The tiny room was I guess normal for New York. The sink did not drain there was one tiny bar of soap and three old and worn towels. Breakfast was a total joke. There is free coffee in the lobby no machines in the rooms. So not having anywhere to sit I went downstairs to the breakfast room. There were 13 old and blackened bananas a few bagels. I was asked by the person in charge to pay 150 as I had a coffee. Which I had brought from the free coffee station upstairs. The hotel was filthy as to be expected under construction. Probably the most interesting point is that I paid 2460 for this room and then went on line. They have discounted the rooms to 1490. I was here for business and had no where to invite my guests to even sit down.

The Muse is conveniently located on 46th Street near Times Square. From a location standpoint it provides easy access to all points in Midtown theater restaurants and shopping. It is a boutique hotel. Our room was VERY small. I am in NYC every six weeks and used to staying at older hotels with small rooms. Our room had a king sized bed and the room had just enough room to walk around the perimeter of the bed. The windows were large but far off the floor. The windowsill was at chest height I am 56. Fortunately there was a large ledge between them because we were able to put our suitcase up there instead of taking up precious floor space. The bathroom was modern and well appointed. Everything worked well. Our primary issue was that I had requested a room with double beds when we made the reservation because my husband and son were joining the second night. There was a mix up in the reservation. The front desk was nice about it and I was understanding and patient. The front desk person told me that the person in charge of the rooms would be able to switch me the next day for an additional charge. The person was supposed to phone me to make arrangements. When I came in after dinner that night the front desk person confirmed again that I would receive a call the next day. No call came to my cell any other phone or the room phone. The three of us were squished into this small room. I was busy with meetings during my stay and I did not have the time to track them down to fix their mistake. I also should not have to. The second major issue was the HVAC system. It worked well enough. Very loud but white noise and that does not bother me and even helps to drown out the city noise. The problem was that occasionally there was a ratleling noise. My husband thought it was the metal cover. Whatever it was it would rattle loudly not white noise. The first time it happened was 130 am on my first night. So I just turned off the system as I did not want an engineering working in my room in the middle of the night. I thought I would mention it when they called about the room switch but that call never came. It happened several other times. Not consistently but enough to be annoying. The restaurant is under construction. They have limited breakfast available in the basement and will help you order from other places have it delivered. There is lots nearby so not a big deal.

Then came The Incident. At aprox 0645 on the morning we were due to check out I awoke to hear knocking on the door. I did not get up in time and someone then actually opened the door to our room. Thankfully I had the burglar bar on so they did not get in. I then went to the front desk to complain as I thought someone actually felt the need to physically deliver our bill. The curt indifferent front desk staff informed me that that did not happen and after a bit I got a half hearted sorry. When we checked out I was informed that according to them no one on staff had tried to come in my room. This is pretty disturbing as there are only a few scenarios then that makes sense. 1. A member of the staff did take it upon themselves to enter my room at 0645 and is lying. 2. The front desk staff is lying. 3. The front desk staff provided a unauthorized person with a key to my room. All scenarios are inappropriate and disturbing.

I prefered when they used to give the 10 voucher and free wifi as part of the loyalty programme as it felt like something special. It seems a rip off and a way to have slightly cheaper rates.
