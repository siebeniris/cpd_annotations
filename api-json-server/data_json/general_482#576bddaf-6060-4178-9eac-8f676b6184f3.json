We booked our stay through Priceline. I paid for a weekend stay and thought that I was paid in full. When we arrived we were told of the parking fees. We were a little taken back at the 190 per night fee. We felt it was a inflated fee. When we questioned the front desk about it we were told that ALL of Irvine charges a parking fee and that it is on there web site. I had my confirmation letter with me and it listed all the amenities and policies on it. No where on this letter is any mention of parking fees. They lowered it to 100 a night so we paid that.

I booked Double Tree due to their location and their Hilton association 5 weeks in advance. I am and Honors Member though entry level and had a great experience in a Hampton only a few weeks prior in ATL. This Double Tree fell way short of that experience. I will list out key items to my poor experience. Pay for parking 19. The manager here will claim that other hotels in the area also have pay for parking. it is worth noting that only about 20 of hotels in the area actually do not a valid excuse and it is much cheaper than 19. These other hotels also are closer to The Spectrum and downtown Irvine. Pay for breakfast 12. This was a surprise. I only got a bagel and yogurt from the breakfast bar and they charged me for the full buffet. I could have gotten a room service bagel and yogurt for half that price. Figure out that logic. No fridge microwave. I figure having the ability to save left overs would save me about 5 a day in meal expenses which is a fair assumption. Front desk staff does not know how to deal with people They either cluelesly smile and apologize and hand you cookies and water to make amends or just talk on the phone and look pissed off. Either way understand that if I need to tell you what is wrong when it is so obvious then you should not be in the hospitality business. There were a few other miscellaneous other things. They took towels we hung up despite the major drought you can hear every room turn on their shower in the AM. couch in the room looks like they got it from a craigslist curb alert there is a lack of modern amenities USB ports for charging the soap was mediocre and the TV channel guide was missing. On the other hand the beds were comfortable. All in all you are paying a hidden additional 36 per night.

However the DoubleTree by Hilton Irvine Spectrum is genuine and practically perfect. We stay here for many reasons. The rooms are immaculately clean comfortable and quiet. We always get a good nights sleep and whenever we see housekeeping they \u2019re always greeting us in a friendly manner and offering assistance. We recently stayed here for doctor visits and to combine this with our 20 year wedding anniversary. My husband was hospitalized under an emergency situation which left him in the hospital for a week. We live far away. When I returned to the hotel without my husband Dean from the lounge greeted me and she knew the absence of my husband was not a good sign. She took care of me and Julie Ceja greeted me as well and literally took the time to make certain I was okay and extended my reservation for me. Their concern was genuine needed and very much appreciated. We always look forward to seeing them upon our arrival. We love our drivers that shuttle us to the Irvine Spectrum for dinner. They \u2019re always glad to drive guests. Mario is a great guy at the desk along with many others that actively engage with us during our stay. Jose is amazing as he remembers what we like to drink and brings it to us with a few jokes and good humor. We also love Eleazar greeting us with delicious coffee and a lovely smile welcoming us to breakfast. The food is also excelentWe feel special at this DoubleTree which keeps us coming back.
