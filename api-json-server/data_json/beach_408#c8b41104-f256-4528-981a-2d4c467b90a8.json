For the price we were really expecting something and we were very disappointed. While the lobby is very grand the rooms are average at best. We were at a Mariot the night before and it was a much better hotel for 13 the price. The heated pools were too cold for the children to go into and one day we never received maid service despite being out of the room all day. The split bathroom was nice but it has been years since I have seen such a tiny tub in a hotel room. As we overlooked California Adventure the room was very noisy. I was surprised that they did not use better quality windows to cut the noise. Disney is definitely playing on their name and in my opinion they failed to deliver any value whatsoever on this hotel.

Let me preface with Things were rectified by the hotel credits food vouchers that were given to us for all our troubles. We are appreciative of that. In general I thought this was going to be a posh experience and it was everything but. For the price of 435 night the rooms were no better than the hotels that are 13 of the price over on Harbor Blvd. The room we got was no better than the Travel Lodge which I say with a heavy heart. I requested weeks in advanced and then at time of check in around 11 am for a early check in because I have 2 kids under 3yrs who needed naps before our dinner reservations in the park at 6 pm. We went into the park and waited and waited for them to page us that our room was ready I finally called after 330 and it STILL was not ready. So I lugged everyone back to the hotel so I could speak with a manager. We finally got our room but on the way walking to it the hotel hallways looked TERRIBLE as room service trays carts that looked as if they had been there ALL day and housekeeping carts littered the hallways and this was at 4 pm could barely squeeze my double stroller around all the clutter mess. Not the impression you want of a hotel that is supposed to be five stars. Kinda ridiculous. The room was ho hum. First thing I inspect is the cleanliness of the bathroom which had hair on the floor EW. Dust on the TV armoire dust clinging to the back of the bathroom light fixture which I could see reflected int he mirror. Sad. I called front desk to complain about the cleanliness of the room and also asked them to have bell service bring up our luggage. Waited 45 minutes and our luggage had still not arrived. Called Front desk again and complained to a supervisor who when gave us room credits for our stay and had bell service expedite our luggage delivery. After another 15 mins our luggage arrived and we barely had time to freshen up and make it back into the park for our 6 pm Dinner reservations. I feel that Disney is a kid oriented place the hotel should treat guests with children a little kinder and try to accommodate them as it is HARD to travel with small kids especially small children babies that require naps. The whole reason we choose The Grand Californian was because we thought we would be treated accommodated with top notch service. This did not happen. We are sad but next time we will just stay at the easier cheaper no muss no fuss hotels on Harbor Blvd.", "offset": [2361, 2464], "date": "2015-12-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "0ec9d6e2-eb8b-47a5-a05f-80bca2a19746", "sentence": "Location. The location absolutely could not have been beat and we had stay here again simply because of it. You could get everywhere you needed to go within five minutes. Staff were perfect as you would expect from Disney. Common areas and pools were wonderful. We had both dinner and breakfast at Storytellers and they were fine. For breakfast though I had recommend heading over to Goodys Kitchen at the Disneyland hotel. Much better selection and better characters. Our favorite part of our stay was on Earth Day when the hotel hosted a ladybug release. My kids were in heaven. The rooms however are pretty bad especially considering the price you pay. We stayed on the club level with a queen and bunk beds. My four year olds loved the bunk beds but our queen was so unbelievably uncomfortable that despite being exhausted at the end of each day we struggled to get a good nights rest. The worst part of the room though was the fact that we could never get hot water in the mornings. We took baths showers in the evenings and had plenty of hot water. Every morning it was barely lukewarm I had assume this was because so many people in the hotel were taking a shower at the same time but it was still unfortunate given how much we had paid for the room. The first night at turndown service the service was impeccable. They even tucked in my girls stuffed animals which they loved. From that point onward housekeeping and turndown were seriously lacking. Two dirty wine glasses were left in the room two days in a row. Overall it was bare bones service. A note on club level while it probably was not a great value the convenience was worth it to us and we would do it again. Breakfast was standard continental bagels croissants cereal muffins cheese etc but they always had fresh fruit and tasty offerings. We never made it back for the afternoon tea since we were always busy at the parks. Evening service consisted of cheese crackers fruits and veggies and two small hot aps. It was very convenient to always be able to grab drinks fruit snacks etc. whenever we needed them. We loved nightly dessert and the opportunity to watch the fireworks from the balcony on club level. The CMs in be club level were always so nice and accommodating. The club concierge on the other hand were less than helpful. We had planned to go to the beach on the last day of our stay and return to stay at the GC to prevent having to pack up and move elsewhere. After four nights we ended up checking out a night early and paying less elsewhere for an exquisite room with a comfy king size bed and hot water.

With its own entrance to California Adventure and a short walk to either the Disneyland main gate or Downtown Disney monorail station access to the parks is unparalleled. If you re driving there s valet or self parking and Disneyland Drive has its own exit off the I5 freeway. Highway 22 is only a few lights south for access to Long Beach and the PCHThis hotel offers more than just convenience though. Visually stunning Grand Californian is a large scale forgery of Yosemite s Ahwahne hotel and the Craftsman mansions of Greene Greene down to the bathroom tile details. The on site restaurants are excellent although they re geared more towards foodies than families and there are plenty of food choices at Downtown Disney as well. If you need a break from the parks the pols are great for both kids and adults and there s a spa and wine bar for more adult leisure. Service is uniformly excellent from the moment one drives up until you park your bags and drive away. The hotel also employs some nice tech arrive early and they l check you in and text you when your room is ready room keys also let you charge to your room from any gift shop or in park restaurant. Perhaps one of the nicest touches is the lobby piano. With all the constant commotion it s a welcome treat to sit by the piano and relax for a minute or two. The pianist will even take requestsThe guest rooms are larger than the average hotel s and exceptionally well designed. They certainly know their audience. The vanity and closet areas are extra large with plenty of space for things like luggage and toiletries. We got a room with bunk beds which aside from maximizing valuable floor space also prevents any of those he s kicking me arguments. Room was stocked with plenty of extra towels bed linens and there was even enough shampoo soap we ordinarily bring our own as backup. Consensus was beds were comfy without being squishy. Decor is a continuation of the Art Crafts style. At first i thought i d miss having a recliner but after going 17 hours at Disneyland i could ve fallen asleep on the sidewalk and it would nt have mattered. Yes we absolutely took advantage of that extra Magic Hour and went all the way til close. When we do Disneyland this family does nt mess around. Were it located anywhere else this would be a first class hotel so why only four dots. Just about the only negative is this hotel s sheer sprawl it s so frigin huge.

The Grand Californian just finished being renovated and the rooms are beautiful. I had say this hotel is great for twens adults. While the room does provide a stool for little ones to reach the sinks and now two sinks the beds are rather tall to get into and there is no bathtub at least not in our room. They made the rooms great for the convenience of plugging in multiple devices I think we counted 12 usb plugs and at least 6 regular so you can charge anything with a ton of counter space. A small refrigerator is also available and a pod coffee tea machine. There are multiple pols our girls used 2 of them often they are heated but one was warmer than the other but they still loved the slide in the cooler pool. Chairs etc are plush and comfy. The Hotel itself is beautiful lots of front lobby staff so do not let the long check in line worry you it is relatively quick. There is a very large lobby and a nice bar. Ask the bellhop where the easiest entrances and elevators are to get to the parks our bellhop gave us great tips on how to get to where we needed to goit is a rather large hotel and has an entrance to Downtown Disney and a direct entry to California Adventure. We used the CA entry often the line was usually shorter and sometimes it was easier to walk through CA and out to go to Magic Kingdom. The lines during magic hour do get very long. Be prepared to wait and go early they do move you quickly through but word of advice pack everything you need in clear plastic bags in your bag. They have to look through everything and are not allowed to unzip it takes time to unzip everything so clear bags work like a charm. You get searched every time you enter Disney property not each time you enter the parks through the normal main entrance so you can parkhop with out being searched. We used the Disneyland express bus to get there from the airport and it was very easy Once again the bellhops gave us tips on where to wait and which bus just to make sure we got on the correct one. The reason for 4 stars is if you do have a little one a tub would be nice and the beds being very tall. They had bunkbeds before and now they are gone so now kids share a bed. Also there was a kids club and I believe that is gone too. Our room was really nice and on a corner but directly across from the service entrance so every morning at 7 am and night at 10 pm we heard them open close up. Also directly above us was the club level and one night they rearranged something so needless to say we heard a lot of noise past 11 pm.

Over the past several years I have written a number of these \u201c practical review \u201d to Disney Hotels and considering the number of \u201c helpful \u201d votes I \u2019ve earned 195 on 5 reviews so far and the number of emails I have received from people asking for advice on their upcoming vacations I think it \u2019s fair to say I \u2019m pretty good at it. As such this review will be in the same tone. I will not drone on about how Disney is the most magical place on Earth and can do no wrong. Instead I am going to focus on the major points of Disney \u2019s Grand Californian Resort and Spa hereinafter GC in order to help anyone who chooses to read this be better informed before they spend a small fortune on a hotel room. This is the part where I normally tell readers to feel free to email me with questions about their upcoming trip to Disney World but as this was only my second trip to Disneyland as opposed to 50 to Disney World I do n\u2019t think I would have a ton of insight to give but if you want to ask me a question feel free. I \u2019m always happy to help or at least try. As per my previous posts this will be broken down into subsections for easier comprehension. Layout and ThemeDG has a woodsy National Park Lodge theme and it is done to perfection. I have stayed in over 30 Disney Hotels in Paris Orlando Anaheim and Oahu and I can say without a doubt this is the nicest most luxurious Disney Hotel I \u2019ve ever stepped foot inside let alone stayed at. All of the rooms are located within the same central building with interior corridors leading off of a main central atrium that rises the entire 6 stories as opposed to many of Disney \u2019s hotels wherein there are various out buildings housing guest rooms. There is one central elevator in the center of the massive and intricately decorated lobby that serves the entire hotel which made it very convenient to get to your room. However if you book a room with a theme park or Downtown Disney view it \u2019s going to be a long walk down these hallways to get to your room. Also I might add that GC has a private entrance to Disney \u2019s California Adventure Park that lets you walk in less than 100 yards from Sorin Around the World my Wife \u2019s favorite ride and this entrance is only for Disney Hotel Guests. So if you want to \u201c rope drop \u201d the park you will have an easier time staying at the GC than you would utilizing the main entrance as the number of people you will have to push through will be next to zero. As I \u2019l get into more below this convenience is about the only advantage to staying at a Disney hotel in Anaheim and it \u2019s not even that great of an advantage considering how close all of the \u201c good neighbor \u201d hotels are located to the parks. The GC also has a private entrance that puts you right in the middle of the Downtown Disney area which is only about a 200 yard walk to the main gate for Disneyland Park. StafI always through a section in about the staff in case any of their bosses are reading this just so they know the staff at the DC was perfect as we \u2019ve all come to expect from Disney employees with an extra special acknowledgement of whomever played Minie Mouse at the Storyteller \u2019s Caf\u00e9 Character Breakfast more on that belowDiningThere were several dining options at GC of which I only tried 2. Hearthstone Lounge is a bar but family friendly that is open for breakfast lunch and dinner as well as well as drinks. We had breakfast there and it was fine. Nothing special exactly what you would expect from a quick style restaurant. We also had dinner there and the pizza was large enough to feed the 4 of us with little difficulty. The lunch dinner menu was not particularly impressive but I think they are meant to be more bar snacks than an actual meal but either way it worked for us. We also ate at the \u201c. Mickey \u2019s Tales of Adventure Breakfast \u201d at the Storyteller \u2019s Caf\u00e9. This is your standard character buffet you will find in just about every deluxe Disney resort around the world. The food is exactly what you would expect from a buffet at a family restaurant for breakfast. Omelet chef Mickey waffles bacon eggs sausage etc. All in all the food was as good as can be expected. What made the meal for me and what justified the 1500 price tag for 4 people was the character interaction. This is the only character meal at Disneyland featuring Mickey Mouse. In fact it featured Mickey Minie Pluto Chip and Dale. I have been to every character meal offered at Disney World and I can say that I have never had a character interaction like we had with Minie Mouse. My almost 3 year old daughter talked about meeting Minie for weeks leading up to our trip. When we first got to Storyteller \u2019s Pluto came right up to us and my daughter had a meltdown crying her eyes out. I \u2019ve never seen her that scared in her entire life. So after my son almost 5 got to meet Pluto he moved on and here comes Minie. Again my daughter was terrified but Minie spent about 15 minutes with us getting closer and closer and trying to cheer my daughter up and by the time she left my daughter was hugging her. Normally you are lucky to get 1 minute with a character. She stayed with us for a full 15 minutes just to make my daughter happy. That ladies and gentlemen is why Disney is worth the money. As far as other dining options Napa Rose is the \u201c signature restaurant \u201d at GC. While I did not get to eat there not the kind of place you want to take a 4 and 2 year old I passed by it several times and was able to look inside and read the menu. If you can get past the price it looks like it would be a phenomenal dining experience. The RomThey were hotel rooms. There is n\u2019t much else to say about them. You \u2019ve got beds a shower and a toilet. You sleep and change there. That \u2019s it. I often read reviews where people complain about the quality of the room which I \u2019ve never really understood. The vast majority of all hotel rooms across America look pretty much the same. These seemed slightly bigger than a standard hotel room with a couch that transformed into a bed not a pull out it \u2019s hard to describe think of a Murphy bed meets a pull out so the room could actually sleep 5 people. Aside from that extra bed and the fact that the main beds 2 queens were elevated off of the floor enough that you could store your luggage underneath there was nothing special about the rooms. The PolThe pool looked pretty great but as it was only in the upper 60s when we visited we did not get to try them out. TransportationUnlike Disney World where there is dedicated transportation to get you anywhere on property you want to go everything at Disneyland is walking distance. As I said before GC has a private entrance to California Adventure Park and to Downtown Disney and the walk from GC to the Disneyland Park is no more than 300 yards. Also unlike Disney World there is no transportation from the airport to the hotel. You have to get there on your own. We had a rental car because Disneyland was only a small part of our trip so if you have a car it makes life easier but they will charge you 20 day for self park and 30 day for valet unles you \u2019re a Disney Vacation Club member staying on points which I was in which case self park is free valet is still 30 day. OveralOveral GC is without question the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed at. Everything about it was perfect. And with that said I absolutely recommend against staying here. It is not worth the 60night rack rate or an entire years \u2019 worth of your DVC points. There simply is n\u2019t the advantage of staying on site in Anaheim like there is in Orlando. Yes there are \u201c extra magic hours \u201d that let you into 1 of the 2 parks an hour early but absolutely nothing is open during that hour so basically you \u2019re just walking around an empty park staring at closed rides. If you \u2019re going to go to Disneyland there are plenty of chain hotel son Harbor Boulevard that are less than 1 mile from the gates of Disneyland and California Adventure the gates of the 2 parks are separated by what looks like a cobblestone football field for a fraction of the cost.

The walk in two story fo stone fireplace is literally over the top but compliments the visually stunning lobby and has a real fireplace inside with a bank of oak and leather pillowed rocking chairs from which to enjoy. The bank of identical childrens oak rocking chairs are too cute especially when full. It almost feels like an afterthought to mention the hotel has its own private entrance to the California Adventure amusement park because the hotel really stands on its own as something to see when in Anaheim.", "offset": [0, 125], "date": "2019-07-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "2ad1fcd6-11f9-4d49-87f9-3e30a758d234", "sentence": "AMAZING. Military discount too. Disney offers a 40 off rack rate for military folks. This is not a guarantee there has to be availability. Also when you make reservation utilizing the military rate Disney asks 2 questions1. Can you shop at a Comisary2. Can you be seen on a base for medical. On my own I do not rate this discount. I only served 4 years and am just a Vet. My husband is a retiree and I am his dependent so I am able to book a military rate. When you check in if you ca n\u2019t produce the dependent retiree or active CAC card the room rate reverts to original rate. That being said I am always grateful to Disney for taking care of those who have served. This gorgeous resort takes my breath away. At CHRISTmas there are no words to describe its beauty. Check in is first class commensurate with a 4 Diamond. The room is well appointed and super comfortable. The toiletries are divine. I loved the shampoo so much I bought a bottle in the gift shop. There is a Keurig in the room it is stocked with coffee tea and cocoa. In case anyone from Disney monitors this I just would like to comment thank you so much for providing a discount to those who are serving or who have served. My husband and I have stayed over the years at the Grand Disneyland Hotel Paradise Pier Aulani Poly Wilderness Lodge Coronado Springs POFQ Yacht Club and Beach Club. All bookings have been with the military rate.", "offset": [1191, 1356], "date": "2019-08-25", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "9a399c5c-3995-4768-9e96-87b3bb42debd", "sentence": "Magical Disneyland visit. On our first trip to Disneyland to celebrate our daughter \u2019s birthday we splurged on 3 nights at Disney \u2019s Grand Californian GC. We chose Club Level accommodations and were NOT disappointed. Because it was our first trip we also ended up spending 2 additional nights at a Good Neighbor hotel across the street and while that hotel was nice the Grand Californian offers that extra Disney magic touch which we missed when we left. At 70night during the off season Club Level at GC is expensive. Rooms are not guaranteed to be available until 4 pm. The trim itself was a nice size 2 queen beds a sofa \u201c daybed \u201d which when opened had an enchanting Bambi fresco painted on the wood. Our family of 3 fit easily comfortably in the space. The room had thoughtfully arranged storage spaces shelving in the bathrooms above below the sink beds high enough to slide suitcases under them. The shower had both a rain shower style head a wall mounted hand held wand making it easy to shower thoroughly rinse our little one. Club Level includes special concierge service access to the Veranda where food is served continuously all day starting at 6 or 630 depending on when the parks open. We ate breakfast lunch dinner there every day with the only exceptions being dining package reservations for Fantasmic Frozen World of Color Disney Princess Breakfast which were all worth it. These meals alone easily saved us 200 day in food expenses for a family of 3. The Veranda includes complimentary beer wine sparkling wine mimosas which we enjoyed saving us 9 13 per drink. You can take drinks back to your room sit on your balcony a small 2 seat space and enjoy an evening cocktail while you watch the sun set. As guests at GC we also enjoyed Extra Magic Hour at Disney \u2019s California Adventure DCA Disneyland a perk where guests of Disneyland Resort hotels get to enter the parks a full hour early. Using this perk Maxpas we were easily able to ride every single ride at the two parks multiple times a day yes including Radiator Springs Racers Space Mountain without EVER waiting in a standby line. Since there is direct access from GC to DCA Downtown Disney we were easily able to take midday breaks returning to the hotel for lunch. a nap so our little one never had a meltdown at the park. We had impeccable service from the valet bellhop services concierge services room service at every meal. While there are certainly Good Neighbor hotels within walking distance of the Disneyland that are more affordable the Grand Californian offered that intangible something extra that made our stay there feel magical. If we go back to Disneyland it is definitely where we want to stay.", "offset": [1908, 2107], "date": "2020-02-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}]}
