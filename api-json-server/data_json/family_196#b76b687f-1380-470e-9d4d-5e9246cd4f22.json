Several couples of family members stayed at the HYAT REGENCY BETHESDA MARYLAND for a weekend to attend a family celebration. The outside of the hotel the entrance lobby and the atrium look pretty attractive for a Hyat built 30 years ago but the real wear and tear of age and mediocre maintenance show up in the rooms bathrooms and breakfast area. Walls doors baseboards plumbing fixtures bathtub caulking etc. are way past the just fix it up point. The whole interior needs a major facelift badly. The furniture is old too massive in the style of the 1970s and scratched stained and in need of hardware replacement. The breakfast area seems to have been improvised more recently and squeezed into an odd shaped area dominated by the hotel bar. It is unattractive dingy and uncomfortable to eat in. All around we were disappointed to walk into a Hyat Regency that pretends to look like five star hotel from outside but offers three star accommodations inside.

We recently stayed for the three day Presidents Day weekend for a family event and to catch some sight seeing. We believe this hotel is perfect for all that you need or may want to do in the area.

The convenience of the Hyat and the Metro can not be understated. It is literally adjacent to the Metro stop. Saturday was Valentines Day and my husband and I took a break from all the family activity to have dinner in the Daily Grill 15 discount by showing room key. and then we enjoyed the in house Comedy Show for only 10 each. We find this hotel to be an excellent choice for its location but also I must mention the service. Every single person who works in this hotel is there to help you.

He was so flexible and patient during everything. We also worked closely with Yeta Price on room blocks who too went above and beyond to customize our rooms rates suites etc. Our guests were given a great rate for their stay which was very much appreciated by all. It made their experience for our wedding great too. The venue was perfect for our reception and we were able to add personal touches to everything. We also were able to work closely with the chef to pick a menu that worked for our tastes and that of our group.

The Hyat is conveniently located in Bethesda right above the entrance to the Washington Metro and close to an area with a large number of good restaurants and bars. Traffic in the DC Metro area is heavy none more so than around Bethesda so taking the Metro whenever possible is a great alternative. The Hyat is undergoing some major renovations. Most of the work is being done out of guest areas though part of the lobby area is curtained off. That in itself is not an inconvience with the exception that the entrance to the parking garage from the front of the hotel is closed. The Parking staff gave me a map with directions on driving around several blocks to park my rental myself. After 3 attempts I gave up and just did valet parking. Granted it was rush hour at the time so one did not have a moment to go slowly while trying to read the map and searching for the entrance. So much for that and the valet service was efficient and quick. I would however like to say I found all the staff that I came in contact with very helpful friendly and knowledgeable about things to do in the area. I would particular like to mention Hoskin who worked behind the bar in the evenings and the women who managed the breakfast area in the mornings. I did not get the name of the woman who worked weekday mornings but there was Mihret on the weekend. Both of whom was particularly helpful to all my family as they appeared at different times during the mornings. I should also mention that the prices for the rooms we rented were very reasonable and quite comfortable. We would certainly stay there again.

Stayed here while in the area for a soccer tournament Traveled with hubby and two teenagers. Yes the hotel is still in the final phase of renovation that focuses on interior common areas and the main entrance. Yes it is not as appealing to the eye in those areas. as one would prefer. HOWEVER the guest rooms are fantastic. Every room has been refurbished and they are beautiful Clean fresh well appointed. Absolutely zero complaints on that. The elevators are slow and some are under service with the renovation A little inconvenient but not unreasonable. Having to pay for parking is a definite thumbs down but there are ways to maximize your buck for the day if you plan on leaving returning the hotel several times in the course of a day. So be sure to ask the front desk representative to explain the 12 vs 20 fee. Also there is a public parking garage a block and a half away that is free on weekends and you do have that as an option although it is one of those hidden secrets that you only find out about from word of mouth of previous patrons so make note peeps. You can inquire for the garage location with the front desk but if you do not ask you may not find out.

To FAVORITE HOME for visiting DC. Not sure what it says about me that I am writing such a detailed hotel review when I have got much more important things to do but that is how much I love this hotel. I have stayed at this hotel 3 times in the past 9 months during its renovation and each stay has been marvelous. The only inconvenience to me from renovations is the lack of a way to buy certain small items for emergencies like Advil and chocolate. The 7 minute walk to Safeway can be too much when exhausted with a headache and cookie cravings after a long day. As for the renovation a tarp here or there a roped off area outside a closed off exit is no big deal. The rooms are IMMACULATE and spacious. Book a balcony suite and you are in HEAVEN with patio furniture and flower boxes. I have back trouble and wake up in pain at almost every hotel but not here. With each visit I notice improvements. This time I stayed in the least expensive room but there were more outlets USB plugs and seriously good lighting all placed EXACTLY where you want them. When was the last time all the plugs. outlets USB plugs lamps and lights worked PERFECTLY in a hotel room for you. The USB plugs charged everything fast too. Hot water was plentyful for a shower or a bath even on the 12th floor. What really makes this hotel great is the staff from Valet to Bellmen to Reception room service etc. These folks helped me when I was in desperate need of an umbrella for the day or helped me when carrying more than I could manage and encouraged me when I was in town on my own for some big stuff and had to navigate an unfamiliar area in the rain carrying all kinds of stuff. Room service is fast and the Miso Glazed Salmon from the Daily Grill is so good its all I ever order. Next trip I may splurge at the attached Mortons Steak House. My biggest fear is that when renovations are complete I will not be able to afford to stay here anymore. Meanwhile book a balcony suite when you can. Those are the BEST. If you are allergic to certain bedding request a hypoalergenic room. They say the rooms have down bedding. The label on my delightful blanket encased in cotton said 75 Feather 25 Down. Many people who think they are allergic to Down are only allergic to feather but this is a blend which is wonderfully firm and comfortable. I have tons of allergies but not to feather or down YEAH. so I LOVE the pillows and bedding here. One trip I had a room with 2 beds sharing with a friend with allergies. Housekeeping had her bed switched up in 5 minutes to hypoalergenic when we checked in. No problem. This hotel is so great there was a seriously awesome. Sure some small things could be better. I wish the windows opened on the non balcony rooms. Fresh air is nice sometime. Also all the rooms need to be checked for Do Not Disturb door signs. By my second visit I realized these were in short supply and guests swipe them from each other. Its kind of funny but confusing to housekeeping and people who do not need their room cleaned and want to nap. Anyone who has serious complaints about this hotel ran into an unusual situation or is the kind of person who loves to blow one small thing WAY out of proportion.
