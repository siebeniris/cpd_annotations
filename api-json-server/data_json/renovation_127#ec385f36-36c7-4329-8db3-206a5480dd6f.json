I have had bad stays and good stays over the years and this stay was very good. the breakfast is a marathon and at times it can get hectic with a lot of people jostling for the various foods. to be fair there is a very good selection of food although boiling your own eggs is hit and miss. Children seem to like the adventure of it. the reception staff this stay were excellent and the cleaning staff work very hard to keep the rooms clean and tidy I realise because of its proximity to the beach and sea this can be quite an onerous task. one gripe if I may I booked 3 executive rooms and I thought these may have been in the newly renovated part of the hotel but no they were along the main passage off the reception I had room 134 and I can assure Novotel that adding an extra small room and having bathrobe slippers and a coffee machine does not make an executive room even with a small free minibar. the rooms are a little tired and need new carpets mine was clean but with old stains they need new furniture the melamine was peeling off the drawers and the sofa just was too tired. so if you want to charge extra for an Executive room upgrade them and spruce them up. The food all round was good and the bar makes excellent cocktails. the price is a little high for a Novotel but I guess this is because of the location and its never stopped me. I would not really stay anywhere else in Le Touquet.", "offset": [1204, 1289], "date": "2015-07-31 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "855913c0-52b7-4bcd-a46b-b6b97e9f3d2c", "sentence": "The worst hotel in the world. I booked this hotel for the last night of our holiday and the pictures really sold it to me. boy was I disappointed. The exterior is very uninviting I was really starting to panic and thought I had made a wrong turn. Reception is bright and the receptionist was very welcoming however the smell of the pool area located just along the corridor was slightly off putting however on looking through to the restaurant the views were spectacular so all was forgotten and I thought we were on a winner. That was until I got to my romWhilst the room was as boked a queen with double pull out I am not sure where the pull out goes if needed as there is insufficient floor space. that is where my expectations ended. To be honest the room is like a prison cell with next to no natural light able to come in due to the rooms location in a corner my pictures were taken with all the lights on to try and get half decent images. The decor has seen better days but a coat of paint on the rough cast like walls would go a long way to freshen the place. Apparently French 4 ratings do not go for cleanliness and fresh decor. The bed. well what can u say the floor has more padding. There is no excuse for such poor quality. Yes I read the reviews before I came and the managers replies but I will always give a hotel the benefit of the doubt. On this occasion I wish I had not. With the prices you pay you expect much much better and I am sorry but the constant excuse of refurbishment pending does not cut it instead they need to take a more hands on approach roll up their sleeves and get involved. The hotel bedrooms reek of a manager not interested in that side of his hotel. The bar area is very small and when we went in there were several tables set for meals which u were discouraged from using another area reserved for a corporate group having a buffet so only 3 4 tables available. Service was very slow and when we finished our drinks no more were offered so we felt very uncomfortable and returned to our cells to await our meal time. The restaurant opened at 190 and we were shown to our table. I appreciate we were in France and the menu was in French but no staff member could assist us with our queries. It was down to another guest to help us. Despite this the main meal was first class. All around we saw amazing plates of food being delivered. Sadly I was disappointed with the dessert selection. The dessert buffet looked like it had been out for hours as some items were starting to droop. Needless to say I declined. My only other negative of the restaurant was that the floor had not been cleaned. There is no excuse for crumbs lying on the floor particularly when we have these modern things called vacumsAfter dinner there was nowhere to sit and chat. There was s singer in the unfriendly bar area. well I say singer but he sounded more like he was in pain so before 2030 I was back in my cell until morning surrounded by noisy families and slamming doors. Thankfully this quiet ended and I was able to sleep. In the morning I decided to brave the shower and as I was washing my hair I glanced up to find a long hair not mine attached to the tiles. I was at the point of no return but it gave me very dirty feeling. I was looking forward to breakfast after our excellent dinner. What a disappointment. The scrambled eggs were vile the sausages burnt and the bacon barely cooked and cold. The pastries were minute also and to honest were not that great. The only fruit juice on offer was orange something I can not drink as it makes me ill and the hot drinks were from a machine and the coffee was like dishwater certainly not worth the \u20ac 18 price tag. Thankfully when we complained at checkout they did not charge us as I then had to find somewhere else to eat. The whole experience was disgraceful and I will most certainly never use a Novotel again.", "offset": [1393, 1615], "date": "2015-09-25 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "bd8839e4-c6a0-4480-97be-6dd1712bcb6e", "sentence": "Ugly Building Lovely Location. On arrival we were upgraded to a sea view room as my husband has a platinum Acor loyalty card. The hotel is located right on the beach so having a balcony albeit a very small one with just enough room for 2 chairs and a small table but no room to walk past each other overlooking the beach and sea was much nicer than looking out onto the car park and dunes. It also meant we were able to open the door and window to the balcony for some fresh sea air at night. The hotel building is a very ugly concrete block although it does look a little better if you are looking at it from the beach. Although a number of things did not work in the room fridge bluetoth speaker and air conditioning it was comfortable with a good memory foam mattress on the bed a table and two chairs and a sofa bed. There was a kettle and two complimentary bottles of water. The bathroom with shower above the bath and separate toilet were perfectly acceptable. The d\u00e9cor was all very tired and a bit tatty and could do with a refresh. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel as \u20ac 18 each sounded far too expensive. We walked into the centre of Le Touquet for coffee and croissants \u20ac 810 for two of us. the first morning and bought fruit and pastries to have in our room the second morning. We had a drink in the bar on our first night. It is nicely located overlooking the beach. My husband received a free welcome drink as the Acor card holder. It would have been a nice gesture if I had been offered a drink too but it was very clear that the drink was for one person only. The car park was not very well signposted but it was free.

The room was small and average and it and the bathroom were definitely in need of refurbishment. It was over priced with the view from the room being the only saving grace. One reason for our stay here was that last year we had enjoyed a very good dinner in the restaurant. Unfortunately this was not the case on this occasion. The food was mediocre and one of the waiters in particular was totally uninterested and offhand. The dessert buffet has been discontinued and instead I was served a pana cota which was not set. Very disappointing. We felt we would have done better to go into the town to eat. Parking was extremely difficult. We were not sent the code for the barrier in advance although we had booked in online and there was a lengthy wait at reception before we could get it. No spaces were available and initially we had to park on the sand that had collected at the far end of the carpark.

As per previous reviews they tried to cancel the room 2 weeks before my stay even when they did that over the phone via a German call centre it was very difficult to understand what they actually wanted to do. I contacted the hotel directly which they confirmed it was cancelled and they could put me up in the Ibis which I did n\u2019t want. I then continued to email them and a few days later they said it might be open but could n\u2019t tell me until a few days before. Well I took the chance and turned up and I am really glad I didThey have a lot of building work going on around which apart from parking was n\u2019t an issue You just had to be careful where you got your bags out as there are a couple of steep steps and hill. I am sure this will all be changed soon though. So the bits which made me give 4 rather than 5 where as follows. The wait in the restaurant was just a little too long and slow and forgot a few things. The mess with the booking before we got there caused us a bit of decision making. We were in the furthest room away which was a little struggle with the bags as mentioned about the steps and hill. The building still needs to be updated in some areas. An easier way of getting to the beach apart from over the rocks or a walk around them. Our 12 year old was n\u2019t allowed in the pool on her own or with her sister without us going in. The bar was a bit soulless at night and closes at 1pm. Now the good bits. we got a balcony room with sea view the view was fabulous I think this is a must unles you do not have any time to look out of your window. It \u2019s great for catching the sun in the afternoon. The staff where friendly efficient and professional particularly the front desk ladies. The food in the restaurant was very good. The rooms have obviously been updated and include air con now and includes tea and coffee and fridge. You have a small but private beach area right outside the hotel veranda so the younger kids can play as you try and relax. Ours went down to the main beach and we could watch them very easily from the hotel. The beach area seems very safe. The gentle slop creates a massive beach area at low tide and even high tide seems really big and it seems to go on forever. As it \u2019s shallow it \u2019s also good for the smaller ones to paddle in. I have driven past Le Touquet a number of times now going down to Spain and having stayed in Boulogne Ibis aah. I am kicking myself I did n\u2019t drive 30mins further to this resort. I will defiantly go back to this hotel and will stay longer next time and explore the town.
