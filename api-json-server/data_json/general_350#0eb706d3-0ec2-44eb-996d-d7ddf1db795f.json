We booked this hotel for the week before the actual Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday. We stayed here for same period last year also. I think possibly the rooms are getting a little dated or just lack proper service. Our TV needed the technician to come to fix it as did our neighbors. Once I saw the reset button on the back needed to be reset I became my own technician. The A C did not work properly and could not cool the room. Technician came and fixed it right away as we were leaving to take a walking tour. We returned late in the evening and found the room had really cooled to be now actually cold so we moved the thermostatFrom 65 to 70 \u00b0 and went to bed. The next morning A C was still going and room just as cold. This time we shut it off and left for another walking tour. We returned later that day and found that you could not adjust the temps or shut the A C off. We passed this info on to the tech who came to fix the TV but we are leaving next day so I have no idea if it was ever repaired correctly. The service at the Mariot was superb as we have come to expect. The lounge is now on ground level instead of 28th floor. It was as expected well maintained with a very courteous staff. The hotel is obvious under renovation as signs are up regarding elevators being updated. This hotel is located where nearly all activities are walkable.

I will preface this review by saying that I am a Gold Elite Member and have been a long time Mariot advocate. My friends and I decided to explore New Orleans for the first time and chose to stay at the JW expecting a care free stay but that was not necessarily the case. I had 9 other friends joining me on this momentous occasion so we booked the largest bi level 2bd room suite along with 2 smaller rooms. After grabbing dinner at Acme Oyster House we got a text four five hours later. When we returned and got to our room I realize it was not the suite we booked. It only had one bedroom and a small living room area. This was really bothersome because no one at the front desk bother to mention this discrepancy. Only after I called did the staff mentioned that the 2bd suite that we reserved had AC issues and we were not going to be able to stay in the room. Additionally my friends room was accidentally double booked which allowed a stranger to walked into his room when he was gone and all of his belongings including his work laptop were left in the room. We met those people downstairs and luckily nothing was missing. The management team did a sufficient job making the situation manageable and sent a nice hand written apology. Unfortunately the experience left a bitter taste because I expected better service and organization for my friends.

Beautiful hotel located on Canal Street in the heart of New Orleans. I really wanted to give this hotel more stars but the information about their Executive Lounge on their website is misleading and when I brought it to the attention of the food service supervisor her answer was equally disappointing. Their website talks about world class luxury made available to Mariot Gold and Platinum members. It touts an honor bar inclusive of beer wine and spirits. And offers snacks and non alcoholic beverages throughout the day. I \u2019m here as I write this on a Saturday night and there is no honor bar. I asked the supervisor about it and her response was that it is only available Monday through Thursday when dinner is served. Mariot \u2019s website does not indicate that. As far as snacks are concerned they offer 5 mason jars full of bad candy and some empty ones as well. While these may technically be considered \u201c snacks \u201d the offering is awful and not worthy of the label of \u201c World Class Luxury \u201d. I \u2019m a Mariot Elite Member.

First let me say the facility itself is First Rate clean comfortable and the staff was very pleasant with one exception which I will describe later. Initially there was one foul up with the reservation that took some time to resolve. The group was forced to vacate the ballroom where the conference was being held because the hotel had booked a Wedding Reception on the same day in the same ballroom middle of the time period the women needed to have their meetings. This was slipped into the contract without informing her even though she had made it plain from day 1 that they needed the ballroom for the entire day. Clearly they thought they could slip it by her and then then bully her and in fact they did. because she had no other option at that late date. It was too late to find another suitable hotel so the had to compromise which put MUCH additional stress at least for my wife who was planning and organizing the event. The event began on Friday but my wife had gone down two days early to perform her duties as the event organizer. On Thursday she had left the room and then realized she had forgotten her purse. She returned to the room alone while another attendee waited for her in the lobby. Upon entering her room she saw a male member of the hotel staff dressed in a Mariot uniform standing on the other side of the bed with two towels in his arms. His name tag identified him as Carlos. He stated he was delivering two he room the two towels she had called the desk and asked for before leaving the room. He handed her one towel and refused to relinquish the other. Seeing something dark beneath the second towel she asked what it was. Looking over at her purse the zipper was open and her black coin pouch was missing. She demanded he return it to her and she then pulled it from his hand. Peeking into her purse again she also observed an envelope with several hundred dollars was also missing from her purse. She demanded that money back and after first denying he had it she snatched the towel and the envelope came tumbling out. Carlos left begging and imploring her not to turn him in. She informed him she was in fact calling the front desk immediately. The desk did not answer the phone so she phoned her friend who notified the desk of what had happened. Hotel Security did respond but to the best of our knowledge Carlos was long gone. I am a former policeman. I shudder to think what may have transpired when she encountered a member of the hotel staff who is also thief in her room while she was all alone.
