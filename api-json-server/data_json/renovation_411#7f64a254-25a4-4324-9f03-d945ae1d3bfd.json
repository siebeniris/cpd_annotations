There was lots of light and a nice fireplace a wine refrigerator that was appreciated a large and modern bathroom. A bottle of wine was placed in our room and the morning breakfast is huge and tasty. We were able to stay healthy with a custom made egg omelet and lovely fruit. Their pastries are made in house and worth the splurge. In the afternoon is a nice tea service that will sustain you until dinner. The bed was comfortable. I would recommend this for a little retreat.

I stayed at this property for four nights with my wife on an annual vacation to NoCal wine country. It is our fifth stay at this property and our experience spans the recently completed renovation of all guest rooms. Vintage Inn is located just to the northern end of Yountvile adjacent to the French Laundry gardens and the St Helena highway. The hotel grounds are self enclosed gardens in and of themselves and lend the property a secluded and quiet feel. Downtown Yountvile is a quiet and delightfully smaller version of local wine country towns mostly focusing on restaurants rather than shopping. TripAdvisor folks will know that there are multiple excellent eateries in town with two of them TFL and Bouchon owning Michelin stars and TFL long considered one of the finest in the nation. While the old version of the Vintage Inn was completely fine the renovation has tastefully upgraded the comfortable french country vibe with upgrades to furniture fixtures and most importantly the bathrooms. Within that category there are differing bathroom layouts some have jacuzi tubs with a integrated shower that is a little awkward to use others have a very large dual use shower setup that is to my mind superior. All rooms as well as the common area are very well appointed impeccably clean and quiet. Parking is directly behind the hotel and accessible via a short walk through the grounds. Food offerings are worth discussing in detail as each morning Vintage offers a large buffet brunch that includes a mimosa bar an omelette station and on the weekends a waffle station as well. The food is of very high quality and there are multiple hot and cold choices on offer including fresh fruit bread muffins pastries and cheeses. The buffet is included in the rate and thus provides excellent value especially as a base meal from which you can attack the wineries up and down the valley. There is an afternoon tea in the main lobby if you are so disposed with more pastries and small sandwiches that is also included in your rate. I have always found service at Vintage to be at the superior level. From reservations to room needs to concierge service to housekeeping customer service is attentive friendly and willing. There also seems to be very little turnover in the core staff signaling a positive workplace with attention to detail our annual chats with Carlos at the omelette station for example are becoming a bit of a tradition. Check in is always friendly and breezy despite the fact that we are sometimes arriving very late at night after a cross country flight from IAD and subsequent drive up from SFO. One tiny complaint this year Vintage switched from in room Nespreso machines to in room Keurig machines. While this is clearly a matter of taste I preferred the coffee made by the former and despise the coffee made by the latter. Feel free to attach firstworldproblems to this whine and if it matters to you Bouchon Bakery makes excellent coffee less than a block down the street. I unreservedly recommend this hotel to all travelers heading to wine country. Given the quality of the rooms food and service I had even call this a bargain despite NY SF DC level pricing especially when you factor in the included breakfast brunch. We have yet to experience anything other than a delightful experience at this property and look forward to our next visit in December 2016.", "offset": [844, 1051], "date": "2015-12-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "e6eda3b8-5fe0-4f8e-b52c-be1abc748b00", "sentence": "Great Stay.

I will reiterate the that service across the board remains excellent. Its worth noting that the Vintage Inn and sister propoerty Vilagio were recently purchased by a large commercial developer property company. I understand that Vilagio is in great need to refreshing. The Vintage will benefit from a revamped lobby lounge area and pool area. While these areas are decent now they will surely be quite improved following the winter renovation. Hopefully they will also spruce up the fitness room which is the one area I found to be sub par for a top resort. if you are planning a winter visit to the property I had check on the level of service ambiance disruption during the renovations. Side note. One somewhat unpleasant surprise this visit was the number of families with kids at the property. I have kids and adore them but I do not go to wine country to hang out with them. I am mystified that people would choose to bring their kids to Napa seems like there are many far better kid friendly choices.

I stayed at the Vintage Inn for four nights last week. Prior to this visit I stayed there both while I was single and married for a total of five or six times. The reason that I stayed at the Vintage Inn in the past is that it seemed to offer a lot for the money. That is most certainly no longer the case. In fact I would say that it is a very poor value. To start there are some positives. The location is fabulous. The rooms have recently been remodeled. The bathroom is lovely. The rooms are quite large. However there are some weird parts. The makeup mirror has been placed at a level only a really short person could use. The really nice Nespreso machines have been replaced with Keurig machines cost cut. Before leaving I checked the website to see if they still used LOcitane products in the bathrooms. The website said that they did. That is simply not true. Two months ago the hotel changed to Espa. Seriously. The website still has not been updated. Yet another example of cost cutting. As for the fabric on the new love seat and the chair. Shiny cheap velvet that looks like it should be in a 1970s disco. Speaking of cost cutting the breakfast. Each and every time I stayed at the Vintage Inn a big part of the attraction was the fabulous breakfast. omelet station cured meats cheeses different quiches boiled eggs smoked salmon with all the fixings bacon and sausage berries etc. Oh how the mighty have fallen. I have described the current breakfast offerings to my friends as Hampton Inn esque slop. The omelet station is gone because of construction there are none of the other items I just listed and the replacements are awful industrial scrambled eggs sausage gravy with cold biscuits bad fruit. It is just awful. I asked if I could go to the Vilagio for their breakfast wrongly assuming that the construction was the only cause of the lack of nice choices and was told I could go there. Notice the hotel did not inform me that I could go there for omelets I had to ask. Well the Vilagio which has the same owners has the same Hampton Inn esque slop. It is such a disappointment after knowing what the previous owners served for breakfast. A new guest may not find it so awful but any guest of the old owners will be sorely disappointed. Yet another example of the new owners cost cutting. On our third day we just went across the street to Bouchon Bakery for breakfast for which we paid 250. This should not have to be done when you are paying for breakfast as part of your hotel cost. Now onto the construction. I made my initial reservations online with the hotels website. I called at least twice to make changes to the reservations. Neither on the website nor over the phone was I ever notified of the construction that is affecting the property. The property is partially surrounded by chainlink fence covered in green mesh the pool is being rebuilt and the lobby is gone. Because of the construction you have to either walk down the street in your swimsuit and coverup to use the Vilagio pool or drive there. The website states that the Vintage Inn has a pool. That is simply not true. The breakfast which was previously in a large part of the lobby is now in a separate building next door. For this I paid 48 for two of my four nights. In no way was it worth this. I was told that an email should have been sent to me about the construction. Well they never sent it to me and they have never updated their website to inform guests about the major construction that is going on until July August. The hotel has been bought by a private equity hotel group Thayer. Thayer has made many many cost cuts. Besides the cost cuts they fired many of the employees by letter and then rehired them two days later. If someone from management is reading this review they might ask themselves well why did not she say something when she was checking out. The reason I did not is because upon checkout no one asked how my stay was. I certainly would have told them that the lack of notification about the construction the lack of a pool the poor poor breakfast and the downgrade of amenities made me regret staying there and spending what I did.

Like many we appreciate the wonderful food people and atmosphere that make this town a gem in the heart of the Napa valley. The Vintage Inn held a special place in our hearts as a centerpiece in our experiences here and this review is as much an epitaph for what was as it is a complaint about what is. The hotel used to be a beautiful property with a sort of French countryside feel. Fresh lavendar growing and beautiful flowers leading up to the lobby. The rooms were charming muted and tasteful. I found our renovated room to be gaudy and tastelessly decorated with cheap looking modern furniture out of place against the natural tone of the hardwood floors. The sanguine notes of Vivaldi in the lobby have been replaced with brash and out of place hip hop music at an elevated volume. Gone is the welcoming and civilized classical music and impressionist paintings on the television after turn down service. The hotel used to set out a free bottle of wine in the room and some nice espresso and cream. Now there is SERIOUSLY wait for it. Coffee Mate to go with your espresso and upcharged bottles of booze set out for consumption. Wow how luxurious and refined. Forget the subtleties of wine tasting and fine food hand me that bourbon bottle and get down to business. How about a nice shot of espresso. Ah but wait lets add some coffee mate to remind you that you never really escaped the corporate money crunchers back in the city. that here too the bean counters rule the choice of coffee condiments forcing you to choke on liquid rubber instead of sipping some honest cream or half and half. Perhaps the bourbon is profered for a fee as a sort of gargle to get rid of the taste of the chemical creamer. One may never know what evil lurkes in the shadows of corporate board rooms when such decisions are made. We were looking forward to observing the changes in decor and were sorely disappointed. Tacky is the best adjective I can conjure. Once settled in to the room we noticed the tub was stained with dirty water and the jets appeared to have mold like stains. gross. Apparently in the haste to finish all the renovation no one bothered to clean our bath tub. Priorities. Toiletries used to be lOcitane. now some brand I have never heard of flowers in the front of the property replaced with lifeless twigs almost a perfect allegory for the death of the soul of this place. A resort fee is now assessed so be prepared to pay alot more than the advertised price for the room. No omelette bar anymore. Ah no stone or egg left unturned by the bean counters. If I did not know how great this place could be in fact how great it was then these aforementioned affronts might not bother me so much but alas I was here when word of mouth meant something when business seemed built on trust and repeat business rather than bloated reputations one time visits from foreigners and mass advertising. In summary I observed nothing in my last experience that justifies the exorbitant fee to stay there compared to the days of yore. I am shaking the dust off my feet and moving on. At least we will have memories of how it used to be when it was just the charming little Vintage Inn. if you were here then then you know of what I speak.

My wife and I spent two nights at Vintage House on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and it was our second time at this hotel. Although we had a good trip we were disappointed that our stay was not nearly as good as last time when the hotel was still Vintage Inn. We concluded that the renovations and re branding from Vintage Inn to Vintage House do n\u2019t really add much to the experience and we were disappointed to find that several amenities have been cheapened or completely removed since our stay two years ago. Despite this since the property is nice and the location in Yountvile is perfect it may still be worth considering. Arrival Experience Since we had such an exceptional stay when the hotel was still the Vintage Inn and we fell in love with the town of Yountvile almost instantly on that previous trip we did n\u2019t even think twice about booking the property again this time especially since we received an email offer with a very good discounted rate for repeat guests. We were excited to arrive at the hotel and see what changes had been made to transform the French country Vintage Inn into the more modern Vintage House. The main lobby building looked totally different from before with a newly whitewashed brick exterior a sleeker and more modern feel and now even valet parking and a doorman features that were n\u2019t present last time we were there. The interior of the lobby was all new now larger and more open with a modern aesthetic in white gray and purple tones. My wife and I were both impressed when we saw the new lobby since it definitely had a more substantial feel than the previous one. Although the old lobby was cozier it was too small so we liked the new expanded space. The friendly staff stood out to us on our last stay and they still seemed nice this time. We had less interaction with staff on this trip but the doorman was really friendly every time we entered or exited the lobby and the front desk staff member who checked us in was nice welcoming us back to the hotel and offering lots of information including a discount card for certain local wineries. I think it would be helpful to let guests know about the wineries where they can obtain discounts in advance as it would be good information to know at the earlier planning stages of a trip. We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around noon and were excited to find out that our room was ready early so that we could get settled in before an afternoon of wine tastings. Room On our last stay we booked a basic Deluxe King room and had an excellent room in one of the closest buildings to the lobby overlooking the pool. We were hoping for something similar this time especially because we were staying midweek when the hotel did n\u2019t seem overly crowded. We booked the same Deluxe King room again and we were given a room on the second floor of one of the buildings further from the lobby overlooking the parking lot and busy Route 29 Room 605. We ended up being very disappointed with our room location. The way the buildings are set up they are scattered on the hotel \u2019s property between the main street of Yountvile Washington Street and busy Route 29 which serve as the boundaries of the property on either side. Parking is all along the back of the property on the Route 29 side which is what our room faced. It was disappointing to have a bad view of the parking lot and also to be so close to Route 29 which made our room quite noisy at all times of day and night. Even though we booked a basic Deluxe Room which are billed as being on the edges of the property we thought there had to have been a better room in that category especially at a time when the hotel was n\u2019t full. In fact when we \u2019d walk around the hotel at night or early in the morning it was particularly obvious that many rooms were empty because the housekeeping staff would leave rooms fully lit with TVs on overnight basically prepared for new guests at all times. This seemed odd and wasteful and we saw rooms remain empty our entire stay but always with lights and the TV on. We were excited to see what the newly renovated rooms looked like especially since we felt that the rooms were in great condition two years ago before any renovation. The rooms do have a lot of nice features like hardwood floors a very large balcony a wood burning fireplace and lots of windows on all sides for natural light. However we were a little surprised at how little the room d\u00e9cor had changed for a hotel that has supposedly undergone renovations and re branding. From what we could tell all they had done since our last stay was very cosmetic. They replaced the area rug on the floor swapped in a new armchair and settee and added some new lighting and artwork along with painting the natural wood paneling on the ceiling white. None of this really made much difference aside for removing some of the original character and going for a more streamlined and modern look. However since the exterior of the buildings and grounds still have such a classic and cozy look and the rooms still have warmer colored wood floors and an older stone fireplace the room just ended up looking mismatched even though it was nice. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you \u2019l probably find the rooms to be nice but for those who have it was a little bit of a letdown. We liked it before and do n\u2019t think anything has improved. If anything some of the charm was actually removed and there \u2019s a bit of an identity crisis. It \u2019s unclear what theme or feel they \u2019re going for even though the previous d\u00e9cor was very clearly meant to be a cozy French country feel throughout. The bathroom was one of our favorite parts of the room last time. During that stay we had a huge bathroom with an enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family with two separate showerheads at either end of the shower. Disappointingly instead of having the same type of shower our room this time had a deep jetted jacuzi tub which we did n\u2019t have much interest in using and which also doubled as the shower. It was such an odd shower setup since it was so deep to get into and it was so open with shower water getting all over the bathroom while showering. It was also clear that the tub was n\u2019t meant to double as a shower since the way the showerhead was placed you would have to stand right on the tub drain in order to be under the water. It made for an awkward shower experience and all we really wanted was the shower back from last time. Beyond the shower the bathroom featured a large vanity with double sinks and plenty of storage for toiletries underneath or on the counter. The previous L\u2019Ocitane toiletries that we liked were replaced with new ones that were uninteresting. The bathrooms generally do have a nice look with white subway tile and natural stone floors that feel updated but this was already in place before the renovation. Some other features of the room are great such as the wood burning fireplace that is easy to operate with a log and matches ready to go. We also appreciated the twice daily room cleaning with turndown service with delicious Kolar chocolates. It was also nice that a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room when we returned from dinner on the first night a nice bottle from Hill Family Estate along with a note thanking us for returning for another stay. All rooms used to contain a free bottle of wine upon check in so I \u2019m not sure if we only received one this time because we were return guests. Despite having a bad view and highway noise our balcony was pleasant and large with new outdoor furniture to go with the modern theme which included a modern swing and daybed. I would recommend requesting a room on the second floor since it gets you vaulted ceilings which contribute to a feeling of spaciousness. The only negative to the second floor is that there are no elevators so you \u2019l have to carry all luggage up the exterior stairs to get to the room. Another thing I would note is to be aware of which blinds are open in your room. The hotel is designed with all exterior corridors as well as each room having windows on multiple sides which is really nice for getting plenty of natural light. However it also means you might find something like a big window in your bathroom directly overlooking an exterior corridor where others could walk by. Despite being a little disappointed with our room I do appreciate that the rooms here feel more like a comfortable guest room in someone \u2019s home not a generic hotel room. The buildings have character and the rooms clearly are not all the same since we had totally different room shapes and sizes between our two stays. If we returned I would be more specific in requesting the room features we prefer. Grounds Amenities Location. The grounds at Vintage House are wonderfully park like and pretty. There is essentially one main courtyard in the middle that most rooms open onto which features well manicured landscaping and fountains. It \u2019s a small enough property that you can walk from one end to the other in about two or three minutes and all rooms are relatively convenient to the main parking lot that runs behind the property on the Highway 29 side. Being in Yountvile is a huge bonus of this hotel. Yountvile is perfectly cute with great restaurants shops and tasting rooms within walking distance. Vintage House is right in the center with world renowned restaurants like the French Laundry less than a block away. Other Thomas Keller restaurants that we enjoy such as Bouchon and Ad Hoc are also in very easy walking distance. The hotel is technically part of something called the \u201c The Estate \u201d which is essentially just Vintage House its sister hotel Vilagio that \u2019s down the street and the V Marketplace shopping area that is between them. In addition to liking the quaint feel of Yountvile we find Yountvile to be particularly convenient for visiting wineries. When driving up either the Silverado Trail or Route 29 the main concentration of wineries does n\u2019t really begin until you hit Yountvile and the towns going north. As far as amenities there is an outdoor pool and hot tub. The pool area is attractive but we did n\u2019t have time to use it. It \u2019s located right outside of the lobby and appears to have been renovated with new seating in keeping with the modern aesthetic. There were also fire pits by the pool at night that looked nice. The spa for the hotel is over by the Vilagio which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. It looks very nice from walking by but we have n\u2019t had a chance to try it. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t have a restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are so many highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. However a complimentary breakfast is offered to all guests each morning. This was another area where we were very disappointed in changes that have been made since our last stay. The breakfast used to be offered in the lobby but when we were there it was in the Groezinger Estate House building on the end of the property by the lobby which appears to normally be some sort of event space. We were told they were having the breakfast there because Vilagio guests were coming to Vintage House for breakfast while their lobby is under construction. I thought the space itself was nice for breakfast still decorated in the old French country look we preferred and offering lots of tables in a couple of different rooms as well as outdoor seating. A huge thing we loved about the hotel last time was that there were multiple hot options at breakfast each day including really good biscuits and gravy as well as a made to order omelet and waffle station and local champagne and various juices to make your own mimosas. It used to be a very sumptuous buffet for one that was included in the room rate. This time we found that the buffet selections had gone downhill significantly. The omelet waffle station is gone and the number of hot items offered is down to one each day it was some sort of quiche our first day that was cold and then scrambled eggs our second day. The make your own mimosas are gone and they \u2019re now instead selling them for 12 each along with coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos for a fee. Other than one hot item per day the breakfast now basically just includes a selection of pastries as well fresh fruit yogurt and charcuterie a relatively simple continental breakfast. Maybe I was just annoyed about the changes but I thought the pastries even went downhill from last time. I recalled them being very high quality but found them to be relatively basic and unremarkable this time. It \u2019s nice that breakfast is included but it \u2019s become the style of one you \u2019d find in a very basic hotel not one of this class. It may be presented nicely in a nice space but it \u2019s nothing special beyond that. We were also disappointed to find that the hotel no longer offers afternoon tea. Last time we enjoyed stopping in the lobby in the afternoon for some lemonade tea cookies and scones which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. There was no mention of this feature this time and we saw no evidence of it so I assume it \u2019s been yet another fatality of the \u201c upgrade \u201d from Vintage Inn to Vintage House. Overall I know we had a bunch of complaints but overall we did have a nice enough stay at Vintage House and a great trip to the Napa Valley. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you will probably like this small hotel that is well maintained and in a great location. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. However as past guests we were expecting to come back to find the same level of quality if not better knowing that the hotel had been renovated since our last stay. Instead we found a hotel that has definitely not decreased its rates but has definitely decreased what it offers guests. While I left last time ready to recommend this hotel to anyone going to the area I would be more hesitant this time. The rates are far from cheap for a hotel that seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis with very few of its unique extras left. Next time we will probably try somewhere new. Changes have taken an exceptional property and made it much less remarkable. To earn loyalty in a town with so many great options Vintage House needs to up their game or very simply restore some of the services they had in the past.", "offset": [304, 556], "date": "2018-11-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "78140dd3-1fbe-4a34-ba87-0cee241808dd", "sentence": "Hot tub is under repair.

I had been looking forward to staying here for many months. My new husband and I decided to make the jump and spend 120 for 3 nights at the hotel after our wedding. Upon entering the room was beautiful. When I entered the bathroom there were very small stains of blood on the outside of the tub. As if that was not surprising enough the entire wall under the window had pink mildew there was roughly 15 feet of black mold surrounding the caulking on the tub and cobwebs that I quickly cleaned myself. Not wanting to have this experience muddle our mini moon we very quickly changed for dinner and alerted the front desk staff of the situation and asked for the bathroom to be cleaned. No bigie. When we returned from dinner I asked the receptionist what came of the room cleaning. The very kind valet said oh it is fine I took care of it. Slightly puzzled when we re entered the room we noticed that someone had scraped off the caulking entirely leaving most of the scraped off bits inside the tub. Okay. so they tried. Pink mildew was still adorning the side of the shower area. I would have hoped that the manager would have called us to apologize and explain themselves a bit but that did not come until the next day after wine tasting. I expressed my dismay and did not really ever hear an I am sorry. I guess I just expected more. 2 nights later we were greeted with a bottle of champagne and strawberries to celebrate our wedding and the manager also paid for drinks at the restaurant next door which was an effort that was kind in gesture but did not really address the problem. I am more of a just admit you messed up say your sorry and let us move on. We received the third night free due to a promotion the hotel was having so I am assuming they knew that and were not willing to reduce our rate further. Needless to say we were underwhelmed by the experience at this hotel. With SO MANY other amazing options in Yountvile this will be the first and last time we stay at Vintage House. Huge disappointment as I said before I was very much so looking forward to this trip. I will say that the breakfast each morning was divine. However now that I think about it we were also left stranded without towels in the jacuzi for about 30 minutes after asking for someone to bring towels. Sigh. I almost forgot about that. This place is just not what I would expect for that price tag. The grounds seem old walkways are very 80s and so is the landscaping.", "offset": [350, 554], "date": "2020-01-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}]}
