Checking in was painless and Star was very helpful in fact all the staff are very helpful and friendly. The cable was down to a few channels one evening so they let us check out dvd movies for free. The place seems newly remodeled I read some earlier comments. There was no noise or construction at all. We stayed on the 4th floor of the Veranda Building. We had a 1 bedroom 5 room suite with a balcony. There is Fast Wireless internet for a fee 15 for 10 days or 5 per day. Gamerom exercise room swimming pools gas BQ area hot tub free laundry self serve video rental business center and more. We are no stranger to Condominium rentals and this place is high class and 5Star. Lastly they were just a few minutes drive to Disney Seaworld Universal Kisime Bass Pro and more.

Visiting with family the weekend of December 15th for UCF Graduation with a total of 6 adults. We stayed in the Veranda complex. Accommodations were quiet very clean and comfortable. We were placed in a 2 room split on the 4th floor King w sofa bed full kitchen 2 queen beds kitchenette both units with full baths. This was great for us. At times my Mother in Law was able to rest in the smaller room while the rest of us visited and watched TV in the larger room. We tended to eat any meals in the king suite as the table sat 4 and the bar sat 2. Grounds were well manicured and maintained beautifully. At check in they had such beautiful and simple Christmas decorations and Roxane was so nice and helpful. When we return to go to the parks we will be visiting again.

We loved the setup of the resort the layout and design of the rooms. Service is excellent resort is very peaceful and quiet. Room really felt like home with the simple American style furniture. Parking is available safe box in the lobby with 2 keys felt it was safer than the ones you get in the room. We faced a bit of an issue small tiny ants were in the room mainly kitchen and toilet. We asked Mgt to sort it out so they sprayed couple of times. When the ants seemed staying MGT moved us to another room. For the inconvenience caused they offered us free internet for 2 devices which was a nice gesture. For us location was nice as we rented a car. Supermarket Petrol station restaurants are all 3 minutes away driving distance. Reception and lobby are relatively small but very cozy.

Well let us get the negative out of the way1. The kitchen is incredibly small. Room for one. Very small counter space.

They promise a nice breakfast if you visit their sister resort stale danish wrapped in cellophane and a small cup of juice. On the bright side we got Epcot tickets for two for half the admission price. Whew. That was it. Now on to everything that was wonderful. When we drove up to the resort it was everything I expected a southern resort to be. It was beautifulThe staff was wonderful and friendly when we arrived. Our room was much larger than any place I have ever been. You walk into a formal foyer. Off the foyer to the left is the second bedroom. It has two double beds and a bathroom attached. There is also a nice television in the room. There is a beautiful private balcony that looks down on the pool. To the right of the foyer is the main living area living room dining room and kitchen. The couch is extra long and a hide a bed and the chair is comfortable. There is a private porch from this area as well. It would be a tight fit to have 8 people in this living area. but if you are there only to sleep it would work well. As I said the kitchen is VERY small but has all the normal things dishes pots pans etc. Off the main living area is the very private master bedroom with a king sized bed chair and television. There is another bathroom off this area. This is a little off the normal review but the towels were the softest towels I have ever had at a resortThere is a playground volleyball court swimming pool hot tub pool table air hockey and a common movie room. This is a beautiful resort that is only 10 minutes from all of the resorts. We took Uber to Epcot total cost 24. If we drove our car parking would have been 20. It was only 4 more to have curbside serviceThere is a grocery store down the road call Publix.

I came as a guest to this resort with a family member who was an owner. I was glad to experience this as an owner because it brought up questions that my husband and I will be asking going forward. The suite was a very spacious 2 bedroom 2 full bathroom condo. A full kitchen with all of the utensils and seasonings you would need to prepare a simple meal. There are pools a tennis court and barbecue grills on site. More than all of the amenities that you would need. My needs were wifi. It was available but you needed to pay 49 per day per device. Is that standard. I will find out before deciding to purchase on my own. It was never the case in the past. To be fair I never experienced this resort before and never as an owner. Maybe my relative bought a cheaper package. Also there were no washer and dryer in the suite. They were available free of charge in a community area on separate floors. No thank you. I do not know why this bothered me so much I am not washing clothes on this trip. The last thing that I was shocked about was the lack of eating facilities. No continental breakfast or the ability to buy breakfast on site. Previously when I have stayed at other timeshares as a potential buyer there was always breakfast served or an eating facility on site You have to leave the community. I unfortunately do not want to cook in the spacious kitchen. This is a beautiful property though. Very quiet and well taken care of. A perfect retreat or get away.
