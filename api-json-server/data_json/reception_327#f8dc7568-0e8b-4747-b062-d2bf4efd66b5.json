First night our good old neighbors were blasting their tv so loud our room was shaking there was constant fighting which I do n\u2019t know if it was due to the people or the movie. Went to front desk to ask if we could switch rooms and they said the people were checking out that day. Okay fine. Then called to say they asked them to check out early due to the inconvenience. They only had an hour left before they had to check out but I appreciated the gesture. Second and third mornings I discovered room 21 is right next to the cleaning ladies who scream their good morning conversations to each other right in front of our room waking us up in kind of an annoying manner with more screaming and yelling every morning. Cute place but thankfully it \u2019s our last night. If room 21 is offered do n\u2019t take the cleaning staff is in their defense and just doing their job. But try to have some respect for ur guests who are tired after long days of sight seeing and surfing. All in all not worth the 159 charged us per night.
