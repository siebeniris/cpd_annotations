The hotel is conveniently located on E Ohio Street not far from the river and the Mag Mile which are all withing walking distance. Lots of restaurants and shops in the area. If you book through Hilton Honors you get free wi fi in the room. Our lakeview room was wide clean and quiet. Unfortunately you only get a glimpse of the lake so it is not probably worth the extra money you pay for the view. The staff generally speaking were always kind and smiling. The cookies you get at check in are always a nice gesture. The only issue we had was with a young and probably unexperienced trainee upon check out. We had received an invoice for minibar items that we had not used. When we asked for clarifications he said that we should not worry because we would not be charged and everything was fine but he in fact gave us a receipt stating that we did owe the hotel money for said items. As we pointed out the inconsistency between said invoice and what he told us and asked for some written confirmation that we would not be charged he firmly refused to do so. Moreover since we arrived one day later due to a flight cancellation and our booking was pre paid and non refundable at check out we asked for evidence of our late arrival to confirm that we had in fact lost a pre paid nights acomodation so that we could provide it to airline company for full indemnification. The guy said that the booking was pre paid and that the hotel was not supposed to issue any further invoice or document as everything was handled directly by the Hilton central booking system. He brusquely told us to contact at our own cost of course a Hilton US number and ask to speak with a specific member of the hotel administration who was in charge of these issues. We immediately called that number and were put on hold. When we finally could explainthe situation we were told that the required member was not working on that particular day was not the hotel desk supposed to be aware of that. but that they would put us in touch with somebody who would solve our problem. You can imagine our surprise when our phone call was forwarded to the very same trainee who was standing right in front of us who did not even apologize for wasting our time and money on a useless intercontinental phone call to a staff member who was not even on duty on that day. When we dared point this out to the trainee his reaction was unapologetic uncaring and in short very unprofessional. That was the only downside of an otherwise lovely stay at that hotel.

We called again and eventually got some kind of pillows but they were still super thin2. Fox Sports 1 does not work. They have the channel but it constantly says no signal. We have small kids and hoped to have watched the USA Argentina soccer match in our room versus in a local bar. After 2 calls and a stop at the front desk 3 4 hours before the game was to come on they could not get it working. For a hotel of this price to not be able to get its channels working is ridiculous3.

The hotel is well located but looks a bit tired and dated in places nevertheless it was a good price considering the location. However we did not have any water from 9am12pm after our first night and we could not even flush the toilet which was a huge inconvenience. When we checked in the night before we were told that it was due to the water supply in the area. However I do not believe this was the case as we stayed on the top floor and had drilling above our room all morning which woke us up. As well as the lack of water this drilling noise was a huge inconvenience. Around 12 pm the maintenance manager knocked on the door informing us they would shortly be turning the water on again demonstrating that it was not the water in the local area that was shut off. I enquired to the front desk whether we would be receiving any form of compensation for the lack of water and drilling to which I was rudely told by the lady on the front desk that we would not as we were previously informed of it. However I do not regard informing us at 10 pm on check in as properly informing us and we should have been made aware of the problems in advance. I actually had two hotels held in Chicago and would have opted for the second one if I had previously been informed. I am a Hilton Diamond member and stay in hotels several times a week. I have never not had water in a hotel before. Furthermore to not offer any form of compensation for it I believe is unacceptable. Even offering a drink would have been basic hospitality and a nice gesture to apologize for the situation. I did tweet Hilton about it and received a tweet within an hour saying someone from the hotel would contact me.

When the Doubletree by Hilton Chicago Magnificent Mile was selected for a regional meeting I thought the rate was a little hard to believe. Boy was I right. This hotel has a propensity to deceitfully bill guests. I have three examples1. We had a package delivered to the hotel via Prime Now. shortly before our arrival. Upon arrival we asked for the delivery and were informed that security had to get it for us. The security agent loudly shouted my name through the lobby rather than bringing it to me. He then shoved a folded piece of paper in front of me telling me to sign it. I assumed incorrectly that it was to acknowledge receipt of the delivery. It was in fact an acknowledgement that the hotel was charging me 7 to get the item that Amazon had delivered less than an hour prior. Half way through my stay I had asked to review my folio and noticed the charge. I asked the front desk about it and wanted it removed. They refused. Interestingly the hotel concierge had texted me about my stay. I also spoke with her about the issue. She was not able to help. Sure does not seem like the hotel is in the business of Making it Right as their signs in the rooms and at the front desk state2. I received breakfast vouchers. A group of us went to breakfast. Prior to seeing a server we grabbed food. We were shocked when the server brought over a bill for 7 maybe 7 is their favorite number to charge. because the hot items were not included3. When I reviewed my folio mid trip I discovered that I was billed for three nights of parking. One of the nights also had room tax tacked on. I was able to get that removed. I commented I did not have time the next morning when checking out to review charges hence why I did it then. You can imagine my shock when the next morning I had been charged for five nights of parking when I only needed twoNedles to say watch your bill if you choose to stay here. These people run a shady operation with how they charge things. Adding the wrong tax to items tacking on fees without explaining them and overcharging even after it was brought to their attention.
