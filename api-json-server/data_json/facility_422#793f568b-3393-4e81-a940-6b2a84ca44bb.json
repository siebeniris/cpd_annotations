Had a great stay at this Courtyard. When I checked in there was a long line but that was the worst part of my time in this hotel. The front desk clerk handled the long line efficiently as she could. One thing I will say is there should have been two front desk people being that the hotel was sold out for the night. The room was nice clean. The elevator made a frightful hum noise but worked ok. I will say they may want to get the elevator serviced. The best experience was at Breakfast it was a little pricey but it was a good breakfast. My daughter accidentally spilled her drink on my French Toast they replaced it for me without me even having to ask. That was a nice way to turn around what could have been a bad start to the day.

We stayed here this past Saturday while visiting relatives. It was a good deal for the price and only minutes away from everywhere we needed to go. Not sure if this place is close to actually DC but we made it to relatives houses in Upper Marlboro and Seat Pleasant in 20 to 30 or less minutes. Same with Live. casino. Our room was clean and comfortable. We only had two minor issues. One there was a very odd onion like smell when we checked in Saturday night like someone was cooking right next door. It was not unpleasant so much as unusual. Second the elevator ran very very slow and seemed to struggle to pull us up to the 4th floor. It was kind of funny to me but it might be something the staff may want to look into. Other than that our stay was great. The 12 pm check out was awesome considering we did not get back from the casino until almost 4 am. We would definitely stay here again. The neighborhood appears to be pretty safe. There is a TGIFridays within walking distance and a CVS not too far down the road. Not much else and not a lot of reasons for non guests to be lurking around if you know what I mean.

We had a group of us in several rooms all there for a sporting event. First off the staff was courteous and the check in was seamless. The lobby was nice and the parking was free and ample. There was a nice outside seating area where we could meet and share a glass of wine before dinner. My husband enjoyed the small but functional workout room and the indoor pool. Rooms When we entered our room we were hit by an overwhelming scent of floral room deodorizer which much later did become less noticeable. Our room seemed clean enough and had all of the typical amenities. Our friends room on the first floor smelled abysmally of mold and mildew. It really reeked. Since the one girl had just sprained her ankle she had no energy to complain and her friends had been told that the place was filled up and that there were no other rooms available. So she sucked it up. Another one of our group related that their room smelled a bit moldy too. They were not sure if it was the carpeting or the draperies. Eating. We all knew that there was no free breakfast. We found a good breakfast diner within a ten minute drive. There is a Fridays right in the complex and we ate there although seeing a uniformed guard at the entrance to the bar did worry me a bit. There is nothing else within walking distance since the hotel is on a main highway and not that close to anything. Overall It was an ok place to stay but the rooms need some work. They probably need some carpeting andor drapery changes. I noticed that the hallway carpeting looked a bit worn too.

We were traveling on a middle school trip via charter bus. This was suppose to be our hotel accommodations and we were definitely tired after a long bus trip and sightseeing tours. Our hotels were beyond filthy. Blood stained linen and carpeting. Semen stained linen and carpeting. Marijuana smell overtaking the rooms and hallways.

Jesus the blood stain was ENORMOUS on the bedding under the pillow until it had reached the mattress. Soiled definitely. Throw the mattress awayThey switched our rooms around several times and ran out of available rooms. I asked why so few rooms available being that it was the end of the school year and a lot of school trips. The staff said all floors except 2 were being renovated. I mentioned how strange this was and that no one told us. They then told me that the hotel was a HOMELESS shelter up until a week before our visit. I asked how long had this been and was told a little over a year. Our tour company switched us last minute to this place just before we departed to DC so we had no ideaI could not believe that Mariot had allowed such an inconvenience to children. No one should have been subjected to this disgusting place. If renovations were needed they should have CLOSED this hotel completely. One group of kids had a strange man calling knocking on their door. After much demands for service from Mariot they finally relocated us to a better hotel. I do not think we should have had to make a big fuss about it as any reasonable person should know this is unacceptable even to basic human standards. It was so bad until the elevator had cardboard backing. I mean really. WTH. It took forever to arrive and finally upon our departure a group of kids mentioned the cardboard. I had to go look for myself. OMG was it nuts. Never have I been exposed to something of this magnitude. The outside of this building looks decent. do not be fooled. The inside will make you vomit. One room literally smelled like vomit had been sitting for days and not cleaned EVER. The kids got sick immediately upon entering. Please know that all reviews above are COMPLETELY accurate.

When we checked in we arrived around 6PM in the evening it was INCREDIBLY loud in the lobby with the restaurant immediately to your left as you walk in and is directly across from the check in desk to your right. There were no \u201c buffers \u201d or \u201c barriers \u201d to break up the noise at the restaurant which made check in extremely difficult especially if you have a hearing difficulty. The woman was extremely nice who checked me in and apologized for the loud noise but had to do so by shouting to me. When I checked in I reminded them that I had requested a handicap accessible room and confirmed it over the phone the week prior to our arrival as I use a walker and was traveling there for the purpose of having another brain spine surgery. The front desk clerk looked surprised because there was nothing indicating that on their computer. She quickly did some adjustments assigned us a room on the 1st floor that was handicap accessible. She also told me having to yell over the loud noise again. that since we were booked for 2 weeks our package included breakfast in the restaurant. When I asked her for how many people how that worked she said it was for the 2 people staying in the room. She said the next morning to just give our room to the people at the restaurant in the mornings and it would be taken care of. which was untrue because it was only one. She treated me professionally apologized for the loud noise seemed to genuinely enjoy her job. The staff is certainly the star of this hotel. My husband I went to room but I was extremely upset because I had specifically booked the Courtyard by Mariot King room because it offered a nice sized sofa. I knew that after having surgery on my brain and cervical spine neck it would be important to have some options of places to sit lay rest after returning from the hospital. But for some reason this handicap accessible room DID NOT have the same sofa we saw in all of the pictures. Instead it offered a small chair with no support for the upper back whatsoever. On top of that the door was difficult to even open and close all the way. We went back up to the front desk they seemed surprised at what I was saying. Then she thought I was expecting a suite explained that we had booked just the king room. We were not expecting a suite by any means. We had booked just 1 king room with a circle sofa bed in it the website said about 190 20sq ft. We did n\u2019t expect to have to give up the amenity of the sofa just to have extra room to use my walker. I offered to show the woman pictures and explained the whole reason I needed the sofa was for after surgery. She told me I did n\u2019t need to show her the pictures but they still did n\u2019t know what to do. I just decided to take a regular king room because in all honesty I had been in the car all day and was in a lot of pain. I did n\u2019t want to wait in the loud lobby while they ran to the room or figured out whether they had a king room with the sofa that was actually handicap accessible even though their website says it does. This was not necessarily the way I was hoping to start our long stay at a hotel. When we got up to the regular king room on the 2nd floor it worked out okay for me because I was able to have help around the room if I could n\u2019t get my walker around. It did make me concerned for those who were in a wheelchair however. The Room. The bed bedding was VERY COMFORTABLE. Each side of the bed had its own lamp with outlets as well as a small side table with pull out drawer. There was a mini fridge under the TV but it was had so much built up frost that we could barely fit small drinks in it. Next to the mini fridge were 3 large drawers. Since we were going to be there for a bit these were nice to have to put stuff in including random things we had with us but did n\u2019t want to clutter up the room with. We had to request for a microwave to be brought up to the room which they did without much problems. The TV was on a swivel stand so it could be seen in bed or on the sofa or both. There was a desk chair that was very comfortable and directly below the \u201c desk \u201d area there was a pull out table. It could be pulled out and used at the sofa or at the end of the bed or you could even just swing 1 end out to make a \u201c L shaped \u201d desk. The sofa was a circular shape and you kinda just melted back into. It was well worth the move to make sure we had this couch. It pulled out to a twin bed but we did not use it so I ca n\u2019t comment on it. There was a closet that had luggage rack ironing board iron linens for the sofa bed. Closet was average size that you had expect in a hotel room. The bathroom was okay. It seemed older with newer things like the shampoo dispenser the showerhead the u shape shower curtain added to distract from it being older. Unfortunately it is age still was evident. The lighting in the bathroom itself was not ideal. Pros. Very kind staff members who always were trying to serve us as best as possible. The room after having some initial mix ups with rooms that was sorted out was well planned out with furniture pieces that could be moved configured differently to make your room multi functional. These well thought out designs made the room feel bigger than they really were even though it \u2019s a decent size to begin with. The bed the couch were VERY comfortableThe location seemed to be very close to everything. From what I \u2019ve been told as I was mostly in the hotel the people that stayed with me during my time up there said it was centrally locatedMixed. The lobby restaurant area had plenty of space different types of seating with electrical outlets USB charging stations in almost every piece of furniture at least that I saw but it is so wide open that you kinda feel like everyone can hear your business. Everything is so loud especially if there are any big group there. Cons. The ceilings in the hallways especially on the 1st floor were really low made it feel quite claustrophobic unsettled. The 2nd floor did n\u2019t seem so bad but I did n\u2019t go up past the 2nd florThe mini fridge had a large build up of frost making it nearly impossible to store more than a few things. We also had to request a microwave to be brought to our room. The sidewalks at the back of the hotel were uneven very difficult to use a walker with. It would probably be nearly impossible to use a wheelchair to go in the back entrances. I had booked a king room that had a sofa bed not a suite just a regular king room. I had requested confirmed a \u201c handicap accessible \u201d room over the phone a week before. When I arrived they had nothing indicating this. After switching things up they gave us a handicap accessible room. It was much smaller than the room I booked on Mariot \u2019s website did not have the sofa. Needing room to move a walker or wheelchair around should not mean you do n\u2019t get to have a sofa. We went back down just got a regular room which probably would n\u2019t have worked if I had been in a wheelchair. All in all it was a nice experience but not what I have come to know and expect from the Mariot brand hotels. The staff are the best part of the hotel definitely the best part of the stay. I would stay here again if it were a decent price but I might try a different Mariot hotel next time there were several nearby.", "offset": [5575, 5829], "date": "2018-12-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "4facea5e-4269-4236-9449-d2f0664257ee", "sentence": "Amazing Experience.
