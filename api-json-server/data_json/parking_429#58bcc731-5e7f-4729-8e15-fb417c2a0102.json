I have been travelling to Bangkok 4 5 times per year over the last 7 years. Plaza Athene ranks among one of the best hotels I have stayed at in Bangkok. Even though it does not have the wow factor of say Mandarin Oriental when everything works the way it should when the room and facilities provide for everything one needs and the service is efficient attentive and disciplined it is easy to take for granted how difficult it is to achieve this level of smooth operation. Plaza Athene has one of the best locations in Bangkok. It is an affluent area popular with expats and wealthy Thais. The area is quiet and safe at night. I have stayed in many areas along Sukhumvit Road and I feel that this area is the most convenient for me. It takes 3 minutes to walk from the hotel to the BTS skytrain which connects to most tourist attractions. This is very important given the notorious traffic in downtown Bangkok and the dodgy taxi tuk tuk drivers who cheat tourists. The skytrain system allows travellers to get around in timely indepedent and safe maner3 major shopping malls are within walking distance. Restaurants cafes cinemas pharmacies supermarkets massage shops and convenience stores are all located nearby within short walking distance. The room was clean modern and standard of a high end 5star hotel. The quality of the room was comparable to that of Intercontinental Bangkok and Mariot Sukhumvit Park two hotels whose rooms I liked the most. The bathroom was large and equiped with a separate shower and bath. The TV was the largest I have seen in any hotel and had a good variety of channels. Ample wardrobe storage space was available. The wi fi was as fast as what I have at home. The service was efficient attentive and courteous. I checked in at 630am and was not charged an early check in fee. Housekeeping was thorough and the concierge bell boys were helpful and proactive. The fitness centre was open 24 hours which is rare to find in any hotel around the world. It was large and well equiped. There was a good variety of weight training equipment including both free weights and machines. Cardio machines were also available. The swimming pool was the largest and most impressive of all the hotels I have stayed at in downtown Bangkok. The hotels restaurant Reflexions serves some of the best modern french cuisine I have had anywhere in the world. Plaza Athene does not have the wow factor of say the Waldorf Astoria or Raffles Hotel Singapore. It does not have memorable decorations an exotic theme a capturing heritage story or staff dressed in period outfits. However for what it does provide it does so extremely well. Like a Mercedes or BMW it does not have the excitement of a Ferari or Maserati but it does the job in a smooth comfortable and seamless manner. Overall I was impressed by Plaza Athene and would not hesitate to stay here again. I have stayed at many of the large hotels in the Sukhumvit area. For travellers still choosing between hotels I have provided below my recommendations. 1. Novotel Ploenchit which is situated around the corner directly infront of the skytrain station has a better location than Plaza Athene and is a good all rounder. However Novotel Ploenchit does not have the luxury or facilities of Plaza Athene. Novotel Ploenchit is cheaper though. 2. Okura Prestige located a few blocks down from Plaza Athene is superb but is in a higher price range. 3. At the highest price range the world renowned Mandarin Oriental located on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya River. is worth considering. This is if you do not need to stay in the Sukhumvit area. 3. Intercontinental Bangkok and Hyat Bangkok both located down the road at the Ratchadamri intersection are also viable alternatives. However their location even though convenient can be chaotic. 4. I would not recommend Conrad Bangkok which is located a few blocks down from Plaza Athene. In summary at the highest price range I would choose Okura Prestige. One step down I recommend Plaza Athene. Going down further Novotel Ploenchit. For budget travellers look at Park Plaza Soi 18. I hope this helps with your selection.", "offset": [4099, 4147], "date": "2015-07-13 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "5f5331d6-c0cd-48af-af17-33912b6b0e54", "sentence": "Parking lot is suck.", "offset": [0, 20], "date": "2016-01-09 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "53364564-db04-4209-af3b-d04194f78e48", "sentence": "Disappointed with recent visit. Not sure what the direction of this hotel is now. Feel that things have been changing bit by bit since last 2015.

Paid a visit to gym last time and not totally impressed. The changing room was in a total mess. floor was wet all the time and did not feel cleanliness of 5stars hotel. In my humble opinion understand that the hotel perhaps policy from GM is trying to boost bottom line profit. But cutting expenses that have direct impact on customers instead of boosting revenue meaning attract more customers is not wise I suppose. At least for me this is the worst impression from my 10 years of experience with this hotel. Even doubting now in renewing membership when it expires.

She surprised me with a beautiful bouquet of red roses from the housekeeping staff. Every day I get new fruit turn down service. Truly I love my room which has been my home for 3 weeks. Hotel property is fantastic. Especially the staff. I travel alone for work but I feel at home. The VIP guest services Ms Marisa has been with the hotel for 10 years and she is phenomenal. She remembers your name and really is a bright smile to see every day and evening. The doormen are welcoming the lobby has gorgeous flowers and staircase. Just really astounding. The staff at the Raintre Cafe are attentive fast accommodating and high class. They remember your name and your drink orders and how you like your cofe with 500 guests I think it is unique and amazing that they do that. Makes you feel special. The Raintre Cafe has the BEST breakfast and dinner buffet. Fresh fruit fresh pressed juices bread bakery station fresh coconuts every day halal Japanese Chinese Indian and western options. The homemade yogurts strawberry and passion fruit compotes are to die for. There is also a oatmeal bar. I mean I can not say enough about the Raintre food options and staff. Location wise it is so central. You are surrounded by embassies and the BTS station Phloen Chit is only two stops away from the center stop Siam Square. I mean it is excellent. Shopping malls like Central Embassy Central Chitlom several 71s Starbucks Coffee for those that like it are all around.

We stayed here during the last days of our Thailand trip and found the hotel to be basically flawless. The Athene has recently been rebranded to a Luxury Collection hotel instead of a Royal Meridien and has undergone a major renovation. The hotel is well located in the center close to the BTS and Sukhumvit with its shopping malls. Lumpini park is only a short stroll away. The large lobby opens up to the outside through large glass walls making it a light impressive entrance. Check in was done in suite and was a breeze. The luggage had already bene delivered by the time we had registered. Our room was a family suite with two bedrooms 1 king and 1 with twin beds 2 bathrooms a living area and separate guest toilet. The renovation shows and the room was in excellent condition and done in a French colonial style which perfectly fits the spirit of the hotel. The room has all the needed amenities ranging from USB charging points to walk in showers dimable lights etc \u2026. The size is also adequate and the room offers plenty of windows to allow natural light to fall in. Soundproofing is OK and most of the craziness of Bangkok stays outside. The public spaces are all done in the same style and are well maintained. The staff is very welcoming and warm and offers an excellent service. The lounge is one of the assets of the hotel and it can easily compete with the excellent lounges in Hong Kong. It offers an excellent breakfast high tea cocktails wine and hors oeuvres during the late afternoon evening. The staff here is truly wonderful and will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and they know how to shake a decent cocktail \uf04a The food on offer was varied and of high quality. The drinks menu was extensive and all was delivered with a smile. It is surely one of the better lounges to be found in Bangkok and we enjoyed our time here. The pool is on the 4th floor and is quite large for a city hotel and offers nice views of the surrounding sky scrapers. It was a bit cold for our taste but still a great place to spend some time after a shopping spree or a visit of a tourist attraction. The Rain Tree Cafe is known for its buffets and they are indeed very extensive and also of high quality. Check out in the lounge was a breeze as well and we used the airport transfer from the hotel. Here they made the only very small mistake by dropping us off at the wrong counter at the airport. It appears that the list of the driver is no longer up to date and we were dropped at 8 instead of 4. However there was a representative of the hotel waiting for us and he helped us move our luggage to the current counter and even escorted us to the security check. All in all I can not fault this hotel in any way and my family and I had a wonderful stay here. We would return in a heartbeat if we ever find us again in Bangkok.

This is a beautiful and clean hotel. However we faced many hiccups during our 3 nights stay there. 1. My tour agency helped to make this booking for me via bokingcom. it was stated in the booking form that we are eligible for a free bottle of sparkling wine. After checking in I realised that I forgot to remind them about the sparkling wine. So I spoke to the front desk staff about it and they assure me that they will check and get back to me. No one contacted me till the following day. I called and reminded them and again they said they will check. it took me a 3rd reminder to finally have this minor issue sorted out. 2. My family of 4 booked a family room. I did not realise that it was actually 2 adjacent rooms but that was fine for us. However in each room we were only given 1 set of toothbrush. I had to call house keeping to request for additional toothbrush sets. This is a minor oversight but it could have been easily avoided if the reservation dept or front desk have better coordination with the house keeping dept. They knew upon checking in that there were 4 pax as they requested for all our passports. Even if they did not know I think it is only appropriate to always allocate 2 sets of toothbrushes in each room just to be prudent. 3. During check in we requested for the luggages to be delivered to our rooms. After checking in we stayed at the lobby for about 15 20 min to discuss the itinerary with our tour guide. When we finally went to our rooms the luggages were not delivered yet. Not sure of the standard turnaround time for luggage delivery but we were a bit disappointed that the service was not more prompt. 4. When I was trying to call the house keeping for the toothbrush I had to make the call 3 times because the first 2 calls were not attended to. I do not ever remember making a call to house keipung in a 4 or 5 star hotel where it was not answered. But for this case the call was unanswered not once but twice. I guess they must be short of staff. All of the above are not what I would call a deal breaker as they are what I view as minor hiccups issues. But nevertheless it is disappointing that a hotel of this standard is making so many mistakes oversights. Pros. the location is superb near the BTS but slightly away from the main road. Lots of food option behind and near the hotel. staff are all very friendly and try to be helpful whenever we approach them. breakfast is fantastic gym is good. Pool looks beautiful though I did not use it. The hotel is located about 80 m from the Lumphini park. So avid runners have relatively easy access to outdoor running space.", "offset": [2551, 2606], "date": "2019-12-27", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}]}
