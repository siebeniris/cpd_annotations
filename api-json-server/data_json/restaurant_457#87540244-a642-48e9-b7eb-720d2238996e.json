We booked a Fabulous room and the room. truly lived up to its billing. It was a large room modern and had an unbelievable view of the Barcelona coast. It was on the 20th floor so the views were staggering. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was great. A large wet room. The room was cleaned to a high standard each day. The pool areas were amazing. There was plenty of space on the two decked lounging area but sometimes it was a struggle to find a lounger in the afternoon. Smart pool bar very close to the pool also. The breakfasts were a great spread of everything you could ask for in a breakfast. All the essentials were there and topped up regularly. The inside bar areas were also very lavish and bar staff very attentive. What we found a disappointment was the 26th floor bar area name I have forgotten. It was quite tacky and looked as if it needed a revamp. The floors were heavily stained and the mirrors in there looked like they needed a good clean.

So the things is I did nt do much research before I book it I only book it because my best friend just love this brand and it never really let us down except one time in W Bangkok and this just come to another level of disappointment. And now when I see all the one star review in TA I can tell you they all true. So here we go I booked this long time ago over the aps and I forgot to update the credit card details which is invalid. I only notice that when hotel send me a email on the day before I arrive so I asked them shal I give you my details over email. They did nt reply right away then I wait and they send me an form later on when I am flying over to Barcelona. When I finally settled in BCN they already cancelled my booking as I am too late. I replied immediately to explain it and no one reply either til next morning the day on my arrival they said they just have to cancel it due to prepay rate. I think this is the first time ever a hotel so insist to cancel a booking even you are a loyal member. Okay rule is rule rightAnyway I made my booking again and after I made my booking I just asked in the aps to see when we could move over I know an early check in is subject to availability but for so far normally a hotel will tell you they will do their best to let you check in asap but no there. All they ask if you have to show up and they will queue you up if you do nt show up there is nothing they can do. Alright it is still fine we just go there by 4 pm then everything should be okay. And I am here to celebrate my birthday for so many years all the Mariot property I stayed in will just tell you they would do whatever they can to make your birthday memorable. I know it is not a must but I never really expect to receive a link to tell you can buy a cake or a bottle if you want. So anyway we showed up at 4 we do get a room upgrade to a suite which request to return by 2 pm most late checkout could be 4. But a suite sounds great right. And I do expect for a little decoration W is very good at that according to our experience they always have some balloon and stuff to make you feel party on. Guess what. Nothing there is not even some fruit or candy the table is empty it is so neat. To be fair they do send me a piece of cake later with a printed card it is just like they just feel sorry for me. So the suite itself looks awesome and the pool downstairs is perfect. The thing about this W is all the hardware is good but the staff is really rude and definitely a memorable birthday. And you think this is over. The next morning we go for breakfast and we wana sit in the lovely booth so we just ask the waitress before we moved. She said it is not ready then we said can we move when it ready. She said Maybe. How difficult it is to just let us move a table when no on waiting. Later on we asked someone else and we moved. So basically it is a buffet and it is self served right. So I just take the cava and the sparkling water to my table and when I gon na to pour it this waitress just ran to me and YELL you can not take this to your table. I explained to her I just do not wana bring 4 glasses over there and I would put back the bottle afterwards. She just insist to take the bottle of my hands and pour it by herself and staring at me. Am I stealing anything. I do not even have a chance to put down the bottle if I leave the bottle on the table you can tell me I can not do that. but before I even pour. How rude can it be. So she just totally ruin the perfect breakfast. And you think that is the worst. Welcome to the pool side. Do nt get me wrong they got perfect pool with ocean view and even got two pool. But watch out if you wana access from one to another you better figure out the way. If you just can not find your own way their security will just yell at you and say Go Go Go like you are a dog. Basically the sign just tell us you can go from the pool from stairs so if it is not allow at least you can point the direction instead of pushing us like we breaking in. So by paying nearly 500 Euro a night I get a birthday that I will never forget and feel like a second class citizen for the whole time. Even we have to late checkout I just can not wait to leave ASAP by noon. If you have such a budget stay somewhere else.
