My only minor issue was the Queen room had no dresser drawers. So if your clothes could not be hung in the closet you would have to leave it in your bag or laying on the floor.

The room that we booked was a deluxe double room with 2 beds but still on the smallish side. The room carpet had a damp feel and smell to it and we initially thought this was because the bath does not have a solid door that separates the bath from the room just a glass door. Something to note if you like privacy showering and using the toilet. We went to use the iron which was in the closet and water was streaming from the ceiling. We called the front desk and they sent an engineer to check and if they had to move us. They moved us to another room which was great however much smaller than the room we booked where we could n\u2019t even open our luggage.

If the mini bar is your thing though you have come to the right place as there are many snack and adult beverage offerings available. along with some other amenities. The staff was super friendly. Check in was efficient and we were greeted by lobby staff each time we left the hotel. The front door valet team was helpful in assisting us upon arrival always making sure we had transportation when heading out to explore and they welcomed us back each time we returned. Since our stay was so short we were not able to check out the rooftop pool bar or dine at the on site steak house. This was my first stay at an Andaz property though and it was enjoyable.
