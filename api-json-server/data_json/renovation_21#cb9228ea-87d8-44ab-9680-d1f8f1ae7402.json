Stayed overnight at Mariot Santa Clara while on a college campus tour road trip with Mariot rewards member husband and teen son. Location of hotel is excellent right by airport and Santa Clara University our destination. Rooms we were in room 71. south tower concierge level as husband is Mariot rewards elite member. Our room was a two queen bed connector and we could hear the folks next door chatting and laughing until at least 10 not the hugest deal but speaks to the insulation of the room. Beds were adequately comfortable though my side of the queen bed was so close to the wall that I had to climb over my husband when I needed to get out of bed. Also there was no mirror in the main room area so I could not dry my hair outside of the bathroom hubby and son had to wait to take showers. Seems a bit weird as business people usually want to outfit check in natural light before leaving a room. There was a mirror on the inside of the closet door but it gave no natural light as you had to open the closet while standing between the room door and the closet door. Really odd. Bathroom was super small we felt like we were on a cruise ship. The ceiling was lowered in there too which made the ceiling about 7 feet. The toilet is pushed right up to the shower curtain and there is very little room on the sink counter for toiletry kits one can fit definitely not two. Barely enough room to turn around. All in all the room decor and design gave us the impression that someone attempted to upgrade a lower quality room maybe this was not originally a Mariot hotel to a high class hotel with marginal success. The room HVAC is a window unit that was really loud. If this room was the concierge grade I am not sure what the lower floors have to offer. Anyway staff was super nice. One restaurant Champions was closed for renovation as was the concierge lounge. Husband was given two complimentary breakfast buffet vouchers for breakfast and said it was wonderful. We also had a lovely dessert at the 104 restaurant. There is a Starbucks in the lobby and there was free coffee in the morning in another part of the lobby. Did not use the pool or gym. Valet was there we opted to self park a true bargain at 10 day. right next to the hotel.", "offset": [1831, 1910], "date": "2015-11-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "08d270bf-8e30-4dca-a4b8-a62c09e61b18", "sentence": "Not quite up to par for a Mariot. Overall I liked the hotel. The lobby was expansive and had a cafe and ample seating areas. There was a bar and a restaurant that lined the path to the conference meeting rooms and the entire path had cozy seating nooks. The ballroom and foyer seemed as though it had been recently updated. There was a smaller meeting room we used for VIP lunches that had an outdoor patio area with additional seating which was nice. The rooms were average. When I first arrived and checked in the first room they gave me had an overpowering floral smell that they said was from the chemicals they use to clean the rooms. I asked to be moved and the second one smelled as well but they were very sweet and accommodating and had house keeping clean a room without the smelly chemicals. I am sensitive and get headaches but honestly have never had a room and I stay at a lot of hotels. that was that smelly. I was also a little surprised that they did not have a safe in the room or a fridge mini bar. I called to ask about the fridge and they said they could see if they could bring me one. A colleague had one in her room. Thought it was odd that some did and some did not. Also found it strange when I ordered room service they delivered it in a take out box. Would not have minded if it was a sandwich but with a salmon entree would have preferred a regular service than eating out of a box with handles. Other than that the staff was lovely and I enjoyed my stay but I did not think it was comparable to other Mariots I have stayed at.", "offset": [254, 323], "date": "2016-12-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "5d9c0c8d-4086-474c-a2fd-73ab7dcb2538", "sentence": "Overall experience I was thoroughly satisfied.

I bounced back and forth between 1 and 2 stars but feel the perceived water issue concerns me enough to leave at 1 star. I travel to the area fairly frequently but this is my first time staying in Santa Clara at this Mariot. Check in went smoothly but there was about a 15 20 minute wait on a Monday afternoon. The person checking me in explained they were short handed and apologized for my wait. He was nice about it and rushed through the check in process to get to the next guest which is perfectly fine and I prefer to just get the key and go. No acknowledgment of status I am just Gold though with Mariot which I know is kinda stupid to complain about but it adds up to the rest of the experience and makes me wonder if this is a hint to bigger issues. Room was satisfactory. It is what you would expect in an older hotel bathroom is small and cramped but not a big deal. TV worked fine lighting was standard etc. Adequate sounds like the most appropriate word. It did make me question whether the rate for the room was in line with the quality of the room. The hotel is need of a full renovation in general based on rates they charge. Sleeping in my particular room was another story. I was located either next to or below some sort of service elevator never got an explanation from the front desk. Each night at different hours of the night 3 am the first night then 1 am then midnight and again 430am. a loud elevator type sound would start where it sounded like an elevator or train on tracks running then a loud click. It would go on for hours. I called one night and asked what it was and they said they would call engineering and have it shut down great. then it started again a couple hours later. they did offer to change my room the final night tonight. so hopefully I can come back and update the review with better news on this front. If you are at all a light sleeper make sure you ask for a quiet room and my room was at the end of the hallway so do not assume that is enoughThey do not do a concierge breakfast on the concierge floor. They do it down in the sports bar logical right. which is offset from the main lobby and not at all obvious or not to me at least. I missed this the first two days as there was no sign indicating this on the concierge floor but there were empty wine glasses and dirty plates from the night before so it was clear when I saw these the third day that that was not where breakfast was. A simple sign or word at the front desk at check in would have avoided this confusion and it was not just me completely. I asked the front desk and they acted like I was stupid for not knowing that they serve breakfast in the sports bar that has hours posting it opens at 430Also and maybe most concerning there looked to be some issue with the water at the hotel just based on my unscientific observations and opinion but judge for yourself from the picture. When filling a glass from the faucet it comes out extremely cloudy. Honestly I have never seen anything quite like it. I showed the attached picture to the front desk who said I need to run the water longer. I ran it for 5 minutes as a test when I got back up to the room and same thing occurred. I told the front desk that I was concerned it was not safe to drink use for coffee or brush my teeth. And all I got was something like I do not know sometimes you just need to run it longer. I am not really one to freak out about these things but I was pretty shocked by how casual the hotels response was to this.
