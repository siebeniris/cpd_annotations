Never having been to St Kits it was a very large and comfortable site. The first two days were total R R sitting on the beach all day reading and resting. The Mariot staff took our drink and lunch orders and delivered them to us on the beach. But we noticed that some staff members were super nice about greeting us answering questions calling the taxi etc. Then there were others on the hotel side at the desk who could seemingly only do one thing at a time. E g if you take a taxi the drivers never seem to have change you want to break a large bill at the Front Desk to pay the driver. Stand in line. They did not seem to understand or care. that the driver was waiting to be paid and there was nowhere else in the hotel that handled cash. Like many Caribean resorts on the Atlantic side they are trying to clean up the ugly seaweed that washes ashore. I give them credit for removing it as best they can. it is nature and I do not know what else they can do but continue to clean it up. Hopefully this will abate as time goes by. All in all I liked it. I am also glad we were there in off season because I can not imagine competing with hundreds of other guests to secure a covered shady spot on the beach.

The Mariot St Kits is amazing. Totally different resort than what we are used to and it was a welcome change. If you go to this resort with the right expectations I am sure you will love it. We went between January 21 and 28 2017 with our 19 month old son. The resort. I would consider this place a sleepy resort. Things are pretty quiet the guests are generally older folk however there are some younger families. This is NOT a party resort. There are daily activities eg water aerobics pool volleyball etc. The activities are listed daily by 8 am at the towel hut. The resort is quite large but everything is still pretty close. They offer melon infused water in the lobby. Check in was simple and not a long wait. A number of reviews have commented on the lack of cleanliness of the common areas and have posted photos. During our stay I have discovered that the photos were taken in spaces that are open air so of course debris would build up in the grout of tiles that are outdoor. Also sand accumulates in certain areas but staff are diligent and were always working at sweeping mopping it up. The resort also has 4 BQs for anyone to use free of charge. They are located near the pool on the vacation club side of the resort. The lobby and public washrooms were very nice and very clean. I actually do not think I have been to a cleaner public washroom in the Caribbean. There is ample parking spaces available at the resort if you choose to rent a vehicle we did and it was great. There are a couple shops inside the main building as well as a couple vendors that set up on the ground level outside the fitness centre. The fitness centre was very nice and had great equipment although we did not use it. The pool. There are three pools at the resort all of which have a shallow section for toddlers. Despite a number of negative reviews on this site the pools were all very well maintained. There were always a lot of chairs available polside and it was generally a pretty quiet and calming atmosphere. Music was never pumping super loud and people were never stumbling all over from intoxication. Vacationers were generally pretty conservative Canadians and Americans. The beach. The beach was fantastic. There are man made breaks located along the beach which helped calm the waves of the Atlantic Ocean. I felt quite safe with my toddler going into the shallow water behind the breaks as it was usually calm. Although one day it was very windy and there were still large waves coming in. We went to the beaches on the Caribbean side and they also had large waves on that day. The beach cabanas were amazing as our toddler was able to play in the sand without having the risk of a sunburn. Most of the cabanas are far enough away from the ocean that you could just let your toddler run around without having to worry about the water you had easily be able to catch up to your toddler before they couldreach the water. There were always cabanas and chairs available. The beach was generally pretty quiet. Some snorkeling is available along the water break. There were plenty of fish sea urchins and some even got to see some sea turtles. We did not see any jellyfish while there and the urchins seemed to stay on the rocks at the break. The beach is a public beach however the sales people were not pushy at all clothes trinkets massages etc. There were outdoor shower heads at the entrance to the resort from the beach to rinse off which was nice. The staff. We did not go all inclusive but the staff we encountered were all exceptionally nice and welcoming. They all smiled and said hello. Yes everything is done in island time which can be frustrating for people living in Canada or the US as we are used to life flying by and things happening quickly. This is just not how they live their lives. They all seem to be stress free and happy which is a nice change. Check in was relatively quick and Kevon was very nice. I accidentally logged into the wifi our second device with a different account. When we went to pay we noticed the charge and explained what happened. They immediately fixed the problem without any issue. The rooms. We stayed in the Pembroke building in room 1 310. The room was exactly what you had expect from the Mariot clean well appointed comfortable beds etc but with a little extra space which was nice. We asked for a crib for our son and there was plenty of room for it. Housekeeping cleaned the room well and we did not have any issue. You can hear people walking in the hallway and people in the adjoining room a little but it is to be expected when you have ceramic tiles rather than carpeting which absorbs the sound. The room has a bar size fridge which allowed us to buy groceries and bring them back to the room. The private balcony to our room was nice and overlooked the courtyard on that side of the resort. We barely used the balcony but it was a nice addition. The location. This resort is located near virtually everything one would need. There are beautiful views of the south peninsula and Nevis from the beach. The road on which the entrance to the Mariot is located has a number of restaurants Bombay Rituals Coffee Rituals Sushi Ciao Italiano Rock Lobster etc as well as a couple duty free shops a grocery store etc. You can also walk to South Frigate Beach in 5 10 minutes. Although we actually preferred the beach at the Mariot to the other beaches on the island as they were busier and had less space. The food The only food we had at the resort was a pizza from the hut located near the main pool. It was a decent pizza and took about 15 minutes to get it. The pizza was 250 US and was pretty decent. The one complaint we have is that they do not accept payment at any of the restaurants. You must give them your room number and name and it gets billed to your room in American dollars. We paid ours at the end of our stay using ECs rather than putting it on our credit card but it was a little awkward and if you did not track what you bought you could end up with a large bill at the end of your stay. The island. I have almost only good things to say about St Kits. it is a beautiful island filled with very happy and welcoming locals. We loved that everyone spoke English and that the roads were easy to navigate. Everyone loved our toddler and were all super understanding when he made a mess at dinner etc. The island has a fair amount of cool sights and places to see Brimstone Fortress black sand beach Diepe cockleshell beach north friars beach south friars beach turtle beach south frigate beach north frigate beach the jungle Nevis historic Basseterre Timothy Hill etc. All of it can be seen in a couple days but it was nice to leisurely experience the islands. Generally the local housing is in better condition than other islands we have traveled. Not once did we feel unsafe. If we did not have so many places we have not been to we would go back to St Kits and stay at the Mariot. It was a fantastic vacation and the only vacation where we were not ready to return to the comforts of home after 7 days.", "offset": [2248, 2348], "date": "2017-01-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "72ce0b7d-ed4b-47ab-bcf2-dee00785e16a", "sentence": "Beautiful resort on a nice little island. This may be the only resort on the island but it was still an amazing experience. The place is huge but it happened to be surprisingly empty when we visited. Apparently we were traveling at the height of the zika scare and this caused a huge hit to their tourism industry. I do not even think there were any cases on St Kits but that does not stop scared Americans from being frightened over. well EVERYTHING. So with most Americans cowering in fear over mosquitoes back home we took advantage of this little slice of paradise. They have a nice large pool area where we were lucky to find entire sections all to ourselves. The beach was a little more rocky but perfect for snorkeling. On one of our first days we followed a sea turtle who led us to a sting ray and we got to watch them both swim out to sea. It was awesome. The staff was all very friendly and the food we tried was good. However because we did not opt for the all inclusive we found ourselves exploring the nearby town. Just down the street are some amazing restaurants all within walking distance. We found some of the best seafood and Italian food we have ever had. If you have the chance to try lion fish go for it. The local divers spear them in the reef and sell them to the restaurants so it is usually fresh. Overall we had a great time at this resort.

When we booked our trip I was between staying at the beach or in the mountains rain forest but usually Mariots are a safe bet so we decided to split the trip in half and do two nights at each ending the trip at the Mariot. I want to say that I would like to review it as poor but I do not think that is very fair as I was comparing it to where we left The Belle Mont farm which was probably the nicest place we have stayed in the world seriously so nice. We were on a kid free vacation and this is definitely a family friendly resort not a fault to the Mariot whatsoever. The food was ok nothing special but I will say we ordered pizza by the pool to only find out you can just go up to your room and for an extra 4 have more food options and just have the food delivered to you. The pools were OK but as I said earlier full of families. The jacuzi at the pool we were at the smaller pool literally was a cold water jacuzi I did not know that even existed. The room was nice and clean however PLEASE do not pay to get a better view or any of that upgrade nonsense from their website because it was NOT worth whatever we paid to have ocean front because it is a tiny sliver of the ocean and there are only two small chairs and a mini table on there so you ca nt even sit out there for a meal. Our friends had a mountain city view which was beautiful at night and they had a HUGE balcony however they did not even have chairs to sit at out thereCheck in took FOREVER. The staff was hardly of any help. We were having trouble trying to figure out how to return our rental car and they were of 0 help trying to assist us. The casino was a fun activity to do at the end of the day. If you want an average vacation hotel go ahead and stay here.

I was told there is a nice beach within walking distance with good restaurants but never tried it myself. The Mariot recently started running a tour of Nevis that include a BQ dinner on the beach during sunset which is an absolute blast and happens once per week on Thursday. The location is central and it is easy to get to the Southern Peninsula from your front door and walk to Timothy Point if you are feeling ambitious. there is a small grocery store too. Most everything about this hotel is perfect. Cons. Only one but it is a big con the beach on property. it is covered in seaweed which does not seem like a big deal until you smell it. The stuff piles up in an impenetrable line that attracts bugs and seagulls. If it is plowed up it does not seem to happen often as there are layers to it so you can tell the age of the seaweed.

I am a Mariot Platinum Elite member so my family and I obviously enjoy the brand. This review is complicated as I would definitely return but some issues. First the pros St Kits is a beautiful island and the setting of the resort with the large beach and incredible views hard to beat. Yes water a bit rougher here as compared to say Aruba or Cayman but crystal clear and my whole family had a great time with the beach and ocean. The rooms my wife and I had along with the 2nd room my older daughters were in had been redone and were very nice. and the bed and pillows were quite comfortable. The people were wonderful very nice from the minute you walk in and they greet you with wet hand towels and drinks and special thanks to Brenda in guest relations for all she did for us ask her to arrange for Alvin to pick you up at the airport. But the issues were that the hotel had trouble handling the of guests and even though we were advised not allowing day passes for cruise ships when I booked as busy season they did allow day passes. You had to be out quite early to get a beach cabana which should not happen as they have plenty of room to add more or at least more chairs with Umbrellas we waited for lunch for almost 2 hours one day and the next day when we sat down the waitress was very honest with us and encouraged us to go elsewhere difficult as not a lot of on site options as so backed up with food service for the restaurants beach and pool. From what I could tell they only had one person who was taking drink food orders on the beach as well although short walk to beach bar. Very crowded to go to the restaurant Calypso for breakfast as well but the cafe was great for quick bite. One day room service did not show up and on other days always short on supplies whether not getting towels toilet paper tissues etc. We would have called down to housekeeping but the phones did not work the entire week in the resort which is also a safety issue. I had to go to the front desk to get someone to replace a light bulb in the bathroom. The walls were thin and the young child in the room next to us kept us up most nights but did not ask to change rooms our fault as wanted to be close to the rest of the family. Also the service was slow at Arwe which is a bar sushi quick bite type of restaurant. We ordered a few glasses of wine our last night and it took 30 minutes to get but that being said the resort was full and the staff was doing their best and working hard over the holiday. So mixed bag beautiful place great people working hard and I would go back tomorrow if I could but just suggest you be patient if you go during a busy season. I think with a little work they could fix the issues. Ie. one restaurant recently closed for dinner and I think they could use that specifically for cruise ship day passes and they could add more chairs umbrellas by where the volleyball nets were for day passes so more availability for cabanas and faster service for the hotel guests who are paying a decent rate for the resort.", "offset": [306, 450], "date": "2019-12-29", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "1add9209-3297-4c04-b5d9-4689fc067bee", "sentence": "Not quite what we had hoped for Did not meet expectations for overall experience travelers should know that there is a 125 services charge added to everything in addition to 2 Value Added Tax VAT at this resort and for Spa Services another 10 charge shows up on the receipt with no line item description. This sounds like a gripe I realize but walk across the street to the Royal St Kit hotel complex and service charge is only 10. Keep walking a little further until you are off either resort property but still on the same stretch of road and there are other FB options. However at nearby Samuri Habachi charged 10 VAT 10 Service Charge and 2 IEF. This is not an inexpensive island where you can expect bang for your buck. The doorman bellman front desk and concierge staff at this hotel are top notch. Chelton Josh Suton and Novelina were particularly helpful to us during the booking process and on property. Thank you. The rooms ours was a basic King was very spacious. We arranged an adjoining room to the other members of our party. Rooms are standard with bidet frig big tv wifi is extra if you are not in the Mariot BonVoy club. Housekeeping came in regular intervals but lacked some attention to detail like the amount of towels for each guest 3 per room of cups and coffee packages and did not remove glassware or dishes from the rooms that came from other areas of the hotel. The normal beds were very comfortable the roll away we added for my step daughter was not old and springs everywhere weird foam blanket. The food itself was very good the Cannibal Roll on the lounge menu is worth going back for delicious ginger beef and drinks were fine too. The amount of time spent waiting to be acknowledged by service staff tests the limits of patience while on vacation. And this is a factor that several guests around me were rolling eyes about too. Painful. The lounge is aesthetically pleasing no doubt breezy lovely modern furniture with a variety of niches for privacy or larger loungers or high tops for groups. This part of the operation would benefit from assigned waitstaf and busers. Too often and round of drinks would be delivered but dirty dishes would remain on the table. A few times I removed them myself as I came to St Kits Mariot Resort to experience island beauty and simple pleasures not piles of dirty napkins and chicken bones on my table. Based on this experience in the lounge we ate all other meals off property. The beach is on the Atlantic side the water is still very warm and was not too rough. Wake early to claim your cabana if you plan on spending the day on the beach. This is not the beach for snorkeling. The pool is fun and not very deep and there is an area where taller folks can play volleyball in the pool. Lots of chaise loungers with canopies. Return towels daily. In the end we made the most of it but will likely not return nor recommend this hotel location to friends or family.", "offset": [2449, 2534], "date": "2020-01-02", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "12200ff7-5c3f-4061-b407-b06192642716", "sentence": "Quiet great beach and superior customer service. We are Mariot timeshare owners and decided to try Mariot in St Kits. Large expansive property with 3 pools and friendly staff. Beach is not crowded. You can go to the beach at 11 or later and it is never full. No charge for chairs or palabas. yes. Food is quite good on premises which also has a casino. Recommend a day trip to shipwreck beach Nevis and botanical gardens. Great place to really relax or just to be quiet.

Unfortunately we were only able to stay 4 nights because from from our first impression of a friendly check in till when it was time to depart everyone was very helpful and friendly. Right after check in we experienced a dead battery in our room door lock. Someone was there quickly to fix it. Next morning we spoke to our house keeper and told her what we needed per day she had everything the way we wanted and was very friendly. As we walked around over the next few days from the pool to the restaurants all of the staff members greeted us regularly. Unfortunately the days we were there we experienced unusually high winds so we were not able to take advantage of the clean and very close beach right off the property. Food drinks in resort were a bit expensive and for some strange reason they have multiple large whirlpools that are NOT heated. But other than those 2 negatives we had a pleasant stay. TIP. If you can get a room in a building near the beach like building 13 get a 2nd or 3rd floor room for the ocean view.", "offset": [605, 773], "date": "2020-01-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "c06fd6fe-33b8-4fc8-aae7-608f44a30941", "sentence": "Good Hotel meh Beach. Great hotel. Stayed in a Villa. Villa was amazing. Pools were great. They have a pizza place at the hotel. The pizza is actually pretty good. There are multiple pools which I enjoyed.

This Mariot out of all the Mariot \u2019s I have ever stayed in is probably the one in the roughest of shapes. This hotel looks like it \u2019s on the list of getting a face lift but it \u2019s still a while to go. The restaurants are not in bad shape but the food is really lacking in quality and taste. The better place to dine was in the mornings at the Calypso restaurant. it was breakfast so it was n\u2019t to difficult to mess up. Our server Loreal was so pleasant and always helpful that you just felt comfortable dining there and starting your morningof to a good start. This is definitely a family style resort so if you want to go for some peace and quiet you might want to look elsewhere. The pool is in need of some loving if you really look at the property it looks as though it might have started out with an enormous pool but eventually it changed into a smaller pool. They have two pools on the property so there is room if there are n\u2019t a lot of people. The beaches were clean not to many attendants but you could easily get to any of the pool bars yourself. The employ were very nice at this resort but everything else was underwhelming. The pics below are of the ac where paint is peaking off and leaking on the stairwell if you are in one of the out side buildings do not pack heavily because you might have to treck all your things three to four flights of stairs as there are no elevators. I do not want to seem whiny it \u2019s just that if you have a bad back it \u2019s just a fare warning.", "offset": [985, 1089], "date": "2020-02-22", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "7e8df372-f1d0-487f-ac2a-12054e6c5a9b", "sentence": "Great people clean rooms nice but dated property. I want to start by saying that all of the Vacation Club staff and management are one of the best i have experienced at a resort we have been to Ritz four seasons st Regis. We had a rocky start with our stay and the vacation club staff stepped up to turn our vacation experience around by accommodating us with any requests. Starting from top management down Claudia S Candace W Nicon Nicola Elise and Simeon in security more names i forgot they went above and beyond to make up for some of the shortcomings of the Mariot St Kits property. The vacation club is managed separately from the Mariot resort staff. However the vacation club sits inside the Mariot hotel property and shares the entire Mariot resort amenities. I state this clearly because you should read Mariot resort reviews to get a sense of the property which i feel is a bit dated and in need of some love. 2 Bedroom Villas these are part of the vacation clubWhile advertised as newly renovated keep in mind only the appliances and furniture were updated. The rooms still feels dated with old tiles and vanities. They are however extremely clean and spacious with new washer dryer and full kitchen. RAMS across the street has everything you need to stock fridge. There was a mildew smell in our bedroom we think from the AC vent but we probably were unlucky with our room because we had one of the worst rooms in the vacation club. We are not time share owners we purchased room through a travel agent and there are definitely more private and more ocean view villas then the one we received which had no privacy and no view of the ocean as advertised. Fitness centerDon\u2019t pay attention to pics online. The gym feels more dated and bare then the online pics. In fact do n\u2019t trust any of the pics online. Also it is managed by the hotel poorly. Towels in the gym were all gone one day i visited front desk and called twice over 12 hr. It took 45 min of working out till an attendant showed up with towels. Every machine was taken in the gym due to rain outside and prime morning hours. It was unsanitary to have no towels to wipe sweat when sharing machines. Also they have two very old dirty mats for stretching or floor work. You often have to wait to use a mat. There is no attendant in the gym managing it at any hour. They should at least have an attendant on peak morning hours. It \u2019s a liability to the hotel even. They should have more and newer mats for stretching and floor work. Some weights are rusty too. PolsThis is the most disappointing part of the property. The chairs and the pools are very old and dated probably to the original in 190. After the first day at the main pool we never went back and stayed at the South Pool in front of the vacation club units because it was the only real clean pool. The main pool was old crowded and often dirty. The pool and beach chairs are so old and need to be replaced. Restaurants Only one option for breakfast and lunch and dinner on the property. For this size of resort to not have more than one restaurant open per meal is unacceptable at a 4 star hotel rating. They have a pizza shack opened all day and night but it \u2019s a take out walk up counter so i do n\u2019t count it as a dining option. Plus my son who loves pizza said it was the worst pizza. Coffee Dessert Bar This must be a recent addition renovation. Newest part of the lobby. It feels more modern and is very well run. The staff is nice efficient and it \u2019s clean and the coffee is excellent. They also have pastries desserts and midday snacks. Calypso Breakfast only. Just ok. Service was beyond slow. The buffet was not replenished well no fruit on the buffet when i went. The omelet station had one person working and a line of 8 people. Again this hotel does not care about its dining. It took forever for cooked items off the menu to come out and no attention from the waitress to refill waters. We only went once as a result. Pool Beach Lunch only we ate here three times and ordered the same items. The delivery presentation and quality were different all three times. The later you go the more crowded it gets and the food quality and service go down. Our worst experience is when we got there to eat at 1 not 12. There is another closed restaurant sitting empty right next to the pool. Again for this size property there should be a separate indoor option for lunch to escape the heat. Either calypso in the hotel lobby or the closed empty furnished restaurant next to the pool restaurant. NOTE. go to lunch at sweet savory across the street. Delicious healthy options and AC also a great dessert place. they are wonderful and food was healthier. BeachIt \u2019s very important to note that this resort is on the Atlantic Ocean side. The waters can be much rougher full of seaweed and windy when the weather is n\u2019t smooth. We were only able to go to the Mariot beach on one full day because it was too windy and rough the other days. This is not the Mariot fault of course but be aware the Caribbean beaches on a windy day will be much better. Check out carambola beach club. The Mariot does have a beautiful beach and nice shaded huts spread out all along the beach which is really nice. But many of the huts are set far back from the ocean water unles you are lucky to get one near the vacation club side closer to the water. The beach is great weather permitting but chairs are old again and huts are rusty. Also there is no bar service on the beach. Tennis CourtsDon\u2019t even bother bringing a tennis racquet. They had 4 courts there are only two that you could potentially try to use. They were apparently destroyed in a hurricane 3 yrs ago and never fixed. They are locked and take 45 min to get someone to open them when you get on them you ca n\u2019t even play. I think they are grass. If you are a real tennis player you will not want to play on these. I will attach pictures. The vacation club Mgr complimentary shuttled us to municipal courts 20 min away. These were playable and better but not great or worth going back to play. The property Mariot does a great job on the vacation club side offering activities as a group or individually mimosa mornings cheese wine etc. They have shuffle boards corn hole chess checkers all out on the lawn for families to play. The main hotel offered a couple of things at night like karaoke bonfire on the beach and movie night. Many people were here in large groups and brought wireless speakers and played music in common areas. When walking around the property and lobby you will notice chipping of paint windows not clean rusty roofing. Also there is a high wall blocking the property from the beach so you really can not see the beach at ground level unles you walk onto it or look over the wall at the edge of the property. GolfGreat course and discounted for Mariot vacation club. We played this course twice. They shuttle you five minutes to the course from the hotel they will store your clubs or give you rental clubs. Six or seven of the holes are on the Atlantic Ocean and beautiful. The course is in very good conditionBotom LineThis property was built in 190 and it shows. It needs property improvements and it needs to invest in the dining to keep people at the resort. We spent a day at Carambola Beach resort Where we saw other Mariot families and spent one of our best days on the island. If you are laid back and do n\u2019t mind the resort being dated you can have a great time because the people are wonderful. Our 2 bedroom room was very clean and spacious for a family of five. Keep in mind it is not a luxurious high end four star resort but the people at the vacation club and on st Kits island are amazing people. Friendly educated and speak perfect English. We went to some amazing restaurants on the island too. Final note my daughter turned 12 at the resort and the vacation club team had a large cake and balloons card and tshirt for her in our room. We are always away on school break for her birthday and this place did the best job of making it special for her. Thank you vacation club. I hope the Mariot invests in property improvements.
