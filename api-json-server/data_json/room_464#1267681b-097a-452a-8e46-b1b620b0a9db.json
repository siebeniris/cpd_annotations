This hotel is very close to the main routes around Jerusalem and the light rail. The Knesset Israeli Parliament and the Museum are also a short distance away. I stayed here because it was also the venue for a conference that I had to attend. The rooms were average with nothing exceptional to remember. The menu for breakfast and dinner appeared to remain absolutely the same for 7 full days which was not only boring but the food was bland. There was a variety of meat dishes on offer but it was as if they were devoid of flavour. I ate purely for sustenance and took every opportunity to eat out. I am mindful of Sabbath and Jewish holidays but this was my first ever experience in Israel where I felt that I was given a raw deal for not being Jewish. During Sabbath Friday night dinner Saturday breakfast and dinner the main restaurant was closed off to those of us who were not Jewish or at least Orthodox and we were served in a smaller hall styled venue. I have no idea if the food was the same but it remained uninspiring. There is free wi fi for about 2 hours in the hotel lobby or you must pay for this service to be available in your room. The aircon was faulty did not heat and made a intrusive amount of noise.

The annual conference of Jewish Genealogy was held at the Ramada Hotel Jerusalem this year. It is a an annual conference held at different venues mainly in the USA and occasional in European cities. I was hesitant to write this review because I could not find anything good to report which made me feel very uncomfortable. On arrival I drove up to the main foyer. The security guard sat at his post and told me that I should take my bags out and leave them with him while I parked the car in the basement. He sat there watch me lug my suitcases out and never left his chair for a moment. I ask him if there was a porter and he pointed to a desk inside. I went to look and there was no one there. This guard never got off his chair to help me and watched me put everything on the pavement. I them parked my car in the basement. The smell in the basement was overwhelmingly discusting. Rotting garbage and sewerage. I went to collect the bags with a porter and then I checked in. The check in was not bad. Certainly not warm and friendly. I got to my room and the electronic key did not work and so the porter went down to change it for me. The room was on the 9th floor and near to the lift a nice plus. The rooms are fairly large and furnished about 30 to 40 years ago. old and shabby. There is a desk chair and a coffee table with one reading chair in a double room for two people. The bathroom was ok. Cheap products and a shower. The shower had a very poor shower head but all this did not both me. I ran the shower and up came the smell from the basement. Awful and discusting. There was black mould on the sealant and round the glass partition on the tiles. The electronic key only worked once. I started having to go back down stairs to get it reconected everytime I came back to the room. I got the regular key and used that for the rest of the week. Enough with all this. The food was overpriced badly prepared and generally inedible. It takes some doing to mess up a toasted cheese sandwich and chips. The bill was 60shekels with a bottle water. A complete rip off. Then came breakfast. the usual Israeli fare but pared down to the minimum and poorly prepared. The waiters were un obliging and surly and most unhelpful. I felt I was intruding on their time just by asking a question. The chaos reigned in the hotel which being a polite way of saying it was awful. Lunch was much of the same. The housekeeping was ok when the came which was late in the day which suited me. Mostly the attitude of the staff was bad. They either ignored you made you feel like they were doing you a favor and in the end I just did not bother with them. I can not name one smily face. I have no idea why the conference was held there.

The a c turned off automatically even when I was in the room sleeping. They are strictly kosher so there are two different restaurants.

Unsanitary and unsafe conditions of the Royal Crown HotelWe returned from Israel on Wednesday night December 30 2015. We took a tour by Cosmos. Amiel. and for three nights we were put in the filthiest most unsafe terrible hotel that we have ever seen. The Royal Crown hotel in Jerusalem. It should be shut down. See my posts on Travel Advisor. Our tour was excellent but we dreaded going back to the awful hotel The Royal Crown Hotel. It spoiled our trip. The staircase did not have access to the floors it was a fire hazard with no stairwell exit. The four elevators did not work so the wait at the elevator was up to 15 minutes. In front of the elevators was trash such as plastic bottles wrappers and other garbage. It had been there for some time. Since the stairwell did n\u2019t open to the floors we were trapped to non functioning elevators in a field of trash. See photos. We were shown four rooms that were all awful. We travel a lot for business and personal trips and stay at hotels a few times a month all over the world. We usually stay in Hampton Inns a level three to four hotel. so we are not comparing this hotel to luxury. We have never seen such a filthy hotel. It would not even be a one star. The first room after we waded through the trash in the hallway was shocking with substandard accommodation. The room floors were so dirty that it was obviously old dirt. It looked like sand on the rug. See photos. There was heavy black mold in the bathroom on the walls and shower curtain. The bathroom door was all banged up and looked splintered. There was something sticky on the bathroom shelf that had obviously not been cleaned. There was no mattress pad on the bed and the sheets were so old and thin and tady that the mattress looked bare. The blanket on the bed had something wet black and sticky on it. Gross. See photo. When we first saw the room we went downstairs immediately and asked for a cleaner room. Our travel guide Rafi was at the reception desk waiting for the receptionist. It took 15 minutes for her to appear. She came from the adjoining Ramada Hotel. We seemed to be in the back hotel of Ramada. It was very awful. We told the receptionist and Rafi that the room was not acceptable. She offered us another room across from the first room upon Rafi \u2019s suggestion. Director of Housekeeping Asad was called and I insisted that he and Rafi go upstairs with us. Rafi our tour guide asked the receptionist why the stairwells were locked. She did n\u2019t have an answer. In the second room on the fourth floor there was a large black spider the size of a bat which I thought it was. It came at me aggressively when I moved the curtain to get air in the room. Actually I thought that it was a bat or mouse the way it moved but my husband and the head of housekeeping Asad who had come with us to the room said that it was a spider with many legs. I was busy screaming so I could n\u2019t tell. It then went under the bed but Asad and my husband lifted the bed and could n\u2019t find it. Under the bed was a nightmare of years of filth. The shower curtain in this room had just been taken out of a package since you could see that it was still with folds so it was clean. The room smelled of a chemical and was very hot. The television and the table lights did n\u2019t work so Asad went to see why the lights did n\u2019t work except for the overhead. He tired to call the desk but the room phone did n\u2019t work. As he went down the hall to check on the electricity and to contact the front desk from another phone my husband went to use the bathroom and found blood or diarrhea dripping down on and around the toilet seat. When Asad came back we showed him so he washed it and the floor that was also soiled. Obviously we were n\u2019t going to stay in that room either. The third room on the seventh floor was a little cleaner. The bath did n\u2019t have black mold or blood on the toilet seat. However before Asad left I checked the corner of the mattress for bed bugs and there were many bloodstains on the mattress signs of bed bugs and not a clean mattress pad either. Asad noted it and suggested that we go to another room. Besides it would have been uncomfortable to be on the seventh floor since there was no stairwell access and the elevators were so slow. It was a safety issue in the event of an emergency. We had now been there for over two hours. It was about 10 PM and we did n\u2019t have a room. Asad suggested that we take a room on the first floor. It was a suite. We did n\u2019t need or care to have a suite. We only wanted a clean safe room. The suite was somewhat cleaner. A curtain was hanging off the wall precariously but Asad reatached and fixed it. The mattress had a mattress cover. The sheets were standard quality unlike the other ones. The bathroom did n\u2019t have mold and there did n\u2019t appear to be any bed bugs. It did n\u2019t look real clean but better in comparison to the other rooms. We were n\u2019t happy with the room but exhausted we needed to get to bed. My husband is 77 years old and has terminal illness. He was exhausted and we did n\u2019t know where to go for another hotel especially that late at night so we took the room. However again our room did n\u2019t have electricity to sockets or TV. The room was extremely hot. The thermostat did n\u2019t work. We had to open the window to breath. Asad called a technician to fix the electricity issues and heat. The technician came but he could only fix the electricity. The heat was up to 80 degrees in the room. Since my husband has kidney issues the excess heat was a health hazard for him. We opened the window and worried about something coming into the room. I could n\u2019t sleep all night from fear of bugs the heat and the filth. The next day when we left for breakfast we saw the male room maids folding the bath towels on the carpet in front of the elevators. How filthy. I ca n\u2019t make this stuff up. When we got to breakfast the salads had no sneeze guards and the hot foods were cold so we could n\u2019t eat the food. We could only eat bread and have the hot coffee since we were afraid of becoming sick. Another couple from our tour was at breakfast with photos of their room towels that were soiled with black marks and holes. They complained to Rafi our tour guide. Everyone was freaked out by the filth of the hotel and lack of quality of the food preparation. Rafi \u2019s explanation was that we were supposed to have been upgraded to the nicer part of the Ramada hotel. The Ramada was n\u2019t even the hotel that was on the schedule. We were supposed to have been at another hotel around the corner although it said in the brochure that hotels might be switched. I can accept that. We could not accept the filth and unsafe conditions of the Royal Crown hotel. On the third night yes we were stuck in this hotel for three nights when we needed to call reception around midnight no one answered at the reception desk security catering or guest services for over 30 minutes of our calling all numbers and letting each ring for over 5 minutes very dangerous. We were calling for help because there was a group of students sitting on the floor in the hallway in front of our door singing and joking until 130 AM. We were too tired to get dressed then wait 15 minutes for the elevator to go to the reception desk and report it. There was never anyone at the reception desk there anyway. I did report it the next morning in front of Rafi and asked to speak to the general manager Yacor Shari. He never appeared. There was only a very young woman at reception who was not capable of handling our complaint. She said that the manager was not working at that time. The hotel was such an awful experience it spoiled an otherwise lovely tour. We have filed formal complaints with Israeli tourism and the Israeli health department and of course Travelocity as well as Cosmos Amiel travel company for exposing us to such a below standard unsanitary and unsafe accommodation. The other hotels on this trip were fine not fancy but clean and comfortable. The Royal Crown Hotel should be shutdown by the health department. Israel should be ashamed to expect guests to stay there. What a blight to tourism. We hope to be refunded by Cosmos for the horrible unsafe and unsanitary conditions that we were exposed.

I have recently been travelling through Jordan and Egypt and now I am touring Israel. In the last 4 weeks I have stayed in 3 Airbnbs and 8 hotels. The hotels were all supposed to be 4 star or better and we are arranged by the tour organiser. In Jordan one of the hotels certainly did not make the 4 star rating and unfortunately nor does the Ramada. It certainly has the appearance of a nice hotel in the lobby but it ends there. I am the sort of person happy to let most things slide. I just want to enjoy the travel. I have visited 13 countries over almost 6 decades so I am not newbie. I do not spend a lot of time in my room other than to shower and sleep so usually as long as the bed and bathroom are clean I am OKBut once you have something you can not let slide then all the issues I am willing to overlook come to the fore. My first room was a little grotty. Pink mould in the shower recess some poorly fixed tiles stains on the desk chair wooden furniture last dusted and polished when Moses was a boy and weeks old pile up of bird droppings on the balcony. The key card entry required a few goes to register. The furniture and decor is looking pretty tired. But I figured it is fine the beds look clean and the rooms are spacious and have a work desk as well as a separate lounge chair and table. The buffet for dinner was pretty good and staff were friendly and fairly prompt taking your used dishes away. Then I went to have a shower. The bit which holds the shower up against the wall was broken so that the shower head and tube were draped over the soap holder. I could not stand under the shower I had to hold the shower head with one hand. That was disappointing especially when you know. if the shower was cleaned after the last guest housekeeping should have identified it was broken and reported it to maintenance. But it was late and I just wanted to get to bed. I showered in the morning as well and the same deal. On the way to breakfast I reported the problem to the front desk. I saw the guy write a note so I felt reassured it would get fixed while I was out all day. When I returned about 6 pm my key card would not operate the door. I went back down to the lobby queued at the poorly staffed reception desk and finally got served. The guy simply re programmed the card. Unfortunately that did not work either. So I went back down queued again. Incidentally they do not have an obvious place at the desk to queue so it was easy for pushy people to push in. Again I let that slide but now I am reviewing it is another example of poor service standards. I eventually got to the desk to explain the problem and I got issued another key card. Again it did not work. I was heading to the lobby again when a house keeping guy came out of the lift. I wanted him to check my door with his master key to see if the problem is with my card or with the door. Instead he tried my card three or four times just as I had confirming the fault. Then he vigorously pulled the handle upwards as against down to open the door. He held the handle up while inserting the card behold we got the green light allowing us to open the door. He said sometimes the key card reader has a problem and we do this. It did not sound like he had be suggesting to maintenance that it needs fixing. That means it is likely future guests will have to go through the same problem. I get into the room and the first thing I wanted to do was make a coffee even though I knew it was pretty bad coffee. Problem was the coffee facilities had not been restocked there was no coffee or creamer to be had. So I checked the bathroom. I could tell no one had come to inspect the shower let alone fix it. Very disappointing. that is when I noticed that housekeeping had taken the dirty towel bath mat and two face cloths but had not replaced them. That was the last straw so I went down to the front desk again. I explained all the issues. I figured he would make a call to housekeeping and get the issues resolved while I was at dinner. But instead he suggested I change rooms and allocated another room on the same floor giving me a new key card. Up I go again and pack all my things to transfer to another room. The minute I walked in to the room I recognised the disgusting smell of a room which had been occupied for some time by a smoker. Which is pretty amazing as the hotel is listed as a no smoking hotel. It probably does not help that they have a built in ashtray on the balcony and no no smoking signs in the room. Six hours later with the balcony door open the whole time and the room still smells. This tells me that the smell has been embedded in the carpet walls and ceiling over a long time. I do not like it and will have to put up with the traffic noise to get fresh air while I sleep but I really do not want the hassle of changing rooms again. The unfortunate thing is I have three nights to go.", "offset": [4179, 4244], "date": "2018-07-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "c8a9bf14-6fd1-485d-9161-2bd2aac44143", "sentence": "Okay.
