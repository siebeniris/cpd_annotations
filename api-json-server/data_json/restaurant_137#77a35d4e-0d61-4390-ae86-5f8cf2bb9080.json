We tried The Green Room for dinner as we can not justify 40 60 for a steak at the posher Council Oaks but next time we will as The Green Room fried shrimp were frozen rubbish and my wifes fresh salmon came with mashed brown gravy who ever heard of brown gravy with fish. We both said that 50 cost may have been better spent at Council Oaks. The bar liquor and cocktails were not very expensive and the room service breakfast really nice.

Tub is deep and was perfect for a luxurious bubble bath. Tub and Toilet separated from a wonderful counter space with 2 sinks. Staff throughout was awesome.

On Tuesday 52615 my wife 2 kids and I went as it was our anniversary. It was literally 15mins before a server acknowledged us and took our drink order. After that my 1yr old daughter ordered a risotto dish at the Italian station. The risotto was raw and hard and upon returning it to the chef there were 2 other diners returning their dishes as well. The other stations has food that looked old and dried out and the service continued to be slow and it seemed as though they were more concerned with cleaning up than serving customers. At one point there was a crew of 3 people running a floor cleaning machine and waived me off as I tried to get to one of the food stations.

I never was offered a beverage by anyone. I also sat waiting for technical service for over 20 min at a slot called Gold Winners which is a spinof of the blazing triple sevens games. First I wanted to lodge a complaint about my comps being rescinded at some time during a substantial absence from the casino over 6 months. Second I had hit 2 rows of blue sevens. Every possible payline 15 of themwas flushed with 7s a natural screen fill win no wilds. Paid back my bet and not a penny more. The croupier had no clue how to calculate 201 the posted payout for each payline on a 040 bet. I tried to explain the identical nature of the payouts by payline but she was insistent that she needed to add each line. I saw that her very progressive employer let her be the level of stupid to which she felt entitled so I followed suit. The wait to get satisfaction was far more costly than the prospective 740 correction. Now before I continue know that I have at times in my life worked as a waiter head waiter sommelier banquet captain and floor manager in some of the finest restaurants in a top national top 5 metro area by population home to the premier post graduate hospitality management program on the planet and aside from Vegas and NYC is the best overall food scene in the US and can boast the most knowledgeable most vibrant and most service conscious market for hotels and restaurants without qualification. I know how this business works at the single proprietorship level and in the world of multinational conglomerates. This smells like a dicey consultancy engagements HR shakeup being either tested or implemented on the floor at this backwater adjacent consumptive outlet of a massive chain of entertainment services supply. So disarmingly personable was this person while simultaneously exhibiting a disinterested and helpless ignorance that was as complete in its scope as it was instantly crushing of my resolve to get the money I was owed that I do not think one could convince me that this service interaction was not the result of concerted hiring and training directives that could only originate in the executive level of corporate administration or consultancy thereto. Put simply no individual on this planet can actually be the level of confidently stupid I witnessed and still reliably shoe themselves for bipedal locomotion in the event the mouth breathing simpleton has advanced that far. Much less can that level of buffoonery be accompanied by the easy smoothly timed almost convivial manner in which this person convinced me that I could not do anything to be made whole which would not also be damaging to my soul or my wallet or more likely both. It was a value call. Lolol. As far as my comps are concerned I will have to talk to someone at player services which is about as enjoyable as waiting for the return money services counter at the most urban of Sam Waltons multicultural retail emporia. I am not looking forward to that one bit. But those oatmeal raisin cookies at Rise Bakery are otherworldly even if I would summarily fire about 70 of the dismal staff and automate their jobs. I still go to the Hard Rock because of those cookies.
