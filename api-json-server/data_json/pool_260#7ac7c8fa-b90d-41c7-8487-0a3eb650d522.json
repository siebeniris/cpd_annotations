I have traveled quite a bit over last few years and also use the site to book trips so I need to start giving back. 2nd trip to LeBlanc for myself. Once in 2010 and then just this last week. 4 Night Trip felt like it was just the right amount of time. The 1 thing about LeBlanc is that you never want for anything. Anything you need then can deliver. No matter if it was something in the room at one of the restaurants or at the pool. Always someone was there to make it happen. While the rooms are expensive you easily get you moneys worth with the service top shelf drinks and quality of food. We normally stay at 4 or 5 hotels. The rooms are just as nice but then you pay for 15 per drink. that is the best part of LeBlanc. 5 Rooms and all inclusive food and drink. Best part of the trip is the Spa. Make sure you use your credits for a massage then also trip to hit the spa even just to use the hydrotherapy each day. I am not a fan of All Inclusive places except LeBlanc.

If you are going to spend 7 nights at a Palace Resort such as the all inclusive adults only 18 years or older. Le Blanc Spa Resort in Cancun I \u2019d suggest that you make the hotel reservation through a Diamond member to get VIP benefits including 1 free airport transfers 2 3 tours person that do not come out of your resort credits or have a room charge you can choose from Tulum Express Chitchen Itza or Wet\u2019N Wild excluding the Ultimate Dolphin Swim 3 a 25minute back massage per person 4 a 25minute Manicure Palace per person 5 a 25minute Pedicure Palace per person that does not come out of your resort credits or have a room charge and 6 a 20 discount on additional spa services. If you have a credit card that does n\u2019t charge a foreign transaction fee use it for the hotel reservation since it goes through Mexico City. David Dealy e mail. GDavidDeagmailcom. is a Diamond member who offers VIP benefits. He has access to Royal Deluxe Suites at Le Blanc and rooms at other Palace Resorts. By making reservations for people he gets free time share weeks that he can sell thereby allowing him to offer the rooms at 20 off. Not all Diamond members provide a 20 discount so choose wisely. We stayed at Le Blanc from July 5 2015 to July 12 2015. We upgraded from a Royale Deluxe Suite 429 sq. ft. and by far the most common room to a Royale Junior Suite which is 46 sq. ft. with 2 small balconies and a partial ocean view. There was only one sink and not a lot of counter space in the bathroom which can be a problem for some couples. In between these rooms in terms of price is a Royale Honeymoon Suite that is 412 sq. ft. The Royale Governor Suite which is much larger at 861 sq. ft was not available during our stay. This was n\u2019t surprising since there are only a handful of these rooms. The small room was the only downside to our stay at Le Blanc. Secrets Maroma Beach in Cancun has larger suites eg 624 sq. ft. The Preferred Club there offers services similar to Le Blanc. The Excellence Playa Mujeres has even larger rooms eg 807 sq. ft. Many of the tours are only offered on certain days of the week. As a result we made our reservations by e mail ahead of the trip through a Le Blanc concierge Veronica Lara Bolivar e mail marketinglbcleblancsparesortcom. She was very helpful. You do n\u2019t have to wait until you arrive to make tour spa or Lumiere dinner reservations. On average resorts in Cancun have 13 employees per room. In contrast Le Blanc has 26 employees per room the hotel is 10 years old and has 260 rooms. If an employee provides outstanding service you should consider filling out a comment card with the person \u2019s name on it. If that individual accumulates enough favorable comments he or she can receive a free weekend at a Palace Resort. The Blanc Gym is very nice for a resort. The only classes that you need to make a reservation for are spinning and TRX. The gym was moderately busy in the morning and pretty much empty in the afternoon and evening. Considering the amount of food and drinks that are served my friend and I visited the gym every day in order to avoid gaining weight. In terms of restaurants Blanc Italia and Blanc International are excellent Lumiere French food and the only restaurant that you need a reservation for is very good and Blanc Asia and the snack bars by each of the 3 pools are fine. If you \u2019d like an excellent meal and a cooking demonstration I \u2019d recommend that you do the Chef \u2019s dinner which is only offered at 6 pm on Wednesday nights. It \u2019s run by Marco the head chef who is talented and quite funny. In terms of evening entertainment the Michael Jackson show Tuesday night and Lights and Fire show Thursday night were enjoyable. The piano concerts were also well done. Tipping is optional and elevates the service that you receive from excellent to truly outstanding. Tips are greatly appreciated by the staff. I understand that the resort is much busier in the winter than in the summer. Most of the guests in July were from the United States Mexico and Japan. I\u2019d summarize Le Blanc as having small rooms compared with Secrets Maroma Beach and Excellence Playa Mujeres but excellent service and food. Guests could spend their entire time at Le Blanc without leaving the resort and have a wonderful pampered vacation.", "offset": [139, 711], "date": "2015-07-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "1c2bbc1e-799a-4e45-b669-983b16bfcf9c", "sentence": "Outstanding Property Worthy of the 5 Diamond Award.

We were transferred here from the Moon Palace and staff were definitely nicer it could be because of our experience with the other resort. Beach was absolutely amazing. There were still a few seaweeds but the water looked and felt stunning. Our butler Carlos first floor was absolutely awesome to have a spot set up for our group by the beach. The food by the beach was really good and filling. It still bugs me however that all they can say is my pleasure. what is wrong with saying you are welcome or de nada just to make it feel more authentic. Cancun is just very touristy I have heard it before I just thought I had experience a little authenticity in the city. Most of us got to experience releasing baby green turtle which is definitely once so far in a lifetime experience for us. it felt really great. There are big green turtles that lay their eggs around 11 pm so do not turn your flash on when taking pictures or recording a video. They provided lunch box for people going to the Chichen Itza excursion because of the 25 hrs of travelling to destination. Although it is one of the Palace Resort I did not see anyone with different colored bracelets which did not identify the members. It is absolutely quieter than Moon Palace without the kids adult only resort and pools are cleaner and are open later. Room service was more organized and cleaner as they would ask you to call for pick up once you are done instead of telling you to leave it outside. was not able to try out all restaurant though because we were only here half the week and was unable to book a reservation for the French restaurant. The lady at the Blancintl was phenomenal they entire time she was all by herself and was able to do her best to cater to everyone.

I stayed here for 5 night from Sunday April 24th Friday April 29th. This was my second time staying at Le Blanc Spa Resort in the past 5 years. Le Blanc is without a doubt the Class of Cancun. From the facility to the restaurants to the service. So I will not repeat what others have written in pervious reviews. But I will provide you with helpful tips so you can make the most out of your stay here. Rooms I have twice stayed in the Honeymoon suite. The room is very nice but the jacuzi takes up about 13 of the room. So if you are not going to use it every day you might want to consider staying in another room type. Also an ocean view is certainly nice but unles you are staying in the room all day looking out your window you might want to consider the lagoon view. Especially if you are on a budget. They have LG televisions with apple tv capabilities. My wife also said the resort wifi was very fast. Resort Credits First and foremost you will be paying tax on items purchased with these credits. For example if you have 150 credits you will be paying around 250 usd. Something to budget for. Also the resort does not hide this fact just the opposite they make it very clear how much tax you will be paying for each item purchased. So there are no surprises at check out. Also any resort credits not use are good up to one year. Restaurants. Dress code There is a dress code for all restaurants. Men long pants and close toe shoes. Women can wear sandals. Breakfast and lunch buffet is casual. Blancinternacional there is a morning and lunch buffet. Dinner is a la cart. There is patio seating and for lunch there are frozen ice cream sandwiches and popsicles. Good for taking down to the pool. Lumiere There is a dress code and reservations required. They book up fast so do not wait until the last minute. You have to do outside through the main pool area to get to the entrance. Also there is a strong draft the goes through the restaurant when the doors open. So you might want to bring a light sweater. There is a tasting menu with wine parings that take around 2 hours or you can order a la carte. Blancterace outdoor casual restaurant located on the 3rd floor. Serving pizzas and sandwiches. Room Service 24 hours a day. Also they have those cards that you can preorder with and hang on your door. First delivery time is 60am. Good to use if you are planning an early tour. Beach and Pool areas You do not have to worry about the towel game here. Sure a few people will come down early and reserve a spot or two. But it is not like at other resorts. You will be able to get a chair. The sun is super strong in Cancun and you will burn FAST. Bring lots of sunblock and a hat if you have thinning hair. Pools there are 3. The main pool the 3rd floor pool and the lagoon pool. It is super quite on the lagoon side. Beach look for the servers with the blue shirts the will get you your umbrella and chairs. They set them up as needed. Cabanas they are limited so reserve early. Costs around 300 credits and 40 usd tax. Comes with a bottle of Moet Chardon Imperial. If you do not want to drink it at the beach they will be happy to send it to your room. Activities get the Blanc newsletter. let us you know what is going on each day. Entertainment this will be located on the 3rd floor at the Blanc Stage. A live band plays on Sundays and Wednesdays and there is a music DJ on the other nights. I have to say the music DJ is really good. He will take your requests and caters to the crowd. Shows and music start at 930 pm. Cabs there is a cart down stair that will let you know how much it will cost to get you to where you want to go. Located near the front entrance. Staff they are all very eager to help. But the following really stood out. Veronica Bolivar telemarketing. I contacted her through e mail before my trip. She helped me with cabana and restaurant reservations. Lucinda at the pool area. And Me Ka 3rd floor housekeeping. Not proud to say that my room was a mess each morning and Me Ka made it shine when I returned each afternoon. My only suggestion it would be nice to have a coffee caf\u00e9. So each morning and through out the day you can be able to get starbucks like drinks. Lastly this is a very upscale spa like resort.

Le Blanc is the best resort in the region leaving others in its wake. I had an outstanding second stay this time for a trip with friends. They handled every detail of our complicated arrangements flawlessly and with ease from our private white glove transfers to room arrangements to having their high end complimentary beach bags for each of us to birthday and dinner reservations. Service at Le Blanc is polished rapid and unparalleled at other resorts where intrusive often substitutes for attentive. Staff is warm and helpful at Le Blanc but they do not need to be your friends or family. They have their own to which they go home. They just want to make your stay perfect and at that they succeed. In a week I can not think of a service slip. In comparison to our first stay the resort was far more crowded this visit so they had many more opportunities. As compared to our March visit the Gulf was a lot calmer in July. It was lovely to be able to enjoy time in the water with only gentle waves. Beach and pool service were comparably excellent. WiFi was strong on the beach now with no signal on our visit 4 years ago. If you spend time at the pool you are rewarded with surprise treats cucumber slices for your eyes with towels soaked in a eucalyptus ice bath for an eye mask to cool you down along with a scalp massage homemade mini Popsicles delivered by the butlers and colorful drinks of the day floated to you on a surfboard in the pool. Drinks are made with fresh fruit fresh ingredients and housemade mixers. They are potent. Top Shelf is available at every bar. Unlike resorts that aim to be like Le Blanc there is a reason you will never see anyone write that Le Blanc drinks are anything but full potency. You do not have to go to the one mojito bar at Le Blanc to get a mojito or any other drink muddled or blended with fresh fruit. That is the norm at every bar. Some favorites from this trip were the Grey Goose Frozen Blueberry the Don Julio Gold Margarita and the Cucumber Caipirinha. Food at Le Blanc is the best I have had at an AI in Mexico though comparable to the also excellent Royal Hideaway Le Blanc beats Royal Hideaway in every other category. The French and Italian shine. The Asian has shockingly good sushi as good as my favorite sushi spots at home in DC. Lunch service pool and beach side were both served quickly and hot. We liked the brick oven pizza and salads at the 3rd floor pool. Though a quieter resort not intended for the rowdy crowd BlancStage is a fun evening venue with good cover bands DJs and theme nights. We enjoyed it a great deal most nights. The spa is stellar and beautiful. This time we used the fabulously easy to use valuable resort credits on an 80minute Relaxation Massage and an 80 minute deep tissue. We combined the 2 free 25min back massages you get by booking through a Palace member into a 50min. I highly recommend massage therapist Marta. The rooms appointments and views at Le Blanc are beyond compare. If you are someone looking for towel sculptures or rice art grain designs all over your bed or floor you may not like Le Blanc. If you want the best mattress on which you may have ever slept luxury products salon quality hair dryers and straighteners Apple TV fully stocked minibars and liquor cabinet that can be changed out with the selections of your choice homemade petit fours delivered to your suite with turn down and so much more then you might be the kind of person who appreciates the Le Blanc experience. Of course if you want to avail yourself of butler service you have 2 butlers there from 7 am to 11 pm who would be so glad to unpack for you iron clothing get you ice prep a jacuzi with rose petals and bath salts chill champagne bring you a forgotten item from your room to the pool meet you at your convenient time and location to reconfirm your flight and transfer arrangements and so much more. I highly recommend Le Blanc for a 5star stay. We travel all over and choose all different levels of travel experiences for different trip desires. we have been to so many of the alleged luxury properties in the greater Cancun region and they are providing a childs approximation of what Le Blanc offers seamlesly in terms of food and drink quality polished service spa experience and room appointments.

We chose this resort based on several glowing reviews on Trip Advisor and other travel websites. I am pleased to say that we were completely blown away by the level of service provided and the friendly staff. This is an unbelievable resort \u2026 very elegant and sophisticated. The resort lived up to its reputation in every way. From the moment we were escorted from the airport to the resort in a private vehicle until we exited the resort we were greeted treated and pampered with great food and service. Each person we interacted with had a pleasant demeanor and wanted to fulfill our requests quickly. Jesica and Judith at the concierge desk were amazing. Our butlers Carlos Marco and Mauricio were some of the most delightful people I \u2019ve ever met \u2026 always had a smile on their face and willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs. Our rooms were kept immaculately clean cleaning service was done 3 times a day with fully stocked mini bar and other amenities. We were constantly supplied with bottles of wine champagne and exotic chocolates in our room. The breakfast buffet is not to be missed. It was extensive and sumptuous able to satisfy every palette and dietary concern. Loved the fresh fruit juice pastries desserts \u2026 we tasted almost everything. The state of the art Spa was incredibly relaxing. another experience you must not miss and even if you do not get a massage hydrotherapy is included with your stay and it was so nice. it is a few types of steam rooms a face mask Jacuzi jets on your feet and then a full body Jacuzi. all while they serve you hibiscus water in a champagne glass. I loved it. We did aroma essence and four hand massage \u2026. it was heavenly. The Aroma Essence therapist Aura was very well trained and did a phenomenal job. Unfortunately I do n\u2019t remember the names of my four hand massage therapists they were incredible too. I thought the infinity pool was just breathtakingly beautiful. The polside and swim up bar service was excellent thanks to the hardworking crew. There were plenty of chairs towels and food served in the polside area. We would recommend the cabana on the beach. They serve you good lunch and Jair and Jesus provided excellent services. We did not have to lift a finger. We also did the romantic dinner on the beach good way to spend your extra resort credits. The dinner was excellent and service paced perfectly so not to rush. Perfect white powder sand with a stunning turquoise ocean \u2026. al in all a magical place \u2026 luxury at its finest and worth the price tag. I have to say that this was by far the best holiday experience we have had and the hotel and staff have everything to do with it. The folks I \u2019ve mentioned above contribute a great deal toward making this a world class resort and an unforgettable experience for travelers like us. Thank you Le Blanc for making our 10th Anniversary a truly memorable experience.

Let me count the ways THE BEACHThe beach on the property is as aqua blue as you would imagine in any daydream of a fantasy beach. The water is clear the sand is white powder. There is a lifeguard on duty because the waves can be quite rough like all hotels in this stretch of Cancun. THE POLSGorgeous infinity pool overlooking the picturesque beach. When you are in the main pool you feel as if you are on the beach. The main pool has a pool bar which is quite elegant and easy to access a drink when the mood strikes. There is another pool on a higher level which is smaller but has less guests generally with a phenomenal view of the ocean as well. There is also another pool which has no view of the ocean but is rather tranquil and lovely and this pool also has a lovely pool bar where you would not have to wait more than 2 minutes to have the perfect drink crafted for you. THE FODI am a New York City foodie who has taken courses at the Culinary Institute of America and I am here to tell you the food is SPECTACULARThere is an Italian restaurant an Asian restaurant and a French restaurant. We ate at each and the food was gourmet and what you would expect to pay a bill of 300 at least in New York City without alcohol. And it is all inclusive. amazingBut the buffet. Holy Cow how that buffet shines. For breakfast and lunch. You think how great could a buffet be. It is the most top quality ingredients prepared in the most flavorful way and so much variety your biggest problem will really be which food should I eat because I only have so much room in my stomach. There are grill stations with omelettes in the morning and at lunch prime cuts of beef fabulous fresh seafood and chicken or pork to get grilled but there are also tons of other wonderful food options. I am having Mole and tamale withdrawal. There are many other non Mexican options those just happened to be one of my superb favorites. And save room for dessert. this die hard chocoholic is pleased to say there were a variety of handmade artisanal chocolates at the lunch buffet that I am on a diet for now. they were Payard quality and outstanding. And the buffet is what transitions me to my next category THE STAFThe most OUTSTANDING staff of anywhere I have ever been in my life. There is never a moment that you will wish for anything that there will not be a staff member there to help you with and when they do they will always say it is my pleasure. And you actually believe they mean it. They take such great pride in the resort and there is a reason why Le Blanc has consistently been Trip Advisors number one for so long it is the stafI have Celiac Disease which means I can not eat gluten. The first day I was at the resort I was meandering around the buffet trying to figure out what I could eat. There are little symbols on the descriptions to note gluten free but I had not figured that out yet. One of the chefs approached me and asked if I needed help. Chef Severiano. I explained I could not have gluten and he asked me if it would be okay if he made me something special. I said sure. He asked me what I liked how I liked things cooked and also walked with me around the buffet to show me some things that were gluten free that I might like while I waited for him to cook me something. Every day Chef Severiano would see me coming and bring me the most extraordinary dishes for lunch based on my preferences and being gluten free. From a jump of your plate taste sensation of seafood ceviche tostada to a flambe d shrimp and vegetable dish that was to die for it was like I had the most fabulous private chef every day and he always had a smile and made my day. We had a butlers on our floor that would tend to any need that came up like booking airport transfers to filling the diffuser in your room so you would have relaxing scents to fall asleep to. There was never a moment you had to worry about anything. Our one butler in particular was so outstanding I am really having a hard time adjusting to life without him. His name was Jesus and Jesus you are phenomenal at your job. Thank youI wish I could name every staff member that made our trip so special but there is not enough room on this website. Every staff member is so kind tries so hard to make you happy in every way. You feel like you are part of their family when you are there. IN CONCLUSIONThis resort is the best of the best. I had the wonderful opportunity to be here in 201 and always wanted to go back and was hoping it would live up to how I remembered it. It did in every way and I can not wait to go back. I cried the last time on the way to the airport when I left and I cried this time on the way to the airport when I left. it is that good. I hate to mention anything negative but just because I love the resort so much I feel the need to post this here to help. I am an advanced yoga practitioner for many years. I was thrilled you offered the paddle yoga classes in the morning. Most of the people taking the paddle yoga class and the regular yoga class are beginners some first timers. One of the yoga instructors for the paddle yoga was fine and doing beginner yoga. The other one who did not have a great command of English was instructing people to do quite dangerous poses including a headstand on the padleboard. The people who were in the class with me were beginners and did not know better and were trying to do a headstand and flopping over. This is quite dangerous and someone could really get hurt. Also the yoga class in the gym needs to be reviewed as it is too fast with dangerous poses and not appropriate for beginning students who could get hurt. I LOVE LE BLANC.

Le Blanc gets great reviews on TA which is why we chose the place. Staff were so friendly and tried to be as helpful as possible. Rooms were nice. No balconies but a large picture window that could be opened up so that the back part of the room could sort of function as a balcony. Excellent pool area and spa. Umbrellas available on the beach. Dining was a mess. By the time we arrived restaurant reservation options were limited. The food was mostly very good but took hours to be served even if we said we did not want to spend hours eating. Outside regular meals lots of drink but very limited food options. Essentially nothing walk up. And for a top end resort the house wine selections were pitiful. Resort gimmick is that they give you in our case 750 towards resort expenses. Turns out that only 250 can be used for the spa which is an 80 min massage or equivalent. The rest is relatively useless for anything substantive. When we arrived one of the departing guests was arguing with the staff about the policies so we knew what to expect.

From the moment you check in to the sad moment you leave you will be pampered entertained and made to feel at home. We stayed for 12 night in the governor suite which is spacious luxurious and has the benefit of a wonderful balcony.

It was great to see Hugo and Javier who have been my butlers on previous visits. Remembered me straight away and always there with a friendly hello and smile when I saw them around the resort. My favourite part of the day breakfast. The guys in the international buffet breakfast work so hard they are busy yet always time for fun jokes and make a great start to the day. Especially Marco Armando Manuel Roberto Juan pourquito chiquito bonito. Elias Marcelino Candelario. I \u2019m sorry if I missed anyone as you are all so wonderful Vanessa and Gabriela were so lovely and welcoming and knew our room number after day one and asked which of our favourite waiters we would like to sit with each day. Isabel cooks amazing eggs and omelettes each day and always is so cheery even when she \u2019s so busy. Edgar thanks for your amazing service not just in the French restaurant but wherever we saw you around the resort o o. Fredy Luis and Paulina in the bar thank you for the lovely drinks and the fun and smiles every day. Also there was another fantastic guy handsome great hair and braces. I \u2019m so sorry I forgot your name but you were wonderful too. I included a picture of you. We had a cabana for 2 days and Victor Daniel and David offered amazing service all day. I do n\u2019t know how you all stay so speedy and friendly running around in the heat all day but thank you. The lagoon pool Adiel Ofriei Juan Carlos and Michele ti amo. You guys looked after us so well. The lovely Joe for helping us get taxis and for the lovely cool water and smiles.

Jesus pool manager personally went out of his way to get me the exact coconut milk I needed for my drink. It was an odd special request but he met it with great pleasure. He is a great guy. Heriberto from the pool was the HARDEST worker at the resort. Hands down. I would PROMOTE him above anyone else. Now. He remembered every special request brought chairs towels ice water drinks sunscreen pool floats. He runs around all day in the blazing heat and always has a smile on his face. It \u2019s amazing to see. HE is the reason we love LeBlanc. Made me like a million bucks. Alejandro spa manager was the most accommodating manager. I had a less than fortunate experience at the spa and he did everything in his power to make things right. He truly truly wanted me to have a great experience. He was apologetic and genuinely wanted to satisfy me. I truly appreciated his efforts from the bottom of my heart. Eduardo pool concierge would make a perfect guest services representing. His people skills are remarkable. He is so friendly and accommodating. I was excited to see him everyday. We talked about our baby daughters who are similar in age. Made me feel like family.

This was the second time my wife and myself visited Le Blanc. The newly renovated resort is truly exquisite. From the completly renovated rooms to most of the restaurants. The staff as always is extremly friendly and helpful always with an Ola and a smile that makes you feel welcome. A few of the staff deserve a special mention as they are the ones that go that extra mile to make sure your vacation is memorable. Firstly in our opinion the best waiter EVER is Manuel Many in La Lumiere restaurant. His friendly exceptional service just makes your meal so pleasant. From his culinary suggestions to his wine parings it was such a memorable experience both times we ate there. Pamela the chief concierge is a great ambassador for the resort. She was able to solve a few issues we had quickly and completly to our satisfaction bravo Pamela. She truly is one of those people that can make your vacation a memorable one. Daniel a server around the pool and beach remembered us from last year and was as entusiastic as ever. It was like seeing an old friend.

Le Blanc MUST become your destination at least once. Due to a promotion we found ourselves visiting LeBlanc twice this year within the past 5 months. We went two times prior and the biggest difference was the renovations remodeling they did in late 2018 \u2013 all great changes mind you. We did n\u2019t think it was possible but the resort looks even better than from our first trip in 208. If you are looking for an adults only destination in Cancun look no further. Everything at Le Blanc is top notch and all of their employees truly care about making sure you have the best vacation possible. Some even go above and beyond when necessary. Each guest is their priority and it shows. Here are a few of our thoughts and specific individuals in no particular order whom we feel made our stay this and even last time great. Please understand writing is not one of my strengths but I hope it is good enough to accurately reflect our opinions about Le BlancTeraza \u2013 We had half of our lunches and dinners here and breakfast twice. It is located on the 3rd floor has great views of the ocean and very peaceful. The waiters were great Bryan Carlos Fausto Rubicel Ulices all very attentive. At one point during our stay an individual named Isac stopped by and had a discussion regarding our stay and how everything was going. This is even more convincing everyone wants your experience to be the best. K\u2019akau \u2013 This is one of our daily and favorite places to visit at Le Blanc. They have a delicious assortment of macaroons bon bons and truffles. You can also get crepes made for you anytime which make a great breakfast or dessert item. Lastly it \u2019s a perfect place for coffee espresso cappuccinos and more. Dana Angelica Jorge and Chris were all greatBlanc \u2013. We had breakfast here almost every dayother times in Teraza. Isabel makes the best omelets. She has been there since our first trip about 11 years ago and is still doing some awesome cooking. Besides the made to order items there is a vast buffet of everything imaginable. They have great presentation with their food and if you ca n\u2019t find something to eat there must be something wrong. It is very similar to lunch with the large variety of choices and they do change things up daily so it does n\u2019t get boring. The waiters who made our morning and afternoon visits exceptional were Candelario Erick Juan Felipe and David. Yama \u2013. This is the Japanese restaurant and our personal favorite for dinner Teraza being a VERY close 2nd. All the food is awesome \u2013 get the Yakimeshi Mix add their house soy sauce \u2013 you will not regret. Jesica was a great host and we had GuilermoMemo as a waiter each time we had dinner 3 times. He knew a lot about the menu had a good memory and was very helpful in our decisions. I personally think he would be a great butler \u2013 he just had that sense and attitude about him as compared to what we \u2019ve seen from our butlers. some people just have that natural ability. Bela \u2013. As with all of the restaurants great food here as well and it is our 3rd favorite tied with Lumiere. We only went here once on this trip but our waiter Lorenzo made it a nice experience. I think this is where we first used the iPads to look over the wine list \u2013 this was the best change that happened during our stay. They had a lot of information listed on each wine which made it easy to choose. Aba Maria suggested we try the Mexican restaurant but we did n\u2019t get a chance to. The Mexican restaurant was changed a few years ago as it used to be International which we loved and miss. All in all a variety is good to have and it comes down to each individual \u2019s preference \u2013 they have something for everyone. Lumiere \u2013 We only ate here once and it is still exceptional. Our 3rd favorite alongside Bela. Alfonso was the manager on duty and came to apologize for a group who was having a lot of fun in a side room they were enjoying themselves and brought up the volume in this normally quiet laid back restaurant however we were fine with it. Personally that stuff does n\u2019t bother us as we enjoy the food and drink and like seeing other people having fun. To be honest we were close to joining them. Our waiter Osvaldo was very personable and we even shared in a few jokes as we did the last time with Baldemarwho had the fun table in the side room. Both are awesome waiters alikeLagon Bar \u2013 We have to give a shout out to Ignacio and Leonelhe was doing an internship as they were both wonderful bartenders and very personable. These guys have some great skilsLagon Pool \u2013 We spent a little time over here playing ping pong corn hole and black jack. In the mid afternoon they have a churo cart which makes for a nice afternoon treat assuming you have room. I was only successful twice. You will not go hungry hereMain Pool Area \u2013. The girls all work very hard in the hot sun and pouring rainhad a few hours \u2019 worth on our second visit to provide the best service and amenities possible \u2013 Lucinda Jeanete Laura and Marine were all very atentiveLoby Bar \u2013 We only stopped by here once to get a Mayan coffee and although it did n\u2019t appear to be going on at the time we thought Rafael stepped up and made us one and we are very thankful for it. Ca n\u2019t say it enough all of the staff goes above and beyond. Butlers \u2013 We interacted with a few butlers during this stay and although we hardly make any requests when we did Juan Luis and Saul made sure they were taken care of and always asked if there is anything they could do for us. Hugo also made us a nice display and set up the Jacuzi for us on the one night we asked for it. We also had the chance to run into our butler from our last trip Mario. He was one of the best for sure and even took care of a unique request from my mother in law. These guys certainly go above and beyondSpa Mani Pedi \u2013 Manuel and Cynthia deserve to be acknowledged for a job well done. 25 min massage \u2013. Merari and Iliana know provide a great massage and have a great sense for troubled areas and where to focus. We opted to do the three and a half hours long Passion package and although we ca n\u2019t remember their names due to be in a complete sense of relaxation both ladies did an amazing and out of this world jobThere is another individual who is very helpful and is a great person to talk to and his name is Mauricio. He mostly worked on the beach but we also saw him in the main pool area and 3rd floor infinity pool. He played volleyball with us on occasion which helps especially when we ca n\u2019t find players which he actually did \u2013 he once found enough for us to play a few gamesEntertainment \u2013 It is impossible to say enough positive things about Ana \u2013 she played ping pong and black jack with us taught a little Spanish the last time we were there and played both water and volleyball on numerous occasions. Superb personality and very friendly we certainly miss her \u2013 I have more on this towards the end. As far as nightly entertainment goes the Magic Show is certainly the best show we have ever experienced and fortunately with us being there for 10 days we were lucky enough to see it twice. Mario and his I thinkfour assistants put on one awesome show. He added in a laser light show and it was very cool. The number in a box trick completely blows my mind. If anything Le Blanc NEEDS to keep this show no matter what. The other shows both very close to being our 2nd favorite were the Circus and Michael Jackson tribute. Circus performers are simply amazing. no clue how they do what they do. The Michael Jackson look a like Luigi was spot on and along with his 6 back up dancers put on a great performance which we also got to see twice. Our only complaint or at least bit of confusion is with the Entertainment Activities team. In May there were two people on the team Alfonso and Ana. These individuals were responsible for coordinating and leading the beach pool and indoor activities and also introduced the nightly entertainment. Upon our arrival we happened to see Ana in passing and asked her about Alfonso. She said he left Le Blanc a few weeks prior to pursue his own business venture. Without a doubt this was very sad news but fortunately we still had Ana. However this would n\u2019t last long. A few days in she told us she had the next day off I think it was a Thursday but would be back to see us for Friday \u2019s activities and the Latin band on Saturday. While she was gone she said the individual who replaced Alfonso named Alfredo would be coordinating the events. Friday and Saturday came and went without any sign of Ana. I asked Alfredo and he said she left and went to another resort. It was very surprising to hear especially since she told us she would be back for the one show and also for more blackjack ping pong and volleyball which we did during the first few days. Deep inside I felt something else happened and she did n\u2019t leave on her own as we were led to believe. I say this because of her genuine excitement of returning after her day off and from the way Alfredo gave his response \u2013 it did n\u2019t sit well with me and it sounded out of place. Nonetheless we could n\u2019t ask Ana and there was nothing else we could doMy wife and I both just wish we had a chance to say goodbye \u2013 she was a great and such a personable person. Ultimately the whole concept of what Le Blanc did have with regards to their Entertainment Activities team has changed in a big way all in the matter of months. While this is n\u2019t going to affect anyone looking to come to Le Blanc for the first time it will be a big adjustment for those who knew Alfonso andor Ana. I do n\u2019t know how jobs and positions are filled in Mexico but in my opinion the management at Le Blanc should have promoted Ana when Alfonso left and maybe even given her an assistant. I did see Alfredo twice for beach volleyball and for the evening events but that was all his presence nor energy just was n\u2019t there as it was with Alfonso and Ana. I actually never thought Alfonso went home as you would always see him around interacting with people. Maybe Le Blanc wants to change the role for Alfredo but we did n\u2019t see him much outside of those occasions. In addition the activities schedule is n\u2019t like it used to be. Granted this is more of a relaxing and quiet resort but I personally look forward to having some activities to split up the day a bit. For instance in May I played beach volleyball at least 7 of our 9 days there this last time 2 out of 10. In all cases it comes down to asking around and rallying people to play. Alfonso seemed to have this natural skill and ability which if I had to guess he taught Ana to be the same so much that I thought she was the new person in charge until she told me different. Regardless Alfonso was gone and as stated previously we were happy to see at least Ana was still there. but then she was n\u2019t. I ca n\u2019t say I have anything against Alfredo as I have only seen and talked with him twice but from what I can see thus far he has a long way to go if theyLe Blanc management want him to have the same energizing presence as Alfonso and Ana once did \u2026. hopefuly maybe he took some good notes from them only time will tell.", "offset": [5494, 5589], "date": "2019-11-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "b6abd06c-d262-4fe4-b946-7936a9a4ad88", "sentence": "Outstanding Staff at LaBlanc Cancun.
