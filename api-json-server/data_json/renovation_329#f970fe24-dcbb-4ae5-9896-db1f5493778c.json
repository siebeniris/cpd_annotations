It is my expectation of a hotel hosting conventions to be able to provide the necessary services. The internet service at this hotel is totally unacceptable. I was never able to get service in my room even after repeated attempts to deal with their hot line support. They created three different tickets but I received no help. Well actually I had a knock on my door at 1230 one night and it was from maintenance saying they would fix my tv which was working.

I also went to the ER that day due to the pain in my back from hitting the tile during my fall. I have had to go to the chiropractor 3 days a week since and still have tingling in my fingers and now have to have mris and go to a orthopedic due to the injuries I sustained. My spine curves to the right due to the impact of my fall. Harahs liability company deemed them not negligent due to the fact that it had not been previously reported. I have to out of pocket costs for the rest of my life with no compensation due to the fact that Harahs does not take responsibility for negligence in their hotel. The liability company clearly told me that plumbing repair work had to be done due to the fact that the pipe was leaking and that they did have to repair that issue but because it was not previously reported my injuries do not matter.

I recently stayed at Harahs for three nights and checked in on a Sunday. Check in was miserable as at 4 pm there were hundreds of people checking in and it took almost an hour to check in. They had kiosks they encourage you to use to check in with staff saying it is faster however some do not work and they would not accept my RI drivers license so I had to check in the traditional way. The line actually moved pretty quick as all hands were on deck at the counter with every computer screen staffed which was nice. I was given room 605 in the Bayview Tower which was renovated last year but I had to wait to get my room keys. They said my room was not ready and oddly housekeepers clean from bottom to top in that tower so I was restricted to 6th floor unles I wanted to wait even longer and since it was already 5 pm I wanted to get settled in quick. I still had to wait an hour and a half they never texted to say my room was ready and I went to desk to inquire and suddenly my room was ready. That was annoying. I had love to someday get a higher floor room at Harahs. I still had a decent partial Ocean View and AC skyline GNThe room itself was nicely renovated loved the colors and design and overall the room was large and comfortable. Housekeeping did a lousy job cleaning however as the room was not vacuumed and there are drink and other stains throughout the room. Dust in the beautiful lamps by the beds too. Some of the lights were already starting to break as one would fall over if you lightly touched it. I liked how there were USB plugs and lots of outlets. The bathroom was spacious with a separate soaking tub which was large and relaxing and fills fast. Despite the room only being redone last year or so Some of the furniture is RUSTING including the small table by the lounger seat near window which left rust stains on the carpeting. The bathroom counter unit also was rusty all the chrome metal trim along the bottom was rusty next to where they put the towels which is a shame. I also did not like the faucet handles due to very sharp corners. Two of the three nights were comped and I feel like the rate was great for a three day stay and would stay at Harahs again. While I prefer to stay at Caesars when they are too expensive Harahs is my go to. Did pretty good on slots at times but just so so on table games. Some of the table game staff like on three card poker were kind of odd. I also ate at the cafe place with the nice ice cream near lobby however my cakebater ice cream tasted weird and not like it was expected to taste like.
