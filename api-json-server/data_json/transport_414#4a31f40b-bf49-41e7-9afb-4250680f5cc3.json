I stayed at the Excellence Resort in Punta Cana from April 12th till April 17th and booked this vacation through Orbitz in November of 2014. When I arrived at the airport and presented my prepaid shuttle travel voucher to VIP Tours I was informed that we needed to pay an extra 20 per person round trip because the prepaid voucher was not enough to get us to Punta Cana so of course we had no choice but to fork over the extra cash not the end of the world but I will be contacting Orbitz for an explanation. The ride to the Excellence Resort took approximately an hour since the bus dropped other passengers off at there resort first since the Excellence Resort was at the farthest end of the island and there were no other resorts next to it so it was nice and secluded. Upon arriving at the resort we were greeted which a cold towel and a glass of champagne. Check in was a breeze and we were escorted to our room 4108 within minutes. The room was clean and the mini bar was stocked with coke Sprite Orange Soda all of which were in glass bottles which I have not seen in the United States in years. The mini bar was also stocked with El Presidente beer bottled water and large bottles of hard alcohol. I hear a lot of people complaining that the shower is adjacent to the bedroom and that its divided by glass and that if someones taking a shower you can see them from the bathroom. It did not bother me since a hot shower fogged up the windows and it was a non issue. I did use the safe for my valuables but never had the impression that someone was going to come into my room and steal. At the beach I left my backpack with my cell phone and other items out and it was never touched. I felt safe on the resort but the only nuisance was people on the beach trying to get you to try excursions or horseback riding which we declined. The room served its purpose and the bed was a tad hard but you are on vacation and hopefully not spending your whole vacation inside. The room was cleaned everyday and turn down service was provided at night. The best parts of this resort First you did not have to wear a wrist band and were only asked for your room number when you went to the restaurants. Second you could grab as many beach towels without question you were not limited to one per person and again they did not even ask for a room number. Third I never had an issue in the morning getting a chair by the beach or the pool after breakfast. Some people did reserve chairs and there were more then enough to go around providing you were not trying to get one at noon. Yes the beach was a little rough but you could still go in the water and enjoy it. Fourth ALL the EMPLOYEES at this resort were INCREDIBLE and THEY make this resort GREAT. They went above and beyond to make my time here fun and relaxing. They were not pushy if you did not want to play any games but were very personable. They would say hi come up and talk and then go off to the next person. They did a Dominican themed dinner on the beach and did a white party which they started setting up very early in the day and cleaned everything up late at night. They had shows at night Dominican musicians on some days and you could go to the club and dance at 10pm. More importantly I would tell you to bring money and TIP the employees they work long hard hours probably for minimal pay and a 1 bill every now and then goes a long way and I am sure it is appreciated. Through we did not have the opportunity to eat at every restaurant the food was good at the places we dined at and some restaurants were better then others but overall I had no complaints. The vacationers at this resort were great no immature out of control people everyone was mature and friendly and it was a chill spot to meet new people from all over the globe. We started our checkout at 10 am and our shuttle arrived at 11 am. As we checked out we were informed that we could use the resort until to the fullest until our shuttle arrived. Check out was easy and took all of a minute. do not read to much into to some of these reviews where they nitpick the resort to death. If you want a nice room good food and a relaxing vacation with good people and great staff then this is the resort for you. I would definitely stay at this resort again without hesitation just because the employees were so great. If money and time allows it I would most certainly go back again this year.

We booked our 25th Anniversary trip at Excellence Punta Cana primarily because we wanted an adults only resort. We loved this experience and had a wonderful time. The resort is simply lovely and just large enough so that it never felt a bit crowded. There were several activities on the schedule each day and we liked that we never felt pressured to take part in anything we did not want to. In the past we stayed at Iberostar and had problems staying on our feet with all the wet super slick surfaces in fact I experienced a serious fall at Iberostar. This was not an issue at Excellence they have mostly textured walkways and very few areas where we slipped. Our favorite part of visiting Republica Dominicana as always is that we love the friendly and smiling people. Regardless of their job or financial status usually VERY poor the Dominicans value family and tend to lead a much less stress filled life as compared to Americans. They take time to visit with us and we feel incredibly connected through sharing of their experience. We were invited into the homes of some wonderful people. If you choose to interact in a respectful manner they are largely warm and genuine. Yes you should be intelligent and protect yourself if you choose to wander but we have never felt unwelcomed or unsafe anyplace we have gone. We probably are not the typical tourists though. Be aware that the concept of the Dominican minute is very real. Be flexible with expectations because it is much more relaxing to go with the flow than constantly be rushing and watching the time. Many locals are very fluent in English and other languages but remember their primary language is Spanish. There will be times when communication is more fun than others. Practice patience. The staff at Excellence really does want the guests to have a good time and come back. Thanks to David at the front desk our check in was smooth and he accommodated our requests with no problems including upgrading us to the Excellence Club even though GBS Travel had advised us it was sold out. We were seriously pleased to be offered a room right on the cascade pool. We stepped out to our patio and jumped right into the calm and wonderfully quiet pool which is actually two levels. We preferred it to the more lively usually loud and huge wandering pool on the opposite side of the resort. Our bed was very comfortable we had no problem with the window in the shower and enjoyed having natural lighting. There was a rambunctious party of 20somethings that tended to drive us crazy for several nights of pool and post disco parties but all was well when they checked out. Overall we would not have done anything different with our room except possibly book a roof top room when we have an excessive amount of cash to spend. We truly enjoyed our space. We also liked working with and visiting Will Carlos at the front desk. One of our extremely early trips left before any food options opened and we did not realize even a continental breakfast was not available until 70 am He quickly arranged breakfast delivery in the lobby. He helped us understand the currency differences assisted us to obtain my husbands debit card back when the lobby ATM ate it for the weekend and explained so many things particular to Dominican culture. He would win as our favorite staff member at Excellence this trip. Almost everyone was great but Will Carlos was EXCELLENT. The food was fine for us. There was always something we could like and the menu was always interesting sometimes adventurous. The wait staff did not always understand food allergies and therefore it was up to me to determine items that were safer. Anything we did not find pleasing could always be replaced with a different choice. If we ever went away hungry it was by our choice because Excellence bends over backwards to make the food available. We disliked the hotel beach on the Atlantic. It was very heavy surf with an overwhelming amount of seaweed. The crews worked constantly but it would be impossible to keep up with. This is through NO fault of the workers. We used the Excellence Club private beach and enjoyed the amenities. We insisted on trying to be in the ocean a couple times but decided to book some tours on the Caribbean side as we MUCH prefer the Caribbean. If you want to immerse yourself in the ocean we suggest other resorts are a better choice. We were happy to read and nap on the beach and swim a lot in the pools. Beware of the tour sales guys stalking guests on the beach and at polside who misrepresent themselves as being representatives of Excellence. They are not. Their company apparently has a contract to solicit guests. While the young man seemed good his knowledge was flawed and he sold us a package with completely incorrect tour information on the receipt. Had I not made inquiries the night before we would have missed our expensive tour by several hours. We highly suggest seeking out Jeanete Senior at Olympus Tours just off the lobby. She arranged a free tour for us to Don Lucas Cigar Factory and arranged an absolutely FANTASTIC all day trip to S Cape Park that was not her usual offering. Again another local person who made sure we got exactly what we wanted. Jeanete totally shines. Go find her you will be glad you didThey do fog for mosquitoes which was pretty necessary however we wish they would do this in the early mornings before guests are out or at least warn the guests that they will be fogging so we can leave the area. We were playing pool and ping pong when the foger came by and gassed all the guests right along with all the insects. We did not appreciate breathing in a thick neuro toxic cloud of poison. Make sure to take along bug spray you will be glad you have it. we are steady tippers for food and beverage staff housekeeping and generally for great service. it is never required but when you learn how terrible the pay is for the staff you will want to. Our drink quality significantly improved with only a buck or two. Everyone wins. Entertainment was okay but got better if you drink a little before and during the shows. They work HARD to put on a good show. It would be great if they learned to lip sync to the songs. Dancing and entertainment was great for the Circus show Michael Jackson show was our second favorite while the Dominican show was bad enough that we decided we did not want to endure the entire show. The dancers for most of the shows have impressive skill and are fun to watch. I was particularly annoyed by the entertainment team announcer. MC whatever he was. His constant demands for the audience to CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP or they would leave the stage was uncaled for. We did not expect Broadway cruise ship or even community theater quality performances but some were just a lot better than others. The transportation available to be booked directly from the Excellence Punta Cana website is deceptive. We paid 140 for direct private round trip airport transportation which is billed to our room. There is no one to call if you have a problem at the airport they only deal with bookings via email which is not too handy at the airport and we ended up paying an additional 70 directly to a driver to be taken to Excellence. We looked for the correct reps at the desk we were directed to black shirts with pink lanyards and then shuffled over to an Island Sun rep. We decided not to make a big deal of this because we really liked the resort. The photos show nice read SAFE SUVs. We got a ride in a van to the resort. For the return trip we were supposed to be picked up at 120 resort staff called every few minutes when the vehicle never arrived then finally a broken old mini van taxi with non functional doors and broken seatbelts showed up at 1205 to take us to the airport. We were not pleased. While it got us where we needed to go we will not book the transportation this way again. Long story to say that we had an Excellent 11 day vacation at Excellence Punta Cana. Thanks to staff from the bell hops housekeeping food beverage entertainment tours and front desk. we are sure to return someday.", "offset": [7874, 7963], "date": "2015-11-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "d7a150fd-53b3-4adc-85a7-d8a5dba5366b", "sentence": "nt and I think the tapas place was my favorite. The pools are amazing and the beach was beautiful. I read reviews about the bugs being bad but we are here in December and I have not had any problem with bugs. We went on a few excursions and let me say that they were awesome. The horseback riding on the beach was fun slightly scary because my horse did not want to do what I wanted it to do but we had a blast and got some great pictures. We went fishing with Crazy Gator charters and although the ride to get to the boat took forever and the seas were very rough luckily we do not get seasick we caught 12 mahi in our half day trip which was pretty affordable. We did the boogie rides through the mud to a cave and to Bavaro Beach and that was so much fun. We got filthy and got to see some of the town. Finally we went scuba diving at Catalina Island and the dives were fantastic. The coral was so alive and the fish were beautiful. Then we got to hang out on Catalina Island and had an island buffet. It was awesome. Some of the transportation to and from the excursions seemed pretty sketchy but we learned to go with the flow and it turned out to be some of the best experiences. All in all we are completely satisfied. Everything was very affordable yet it felt like 5 star service.

I am a little late with this review but it is well deserved. This was my husband and my first vacation out of the country and took our honeymoon over new years and it was a great decision. it is only about 45 minutes from the airport and the second you get there you are warmly greeted. We upgraded to the excellence club and sorry forgot names since this took so long the man working the excellence club was on top of everything. January is a busy time of year and they were still generous enough to upgrade us for free from a garden view room to ocean view. He kept giggling the whole time and we were clueless till we got to our room. Honestly the staff here really make the club. They are all so friendly generous and you can really tell they enjoy their jobs. We only had one person the whole time who was not super bubbly and we believe this waiter just did not like American men. He was not rude bit would barely talk to my husband and would only look at me out whole meal so we tipped graciously since we figured it was a stereotype thingThe food options were endless but if your only into eating Americanized food this is not the place for you. we are adventurous eaters but we kept getting late night room service and stuff like chicken strips pizza etc and it was all bad. they tried real hard though so we found it amusing. The beef is not up to American standards either you can see it in the cows on your drive though. But everything else was amazing. Best Asian food I have had in a long time perfectly cooked sea food all over and we had an 8 course meal for new years that was out of this worldIf your looking for a good place to enjoy drinking all day this is also the place. Bats and drinks everywhere even breakfast had mimosa and bloody bats everyday. The new years party was our best yet and will be very hard to beat. They had a discovery entertaining leading up to the countdown followed by fireworks on the beach and a DJ with dancers after that was all after that 8 course meal for dinner. Perfected displays all over streamers hats and endless delicious champagne. With all this alcohol we never ran into any fights and the resort does a really good job at bringing everyone towards the main ballroom than to your rooms as the night goes on. If you want to take a late stroll it is very quiet and you do not feel worried or sketched out about who could be around at all. We only had 2 issues with this trip and one was not the resorts fault. Our first full day there we went for a walk on the beach and as soon as we were out of the resorts propertylike I said not their fault. we were rushed by a very save peddler with a shop right outside of the resort. He was very smooth and good at what he does apparently but got ripped off like crazy on souvenirs. My husband is not the kind of person to get tricked into this sort of thing either. We had not gone to the resorts shops yet and had no idea Really how bad we got tricked till the next day but as soon as we walked away we felt dumb. Now on the other hand. the spa. the free water treatment for excellence club was great. It was fun relaxing and a great hangover cure. but the massage. No Buenos. We upgraded to a Swedish and deep tissue for him massage after and we got the same massage. It was calming and nice but they were obviously trained on the job and it is mediocre but you are charged spa prices. Way over priced and again the deep tissue massage has nothing deep tissue about it. Overall though amazing. They pay attention to every detail and their workers never stopping moving and bust their butts there yet are all extremely nice and great to be around. A couple tipsif you get an excursion bring food. you are gone most of the day even if they say 4hours and only have water or a couple food samples for youI may of not been paying attention but all restaurants at night are formal wear. No shorts hubby brought lots of khaki shorts for men and no flip flops. We were not prepared for that. Everyone dresses pretty well for dinner so be preparedget a private shuttle from the airport. This resort is the last on a line for busses that stop at other resorts will cut the trip to and from in half.", "offset": [4101, 4211], "date": "2016-04-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "371920c5-03d2-4731-94b6-24f49842b855", "sentence": "Destination Wedding. Fantastic. First off I do not understand the negative reviews of this place. Everything at this place if fantastic. We arrived at the airport and had transportation there that took us to the hotel. It is about a 40 minute ride and you pass all of the other resorts along the way. Upon arrival you are greeted and if you are in the Excellence Club which we did as it was our wedding they take you to the club and get you a drink snack and then get you checked in. This process is a little long and takes about 30 minutes. From then on it is to your room where you have a fully stocked bar. With the Excellence Club I believe the upgraded liquors were Bacardi Absolut Bombay Sapphire and Jack Daniels. While at the bars at the resort if there is a bottle of liquor you like or something you want ask the bartender tell them your room number and that bottle will be awaiting. They replace them everyday. The fridge is stocked with sodas water candy and beer. The resort itself is not very big but it is big enough. It is not overwhelming. The rooms are big clean and everything is very nice. Nothing in our room was in bad condition. Some of the furniture may have been outdated but it was all clean. The shower is open to the rest of the room so you can see your partner in the shower while laying in bed. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from. For breakfast the buffet was the most popular spot. For lunch we really enjoyed the seaside caf\u00e9 as it was more of a grab and go where you could get the entr\u00e9e of the day which could be anything from grilled chicken to seafood paella to burgers and pizza. They had a smoothie and milk shake station as well. We as well as our guests really enjoyed Spice for dinner as well as the lobster house and the French restaurant. The pizza Italian restaurant is open late and is a great spot to hit up after a night of gambling at the casino or working up an appetite at the disco. You also have 24 hour room service so if you do not want to wait at a restaurant you can get it delivered. There are 2 pools. Both are pretty large. The main pool is very long and has bridges stretched over it. The cascade pool is on the other side of the resort and is a fun spot to go for a change of scenery. The pools close down at 6 pm and allows everyone time to get cleaned up for dinner. The beach is beautiful. While we were there it was always a Red flag meaning we could not swim but that did not stop us from laying out in lawn chairs and cabanas. In the excellence club there are a plentiful amount of these available however prime seating is obtained by arriving early. The casino is very small. 4 blackjack tables some slots and 2 roulette tables. Very fun especially with a group. There is nightly entertainment and this ranges from cirque du soleil type shows where they wind down ribbons and do acrobaticsour favorite show to a disco band to a Michael Jackson impersonator. They were all enjoyable. Onto the wedding. We chose this place via Destinationwedingscom and reading reviews on TA. We wanted an all inclusive adults only resort and this one fit the bill. Our point of contact with the resort was Yesica. She was fantastic and an absolute pleasure to deal with. Any questions we had she answered promptly and this applies to both before and after our arrival. Before you get there they send you a catalog and you get to pick and choose what you want as far as food tables centerpieces etc. All of the same stuff you would pick out for a wedding stateside. We met with her the day we arrived went over all the logistics and again the morning of the wedding. No problems or hiccups encountered at all. Our wedding took place on the beach right in front of the seaside caf\u00e9. My now wife arrived via horse drawn carriage which was pretty cool. The have an altar set up and the photos and reception was great. Not the longest wedding I have ever been to but for us it was perfect. Our guests all really enjoyed it. The hotel will provide a photographer which we used to do our video but we also hired outside photographers who we would highly recommend. After the wedding there was a cocktail hour with mariachia band followed by the reception. Our reception was initially supposed to be at the cascade pool however given that rain was in the forecast it was decided to move indoors. There is a reception hall where it took placewe also did our rehearsal dinner here. They said they could chance it and keep it at the pool but takedown and setup of all the DJ equipment takes about 3 hours and with only a 4 hour reception we wanted the longest time possible to hang with our friends and families. If you are looking for music look no further than DJ Mania. He was amazing. As good of a wedding DJ as I have seen. We had emailed him a few times before and sent him a playlist and he put it together. He did take requests as well from our guests. The wedding food was delicious. We opted for the Mexican buffet and it had everything from a fajita station to queso to salsa to guac as well as some fresh seafood. We received many compliments on the food. The wedding cake as our guests have said was the best cake I have ever tasted. It was a vanilla cake with strawberry between the layers and a vanilla frosting. I think that about wraps it up. The destination wedding at Excellence Punta Cana was everything we had hoped for. It does cost your guests more to get there but it is also a way to get to go on a trip with some of your best friends. For us it was a lot cheaper than doing a wedding stateside and had a blast. If you have any questions feel free to message as this can be a stressful time and there are a lot of unknowns if you have not been through it. We would not have changed anything.", "offset": [137, 218], "date": "2016-08-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "b84c0d46-d746-47e9-832e-d5b2d6fe0282", "sentence": "Great but not perfect. We received a warm welcome and were quickly checked in. Prior to our stay I emailed and requested a top floor room. The reception acknowledged I had done this and granted our wish. So a great start. We were impressed with the size of the room plus it had a view over the Cascade pool. From reading other reviews we knew it could appear quite dated but did n\u2019t feel this. There was n\u2019t an awful lot of drawer space so had to hang most things up. We had to ask for more hangers but this was n\u2019t a problem. We made use of the bath a few times during our stay and the mini bar was always stocked. I left a note along with a few dollars for extra white wine but was just left a ton of water. This was disappointing. It \u2019s easier if you run into the chap and ask him there and then. We never had the turn down service as we were always in our room when the maid turned up but am sure this would have been a nice touch. We found the resort to be well looked after and loved we were so close to the beach so there was a nice breeze. The first week we did n\u2019t have a problem locating a bed with shade by the main pool but towards to the end of the second week more and more beds were getting reserved earlier and earlier and we had to hunt for a bed that was n\u2019t taken. All the towels were put out in the same way as if a member of staff had maybe done this. Not a problem if guests used them but when they \u2019re still empty by midday it \u2019s annoying. We visited all restaurants apart from the Mediterranean. We liked the Grill Spice and French most for dinners and the main buffet for breakfast. Omelets are a must for breakfast. These are cooked fresh and are plentiful. It was nice to help yourself to Bucks Fizz and they even had a Bloody Mary station. For lunch we flitted between all three restaurants. Sometimes we found the food to be cold if it had been there for a while at Las Olas but even at The Grill my meal came out luke warm on occasions. You can get take away boxes so one day I grabbed sushi from the buffet and ate it on my sun lounger which made a nice change. We had three theme nights whilst we were there but found the quality of the buffets to be poor. We tried one but sadly left most of our meal to eat somewhere else. The majority of the restaurants are also open on these nights so maybe if they closed them then they could concentrate on turning these nights into a real Gala with a big crowd especially as the hotel put a lot of effort into the decorations etc. In comparison to other all inclusives we \u2019ve stayed at we \u2019d never had so much choice to drink. There were bottles of beer to premium spirits so always of a good quality. A couple of bars sometimes served flat mixers so was always risky ordering a rum and coke for example as it was n\u2019t pleasant to drink. We stuck to mostly beer and water during the day and endulged at the Martini bar with cocktails Champagne and Baileys in the evenings. All bar staff were a pleasure fast and efficient. The entertainments team were lively and encouraging so there was always a crowd taking part in the games. A lot of reviews mention them by name partly because they were keen for guests to write their piece before they left the resort. It \u2019s not that I particularly disagree with their reviews but at the same time they probably felt they could n\u2019t give any constructive criticism either \u2026 the resort is great but not perfect. There were different activities most days but in the two weeks we were there we heard the movie quiz four times. Think I \u2019d have scored top marks if I \u2019d taken part on the 3rd4th time. At this resort there are no wristbands no towel cards and reservations are not required at the restaurants. It was so nice not to be tied to any restrictions and to be able to eat anywhere we liked when we were ready instead of clock watching for your sitting. We did have a wonderful time at the Excellence. It was stress and drama free with plenty of sun and good times. I \u2019d like to think I would return as the plus points do outweigh any negatives but the world is a big place.", "offset": [1048, 1283], "date": "2016-12-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "77267fce-385a-43e4-bbf1-b57d3b2c5bfe", "sentence": "it is a long one because we LOVE EVERYTHING about this place. We went twice in 6 months so that about tells you how much we LOVE this place. I will try and break it down as much as possible for clarity We arrived on a Monday following 2 weeks of torrential downpours and could n\u2019t get across the road we were dropped off at Excellence El Carmen where we ate and drank without question and waited for a car that was high enough off the ground to come get us and across the floods. We were greeted with the usual warmth of a smile wet cloth and drink. Checked in NP I have never seen a line up of more than 1 or 2 people at front desk it \u2019s really amazingWe were in the building that backs onto the gazebo it \u2019s perfectly located for us as my husband dives quite a bit and makes visits to the dive shop often. If you want a phenomenal water excursion go see Franklin there you will meet with the same person you \u2019l be in the water with not a desk person then a transportation person and so on and so on. LOVE that there is no bracelets and \u201c categorization \u201d of guests. Everyone is treated equally. if you want your extras you upgraded to then you just go to a different lobby and get it there. everywhere else you get the same treatment as everyone. You get all the a la cartes you want no rush to make your reservations just go when you \u2019re ready. Of course we have our favourites but we really like ALL the restaurants. Theme nights are awesome outside and in the buffet. Wifi is awesome on the beach if you need it and free everywhere which is great. Staff PHENOMENAL. So incredibly friendly caring attentive and genuine. So many to mention but I will specifically make a shout out to Yeifrid the front desk CS Manager he not only is a phenomenal manager he knows the true value of Guest Customer Service but seeing how he interacts with his staff is awesome. Kendry Dany Jorgue Reymond Familia our room maid sad I never got her name and also the turn down service lady oh my goodness she can put a smile on anyones face. Just hearing her laugh makes you laugh. There was no shortage of staff. People working everywhere including lots of maintenance groundskeping. Never had to wait longer than a couple minutes for anything. Busiest spot would be breakfast buffet egg bar to wait for anything but it \u2019s fresh and well worth it. Entertainment was lots of fun and went on throughout the day. beach pool evening shows. They really put a lot into the evening shows numerous outside performers. DON\u2019T MISS the Circus show or the Michael Jackson Show you will regret it. Disco was fun but needs more \u201c local \u201d music catering to the masses a bit too much but that \u2019s me I can listen to that stuff at home. Rooms were spacious nice everything was clean worked well. Housekeeping was awesome as was the turn down service. Their toiletries are great we do n\u2019t even bother bringing ours from home shampoo conditioner lotionEverything is nice and close never felt crowded but you could definitely notice the busy days to the less busy days. As per staff it was at about 80 capacity at one point. There was usually a beach and pool chair and if there was n\u2019t there would be one soon enough. Staff does a great job of removing used towels from empty chairs. No limit to the towel service. Food was amazing everywhere restaurants buffet 24hr room service too the mini sandwiches at the cascade bar and the sports bar was a yummy late afternoon treat. Beach was nicely cleaned every day. A bit of distance between the water and the loungers not the calmest for swimming but just a few steps down the beach there is a much calmer spot. Great beach to walk. Always a lifeguard on duty security at night. Gardens are gorgeous out front and by the gym spa they were flooded when we got there but mostly accessible a few days later. Spa gym are great gorgeous great service and services. As you can see I have nothing to complain about and the reason we will continue to be return customers will most definitely go back. Major renovations happening this Fall and we hope they do n\u2019t modernize it too much like the Excellence El Carmen. we LOVE the tropical feel of the resorts we visit. Staff works hard and they do a phenomenal job MAKE SURE TO TIP. if you ca n\u2019t tip much tip something. That includes everyone.

The all inclusive resort is a 45 minute trip from the airport we had a private shuttle which cost 240 round trip. The driver was fantastically friendly but maybe a bit of an aggressive driver.

However we were served beverages and chatted up a bit. Now we paid a bit extra to be in Club Level which is a segregated area with supposedly better booze and such. However our rooms were at the opposite side of the resort. Hm. We complained but were told its no big deal. And it was not except maybe the distance 300 yards or so. Exercise is good for you I guess. As far as the booze quality I saw no difference but then again I am no expert either. The resort is very nice. A good bit looked new rebuilt no doubt from the recent hurricane aftermath. There were employees everywhere cleaning and making certain things are just right. Service was very good. There was always wait staff around whether on the beach or at the pools. There were nine restaurants to choose from and each one was great. While I did not necessarily like all the food it was delicious and usually very well presented. Note that you will not be rushed during a dinner. Most of our dinners were 90 120 minutes from sit down to dessert. Drinks tend to be slightly dilute which I understand. If you want them stronger all you need do is ask. Most of the restaurants had a dress code no shorts or sandals for men. Dresses or slacks for women. And they enforced that too. Our room was second floor with an ocean pool view. From the room to the beach was about 100 yards. The pools were in between. The room was very nice and immaculately clean. There was a jacuzi tub in the main area while the waterfall shower in the bathroom was sheer joy to stand under. Now our room had one slight issue which was climate control. It could not quite handle the 85F75 humidity so it was always a bit damp inside the room. Nothing major just a bit noticeable. Every night there was a live stage show for entertainment. Each one was filled to capacity so you need to get there promptly. The quality of the shows varied but hey this is a tropical resort not Broadway. Other guests were friendly and reasonably outgoing. We talked to quite a few and enjoyed that. A few of the staff stood out in their attentiveness and we tipped them extra. We did experience some communication issues. But I would say thats not unusual for folks like us who only speak English plus 5 words of Spanish. Nothing insurmountable. On returning to the airport one warning. Southwest was very disorganized in boarding. There was mass confusion at the gate at the bus to the plane and getting on the plane. I found this odd as Southwest usually is much better. I would recommend Excellence Resort however I am not sure the extra we paid Club Level was worth it.", "offset": [2990, 3076], "date": "2018-01-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "b01d1c97-c1b0-4155-91d6-75d87438059f", "sentence": "Paradise and Purgatory. We celebrated our 20th anniversary at Excellence PC in January 2017. It was such a special amazing time that over the summer we booked a return trip. We have since nicknamed this trip Three Days in Paradise Three Days in Purgatory with an emphasis on purge. It makes me sad to even write this because we really do love this place. So let me start with the good. The renovations we loved were the opening up of the beach area to the resort area. It was absolutely lovely to be able to see the beach from the hotel. The rooms looked more up to date and I personally liked the in room jacuzi. Excellence is also known for customer service and they did not disappoint. A special shout out to David at the front desk Elisabeth at the Mexican restaurant Joel at the French restaurant Kendry at Sol and Jean Carlos who checked on us when we were on the beach. These people all did a fantastic job. They are friendly and knowledgeable. Joel even remembered from last year WOW. that I have Celiac and made sure my dietary restrictions were taken care of. As for the rest of the renovations I do not have a strong opinion about them. The restaurants seemed pretty similar as last time even though the names decor and locations had changed somewhat. Someone mentioned the rooms being damp they definitely were and it was a bit icky to wake up feeling damp. The outdoor hot tub was broken which I did miss from last time. Now for the bad. I woke up at 10 am on our fourth night with back pain that would not go away. I could not sleep most of that night. The next day other symptoms appeared and got worse over the course of the day. I will spare everyone the details but I ended up being diagnosed in a Dominican emergency room with an intestinal bacterial infection. We are not sure if it was a bacteria or a parasite but it was most definitely from food I ate at the resort. There is no way to pinpoint exactly which food restaurant was to blame but I suspect the fish ceviche at Los Olas. It had tasted unpleasant and I had only eaten two bites. The taxi ride to the hospital was 60 each way ALWAYS BRING LOTS OF EXTRA CASH PEOPLE and the ER bill was 91. I had to receive antibiotics anti parasitics and some other drugs that I frankly did not know what they were right into the ol IV. It was scary and expensive. The ER tried to admit me for 24 hours but we refused when we found out the bill would be 270. I opted for 40 oral antibiotcs instead filling only one of the eight meds prescribed due to cost. The next day was spent convalescing in my damp room and the flight home two days after the ER trip was not much fun with the symptoms I experienced. Today one week later is my first day to feel better. All that to say. I really really hate to write this review because I have a fondness in my heart for Excellence. But the resort needs to know that they have a food safety problem and the reader needs to know to avoid the fish ceviche. We will probably stay closer to home next year.", "offset": [1148, 1262], "date": "2018-01-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "85d70750-a7bf-4517-8fe2-2358ad55bd18", "sentence": "FABULOUS PERFECTION. After going back forth on choosing a resort for our trip we decided on Excellence Punta Cana and we could not be more pleased with our choice. The service was outstanding the resort was absolutely breathtaking we had minimal problems w seawod they worked so hard keeping it clear. Not so much when we went over to Caribbean side to do a catamaran trip it was horrible. No one was even at the beaches at those resorts because it was so bad. Our room was a little damp from humidity but you could get a de humidifier for it. We were in Bldg 2 club level and it was a perfect location. If your looking to party hard get wild this is not the resort for you. Place shuts down around 10am. The entertainment was severely lacking did not enjoy the shows much but really the only negative for me overall. No music really to dance or just have playing in lobby area after the nightly show would have liked that as that was where we all tended to gather. Best restaurants where Chez Isabele Flavor Market hands down. Also Kitchen table for breakfast lunch had something for everyone. I am still not sure upgrading to Club Level was worth it check in out was smooth would have missed access to waterfall pool beds on the beach but otherwise I think we still would have been very pleased without.

Will be back. Overall we had a great time at EPC. First the Punta Cana Airport was quick and easy. We used DAT as our private transfer which was a great choice. Highly recommend them as your transportation to the resort 40min driveI\u2019l start with check in. We were met with a cold towel and smiling face. Check in was fast and easy. We were led to our rooms shortly after. Grounds are amazing and they work hard to upkeep them. There is seaweed on the beach however they shovel it and try to get rid of as much as they can. I \u2019ve never seen this happen at other resorts with the same problemBRING TIP MONEY. these people work very hard every day and even a dollar is better than nothing. Did we tip for every single drink that we got from the bar. Of course not. But if you \u2019re being waited on give the person a dollar or 2. These people probably live off tips and they appreciate anything that you give. Exceptional service always deserves a reward. Room. We had a swim out junior suite which came with a daybed on the patio area. We used it daily and enjoyed the easy access to our room from the beach pool. The shower was very large and had a rainfall type water flow. We had a large jacuzi tub that we also enjoyed. We did not purchase the excellence club upgrade as we did n\u2019t think it would be worth the extra money. But we saw quite a few people that did and they seemed to be enjoying themselves. Food As you \u2019ve read from other reviews the food is overall good. Some meals were better than others but we never had a terrible meal here. Our favorite restaurants were The Grill and Agave but Chez and Lobster House were also good meals too. I usually love Asian food and was not all that impressed with Spice. I guess I set my expectations too high after reading other reviews of it. We frequented the Sports Bar for early dinner snacks and they had a great variety of bar type food that was surprisingly high quality. We ate light lunches at the kitchen table buffet that was very good. They have a flat grill cooking area that allows you to see the chef cook whatever meat you pick out. My only 2 complaints with the restaurants were the seating process at dinner and long pants rule. The hostess has to fill out 3 different forms just to sit you and at rush hour dinner time this causes a large line of people just standing waiting to be seated with open tables everywhere. I also was n\u2019t a huge fan of having to wear long pants shoes to dinner at such a humid place on vacation. Dress shorts shoes should be the norm as those restaurants are n\u2019t fine dining places. Amenities Entertainment The night shows were very fun. Our favorite ones were the Circus and MJ show. Make sure you get to the theatre around 9 pm to get a good seat. The entertainment crew works very hard to make each day fun. The main pool area was n\u2019t as loud as some other resorts which I appreciated. We played bingo daily and I also played in the ping pong tournament. The gym was awesome. One of the better gyms I \u2019ve seen at a resort with about every machine and cardio machine you can think of. 3 full tennis courts full basketball court mini golf pool tables and ping pong tables. Beach. The beach was awesome. Probably a half mile long of beach front that was great for walking. The ocean was a little rough but it did n\u2019t stop people from getting in. We really liked that every seat day bed had shade with it and there were plenty of spots so no one had to save spots. We are n\u2019t all inclusive pros by any means but compared to the other few that we have been to this resort was far better than Sandals Royal Caribbean and was just as good as Sandals South Coast another true 5 star resort in my opinion.

An incredible selection of yummy food to accommodate both the homesick and the foodies wanting to try something new. Breakfast available in two locations including a buffet. Lunches in three locations including a beach hut that features different caribean style meals daily. Nice pools and beautiful atmosphere. Much cooler in temperature than other resorts in Punta Cana due to the location on the coast which makes night times much more breezy and pleasant than the stifling heat. The only complaint would be the beach. It is still stunning but due to the location they have a lot of debri washing in on the large waves but they immaculately clean the beach every Monday. The entertainment is spectacular you can tell the dancers truly appreciate North American culture and incorporate every detail in the different shows. The restaurants are fine dining and all though tipping is not expected as someone who has worked years in fine dining they are formally trained and should be tipped for the style of service they provide. My only complaint would be how I feel the western world is being represented in this establishment. I understand you \u2019re on vacation but use manners. Please thank you. Practice speaking the basics in Spanish make eye contact and be respectful. Understand that you are visiting a country that almost never has the privilege of enjoying what you are being served.

This is our 3rd stay at an Excellence resort. We have stayed at the Riviera Maya and El Carmen locations previously. We had originally booked the Punta Cana location for our honeymoon but were told a few months out that it was closed from June November 2017 for renovations. We were disappointed but loved the El Carmen location. it is gorgeous. We decided to book Punta Cana thinking how wonderful it would be since it was recently renovated. Having stayed at Excellence before we expected all the luxuries and pristine facilities that they typically have to offer except better with the renovations. Unfortunately the resort was nothing like we had expected. Our room was sticky and warm. We requested service they came for a few hours to work on it and still warm and sticky so we had to request an oscillating fan. Given all of the bad press the DR has received lately we got an email saying we could request an upgrade so that we did. We were upgraded to a pool view room and the Excellence Club which we love. This was far from an upgrade. Aside from the room temperature the room looked unfinished. A bathtub randomly in the main area under the TV shower head was leaking and rusty and the safe malfunctioned they did come to fix this right away. One of our favorite features of the Excellence Resort is the Martini Bar which is usually the center of the resort and enclosed in AC. This Martini Bar sat about 10 people and did not provide relief from the heat and humidity. We explored the pools with brown tiles that are chipping all over and found that the far part of the resort seemed completely deserted. It was empty. Overall the facility was disappointing especially since it was suppose to have been newly renovated. We loved the proximity to the beach at this location. Another disappointment were the items that were out such as mint for mojitos fruit or juice for other drinks and coffee yes we were told after dinner sorry we are out of coffee. Another disappointment was that the restaurants were not all open and they do not have the Indian restaurant Basmati which we have loved at the other locations. The restaurants that were open had a long wait time. There also seemed to be some people that were considered celebrities as on three occasions we were seated and did not receive our meals until after these individuals that arrived after us and who were greeted by all the staff. It was unusual. The shows were great particularly the saxophonist great job. We enjoyed the trip but expect a lot more from an Excellence Resort.

A dollar here and there is much appreciated but not expected. For beach lovers a little warning fabulous beach but remember it is on the Atlantic side so very rough and a nasty rip so if the life guard says do n\u2019t go in listen to them. Yesterday they had to go in and rescue 4 people who were in trouble 1 to start and 3 who tried to save her thanks to the prompt action and great skill they were all ok but could have been very diferentLast night entertainment was the Queen tribute outstanding and well worth it. Restaurants our favourite was probably the French but enjoyed the tapas Italian grill and the Magna. Not so keen on the Asian or the Lobster. Coffee shop is open all day for a good selection of coffee ice cream and delicious cakes if you can find room. beach waiters have a list of pizza and snacks if you do n\u2019t want to get of the sun beds. Grounds are immaculate and a walk to see the gardens with the flamingos and the resident parrot well worth the effort.

Excellence Punta Cana keeps bringing us back. We enjoy the property. the facilities the food and drink but it is the people who keep us coming back. When you arrive at Excellence they say Welcome home. It was charming the first time but now it feels very genuine. Things are very much the same here. Tranquil peaceful and just a true tropical vacation getaway. If you did not come to party. you came to the right place. We did notice this year there is a big downturn in occupancy. We heard it was 40 per cent or less. We could tell it was down it did not impact our experience much but I hope for the sake of our favourite resort and the staff that it picks up. THE ROMThis time we stayed in an Excellence Club swim up room all of these category of rooms are on the Cascade Pool so there is no ocean view. However you can step out onto your deck and right into a beautiful pool that feels almost private. The Cielo Bar is right on this pool and the staff there took incredible care of us. Shoutouts to JHON HENDRUIX and WILMY especially and DIAZ who took over on our last day. The rooms at Excellence are very much the same clean and comfortable nice robes stocked mini fridge and bar. EXCELLENCE CLUB OR NOExcelence Club is worth it to us two exclusive pools bars and an exclusive restaurant and beach area. If you do not stay in Excellence Club you will still get the same great service. Also there are many options for rooms. do you want ocean view or garden view. A private plunge pool. A rooftop terrace. we have walked around and all rooms and views look good to us just depends what you like. DAILY ROUTINE DINING OPTIONSOur routine was a little different from past visits. but not much. This year we really enjoyed doing breakfast at MAGNA the exclusive Excellence Club restaurant. It was just too relaxing with French press coffee great food try the grilled sausage with chutney and of course great service. We were well taken care of here by JOSE MIGUEL JOHNNY ELIZIER and EDDY. The staff is the same at breakfast so it was a great chance to get to know them better. After breakfast it is beach time. What we love here is when you go to the beach someone is there to greet you. Sun or shade. Bed or lounger. They find you a spot and make up a little bed for you with towels. Service on the beach is steady drinks snacks anything you need. Lunch at LOS OLAS was always a treat quick and simple buffet style but the same great service from the chefs and servers. JOEL was always waiting for us with a warm smile and cold cerveza. Afternoons in the Cascade Pool are hot and sunny and with our room there it was a perfect hangout. For dinner we went back to MAGNA three times because it is a nice outdoor dining area and they offer a good steak. In addition to the staff mentioned earlier we had a bit of a wait for a table one night but had a lot of fun sitting at the bar with another couple where SORIANO mixed drinks and kept us smiling. We also ate at THE GRILL good steak too SPICE for sushi and pad Thai and our first meeting with EDDY also a great server and AGAVE for Mexican RAFAEL was another great friendly server thereFor the first time in three visits we ate at the Hibachi grill located in the Spice restaurant. This is the only dining that requires a reservation and it must be made the same day starting at 7 am in the lobby. I was awake early one morning so I went for it. JORDI is a master chef and very entertaining. Just know that you are rolling the dice if you are travelling as a couple you will be eating with eight strangers so hopefully you are with good people. THE LITTLE THINGSLike I said it is the people. At Excellence you feel like a welcomed guest with smiles and greetings from everyone you interact with. I have been to other good resorts but things like finding change for tips was for some reason a big deal. Here they just make it happen. You are on vacation. You should not have to worry about a thing. THE SPA is not really my thing but if it is yours I hear good things from my wife. AIRPORT. TRANSFERSLast year we did a package vacation which meant a shared ride to the resort. In addition to having to make stops along the way we were slow getting away from the airport as we waiting for other passengers. This year we fast tracked all the way. We opted for the PUJ Airport VIP ARRIVAL service. For 150 USD payable in cash on arrival \u2013 there is a greet with a golf cart waiting on the tarmac holding a sign with your name on it. They take you to a VIP lounge where you wait for them to get your luggage and process your Customs paperwork. After a short time they come take you to your resort transfer. This year we booked a PRIVATE transfer through DAT. It was easy to book online and I felt completely confident they would be reliable and they were. We tried to keep track and we think it was 1 hour 40 minutes from the time we landed to the time we were at the resort on our deck drink in hand. We talked to others who were about 90 minutes just getting through the airport. Our DAT Transfer was return and on our departure day they were there ready for us about 15 minutes earlier than our scheduled time. which is great. Our driver made our departure a little less sad. Alex Jimenez I think was so friendly and he gave us some Spanish lessons and some local knowledge during the drive including information about the area and the local culture. CONCLUSIONJust another awesome week in paradise and yes we plan to be back. We hope you will visit and help support all our friends at Excellence Punta Cana.", "offset": [2984, 3268], "date": "2020-03-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "transport"}]}
