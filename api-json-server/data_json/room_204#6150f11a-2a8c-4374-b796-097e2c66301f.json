The room was spacious well laid out and comfortable. The bed was comfortable the desk well suited for work and the bathroom was fine. The drapes worked well allowed for complete darkness if required but were not in the way of daylight. Overall the room had plenty of space and was clean and functional. The hotel is quite large with many amenities. The common areas on the ground floor are large and open and to one side is a seating area where refreshments are served. There are some restaurants in the hotel and there is a cafe where sandwiches salads drinks and more can be purchased. On the top floor there is a swimming pool and workout room. Did not try the pool but used the workout room a few times. It is rather small but works fine and has great view outside. The service at the hotel was very good throughout. Check in was quick and friendly always nice after overnight flight from Europe. The concierge staff was helpful with any requests we had and the same can be said with all the staff.

This is a review of the long term apartments managed by Kempinski and located in the office block adjacent to the hotel.

Being alone I had a 1bdrm apartment with fully functioning kitchen including all appliances. Dishes were quite nice a four of everything. Although cooking utensils can be improved Teflon frying pans all scratched up wooden cutting board with splinters. Water filers also did not work at first. After a number of interactions with management some of those issues were resolved. Bathrooms are large include a washer dryer combo in a single unit. The drying part works surprisingly well. Overall the apartment has plenty of storage and work space. For a separate small fee you can have big jugs of water delivered along with a hot cold water dispenser. All tenants receive a membership to the gym not the one in the hotel but a separate one for there apartment ofice block. Apartment residents do not not get access to hotel pool except for a fee. Apartments include housekeeping twice a week. The quality of vacuuming is inconsistent. Also some soft furniture keeps shedding. Overall not ostentatious at all but functional convenient and was a good option for a long stay. Any stay over a few months might get mentally hard.

Both rooms immaculate and room service was as expected for a 5Star hotel. I \u2019ve been coming here for almost 10 years for 2 4 separate visits each year. The hotel serves as my entry and exit portal to China partly because of their excellent limo service to and from airports and train stations that service at Beijing Capital International Airport is priceless. escort through airline checkin immigration customs and security and right up to either the gate for my flight or the Airline Lounge whatever my preference That service relieves much of the stress of navigating BCIA. I usually stay in an Executive Floor Deluxe room but sometimes receive a free \u201c upgrade \u201d to a Suite. My advice if I you are traveling alone stick with the Deluxe room which has a larger and more comfortable bed and is easier to manage four days in a suite and my stuff is scattered over two closets and multiple dressers in three rooms and the walk from bedroom to the bathroom is a long journey. GREAT SHOWERS in the Executive Floor rooms. These are designed to provide showers as a luxury hotel bath should do eg the ceiling rain head delivers a Cat 5 Hurricane torrent of water. Room Services are prompt and amenities eg shampoo hotel slippers The Executive Floor rooms and the Executive Floor Lounge of Beijing Kempinski Lufthansa Center Hotel have been undergoing major remodeling for well over 2 years during which stays requiring those spaces were not as pleasant as usual because of noise and less quality of service in the Lounge.

The main courses are prepared in the Lounge kitchen fresh by chefs and I found each and every one of them of very high quality. Each is a small snack but one can be very satisfied by ordering two or more of them. Also offered are some light desserts and snacks like spicy peanuts chips pretzels. Accompanying the food is a broad selection of very good wines sparking and still wines beers fruit juices mineral waters. Breakfast in the Executive Floor Lounge is likewise top notch with a la carte eggs pancakes et cetera and a salad fruit cheese bar.

There needs to be a clearer instruction on how to get onto the 18th floor at least at the hotel guide provided in the room. The hotels interior is sleek bright and modern. We love that the lightings at the corridor and inside the room are bright and clear. Our room had very comfortable twin beds. Lovely sized room with great bathroom. The water pressure both for the bath and shower was excellent. We found the hand basin was rather too shallow but worked our way in using it. The room was a bit dusty due to the garden construction onsite. We asked for additional blanket and latex pillow they came very fast. Some minor things that can be improved about the rom1. No saucer and small spoons provided to stir hot beverages2. Our room was not cleaned until around 1 at noon maybe it was a really busy day. The cleaning itself was very fast professional and clean though. The staff that was handling it was friendly and warm. Breakfast was impressive. Wide varieties of food and drink to choose from and the refilling restocking of the food was fast. When it gets busy around 9 am service could get a little slow I had to ask 3 times for a cup of cappuccino and tea for my husband. We were well in the middle of our breakfast when the hot drinks finally arrived. Pool changing room is small sized but well maintained and clean.
