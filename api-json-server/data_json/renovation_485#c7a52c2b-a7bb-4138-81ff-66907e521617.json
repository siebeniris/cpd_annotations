Right off the bat Anna at the front desk was fabulous. We made reservations for the executive floor 7th. When we booked we had no problem. Meanwhile unbeknown to us the hotel changed their booking rates to charge an additional amount to be on the 7th floor. Anna took care of it. Thank you Anna. Now for the crappy part. Our room was so noisy with a very loud droning noise that is sounded as if a big rig was idling next door. Constantly. There was no way I was going to be able to hear the TV or to sleep for that matter. By 10 PM I had it and called the front desk. They sent up the maintenance guy Lorenzo. He said that it was the air conditioning below us and next door to us and that he was not able to do anything about it. However he did have a terrace suite that was unoccupied for repair and that if we want to look at it he would move us. This suite had no one above next door or below. So at 11 PM we moved all our stuff across the building to that room. Yes it was in a little need of repair but it was clean and QUIET. YAY. A big thank you to Lorenzo. From that time on we did have a very nice stay. On the executive floor besides the room you get a continental breakfast coffee cereal juice breads pastry bagels etc. And an evening reception that includes drinks with top shelf mixers such as Absolute Vodka and the like. They also serve what could only be described as a meal. One night cheese enchiladas the next night baked chicken. It was great. But the very best thing about both was Myoung the lady that served the drinks and basically took great care of everyone. She is fantasticLong story short we would definitely stay there again but only in the top floor terrace suites. And should you stay in a room not to your liking say something. They bent over backwards to ensure we had a very nice stay. A big thanks and kudos to Anna Lorenzo and Myoung. You are what made our stay worthwhile. Tip Spring for the executive floors.

The bed I had was very comfortable very supportive without being too hard or too soft and even the pillows typically the bane of my typical hotel experience were comfortable and supportive as well. The hotel is still undergoing renovation so the pool area was closed which meant no enjoyment of the hot tub could have been taken but I am not complaining about that. I think renovation is necessary. I have to have my room completely dark in order to sleep well but there was a lot of what I will call light leakage in my room. First there is a nightlight built in to the bathroom mirror. A nice techie touch but it meant I had to close the bathroom door. There was an orange glow from the alarm clock who uses a hotel alarm clock anymore when we all cell phones. that I had to put my dirty sock over. But the most annoying light leakage came from the significant space between the floor and the door that caused a lot of light from the hallway to come in. I will say the blackout curtain was wonderful. The breakfast was nice but really Hilton why do you charge 1595 person for a buffet breakfast in addition to the price of the room. Why can not it just be included in the price. it is pretty much on par with what is served at BWs or Holiday Inn breakfasts. Seriously get with the program.

So what happened is that there was the ludicrous situation of people boarding the UP elevator in order to go DOWN knowing that there would be no room for them if they waited on the down elevator. I suggested that management open up the service elevator for guest use but that idea was rejected. I also had problems with housekeeping not wanting to do their work perhaps because of understafing I am not sure. But that issue was resolved by the friendly front desk staff.

The plumbing needs total replacement no matter which room I have stayed over the years there is always a pluming problem that can not be fixed tubs do not drain toilets barely flush in some rooms there is no hot water available during peak showering time etc. You can not put a bandaid on a system that needs total replacement. The refurb of the hotel ignored the infrastructure problems. Customers are not stupid. The staff works incredibly hard to work with the bad hand that they have been delt. The staff is respectful and kind and hardworking but they can only do so much. They have lost many outstanding workers over the last few years that my husband and I have been staying at the Hilton Tucson East.
