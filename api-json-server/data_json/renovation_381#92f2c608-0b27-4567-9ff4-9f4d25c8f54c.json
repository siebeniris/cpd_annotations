All the buffet places serve the same food however some are better than others. The Italian place is the best we ate there two nights. The Japanese place was horrible food was not edible we just grabbed food at the buffet afterwards. Tried to eat at partnering hotels which the palace manager said we could but we were denied access. Room We had two connection rooms. The view was horrible however we spent no time in them so it did not matter to us. We stayed right outside of construction which was annoying but it stopped around 5 pm and did not start again until we were out of the room in the morning. The bathroom was horrible. I wore shower shoes the whole time. The air conditioning is what you would expect for a tropical resort. I thought it was fine. however nothing dried because it was so humid. There were also no elevators. Thankfully we were on the second floor and are 21 so we had no trouble walking up and down but if you are older or handicap I am not sure how you would be able to stay here. Drinks. I thought the alcohol was great. It was not horrible. No drinks were weak they were mostly too strong which is nice since it is all inclusive I would worried we would get the poor end of the stick. Service Most of the servers were amazing. They remembered us from meal to meal. However one server named Gene was incredibly creepy. He waited for my friend and proceeded to kiss her as she left the bathroom. We were lucky this happened on the last night as she felt too uncomfortable to be around were he was serving.

I stayed at the Riu Palace Punta Cana between the dates of January 23 30th 2019 making this my 6th time to the DR. This was my first time at the Riu Palace PC and I was initially very impressed with the manicured grounds and recent renovations. The service at the main buffet and various bars was good as staff were attentive and friendly. The room was modern and clean no issues in regards to housekeeping. Take note that multiple couples people we met even on my floor said they came back to their rooms and their safes were open and money missing. This was not my personal experience but I witnessed a couple come back to their room around midnight and have to call management in regards to missing items. Towards the end of the week there was a medical emergency at the main pool bar. A young woman slipped off the pool bar chair and was submerged under water for an unknown amount of time. Multiple women who witnessed her go under pulled her out of the pool and onto one of the lounge chairs. This is where I and a nurse I met earlier in the week come in. We indicated to all staff and visitors that we had medical training and started the assess her vital signs. We immediately called for medical help asking staff to rush and get a doctor while we took necessary steps to make sure she was getting oxygen. She started choking and seizing fingertips and lips turning blue. All we could do was turn her on her side hold her head from hitting anything while we waited for staff to arrive. No one near the pool or beach seemed to have any medical or CPR training and had no clue what to do in a situation like this. To make matters worse the young womans spouse denied all medical care costs by signing a waiver right beside her at the pool and hotel management medical staff turned around and walked away saying there is nothing they could do. I had to argue with the hotels manager to advocate for this girl to be taken to a medical facility on the hotels property. If I and other guests at the hotel did not advocate for this woman no one would have hotel staff would have left her right at the pool. what is even more concerning than the actual incident is how staff handled the situation. The following day staff were asking random guests to fill out incident reports yet no one asked any of the guests involved with helping this girl. We were avoided like the plague. The acting manager specifically avoided us and front desk staff gave 3 different names in regards to him when asked. the final name I was given for the manager in charge on January 28 was Joselo I really hope he s not in charge should you ever need any urgent help. I want to end this review on a someone positive note by saying the resort itself is beautiful the beach is breathtaking the food was good and I would ultimately go back to this resort.

We has stayed at the sister resort the Riu Macao last year and enjoyed it so when we heard about the update done at the Palace we booked for 2 weeks. The experience was about the same as the Macao but this resort is much more grand and everything is new and working perfectly. Much more space to sit out yet did not find it any harder to get around. Great trip with Sunwing about an hour late both ways seems to be about normal with charter flights. Arrived at the resort and had a good check in and were very happy with our lovely jr suite. The King bed was very comfortable room was well stocked and the maid service was excellent. The room and the whole resort was the cleanest place we have ever been to. Even the bathrooms closer to the beach and pool were spotless. We tried the steak house Spanish Japanese and fusion. They were all good with the exception of the Spanish The food was not to our liking. Had a steak and Lobster at the steakhouse and it was pretty good enjoyed the food a bit more than last year. Jerk chicken at the beach was very tasty for an afternoon snack. Service was very good everywhere and we loved that Marina and Larmairs took such good care of us at the buffet. We were 4 the first week and eight the second week and they always had a table ready for us. Management should be very proud of these workers that go above and beyond to make guests enjoy their meals. Beach is the best as we have stayed in many resorts along this stretch. A few new loungers would be nice as there was a shortage with some people saving loungers in the shade and in the sun leaving some people without one. The pools are new and very well designed. we could normally find a lounger there most of the time and you could sit in the shade or sun. The only let down we had was the front desk. Our friends that joined us the second week arrived at 130 at night and were taken to a room that was not made up. They did not find a room for them for about and hour and half and even wanted them to pay an extra 30 for a garden view upgraded room. It was late and they were tired the staff could have handled it better as they had to call a manager and I do not think they ever got him on the phone.

Smiling faces and prompt attention with a genuine desire to accommodate guests needs were demonstrative. the norm. You can not fake nice and management is to be commended for the results of their hiring practices and supervision. The physical facilities offer pretty much whatever you might desire and they are kept up immaculately. The pools are spotless and the beach welcoming sandy and clean. If there is one potential downside to the beach for some it is that it is public. So be aware of your valuables just common sense really. There are plenty of lounge chairs at the beach and ample palm trees for shade when desired. One is issued a towel card per person at check in and you can exchange your towels throughout the day as often as the desire to do so takes you. The food was well above the norm for a non truly exclusive overly expensive all inclusive. If you can not find something to satisfy your desires you are really either not hungry andor not looking. The buffets have something for everyones palette. The assortments of fresh tropical fruits at all times were a treat as were the pastries. The bakers do any outstanding job on both the deserts and numerous varieties of breads. Though we sampled the specialty restaurants come early they do not take reservations and fill up quickly and were satisfied with all of those which we sampled being the Japanese Spanish Haute Cuisine French and Steak Lobster the buffets are expansive and highly diverse among their offerings. Like I said if you can not find somethings to satisfy you you are not hungry andor not looking. Made to order eggs omelettes stir fry and a host of various regions foods are on offer. The grilled BQd chicken at the pool side snack bar was surprisingly tasty and made for a pleasant and quick lunch. there is plenty of sea foods on offer as well. Burgers and fries are on offer virtually all of the time should you be traveling with childrenThe rooms renovated over the summer of 2018. are extremely well maintained by the staff they come in twice daily to clean make up the room and replenish the beverage supply in the fridge. The bar and fridge were adequately stocked with Vodka Stolychneya Rum Brugel a local DR product. though not their top label and Gin Gordons. The fridge contained a surprisingly pleasant local the most popular DR lager pilsner style beer Presidente. Unfortunately for my tastes the establishment is a Pepsi products one. there is something just wrong about making a cuba libre without Coke though you can purchase Coke at their shop. Liters of water were amply provided and refreshed as well. A footnote about water it is advisable to use bottled water in your rooms to drink and brush your teeth with. Otherwise the water served in the restaurants and the ice used for drinks are all adequately safeguarded and we experienced no gastrointestinal issues whatsoever. So relax in that regard. Please remember to tip your housekeeping staff their wages are low and they depend on gratuities and they earn the your consideration. For those whom might wish to work off some of those calories yoga classes and exercise classes in the pool at the beach and elsewhere take place at various times and those conducting them are very pleasant people. there is a sports bar with food if that is your thing the NCA Tournament was taking place while we were there and there was a contingent of Michigan State fans ensconced at the Sports Bar when we passed by. Evenings entertainment is somewhat limited this is not Broadway Vegas or a substantial cruise ship but we found some of the musical offerings pleasant and sufficiently diverse to satisfy our needs. For our trip at the end of March early April apart from a little rain a nature imposed siesta the weather was delightful. Though we did not venture in it is my understanding that the casino is operated by a separate entity so I have nothing other to add to that. For a week or so if you want to relax dine drink swim golf snorkel dive dance enjoy some excellent coffee top notch cigars etc etc this is a near perfect venue to do so.
