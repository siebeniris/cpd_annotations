We had a room in the seventh floor because it was there where the executives suites were located. As we entered our room the bathroom were kind of small but clean. The room was spacious and the beds were comfortable. The only thing missing in this executive queen suite was a refrigerator and a microwave.

I stayed in a pet friendly room on a different floor with my dog though I paid for the Executive floor with a breakfast included. I was told that pets could not stay on the Executive floor after I had checked in. When I arrived in the room the bathroom was dirty in a disgusting way a housekeeper did come and clean it up. The room itself was shabby with faded furniture and old fraying carpet. Twice I had to call for a person to fix the WIFI so I could even use my computer. Also I ordered room service breakfasts thinking these would be the breakfast which was included in my room rate. This was not the case. To get my free breakfast I had to go to the hotel restaurant and leave my dog alone in the room which was against their written rules. One morning I gave up trying to get the tv on since the remote was not working. Over the years I have stayed at Hilton Doubletree hotels and found the same worn out conditions in the rooms.

The fridge in our room looked like my fridge that I used in college dented and dirty. What a farse. Never NEVER STAY HERE AT ANY PRICEManager said that this hotel was renovated 6 years ago. I find that hard to believe. Comparing this to other Hilton properties here in Tucson expecialy the El Conquisatodor that true resort had rooms for less then this pathetic excuse of a hotel.
