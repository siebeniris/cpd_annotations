We visited in NYC in Mid September and were looking for a clean comfortable hotel in a decent location in Manhattan. The Shelburne fit the bill and then some. Located on Lexington and 73th it is within 10 blocks of Times Square 4 blocks to the Green 6 line subway and in a quieter less crowded part of Manhattan. Our room was extremely clean and looked relatively new. The bedding was very clean and comfortable. Comfortable and quiet enough that we were able to sleep almost as good as home. The hotel has a bar and restaurant conveniently located next to the lobby that serves well above par bar food and appetizers. The best amenity was the rooftop bar that provided views of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. Other niceties included a wine reception happy hour in the evenings and a passable gym with some machines and free weights in addition to the normal cardio equipment. The Shelburne is an outstanding value charging 12 to 13 of other hotels with similar amenities.

The main bedroom king size was huge. The sofa bed was also larger than a double. The sitting room and bedroom had large flat screen TVs. There was a fairly tight bathroom. The room was a good size with a large shower but the toilet was tucked into a corner with a boxed in section for the pipes that was awkward for taller people.

We had an unfortunate experience at the Afinia Shelburne. I know that bed configurations and other requests are never guaranteed but this particular occurrence really soured me on staying here in the future. We had reserved a \u201c One Bedroom Queen Deluxe Suite \u201d described to include \u201c separated living and sleeping rooms work desk sleeper sofa two flat screen TV \u2019s large bath and kitchen \u201dI had booked 2 months in advance and had called to reconfirm 2 days before traveling. Upon arrival there was only one young lady at the check in desk dealing with a somewhat upset family who \u2019s reservation was in question and the clerk was trying to accommodate them best she could. This went on for 5 10 minutes as I waited. Eventually another front desk clerk arrived to check us in. She quickly explained that due to overboking there were no suites available. No chance to be sent to another Afinia property \u201c they are all booked this week is crazy \u201d and no chance to move you to a suite later in the week \u201c it \u2019s just not possible. \u201dWe were offered what I would describe as the worst possible 2 bed standard room on the property. The room was quite dated carpet worn wrinkled stained furniture scratched and discolored immediately across from the elevator very noisy and the view from this 6th floor we had requested a high floor with view was an apartment building across 37th street. The hotel adjusted the rate by a 75 night reduction which may have been nothing more than a change from suite rate to standard room for all I know. The only extra compensation was one free breakfast during our 7 night stay. We had reserved a spacious 500 60 sq. ft. apartment style accommodation on a high floor with a view and received a single room with stained carpet and half the square footage. I am sure they were doing their best to accommodate everyone but this was indeed not the best way to start our week in the city. From a lot of glowing reviews it seems many travelers love this property. Maybe the sour taste day one left in our mouths really made our stay seem so unremarkable. All said found the hotel to be less than what we expected. The rooftop bar is cute the wi fi worked fine although you are limited to 3 devices and the doormen were pleasant. Not sure what proper compensation might have been but we felt a single morning breakfast was a bit meager for the drastic change in our accommodations.", "offset": [1659, 1792], "date": "2016-07-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "f287fcf6-2cf5-496b-bea1-31d3b703486f", "sentence": "Big Rooms Nice Neighborhood. Stayed 2 nights at the Shelburne and overall had a pleasant experience despite the sometimes indifferent attitude of the staff. This property is a wana be luxury hotel and there are hints of it elegance in certain spots. I would classify it as a moderate hotel similar to an older Hilton or Mariot. First off the rooms are quite large for New York which is a big plus. And Murray Hill is a pretty quiet neighborhood and populated with several good restaurants and shopping largely on 3rd and on Lexington Ave. The furniture in the room is pretty shop worn and due for a refresh. The beds were not what I would expect to find in a 300 per night hotel for me they were way too hard and most decent hotels my this time have upgraded to hybrid beds a la Hilton and Mariot. Be aware that the windows are not double insulated so expect to hear sirens cars honking etc. When I first arrived at my room I did a once over and had to call the front desk to get housekeeping to scrub the mildew in the shower. Once done my room smelled like bleach for a couple of hours they cleaned it while I went to dinner. That said the shower is large and walk in with good water pressure. The soap dispensers mounted on the wall had lost their springs so it takes some effort to get them to dispense the body wash and shampoo. There is a closet for hanging items. small but it did the trick. The lobby is comfortable with several sofas and chairs and looked as if it had recently been refurbished. However in all the seating areas only one chair was close to a plug for my phone and laptop. The one big annoyance for me was the doors are all spring loaded. Since I arrived very late and had to be up at 5 am I tried sleeping later morning but could not due to the housekeeping staffs constant opening and banging shut the doors. I complained to pretty deaf ears the easy remedy would be to just keep the doors open while the rooms are being cleaned. All in all it was a nice hotel personally I would not stay again given the price with a convenient location walkable to Empire State Building and Bryant Park Times Square.", "offset": [1399, 1504], "date": "2016-12-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "5452c97d-408b-4e02-82c2-3aceb04bdfb2", "sentence": "Humdrum hotel not awful but nothing special either Stayed here two nights for business in December.

First the good news. excellent location near Grand Central Station shopping restaurants and large rooms by NYC standards a happy hour and a very nice roof bar. Now the bad a 25 daily resort fee is tacked on to any rate you are quoted. This hotel is far from a resort. After we checked out we learned from other reviewers that the resort fee entitles you to 10 worth of merchandise from the lobby store which we were never informed of at check in. If you want to avoid nearby traffic and congestion noise there is also an additional charge for an upper floor room which we thought was included when we booked a room on a higher floor was offered before check in for 15 per night and charged 30 per night at check in. To reach these upper floors you have to take one of the two cramped very hot slow elevators available to guests. The views can be nice if you can see through the filth on the windows.

However the greatest turn off remains the \u00ab hotel facilities fee \u00bb of 30 USD per night charged by the hotel in addition to the prepaid reservation. Even though the agent Hotel Tonight states that There is a Hotel Facilities Fee of 30 plus tax per room per night and is exclusive of service gratuities \u00bb on the reservation confirmation page one could legitimately assume that this fee is the one described under the \u00ab Taxes and Fees \u00bb line that appears in the bill sent by the agent.
