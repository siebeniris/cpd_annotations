Booked Omni Barton Creek for a 2night work trip due to its proximity to our office. After reading some of the reviews I prepared myself for the worst. However my stay was just fine and I would stay again even before renovations are complete. I look forward to seeing the place after the renovations. I had a King room and it was very large. The room was clean furniture was fine. Looked more updated than the photos on line and I do not think it was a renovated room. Bed was also very comfortable. If I stayed again I would rent a vehicle as the Omni is a resort by itself and not in walking distance to anything in the area. For the most part I used Lyft for transportation which normally came within 7 minutes but would have been nice to have a vehicle to go more places. From the airport my Lyft ride was 30 heading back to the airport it was closer to 40 maybe due to the time of day closer to rush hourI ate at Hill Country Dining Room twice for dinner and the food was really good. The service was great as one night I came down close to closing and despite not being crowded I was not rushed. The outdoor pool was closed for renovations while I was there but I did get a glimpse of the indoor pool while using the gym facilities. The gym is also very large with lots of equipment. There was also a tranquility room I did not get to try out. I did hear the construction but it was always after 8 am and not horrible. I came back to the hotel around 6 pm each day and there was no noise form construction so I gather the construction happens during business hours. Despite the construction outside my room I still had a beautiful view of the hills and some homes in the distanceThere is a small cafe gift shop in the lobby with a coffee tea bar snacks pastries and breakfast tacos. I did not try the tacos but a great option if you are on the go and not enough time to go to the dining room for breakfast.

Worst Massage ever. My husband and I booked a couples massage for Saturday 54 at 90 am. We have visited this hotel for over 15 years. The renovations are a wonderful improvement and look great. However someone needs to hire competent people. The hotel had a soft opening this weekend and was not busy. We asked if we could view what the new rooms look like and the front desk person was very rude and would not show any room at all. The spa was filthy. The women \u2019s locker had three toilets and two were gross and the floors were dirty everywhere. They were gross before I went in for my massage and the exact same 2 hours later. No cleaning people at all. My husband asked for a pair of slippers and the guy went to look for some and never returned. When I booked the couples massage I was told we would have a room with either a bath or a shower. Well we did not. They made a make shift room that did not even have a tissue. I would love to see the training if any that the two women had that gave us our massages. We paid 581 for the most lame service I have ever experienced. I was actually wanting it to end before our 70 minutes were over. We took a walk by the swimming pool and the trash cans were over flowing with trash. I watched numerous employees walk right passed it and not one seemed to even notice all the trash. I am sad that this hotel seems to have NO manager.

The common spaces restaurant options pool and fitness facility were top notch. Our guest room however fell short we had thought we were staying in a deluxe queen room but I am fairly sure the beds were two doubles and fairly uncomfortable felt like the top section of the bed was slanting downward. For an Omni resort I would also expect more attention to detail eg access to outlets in the guest room and a trash bin in the main room not just a small wastebasket in the bathroom. I know the resort has just recently re opened after a recent renovation and service suffers as a result. Cafe staff were frequently frazzled pool staff were slow and inattentive main lobby staff were unable to provide helpful recommendations or info for the surrounding area. I am sure with a few more weekends under their belt all will improve.

I stayed here shortly after the hotel reopened following its 150 M refurb. The OmniBaron Creek is a massive property which could feel like a small town if it was at full capacity. The hotel sits amid hills on its own and towers above everything else. Surrounded by golf courses this has the feel of a retreat not a hotel. The rooms are quite spacious but not I would say luxurious. They have a country manor vibe about them. The bathrooms even after the refit still feel quite old fashioned. I would n\u2019t be copying their design style to put into my own home. The gym and health facilities are where the action is for me. It \u2019s several thousand square feet including all the equipment of a high end practical gym. There are racks cages dips stations Peloton bikes treadmills and even a sled. This is the best hotel gym in Austin by miles. Add to this tennis courts squash courts under construction I think and lots of pools and for someone focused on fitness this is the place to stay. Food was my major disappointment here. I am a vegetarian. The chefs did n\u2019t seem to plan for vegetarians when putting together the menus here. So despite there being four or so restaurants counting one still under construction I struggled to eat. On one occasion I ordered a salad in a hotel restaurant and the food was underwhelming and the meal so small I had to go back to my room and order another \u201c meal \u201d on room service immediately. There are some options on each restaurant menu but they are limited and lack protein I can only eat so much hummus and vegetables. Staying here a whole week I felt the lack of choice bite. I would stress. Austin is amazingly good for vegan and vegetarian food overall better than San Francisco or even New York. So it \u2019s really surprising that Omni have forgotten us at this leading hotel in Austin. The hotel restaurants also seem to stop serving early. I stay here for work so return to the hotel perhaps by 7 pm work out and then want to eat by around 9 pm. This is very hard to do here. I found my choice of restaurants might be just one place by 9 pm the same restaurant every night with limited options for me. As the hotel is in the middle of nowhere you are n\u2019t going to get food delivered or jump to a neighboring restaurant easily. If you are a meat eater most of these food choice problems will go away for you. But you will still struggle with restaurants closing early. In short a great hotel nice location mind bendingly excellent fitness facilities let down for me by disappointing vegetarian food options and limited restaurant opening hours.", "offset": [38, 112], "date": "2019-06-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "93bb9703-4392-4fe0-8948-a3971174867c", "sentence": "My Stay.
