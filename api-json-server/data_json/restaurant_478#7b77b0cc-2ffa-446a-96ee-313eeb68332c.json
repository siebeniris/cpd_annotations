The room was great clean and the hotel staff were wonderful. There are some loud bars in the area but the hotel offers white noise machines and ear plugs if that is a problem for you.

A quick trip to Portland from Yarmouth taking Bay Ferry was a great experience. Recommend taking a taxi from ferry terminal to hotel as the wonderful city has cobble roads and brick sidewalks. conditions that would not be suitcase wheel friendly.

The hotel is near many tour outlets shops and restaurants. It can not go unmentioned that there are NUMEROUS gelato places in the neighbourhood which was perfect for the humid days I experienced. Do ask about the potato doughnut place very interesting experience. If you like to walk this is the city for you. Location is ideal if you do not have a vehicle.

We were very fortunate to be upgraded to a top floor suite which was lovely and so kind. While i was in no way disappointed with the room it was a bit sterile. The lobby and bar give an opulent vibe that i expected to carry into the rooms. Reality felt very corporate. Again not disappointed just not what I would choose had I known. Overall the hotel was quite nice. The free breakfast was a larger spread than expected and pleasing. Only two true disappointments no bathtub and the pool is tiny. You could not do laps in that pool and four or more people would be a serious crowd. I think the space would be better used as a spa hot tub. You can not beat the location right in the heart of the Old Port. The garage is convenient but a little confusing. The is no entrance to the Hotel. Opt to be dropped or pay the very small fee for valet. Lobby Bar Breakfast Location. Heart of the Old Port. Hundreds of restaurants and bars. All that Portland has to offer is mere steps away.
