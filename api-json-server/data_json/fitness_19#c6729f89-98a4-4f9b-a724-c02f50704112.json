The breakfast was good you just ca nt get hot chocolate or special coffees for free its an extra charge. Most hotels we have stayed at we had someone coming to our table asking us if we like a coffee and hot chocolates were also available at no fees.

Location is excellent very close to the train station Westfield and tonnes of places to eat or grab a drink. Staff were friendly and efficient.
