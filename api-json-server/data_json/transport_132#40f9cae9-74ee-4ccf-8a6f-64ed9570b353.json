The Pros 1. This hotel is in a great location. There are a few quick turns once you get off the freeway so keep your eyes peeled. But once you are familiar it is easy to navigate. Also the waterside location makes it extremely appealing. 2. The room was well maintained. Not nearly as fresh as some newer hotels but quite clean and that is very important to me3. The sports bar grill in the lobby is really good. I am not typically one for this type of fare but the quality was above average the portion sizes were huge and the service was attentive. Plus very reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant4. Starbucks in the lobby. Nuf said. The Cons1. I had a really nice person at check in but any time I went to the desk after that the service was less than stellar. One women did not look up from her computer when I approached or even as I spoke which is infuriating2. My friend and I drove from different cities so had two cars. The overnight parking fee is 26 per night PER CAR. I went to the desk to ask if we could get a break since we had two cars. They dismissed me like I a schoolgirl. I am a Mariot Rewards member and was paying 300 night for a so so room. I am fine if you can not make an accommodation. I just expect that you be polite in your refusal3. The service in the open lobby bar dining area was pretty dismal. We had to leave after 15 minutes of no server approaching and ended up eating AGAIN. at the sports bar.

I have tried following up with this location for two days and have even tried calling the general Mariot line but even they can not get someone to pick up the phone 1. Once my room was finally ready after waiting 4 hours I open the room to a dirty bed with messed up sheets that looked like they were slept in 2. Ask for new bedding and once complete their is a gigantic happy stain on top so again I ask for more bedding and house keeping proceeds to put a duvet cover over it right in front of me 3. I go into the bathroom and dirty towels from the previous guest are still hanging on the back of the door and laying of the floor in additional to a garbage can full of trash and no toilet paper so again I call downstairs 4. I turn up the air and head to my first conference session. I return to my room 3 hours later and my room is still well above 70 degrees even though the thermostat says 65. I call a repair guy to come fix the room who tried to assure me that it was 65 degrees as I stand sweating in the room. Once I convince him to increase the airflow the room finally cooled down. 5. Fast forward a few hours. I go to use the restroom in the middle of the night and of course the toilet does not flush at all. I call the front desk AGAIN and ask someone to come fix the toilet. Someone comes up and does something but I assure you fixing the toilet was not it. Again I try to use the restroom and again the toilet does not flush. I call the front desk AGAIN and this time a handy man comes and changes a part and leaves. Now the toilet is flushing over and over again on its own. AGAIN I call the front desk. So now someone comes to fix the toilet successfully at 7 am. I assume in the process the floor was flooded because after he left and I went to take a shower for my 8 am conference session I noticed every single towel in the room was gone so AGAIN I call the front desk. At this point I ask to move to a new room. All of this I mind you took place from 4pm7am. Thanks for a terrible time and terrible service.

I took advantage of the special. 2 30 minute treatments for 100 at the end of a conference I was atendingThere was a problem when I checked in but it was resolved during check in. I had booked months ahead and earlier in the day I checked in with the Mariot mobile ap then called to make sure I had the room I had requested high floor balcony facing the water King bed. They confirmed and gave me the room number on the 18th floor. But when I arrived they gave me 9th floor. I did not think that much about it but wondered what had happened. In the discussion when they gave some story about the people in the room deciding to stay longer sounds odd it is a huge hotel they chose my room to stay longer and after check out and the hotel did not move THEM. it turned out Mariot was giving me a room without a balcony saying they were full and could not give me what I had booked. It took 20 minutes and me insisting on a balcony room before they finally came up with the room that I had ordered and Mariot had confirmed several times. While it is great Mariot finally honored their own commitment I should not have had to get pushy and insist. What about other people who are not so pushy. Does Mariot just hope they will just take the changeAnd if I had not asked about the balcony I would have gotten to the room on the 9th floor only to find out it was not the kind of room I had ordered again that is not a reputable way to operate. Tell me before I go up to the room unles you are trying to hide something like no balcony. Did you think I would not notice. Or is it easier to say too bad over the phone if someone calls to complainWhile we are talking about checking in there is a lighted sign at the edge of the check in desk that says mobile users who have checked in pick up your key here. I bypassed the longer line to stand by the sign. I was ignored until I finally asked a desk clerk and she said oh that does not work we do not do that here. Fine so why leave the sign there. And be a little proactive about what is happening in front of you if you are a professional service personAnyway the annoyances at checking in were more than surpassed by the room view pool spa and otherwise great staff. The food is good too. Of course it is pricey. where do you think you areIf you are a Mariot Rewards member sign up when you make the reservation. you will get free basic wifi in the room 12 per day and 2 small bottles of water per day. it is worth it. particularly if you use a separate email address for these kinds of thingsThe hotel is in an ok location lots of walking along the waterway from the hotel the convenience market is just across the waterway about a 10 minute walk the historic street car to Ybor City is in front of the hotel apparently this used to be a factory and docks area so there is much new development and no real neighborhood around. although there are several new condos on the other side of the waterwayThe city bike share stand is right in front of the hotel.

My major issue related to the handling of a package that was sent to the hotel to me and arrived on the same day I checked in. There was a lapse in either the control system or communication and no one could locate my package. The Bell Staff recommended that I check with surrounding hotels as sometimes packages are mistakenly delivered to other hotels close by. I spend the next two days trying to find these 3 small packages. However on Monday when the ups office opened located on 2nd floor they advised me that the package was received by security and basically was at the hotel for the entire time. The security control manager Jimmy I think handled the matter very well and apologized and tried to clarify the issue. Although the ups staff then changed his story when he realized I repeated what he told me it was all fine at the end because I had my packagesThe reality is this hotel is downtown and mainly a business hotel so I would expect much better handling of packages and proper recording of items received either by front desk security or bell staff.
