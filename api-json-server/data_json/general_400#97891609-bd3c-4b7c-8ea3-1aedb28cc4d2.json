My husband and I hosted our daughter \u2019s wedding ceremony cocktail hour and reception at the Hyat Regency last September 2015. Overall it was probably the best wedding we have ever been to and definitely have to thank Irene Rosenberg the Wedding Coordinator at the Hyat for everything she did to make sure it was an absolutely amazing wedding experience. From the moment we sat down with Irene we had a good feeling that we could sit back and relax a bit about so many details every bride worries about. The Hyat has a variety of packages for weddings and there were even additional incentive offers that made our daughter \u2019s big day an impressive one for sure. LOCATION. On East Golf Road Schaumburg this hotel is located about 15 20 minutes from O\u2019Hare Airport making it an easy access for travelers. It is also located directly across from Wodfield Mall one of the largest malls in the country. TRANSPORTATION. The Hyat has two comfortable shuttle buses that conveniently offer rides to location shopping within a 2 mile radius of the hotel. They do not however pick up or drop off at the airport. Parking is free with plenty of parking to the side and back of the property. HOTEL LOBBY. Just driving up to the hotel does not give you the idea that there are over 468 rooms. During the beautiful weather of September they had comfortable outdoor furniture groupings on the front \u201c porch \u201d area. The lobby is magnificent with a tall atrium check in to the left an inviting open spaced Fresh Bar Fresh 180 Restaurant and Fresh Coffee Shop to the right. In the center of the lobby area are a variety of couch and chair groupings to sit and chat with friends and family. ROOMS. The hotel provides two \u201c getting ready room \u201d for the bridal party but we had an amazing VIP Suite for the bride and her bridesmaids to get ready that had a mini kitchen large dining room with a tall table and chairs and living room with plenty of seating. There were huge windows bringing in lots of natural light looking out to the courtyard. Attached is the bedroom with a king bed and a spacious bathroom. We had a hairdresser and make up artist doing everyone \u2019s hair and make up so there was plenty of room for everyone at the tall table and kitchen area counter. We ordered a room service breakfast in the room for everyone getting ready and that worked out great. The beds were comfortable with a choice of pillows. We were there two nights and even with wedding worries we slept well. The bathrooms are spacious with granite counters and all the amenities you would need for personal care. Wedding rates for our guests was 89 which was extremely reasonable for the area. The Hyat set up a link for all guests to easily make a reservation. We were given a regular list of guests who were staying at the hotel for the wedding. We saw several of the regular rooms which were all up dated and beautifully appointed details. WEDDING PHOTOS Since all the events were taking place so close to each other the bride and groom decided to have a \u201c First Look \u201d and photo session at Buse Woods a forest preserve close by. Their pictures turned out beautiful then they returned and took the other photos in the Pavilion before the ceremony. WEDDING CEREMONY. We chose to have the ceremony in the Pavilion. This is a large white 3season air conditioned tent with carpet chandeliers ceiling fans and windows on 3 sides letting in lots of natural light. It is in the back of the Hyat with only an outside entrance. We worked with Irene to rent a beautiful curtain back drop behind the stage for the ceremony. The chairs were covered with white linen and champagne colored ribbons. We had our florist Russ Wholesale Flowers created a large floral arch as the backdrop framing the couple during the ceremony. It turned out beautiful and beyond our expectations. The isle runner was rolled out all the candles were lit and Irene lined up the bridal party and took care of all the other details. It turned out absolutely beautiful \u2026 the ceremony in this location was like a fairytale. COCKTAIL HOUR. After the ceremony it was very convenient for the guests to walk to the cocktail hour in the Cyan Room. This is a spacious two level room with plenty of space for two full service bars high top tables and 180 guests. We had gloved waiters handing out champagne to all guests as they entered. We also had waiter passed hor d\u2019voures. Our selections included Ahi Tuna with sliced Cucumber and wasabi Caviar Blackened sirloin with remoulade on toasted ciabata Zahtar rubbed lamb skewers with olive oil and lemon and Crispy cashew chicken spring roll with soy dipping sauce. They were all delicious and plenty of them for everyone. When dinner was ready they rang the dinner chimes. RECEPTION DINNER. We had pre selected the food choices at the tasting a few months beforehand. All guests made their dinner selection when the replied with their RSVP. For the dinner salad we chose something a little bit different than the typical boring salad was beautifully presented and tasted delicious. It was Asiago cream cucumber wrapped bouquet with tomato balsamic jam organic greens candied walnuts dried fruit and goat cheese. If you want to treat your guests to something special and out of the ordinary than you will love this salad choice. The three dinner choices were Beef Tenderloin with roasted shallot sauce Roasted breast of chicken with braised leeks and sundried tomatoes and jus lie and the vegetarian options was Eggplant Parmesan. All food choices were fabulous and just over the top in presentation and taste. Just a side note during the food tasting we did try the filet mignon with bleu cheese crusted sauce espagnole and the bleu cheese was just way too overpowering the filet mignon so we did not choose this option. Dessert was the wedding cake of course. The Hyat includes the wedding cake a fairly basic cake with their partner The Bake Shop. We provided a photo of the cake design we wanted selected the cake flavor and filling at the cake tasting a few months prior and the cake arrived more beautiful than we expected. We wanted fondant to prevent the cake from melting and ended up paying an additional 300 which was well worth it see pictures. The couple are both gluten free soy free and dairy free so The Bake Shop made the bride and groom \u2019s cutting cake something they could eat. The large displayed cake was white cake with Bavarian cream filling with fondant icing. It was very delicious. BAR We had a 5 hour Premium Bar Package champagne and cabernet and chardonnay wine served during the meal. The bartenders were awesome and made some really great drinks. The bride and groom had created a couple signatures drinks which were also available for the guests. LATE NIGHT SNACK. We chose to serve mini burgers for the late night munchers an additional fee at about 10 pm. It turns out that most people are n\u2019t really that hungry even after all that dancing and drinking so most of it was uneaten. We would encourage everyone to save your money on this expense. The reception ended at midnight but continued back in our VIP Suite with plenty of room for those still not ready to end their evening. BREAKFAST SUNDAY MORNING. The Hyat has a fabulous buffet breakfast for about 17 which includes just about anything you could want and we wanted to provide that for our overnight guests. Irene worked out a discount for us and Andrew one of the Managers went above and beyond and set up a private room with linens and silverware for our 70 overnight guests to have breakfast together. It was a nice touch as we ended our daughter \u2019s weekend wedding celebration. VENDORS. We had some wonderful vendors for the wedding and wanted to share each of them with you. No surprises and no disappointments.
