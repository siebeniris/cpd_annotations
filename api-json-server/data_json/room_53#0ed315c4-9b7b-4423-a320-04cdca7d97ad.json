Me and 3 girlfriends recently returned from Chateau Elan for my 50th birthday celebration my husband treated us to and it was absolutely WONDERFUL.

Each and every employee we encountered were extremely courteous warm and professional. We were there with the Girls Want to have wine package which includes accommodations at either the inn or the vilaswe got a villa spa services wine tasting and lunch. We were pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded from a two bedroom villa to a three bedroom villa. Thank you again Chateau Elan. The villa was spacious clean and very well appointed. It was a 3 bedroom 3 bath which accommodated the 4 of us quite nicely. It also includes a full kitchen which was stocked with basic items dinnerware flatware pots pans coffee maker and even have a washer and dryer. Our first night we ate at Versailles for the buffet dinner. The food was good especially the prime rib. Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing. We then did our wine tasting immediately after dinner. We tried 8 different wines. The young guy who served us gave us ample servings so needless to say we were feeling great. The next day we had our spa services. 2 of us had facials and 2 had massages. They were all 80 minutes services and blissfully wonderful. The facial I had actually gives me the best of both worlds with foot hand head and shoulder massage along with facial services. You are allowed full use of the spa with any service so we took advantage of steam room sauna and a fresh shower. After the spa we had lunch at marc. This was included in our package. Although they have a very small and limited menu the food was ok. 2 of us had the fried chicken and our only complaint was the skin was a little salty but once you pull the skin off the meat was really good. Chateau Elan is a very relaxing getaway and they really cater to their guest. There were other amenities on the property that we did not partake in golf pool and we were too drunk to go listen to the live music. but it truly served and lived up to its purpose for my girls getaway weekend.

They even delivered a golf cart to our villa so we could load up and let my husband drive it back to unload.

I recommend staying during the week if you are looking for a quiet relaxing stay. The room was very nice and clean. There was a lot of storage space for our things. While visiting we did the wine tour and tasting it was great. I loved the wine glasses the wine and speed of service from the bartenders. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable of the wines and it was cool to see the production room. We also ate at a couple of the restaurants. Versailles brunch on Sunday was okay. I was disappointed in the selection of food quality and taste for the price. It was not worth 27 per person. My coffee was luke warm so this was disappointing as well. We ate at Paddys twice while visiting. The food was good and the service was great. We had the fish and chipssplit. because it was more than enough food for us.

The carpet has stains which you can see in the mirror pic. The plastic coffee maker and actual coffee is the cheapest type.

It all started with my two colleagues and I booking an overnight stay to work and enjoy an evening with the girls. After HOURS of shooting around the property we went downstairs to have dinner at Versailles. Upon sitting we noticed there was only one other couple at the restaurant so we thought perfect our food should be out fast. Boy were we wrong. Not only did it take a long time for the waitress to even come acknowledge us she rushed us. I could totally understand a busy night but on Monday because the winery is n\u2019t open it was completely dead. Our waitress Emie was unfriendly and cold the entire time taking our order. Once we finally were able to order our food came out lukewarm. I was so confused but as I said we were tired and hungry so we ate. Plus we did n\u2019t want anyone to spit in our food. they gave off a warning vibe. We ordered a bottle of wine and would n\u2019t you know it. after tracking her down we had to ask for her to give us clean glasses and water which she reluctantly did and with an eye roll. Needless to say we ended up pouring our own drinks. We eat and asked for a to go bag. She finds one behind the hostess stand and hands me a Chinese take out plastic bag. My colleagues kind of chuckled at how embarrassed she was for the restaurant as she had just traveled from paris just weeks before coming here and definitely was n\u2019t handed a plastic bag to take her food in. After dinner we took a few pictures and headed to our room. We were in our room for roughly an hour before we hear loud banging on the door and a woman clearly drunk and in distress asking for her friend \u201c Andrea \u201d. After opening the door to assist her she assaults us in the doorway. My colleague called security atleast 6 7 times before anyone even answers. It \u2019s 1 am and here I am with two other women having to fight off this lady trying to break in our room. After an elapsed time of about 20 30 mins security finally strolls down the hall all nonchalantly and starts arguing with US. He sees the other woman in the hallway and automatically takes her side. It got worse by what ensued next. Not only did he verbally attack me by telling me to \u201c shut the fck up \u201d he also motioned towards me in a threatening manner and gets right in my face and says \u201c did n\u2019t I tell you to be quiet \u201d. I am completely baffled at how this is a 5 star 4 diamond hotel. I was treated like I was at a motel 8 at dinner then I go to my room just to be attacked by a stranger to then be threatened by security. luxury hotel where. The police should \u2019ve been called on their end and they never did until I called at around 10 am. I asked for management and for her to be put out the hotel she was escorted downstairs just for her to be brought right back to her room where she had a greats night rest right in the room next to us for the entire night. There is also a video of the attack that I am gladly posting on all social media platforms. No one deserves to be treated like they \u2019re second rate threatened or assaulted while in a supposedly luxury safe environment. I \u2019ve worked with some of the most luxurious resorts around the world and NEVER had any of this happen to me before. I am holding the hotel their lack of security and this woman responsible for the events leading up to the bruises and scratches on my arms.

Womens sauna and steam room were about the size of a walk in closet. Steam room smelled kind of musty. Co ed hot tub prefer separate always had lots of water on floor around it and no place to hang your robe or towel. Shower door would not stay shut. I did have a very good massage Jordan. Not much to do on property. Wish there were more places to dine. Ate at pub one night which was good. The other restaurant Marc seemed very overpriced. Went off site to a Mexican restaurant. Property layout was kind of confusing. We got mixed up a couple times and actually had to help at least 2 other couples who asked us where to go. Had a good view of golf course from our room but could not sleep one night because of noises above us either an office or a laundry room. Overall stay was ok but will not recommend or return.", "offset": [357, 425], "date": "2019-09-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "073fa09b-229a-4a57-a77f-d7c1bc79900e", "sentence": "A Great Wine Tasting.

I \u2019ve purposely waited to share this review because I did n\u2019t want to relay any resentment or bitterness only the facts. So here it goes My husband and I booked the culinary experience as well as a spa day for our short weekend getaway. We booked over the phone as we \u2019d never been to Chateau Elan and wanted to speak with someone directly about the amenities etc. Upon our arrival we see that the Inn where our room was was under going a complete renovation. This was fine however it would have been nice to know considering the building smelled of fresh paint. So we check in and get settled into our room \u2014 400 night and we \u2019re next to the laundry room and also spotted three large bugs in our room and we begin to dress for our first dinner outing. Come to find out the resort \u2019s restaurants were either closed for renovations or weddings. It \u2019s important to note that this information is displayed on the website but was not relayed to us over the phone. Had we known we would not have booked the culinary experience. So we had no choice but to eat room service for most of our meals. Luckily there are a few restaurants off site that we were able to drive to. On day two we headed over to the spa for our very pricey couples massage. Low and behold the spa is also under renovation so where one would typically use the sauna steam room etc. it was closed. The men \u2019s locker room sauna and steam room were all closed. This was not disclosed to us either as we would n\u2019t have booked. Paying the hefty price for a spa service includes the amenities at the spa. So why did we pay for them if they \u2019re closed. Lastly I purchased an eye mask from the resort store the evening before we checked out. I placed it in the refrigerator in the room and subsequently forgot it was in there \u2014. so I left it. I realized this about 20 minutes after leaving the resort and called right away however the front desk was closed they were at the front desk to check us out. strange. Anyway I call first thing Monday morning and they file a report to have someone go to the room and retrieve it. It was about three days before I hear back and the gentleman I spoke said it was not in there and that no one had checked into our room since we \u2019d checked out. So there nothing he can do. So this only leaves one explanation. someone who had access to the room took it. I was told that the only thing I could do was come to the Braselton police department and file a police report. For a 20 eye mask. I also live about two hours away. What \u2019s most disappointing about this is that we spent nearly 200 for a two night stay at this resort and not one person was willing to work with us. Needless to say we will not be returning to Chateau Elan and warn everyone we speak with to STAY AWAY.", "offset": [2025, 2136], "date": "2019-09-07", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "30d23171-4ad9-4d35-81c3-a93f4bc848bb", "sentence": "Just wanted to say what a disappointing stay this was. My wife and I were celebrating our 20 wedding anniversary and decided to have a wonderful experience at this resort but when we were checking in and asked about the spa we were told that it was closed due to renovations which was never said when I was booking the stay this is all that was mentioned and it is even on the web site. The Chateau Elan Inn Atrium is undergoing a stunning renovation beginning early July and lasting until mid November 2019 and not accessible to guests.

The Spa Mansion will be CLOSED to the public October 14 \u2013 17. And our visit was in the month of September this was such a horrible experience for us and we explained this to the host and nothing was done for such a huge inconvenience we could have booked at so many other resorts and have had so much better memories of our anniversary I even replied to an email that was sent after we checked in which was from the manager expecting a reply but that was just as disappointing as the time spent there.", "offset": [1022, 1071], "date": "2019-09-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "8243ab53-ea94-4492-ac00-7364aa8236b2", "sentence": "Beautiful property with operational issues.
