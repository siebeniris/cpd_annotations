Right in the heart of the new Linq area. Lots of restaurants other great hotels surround this area. Worst thing about the Flamingo was the pool situation. We lined up an hour before the pool opened to get chairs. We fortunately learned we had to do this the day before after seeing a very long line wondering what was going on. We were considering renting the pool beds not a cabana were happy we did nt because people were placing their towels and using the beds as back supports. which There were lots of people on towels on the concrete all over due to lack of chairs. We ordered food at the pool probably should nt have. Quality was not good. We were there midweek. Another pool goer told us they were going to start charging an entry fee to get in on weekends.

Pros The pool is relatively clean Premises are well maintained Cafe and bar staff is polite and helpful. Cons The security staff is unreasonably rude. They do not know of do not care about customer service Getting into the pool are is like going through an airport security. They search your bag. They touch your personal items. You can not bring your water or even an empty container in the pool area. The only thing they are missing is a full body scaner The pool is extremely overcrowded. Finding an empty chair is a challenge. They do not let teenagers to go into the main pool. If you have kids 21 and younger your only option will be a small family pool. I am not sure why they doing that. They serve tobacco and alcohol in both pols Drinks are extremely overpriced IMO. 30 for 6 bottles or water. 50 for 6 cans of beer. 17 and up for a cocktail The pool closes at 6 pm on a hot summer day.

Unfortunately I think this hotel has gone downhill similar to the Rio Suites Hotel has. When I first arrived at the Flamingo. The cab drops you off at a side entrance.

DaShawn was his name. The carpets going to my room was old and dirty. During my stay i think someone from housekeeping could have gone up and down the halls picking up the trash. My room was ok. Though the hotel promotes some updates my room was just functional and I had a view some back buildings. my first night so overly rowdy people were banging on doors. I did call security to check it out. Later that evening coming back from the casino I did notice some security detaining some people down one of the halls. I ate at the breakfast buffet and it was overpriced and mediocre. The food court was ok but overpriced like most everything else as far as food goes. I ate at the Mexican restaurant it was ok. The family pool was overcrowded with blaring music and so i left. I did room checkout by my tv to avoid the lines again. The bell captain was not helpful but I did find the elevator back to the cab stand via winding halls to get to the airport. This entrance and exit experience needs to be approved upon.

We paid extra for an upgraded room and ended up having to call the front desk four time over an issue that they just could not resolve without compensation of the room. The staff down stairs at the coffee shop had to be the worst employees we have ever dealt with the first morning when we finally got to the register the three girls behind the counter were more concerned with counting their tips than taking care of our order. The cashier finally made our order for two coffees and told us that they were dollar refills When we came back with our cups the next morning with our original cups for refills the same girl told us that we were only allowed one refill.

My two friends also booked GO Rooms but they declined the paid upgrade. To my surprise the more superior room had LESS amenities than the GO rooms and were on the lower floors. I went to reception to ask why this was classed as an upgrade and the only reason is that the rooms are newer. From my experience staying in the GO Rooms previously there was not much difference at all. I asked if I could go back to the original booking I had and I was given a GO Room which was great.

That was not the response I was expectingHe then advised that he would send an engineer to my room and if they could not fix the issues he may be able to move me tomorrow. I asked how am I supposed to sleep with the tv going all night and he said I am not an electrician so I do not know what the issue is. I explained that I am a repeat customer and I do not expect to be spoken to like this and he said he does not care if I am a repeat customer. I then said I will be writing this on trip advisor and his response was and I quote I do not care if you put it on trip advisor as we will always get bookings. I was so shocked by this response especially from someone who has the title of Guest Service Manager. I asked for Tyras name and he obliged by giving me his business card and as I left reception he said todles. which I found very condescending and not necessary. I was advised that I would be contacted shortly to let me know if the room had been fixed but to no surprise to me I was never contacted. We arrived back to the hotel after the Ice Hockey and I dealt with May which was a pleasant change to Tyras. There were no notes in the system about what had happened and she managed to contact engineering who said they were not able to fix the issues in the bathroom.

Second small issues that did not give us confidence in the service of the room no shampoo conditioner in the dispensers remote for tv did not work fridge was so low that nothing got cold and when repaired became a freezer. We could live with all of that. But the large luxurious pools are only available for PAYING HOTEL GUESTS before certain times every day like 11 am on Saturday. There is a teensy tiny pool available for families that is free at all times. I could not find any evidence of this fact in any of the places that we looked up hotelscom vegascom they do not warn of these restrictions. And if you check into a hotel after 3 pm as you are only allowed to do then you can not use the pool facilities without paying ON YOUR FIRST DAY. WELCOME TO THE FLAMINGO I guess. The vast majority of the pool facilities are restricted to above 21 and are not for free all day. RIDICULOUSAnd once you do get into the restricted area the vast majority of the chaise lounges are for rent only leaving a small portion of free chairs available for the PAYING HOTEL GUESTS. I do not have an issue with rental cabanas or even comfy bed lounges though there should be many many many more free chaise lounges. but there are even chaise lounges that are nothing special and not much different than the others and those are ALSO reserved rentals. You better get to the pool right when it opens and be prepared to wait in a long line because they have so few staff working at the security area if you want to find lounges by the pool that you do not have to pay for.
