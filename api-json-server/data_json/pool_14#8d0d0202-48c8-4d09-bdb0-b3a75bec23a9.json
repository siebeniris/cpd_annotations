We can not fault the hotel at all. Its Massive Clean Brilliant Staff Great Rooms Perfect Beach Lovely Pools all the resturants we tried were lovely. Yuan Kalidescope Nasimi Beach The Edge The Shore which are the 2 pool bars. We booked a Palm View Delux Room with Half board. So we got breakfast each morning then either Lunch or an Evening Meal. The Room was Spotless it looked as if it had been recently decorated or its just been kept VERY well. The View was great you have a view of the pool the Royal beach then also of the whole Palm. I would recomend the Half Board option if you do nt really plan on leaving the hotel for the duration you are staying. There are plenty Restaurants to pick from that you would nt have to go to 1 more than once if you did nt want to. We have friends over there so did nt eat in the hotel every night but made up for it by using our half board for lunch on those days. The staff really could nt do enough for you the 1st night we arrived i was really unwell from something i had ate the day before they were very helpful in letting us order food to the room and offering a medic to come up see me. At the pools beach again staff really were waiting on you hand foot. We took advantage of the free access to the Waterpark although half was shut for refurbishment and the aquairium which were both good. Although the hotel has over 150 rooms we never once felt that it was too busy or crowded and the security staff do a great job of keeping the general public out of the residents only areas. To sum it all up like i said at the beginning of all this. It really is an amazing hotel we could nt complain about 1 thing during our stay. We will defiantely we returning as soon as we can.", "offset": [237, 312], "date": "2015-01-23 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "6797ae94-4a90-470b-a002-460f74dc59f2", "sentence": "Enjoyed every min. we had the most amazing holiday here for my 30th. We had a deal which included our room and half board and access to the waterpark next door. Well worth it. We paid extra to swim with dolphins and scuba dive in the large tank with the Sharks. This is a must. Such a grilling experience I will never ever forget. The tank itself is spectacular I could stand and watch it for hours. The hotel is extremely busy and this takes means there no real personal touch. there is al sorts that you can do within the hotel. The pool was good. Liked the little golf trolleys which take you to and from places on the complex. Drinks and food are very expensive so we are glad we went half board. We did not really enjoy the Turkish restaurant but that is due to our tastes. We did not realise until the last day but if you are half board you can use your vouchers in all the restaurants but with some of the ones that are not fully included you just pay an extra supplement. The waterpark was clean and just fantastic. One disappointment was the fact that there was a lot of jellyfish in the sea. We love sea swimming but could not go in. I understand this is a common problem so wonder why the hotel do not invest in a net or something in the water to try and prevent them. Just an idea. We used taxis to get around because this was very easy and cheaper.

I have been lucky enough to have stayed in some very lovely hotels in my time all around the world but The Atlantis is like nowhere else I have been. it is absolutely spectacular. it is massive and looks incredibly impressive as you see it in the distance. The lobby is beautiful all the bars are stunning the spa looked and smelt divine. there is a Nobu downstairs that says it all really. The nightclub is gorgeous although smoking is still permitted indoors in Dubai so that ruined it a bit. there is an outside bit but when it is 38 at midnight that is not really an option. The club itself though is fabulous. When we were there one of the bars hosted a world famous DJ standard for the Atlantis I imagine. We went half board which was perfect. Definitley I would not go without half board drinks are expensive so I imagine food would be too. However there are plenty of happy hours in the bars and you pay for what you get. High prices for high quality. What made it for me though was the service. It was flawless. I did not open a door for myself the whole time I think I called a lift once. EVERY member of staff we came acros was polite friendly and could not do more for us. The whole team are a credit to the hotel truly we could not have asked for more. All in all I would go back to the Atlantis in a heart beat. the pools are beautiful the aqua park was great the whole vibe of the hotel is really lovely and our room was perfect.

My mom dad and sister were going first then when I realised I could get the time off they added me which cost an extra \u00a3 360. But as we arrived at the hotel our luggage got dealt with straight away and we were taken into another room to book in. As you walk in you feel the wow factor it is true luxuryChecked in and was shown to our room We were shown into a club room. I think they call it which was MASSIVE. Had a large living room area kitchen then a massive bedroom separate and a HUGE bathroom. With an AMAZING BATH. And a walk in wardrobe. A beautiful balcony to sit and lie down at with a beautiful view of the Palm. We were amazed at this. Then we thought that was it they said we will show the young adults to their room now and we were like ANOTHER ROMThey opened a joining door and inside was what I presume is your normal room. had 2 large double beds a big bathroom so we all basically had a double bed to ourselves. We were taken to breakfast which had a huge choice and was really nice no ques. Which was brill We went down to the pool every day and was great did find we had to get up really early to get towels to put down on 4 beds together as they got taken quite quickly. But we did not mind. Service around the pool was brilliant can not do enough for you and the beach is just a few steps away. We did not really think the food of the evening was great. We eat in the edge kalidascope which were in the half board and Italian restaurant which we paid half atWe had a look at the menus at the other restaurants and was not taken by what was on oferWe tried saffron on the last night and that was the best one.

It did smell a bitHighlight of the week was being on nasimi beach the little walk from the beach and meeting Mark Wright and Michele Kegan on their honeymoon. Must go there though for the extra bit of luxuryWe would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Staff could not do enough for you. And you must try the ice cream shop. You get a whole show whilst they are serving your ice cream they do tricks and sing if you tip them. Was really funyEnjoy.

The waterpark is truly out of this world and the rides are amazing. We swam with dolphins and took a rib ride around Palm Island as well as visiting the shopping malls and getting up close to the amazing architecture such as the Burj Khalifa. Dubai is a fantastic place and despite the heat there is air conditioning inside and plenty of shade at the rear of the hotel or in the cool water of the Royal Pool.

Breakfast was also amazing. 1010This is in no way a criticism of the hotel but Drinks are expensive there is no denying it all over Dubai. The cheapest bottle of wine will cost you 40 to 50 pounds and they are the entry level bottles. Cheapest proseco was \u00a3 80 a bottle. A pint of peroni is \u00a3 10 ish and coke is 4 to 5 pounds a can. Stock up in the supermarket at the Dubai mall that you can access via the monorail. Back to the good stuff the water park is amazing. Make sure you ride the lazy river all the way around its great fun. Ray feeding is good fun and shark reef diving is a great experience.

So much choice. Quality and presentation if 5. Disappointed with the beach. The sand had a lot of very sharp stones and shells. The Saffron restaurant is a no go zone on the brunch days Saturday Sunday. Absolute chaos inside and the noise spilling out to the pool area was horrendous.

We recently stayed at the hotel for 5 nights following 12 nights at The Westin. The plan was for this to be a treat given the reputation of the hotel. On arrival it was noticeable just how busy this place is we had booked as imperial club guests so luckily did not have to queue in the many check in lines. During our stay we found the following Rom smaller than expected quite basic no balcony no chocolates or fruit. View was of the sea as it was an imperial room. Left the room at 100 one day and still was not made up in our return at 1715Swiming pool horrendous similar to a 2 hotel in Spain. Hundreds of ugly metal loungers with towels everywhere the water is shallow and impossible to swim due to the amount of people playing ball games. There is also a kids activity pool which is the same but even shallower. Imperial Club 2 locations east west tower. Light snacks mainly crisps nuts and afternoon tea which consists of sandwiches and cakes along with drinks. The imperial lounge feels more like an all inclusive place rather than the type of lounge we have experienced at other Dubai hotels. Often had to queue or wait to be seated. Visited West tower lounge for breakfast but no omelettes or fried eggs advised they would take 25 minutes as they had to be ordered via room service kitchen and encouraged to use general buffet restaurant. Restaurants the buffets are very busy and cater for huge amounts of people on the whole the food was good with a good choice. We preferred Saffron which had Asian dishes along with traditional roasts. Kids club really disappointed as this was a key reason for choosing the hotel. We left the Westin who had a full indoor and outdoor activity programme free for a kids club that offered no outdoor activities no water sports etc. The climbing wall was no longer in use and it was all very tired. Ok if you want to leave the kids to play on the computers. Indoor games and activities which my daughter thought we just ok. She was always happy to leave after an hour or so. Bread Street Kitchen London style restaurant with classic British dishes which was pretty good on the whole. Ronda Locateli this was the highlight of the holiday and would score 1010. Great service and choice. For a supplement for half board guests of 50dhs you have a choice of the whole menu. We visited twice and the food was excellent best lamb I have ever had. They are also great with kids and asked my daughter to go through to the kitchen and make her own pizza they gave her an apron and chefs hat which she could keep. In summary if you are looking for a very busy Disney style hotel which is very impersonal but has access to the waterpark then this will do the job if your looking for luxury then I would look elsewhere.

Signed up for the free Atlantis membership which offered checkin early as 11 am. So we got there at 12 noon and early checkin was not possible as rooms were not ready. The lobby was jam packed with long queues of people checking out at 12 pm. Thankfully one staff came and asked us to go to the Hospitality lounge on the ground floor for a speedier checkin. The hospitality lounge is one of the best things about the hotel. Not only can you easily checkin checkout here but it also offers seating facilities tea coffee water and refreshments toilets showers and lockers for free. We checkedin around 1 pm and was offered our passes for the Aquarium and Waterpark and the room key was given only at 3 pm. We booked a King Palm room and were allocated a Queen room instead. disappointing from the checkin staff of such a big hotel to make such mistakes. We saw this happening to other people as well who were getting different rooms against the ones they had booked. We had a baby so need a king bed instead of 2 smaller beds so we requested for the change and got the room finally at 4 pm. Luggage arrived after a reminder at 5 pm. So not the smoothest checkin at all. Went to the indoor Aquarium which is nice. Can spend about 30mins to 1hr here. Nothing exceptional. Aquaventure waterpark was great. We made most of the unlimited access given to guests which includes a separate entrance as well. It was hot and the ground was too hot and need to wear slippers any where you go. There are 25aed rubber soled disposable socks selling inside some of the kiosks at the Waterpark which are really handy and you can walk in them to the pools as well. The kids area was the best. The sri lankan lifeguards especially were very friendly with the kids. The starting point for most of the adult slides rides was in one location and this got packed up with people. You need to carry a tube to this place as the starting point does nt have tubes available which is a bit of a hassle. Prepare to stand in queue for the rides. Finding a sun lounge bed can be challenging as well when it gets crowded. Best for hotel guests is to go to the waterpark at 10 am get the towels and lay them on a sunbed and come back to your spot later. There are 2 swimming pools at the hotel. Nasimi is for adults and kids. There are pool water sports available here. The Royal pool has a baby pool next to it as well. Overall both are great and plenty of sun beds as well. In both pools and waterpark there are plenty of lifeguards. For half board you get breakfast and dinner buffets at Saffron and Kaleidoscope. Unfortunately no water is included. Water is however included for outside reservations and not for hotel guests absurd. Carry your own water bottle here if you are on half board. Saffron been here before and its still the same. It has themed nights while the restaurant is mainly Asian and Seafood. There were good selection of meats and grills as well fresh seafood. Kaleidoscope been here before too and nothing has changed. It has a international spread. Not much seafood but good variety of meat and grills. Both restaurants are usually packed and very noisy. Rest of the restaurants are open for dinner only and can be accessed by hotel guests for an additional fee. Room service was good. Nuwan who did our room was especially kind and courteous. The room was clean. No toothbrush toothpaste provided tho. The in room minibar is a trap. dont mess around with it if you dnot intend to use any of its beverages or food as the billing for these items is automated and if you move any item from its original place it will get counted as a purchase which during checkout you will have to explain. Few guests have commented on this issue. Since we were aware we used it to store some of our items without rearranging the stuff already in there. The hotel security was pleasant this time around whereas in previous years they were quite gloomy and serious looking. So thanks for improving on that. Overall a good fun filled hotel do nt go here if you want to quiet relaxation.", "offset": [1746, 1912], "date": "2019-06-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}]}
