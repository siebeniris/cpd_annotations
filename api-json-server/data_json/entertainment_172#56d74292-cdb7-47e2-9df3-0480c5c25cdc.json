I \u2019ve been going to Vegas 1 2 times per year since 207. Traditionally I have always insisted on staying somewhere on the The Strip but this trip my friends convinced me to stay at the Hard Rock. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and plan to make the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino my new Vegas go to resort. The room was terrific. I stayed in the Casino Tower which appears to have been recently renovated. The room was spacious super clean and had all the amenities one would expect and the bed was quite comfortable. I \u2019l admit that the view a side view of McCaran International was nothing to write home about but if you \u2019re spending that much time looking out your hotel room window in Vegas you \u2019ve already got problems. Additionally the WiFi was free for guests and I always had a strong signal everywhere in the resort. One member of our party upgraded to a suite in the new HRH Tower. He placed a premium on having the additional couch lounge area in the room. There were six of us in the group and the added space was enough for us to be comfortable and also provided a staging area to congregate and pre game the evening. I do n\u2019t know that we maximized the room but if you \u2019re planning on a group vacation and also intend to do a lot of your partying in the room I definitely recommend looking into the HRH Tower. The real draw of the Hard Rock is the atmosphere. Over the years I feel the vibe on The Strip has gone from \u201c Let \u2019s have fun \u201d to \u201c. You \u2019re too poor to be in here \u201d. Sometimes even we guys want to suit up and pretend to be refined. But as a middle aged dude who does not handle his hangovers very well anymore when you come downstairs after a night of drinking in your jeans and a T shirt feeling like crap and you hear classic rock blasting on the speaker system and see girls swinging from the ceiling you instantly find your inner party again. I do n\u2019t gamble so I can not speak to the slots or table games. Other attractions in the resort include Lucky 7 which is the diner the ubiquitous 247 pizza joint and the Pink Taco which I believe is a chain restaurant and serves Mexican fare. Regarding the location there is not a lot around the resort so if you want to get anywhere you will have to take a cab. The location made me a little hesitant about staying at the Hard Rock but the fare to the Strip was only 10 15 depending on where we went. I hate Uber but if you use that ap or a similar ride sharing service know that the drivers can not pick you up from the main entrance. You have to walk all the way through the hotel to a back parking garage to find the designated ride share pick up drop off. Overall I thought the Hard Rock was an excellent bargain. The service was always terrific the vibe is exactly what I want out of a Vegas getaway and I absolutely plan to head back next trip.", "offset": [341, 416], "date": "2017-02-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "a961dba8-1ffe-4c17-bcd1-371e36dc7afd", "sentence": "Getting a little tired.

I have been going to Las Vegas for more than 50 years my first stay was back in the mid\u201960 \u2019s when I was a teen at the Desert Inn FYI that was back in the pre corporate days when the Mafia ran most things in town. The management style and business model were VERY different then. In the intervening years I have stayed in Las Vegas several dozen times \u2026 mainly on the Strip in various properties. Obviously I \u2019ve known about the Hard Rock Hotel Casino and have passed by it in a car on many occasions but I had never darkened their door as a customer. I \u2019m familiar with their global brand for restaurants and entertainment but they have never been \u201c top of mind \u201d with me for accommodations. Well as the saying goes you \u2019re never too old to learn. During this past 4th. of July week my girlfriend and I decided to spend four 4 days in Las Vegas. The Hard Rock Hotel Casino came up online at an airline \u2019s travel website as a possible choice. I waffled a bit before choosing it because I had an incorrect pre conceived image of finding \u201c hard partying \u201d rockers everywhere and some trepidation about a lack of peace and quiet during my stay. Fortunately my curiosity ended up getting me to choose the Hard Rock over several other possible Strip hotels for our trip. I \u2019m glad I was curious because we just had a great stay here. Molly in Reservations was very polite and helpful with some questions I had before arriving. We flew into Las Vegas on Monday night July 3rd and arrived at the Hard Rock around 1045 PM. FYI the Hard Rock has plenty of off street free sheltered parking which I like. During our visit we paid some very high parking fees on the Strip 25 for 4 hours at the Aria for Valet 15 for 15 hours of self parking at the Belagio. ugh. Check in at the Hard Rock Hotel was slow to be honest. I clocked our wait time we got in the line at 1053 PM and got up to the Front Desk at 116 PM \u2026. almost 25 minutes with three 3 clerks on duty. However LaLa was the check in agent who assisted us and she was just great. She apologized for our wait and was extremely polite and helpful. We got up to our assigned room in the Harmon HRH Tower Room 10826 around 130 PM. The particular room type we stayed in is called an HRH Pool Queen Suite. What a nice room wow see attached pix We had an unobstructed view to the North with floor to ceiling plate glass windows overlooking the pool area and with a great view of the Strip day or night. Needless to say it \u2019s a very large and spacious suite with three distinct areas living room bedroom huge bathroom plus a substantial entryway. The entry has polished hardwood flooring and a complete and large set of built in cabinets with a stainless steel sink that includes a closet armoire full mini bar and etched mirrors. The living room has a very nice contemporary sofa throw pillows cocktail table desk and a large SONY flat screen TV with JBL sound bar. The sleeping room was spacious and contained two 2 Queen size beds with a great view out the large windows. The bedroom has a night table equipped with a high tech JBL clock that has dual USB charging ports which was great at night for our his and hers iPhone charging needs. The bedroom also has another large flat screen TV. The entire suite is very quiet we never heard anything and the black out drapes worked well for sleeping in a bit. There are two pocket doors that separate the living room from the bedroom that can be closed for either privacy or to block light. The bedding was great and included a generous selection of both firm and soft pillows. The bathroom was very large and nicely appointed with a private toilet dual sinks vanity huge deep tub and a very large separate walk in shower with dual shower heads wall and ceiling. There was a very nice selection of personal care items as well. My only critique about the suite is that management should now upgrade the compact fluorescent lights used throughout to LED bulbs. The LED \u2019s are very affordable now in bulk they are even less expensive to operate than the current CFL \u2019s and the quality of LED lights is better and crisper. Sadly the compact fluorescent bulbs cast a yellowish tint light which makes it difficult for folks to correctly apply and tweak their make up prior to going out for the day. I have produced more than 200 TV shows and projects \u2026 so my opinion here about lighting is both qualified and knowledgeable. If you are NOT on a budget the minibar in the suite is both extensive impressive and very expensive. Go for it and enjoy. However if you are on a budget DON\u2019T even touch the snack items displayed or open the door to the chiller unit where the booze and beverages are kept. There is an alarm system on ALL of it. If you remove a snack item from its display shelf there \u2019s a weight sensor that will bill you for that. Ditto for opening the door to the beverage chiller and booze locker. If you are on a budget a better suggestion is to go out to Harmon Avenue and head East a block to the CVS drugstore at the NE corner of Paradise and Harmon. where the great big guitar sign is. They have a large selection of booze wines food and snacks that are typically 30 to 70 less than the fees charged for the same items in your room or inside the Hard Rock Hotel \u2019s well stocked gift shop. Although we loved our suite it seems odd that there is no in room coffee service of any type \u2026 free or paid. However both the Lobby gift shop which is near the Harmon Tower and the on site Dunkin Donuts store offer excellent coffee including a Dark Roast version my favorite. Note the Lobby gift shop has fresh coffee it \u2019s good from hot pots only and donuts and pastries. If you want a Latte or another custom coffee drink you \u2019l need to take a 5 minute \u201c hike \u201d East through the Casino and retail area to the Dunkin Donut on site store their coffee drinks are well made and good. This store also offers a variety of hot fast food sandwiches. I ordered a flatbread with sausage egg and cheese 679 it was pretty tasty. While at the Hard Rock we ate twice on two separate evenings in the Mr Lucky \u2019s cafe which is adjacent to the Casino. Both experiences were good. The food was fresh hot delicious and the portions were generous. see pix. One night we split a Southwest Burger one burger was plenty of food for the two of us. The second night we ordered a steak Focacia bread and a Caesar salad both of which we split. FYI the House red wine blend is quite tasty and has a good flavor I enjoyed some both nights. Most importantly our servers both nights were great. Aby took care of us the first time and Conrad took care of us during our second visit. Both of these wait staff were helpful polite attentive and professional. Their service was good. Conrad went out of his way to assist me. After our meal I felt like enjoying an espresso with Sambuca so I ordered one. Conrad said they had the espresso but that he was not familiar at all with Sambuca. So he went to check the cafe \u2019s service bar they did not have any. However without my asking Conrad very graciously hiked out to the Casino Bar to ask if they had some Sambuca they did and brought me back a shot to pour into my espresso cup. Bravo Conrad. By going out of his way to provide great guest service he made me a very \u201c happy camper \u201d. By the way the Harmon Tower has its own Guest Services staff and a Concierge on duty in its Main Floor Lobby. In this review I need to give a shout out to Jesica who was on duty each morning of our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. Jesica was proactive kind helpful and polite. How fortunate the HRH is to have her. On Thursday we decided to try out the pool area it \u2019s very cool \u2026 even though the temperature was hot. We had no trouble finding two chaise loungers in the shade. The pool area offers three 3 pools a sandy beach bottom pool an adjoining regular pool and a separate smaller pool. There are also a decent number of private cabanas available for an extra fee. Those cabanas have a sofa TV safe and reserved chaise lounges. While at the pool we ordered some food and drinks. Marisa was our server and she was also great friendly timely polite and followed up with us from time to time. The food and drink prices at the pool are high but the quality and portions were fine. My girlfriend and I ordered one sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich to split it was huge served on a toasted Brioche type bun and delicious. It came with a container of jumbo home made potato chips \u2026. YUM. I \u2019m a breakfast maven and I \u2019d have to say that this Hard Rock Hotel pool breakfast sandwich was probably the best of its type that I have ever eaten anywhere period. At 140 it was pricey \u2026 but it sure was good. Also it was enough for two of us I will absolutely order another one when I return. The Lobby area of the hotel offers a limited but decent array of retail including a gift shop a couple of clothing and accessory stores and several different restaurants specializing in Mexican Asian Steaks and Oyster Bar Seafood. Overall impressions. This Hard Rock Hotel is well maintained. Our room housekeeper Saihiris was very polite helpful and greeted us as we went by in the hallway. The HRH \u2019s staff is uniformly polite and helpful throughout the property. Someone in management has obviously worked with and trained the employees on this subject. BRAVO. The on site food during our stay was uniformly good to excellent with generous portions. Sleeping floor hallways were clean and quiet. There IS 247 rock music playing throughout the Casino and public places what would you expect. However the playlist seemed well curated \u2026 and we enjoyed most of the tunes. As an aside I \u2019d love to know what the HRH has to pay in annual royalty fees to both ASCAP and BMI for the music it plays continuously I \u2019l bet I could live nicely on those. I \u2019m sure its a very large sum of money. I have somewhat sensitive hearing so I \u2019d say to management to dial the background music volume back about 10 to 15 but that was a relatively minor consideration for us. All in all we had a great time here. We really appreciated the fine service we received from ALL the employees throughout the hotel and stores. The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Las Vegas offers a great alternative to staying at a Strip property. Plus the HRH has complimentary shuttle service that runs back and forth between the hotel and the Fashion Show Mall. We had a rental car at our disposal but realistically between the hotel \u2019s shuttle along with either Uber or Lyft this property is close enough to be worthwhile trying and still have access to all the Strip has to offer. And speaking of that I carried on some brief conversations with other guests I met in the elevator. I was simply amazed at the number of other people I encountered who like me had been coming to Las Vegas for DECADES and for whom this was their first stay at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. All were enjoying themselves and said they would be returning. So here I am at age 66 having only now experienced the HRH. I \u2019m very glad I stepped out of my mental comfort zone when booking \u2026 and gave this place a try notwithstanding my now obviously incorrect notions about what a stay might be like. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here \u2026 and we do plan to return. I recommend you try it as well. You might just surprise yourself like I did.", "offset": [10764, 10954], "date": "2017-07-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "89f9f1a6-bf3d-463a-88bb-effaeeb7a81e", "sentence": "Great pool parties at club Rehab.

I would not necessarily recommend for families with young children. I found the hotel to be festive and entertaining. The rooms are uniquely decorated and included some little details that were nice for a hotel of this price range such as miniature sized shower gel and mouthwash. The room decorations were unique and include artwork and memorabilia related to rock and roll. Also make sure to park in the parking structure nearest your room.

I would definitely return.", "offset": [175, 274], "date": "2019-02-17", "cpt": "2", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "4516bb8d-4e50-4397-a159-a4460a3c17f3", "sentence": "Superb rooms and dining.

While this hotel is not on the strip we did not care. We wanted to stay because it was the Hard Rock and we have had good experiences in the past. We were not disappointed. The room was located in the casino tower and was very spacious. It was very clean and modern. The beds were some of the most comfortable that I have slept on in a hotel. It also had a nice mini snack bar if you do not mind paying outrageous prices for such things. The view out the huge window was pretty amazing as well. All staff that we encountered were friendly and helpful. The place was huge so it was easy to run into a lot of themThe only negative is that it takes a long time to check in so leave plenty of time to do that. There is thankfully an express checkout option.", "offset": [193, 256], "date": "2019-06-20", "cpt": "3", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "439336be-9aa9-4639-b47a-6ae673c10b86", "sentence": "Great stay wish we made it here earlier. My wife I are in our early 40s after 20 times visiting Vegas over the last number of years we finally decided to give the Hard Rock a try. I must admit we were a little concerned about our stay after reading some of the negative reviews but after spending 3 nights at the hotel I would absolutely return. We arrived at the hotel on July 4th around 530 pm there was no line at check in so that made for a good first impression. Check in host was great we asked about an upgrade but were told there were none available no worries we ended up in the casino tower 11th floor corner unit facing the pool. The room was perfect it was clean had lots of space was super quiet we never heard any other guests coming or going during our stay. Only a couple of pools were open during our stay but we did not have any issues finding seats when we arrived both mornings around 11 am. Drink service was great both days our servers were very friendly and easy going. Casino was very quiet during the days but had a great atmosphere in the evenings. Music was awesome tables were busy drink service was good and we did not find anywhere in the hotel casino included to be smokey. The only restaurants we ate at were Mr Luckys Pizza Forte both were good we had absolutely eat at them again. Like I said I wish we would have discovered this place sooner hopefully with the re branding it will still be as great as it was during our visit.", "offset": [1075, 1204], "date": "2019-07-09", "cpt": "3", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "bc279ae3-652b-4e73-b0f5-6c38a2383cff", "sentence": "Except for the earthquake I thoroughly enjoyed my one night stay here.
