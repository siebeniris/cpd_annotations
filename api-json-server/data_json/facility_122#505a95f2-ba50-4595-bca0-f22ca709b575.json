Overall I really enjoyed our one week stay at the Martha Washington Hotel. It was a fantastic location and we walked everywhere. I wish we could have stayed a bit longer as we started to find great things close by to do. it is very close to the Empire State Building The Morgan Library and Museum Madison Square Park and the Flatiron Building. On our last night there we also found a lovely buzy and atmospheric gastro pub type restaurant and bar called Tavern29 just two buildings away. In the hotel itself is the very popular Marta restaurant which was always really busy and had a 1great feel about it. We went there and had the pizza which was okay but not the bestThe room itself was all that we needed it was compact but the bed was really comfy after a long day exploring and even during a summer heatwave it remained cool. Unfortunately there were a few things that could have been better. When you get past the reception area the hotel becomes very dark and gloomy all day long with dark painted walls. I think the hotel has recently been refurbished but to me it looked outdated. This is completely personal though and others may like that. Next to our room was a staff room which mysteriously emanated what looked and smelt like cigarette smoke every day a bit off putting. In the room itself it would have been good to have some kind of tea and coffee making facilities maybe this is not so common in New York. Another problem was that the shower was very leaky and the door did not keep in water meaning it always slightly flooded into the small bathroom. In general it is a good hotel and very functional for a weeks holiday but there are definitely small improvements which would make it better. I will look elsewhere if I stay in New York again.", "offset": [935, 1048], "date": "2015-09-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "2a0ebf96-68c3-4ca3-ad6d-9348faa49fea", "sentence": "Really fun place to stay. it is not near any of the main subways except for the 6 so that is kind of a pain but really good and lively restaurant downstairs.

My room has been 75 my entire stay. that is a little hard to sleep in. I stayed on the 12th floor not facing the street and it was a very quiet comfy room. I think they should do something about the heat pumping all of the time and maybe have a dimmer for the hallway lights later at night. it is an older building so the doors have gaps in them and tons of hallways light shines through.

There are now additional charges not mentioned in Bokingcom which we managed to avoid because we booked before the hotel changed hands. Otherwise it would have been another 28 per night 12. As it was Taxes charges came to more than 16 of the bill. The restaurant was popular but was very noisy you would struggle to have a conversation poor acoustic design and the noise spills out into reception making conversation at the desk difficult.

I showed up to the hotel to my reservation having been cancelled. The property pushed through my request as an automatic cancellation. Also I had requested an early check in but when we arrived the system was down. Ended up dealing with a cancellation and late check in which were both very inconvenient and not accommodating. In addition to this I opened the sofa bed in the room to find a very dirty mattress. I have attached a photo. On our last day as we were heading to the elevator I was greeted by a mouse. Much to my surprise I let out a loud yell and the mouse rushed its way to room 715. Thank god this happened on my way out. Imagine the terror if I had seen one in our suite.
