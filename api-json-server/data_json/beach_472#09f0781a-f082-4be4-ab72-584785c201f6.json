We arrived on a Saturday night and the bar by the lobby was very lively with very loud music and scantily clad dancers posing in Santa hats.

We also had breakfast at Steak 954 and it was excellent delicious food served by very efficient and helpful staff. Location is perfect just across the road from the beach.

I will start by saying that if I could give a 25 I would because it was a halfway decent stay due primarily to the atmosphere the ocean weather peaceful and beautiful environment. My final bill came out to a little above 510 for 5 days Dec 24 to Dec 29 and for that amount of money I expect great service and a worry free stay. The God The staff greeting you at the entrance are very friendly and very accommodating. We requested to check in early and we were able to check in at 11 am so we were appreciative that the hotel accommodated that request. The room we had the Cool Corner Ocean View Room had amazing ocean views as the name may indicate but it was even more amazing than the website pictures. The sliding doors when not duct taped see under the bad let in the ocean air. It was simply amazing and peaceful Fi at the Away Spa was wonderful. I can not say enough good things about her. Lee the nail technician was great and very detail oriented. My body detox treatment was a very good experience as was my reset masage One of the hotel restaurants Steak 954 while overly expensive had amazing food that kind of made you forget about the bill. Room service depending on who is doing the preparation is god Security is good as folks without a room key are unable to access rooms or the level with the pool. The Bad. I admittedly am obsessive when it comes to cleanliness. prime example I carry Clorox Wipes with me when I travel to wipe down door handles remotes etc. When we arrived in the room I pulled out my wipes and got busy. The bathroom sink had yellowish stains that came up with a simple wipe and a little crud in one of the corners. The bathtub had hair in it. The bathtub stopper was taken apart and put on the corner of the bathtub it was not a stopper that should have been removed save for unclogging or something but should have been replaced once that was resolved. I planned on doing some reading and eating on the balcony so I also wiped down the side table which was filthy. It obviously had not been cleaned as there were visible dirt smudges and spots. For the money I paid I expect a clean room. The first couple nights we kept hearing a whistling sound from the sliding doors. As the wind was not that bad it was slightly annoying but not unbearable. As the week went on it became much windier and the whistling became more constant and unbearable. We called the front desk who dispatched maintenance. Maintenance duct taped the sliding door to stop the whistling rendering us unable to open the sliding doors on the side facing the ocean. When I say duct tape I mean black heavy duty duct tape. Why they thought this was acceptable is beyond me One night we ordered extra washcloths and towels they just brought up the washcloths. When my husband asked about the towels he was told they were still being laundered. How does a hotel of that size not keep up with laundry so a guest can have a clean towel on demand. Again beyond me Room service was inconsistent the first time my husband ordered an 18 cheeseburger it came with lettuce tomato and pickles. I also ordered something and we received 2 glasses of water standard with room service anywhere. It was really good food and service. It was so good we decided to order again the next day this time the same 18 cheeseburger came with no fixings just a bun burger and cheese. There was no water to go with either of our meals. Same thing happened with our breakfast orders. First order was great second the exact opposite. To be fair one of the managers did refund the second cheeseburger meal that was not sent to the room properly The hotel had advertised at the front desk upon check in Mariots Bonvoy credit card and the offer of 75k bonus points. The ap also advertised the card. I applied my second night there after researching which card fit my travel style. Upon approval I was given my credit card number to use until my physical card came. I went to the front desk with the email from the credit card with the credit card number that the hotel advertised. I was told the property only accepted physical cards and to try to call Mariot. I told them how could I have a physical card when I just applied AFTER seeing the advertisement at the front desk upon checking in. I called Mariot and the help line said to call American Express while at the front desk and try to work something out. Long story short in 2019 with the technology available to all of us Mariot and this property could not figure out how to pay for my stay on a credit card they advertised at check in. Some may say what is the big deal the big deal to me was not necessarily the form of payment but rather the points I would get from spending over 510 on the stay at a Mariot property on top of the 75k bonus points. The mattress was too firm for my liking. I thought it was just me until my husband woke up complaining his back hurt from the bed. The mattresses could use some serious upgrades I had a spa service 4 of my 5 days there. The facial left much to be desired. The last day the massage was great but when I went to check out the price was much more than listed. When I questioned it I was told there were two add ons some puffy eye mask and paraffin on my feet. When I told her that I was never asked if I wanted those things and because the massage alone was 25 I just assumed they were included because of course someone would not add on about 100 in services without asking you. I explained that I already had both of those done with my facial and pedicure plus I did not ask for them. After verifying with the masseuse that I indeed did not request any extras during this service they were removed but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I was given some samples and the woman apologized I thought the spa extra charge was a one off until I got my final bill the day after we checked out and there was a 12002 charge for a Munchie Box on my bill. I called immediately and informed the person helping me that we did not touch one snack in the box as we went two blocks down to CVS and got everything we needed for 110 of the price they were charging at the hotel. After telling me he had to check with the Munchie Team he came back and said it was alcohol. The alcohol was not in the munchie box so the Munchie Box charge was ridiculous but nevertheless we did not even drink the alcohol there either. After I explained to him that he sounded better accusing us of eating the food than a bottle of alcohol because we had 45 oz margaritas everyday buy 1 get 1 12 off at Rock Bar down the street they are amazing. Anyway back on topic we did not drink or take any alcohol with us. The person immediately said yes it looks like a mistake you will see a credit in a few days. This was fishy to me. Over charging once ok a mistake but twice seems really suspect to me. I would definitely come back to Fort Lauderdale I would definitely visit Fi at the spa and eat at Steak 954 BUT I would never actually stay here again.

There is lots of great restaurants in the hotel and the hotel bar is very nice with a good vibe. The sushi bar was awesome steak restaurant was really good and morning breakfast at the downstairs restaurant was excellent. I am a platinum member and the W did upgrade the room which was nice but I do feel that breakfast should be comped. There are no lounges at the W which is fine but this particular property gives you a breakfast voucher for 25 dollars which does not cover the cost for breakfast which is about 50 dollars for 2. it is a small thing but more of a principle thing. I travel a lot and will pay less at a sheraton and far more at a St Regis both of those properties fully comp breakfast for platinum members. The W brand should do the same. You pay a lot to stay at the W and it is a great spot but the least this property could do is provide its guests with 2 vouchers of 25 per room. Again it is a small thing but its a good will gesture that would be appreciated from loyal customers of the brand.

My only complaint about the pool was they allowed people to reserve the best chairs at 7 am and then not actually use them until the afternoon. Often the chairs were all taken. I would suggest if the chairs are vacant for an hour they are recycled for others it \u2019s what they do with the beach chairs here. 3 of the 4 days the hotel was very crowded and often took 15minutes to get from the ground floor to the 18th because of the wait and all the stops.

We \u2019ve just returned from a Florida road trip that took us from Fort Lauderdale to the Keys the west coast the central region the northeast coast and back to end at the W Hotel in Fort Lauderdale. Needless to say we stayed in quite a number of hotels six I think all Mariot properties. The W in Fort Lauderdale was the last of the bunch and not the cheapest by a long shot. Let \u2019s start with the good bits. The hotel has a great cool vibe and really interesting modern public spaces. The high point however of the hotel is its staff \u2013 they all seemed to truly want to do whatever they could to make our stay wonderful. They wanted to but the story below might suggest that they do n\u2019t actually accomplish what they set out to oferThe rooms are modern and bright and we had a large veranda with a not quite full view of the beach. Exactly what we booked. They also have a wonderful steakhouse on site with absolutely terrific steaks and professional staff that are second to none. The Mexican restaurant on site is loud fun and has terrific food with wonderfully small portions. Loved it. It was n\u2019t so great for breakfast \u2013 I \u2019l get to that. So now for the not so wonderful bits. The hotel is confusing. The entrance is between two towers on Jackson Avenue not on Fort Lauderdale beach boulevard which can be a bit confusing for your GPS. Then when you do get out of the car valet parking only \u2013 we had a rental which we dropped off at Avis which is sort of on site \u2013 one driveway down. you enter into the front part which is n\u2019t really a lobby. It \u2019s sparse and unwelcoming. You take the elevator to the fourth floor to check in. That part is somewhat better. Great staff. but it \u2019s dark and claustrophobic. Breakfast is served at the Mexican restaurant on site. Well as well run as it is in the evening you \u2019d expect a bit more in the morning. Nope. One morning it was so crowded at least we thought it was that there was a line up and hostess took names and gave out seating times. The only thing was that we could see empty tables. A quick pop inside indicated at least eight to ten empty tables. So annoying. A restaurant management issue. I suspect it is not actually run by Mariot but it \u2019s on their property and they need to take notice. The next morning she seated us and we sat there and waited and waited watching three servers chatting and laughing. Finally my husband went to the desk to find out if we could possibly be served. Our server was in the back folding napkins so I do n\u2019t know why on earth one of the others who could n\u2019t have either come over to see if they could help us or at least gone to get her if they were that lazy. But the worst part \u2026 The guest room. OMG I have been in hotel rooms from Istanbul to Papeete Tahiti and beyond I \u2019ve never actually been in a hotel where there were as many maintenance issues or as much actual dirt in the bathroom. I \u2019m not kidding. It looks so nice but there was a long dark hair on the side of the bathtub trust me I do n\u2019t have a hair on my head that long and a short and ahem curly one in the but \u2013 when we checked in. After I got rid of the hairs the long one was replaced the next morning by yet another one. There was dust in every crevice. I do n\u2019t usually look this closely but after I tried to turn the light on the magnifying mirror on and got dirt on my fingers I took a tissue and wiped it. Sticky too. Well let \u2019s just say I was not impressed. Then there was the mold growing in the bathtub surround. The hand print hand print. on the glass at the top of the bath surround it disappeared the next day. And the drips of god knows what on the glass wall and door enclosing the toilet that never did disappear even after we told the front desk staff about it. The table on the deck was in very bad shape. The two USB ports on one side of the bed were pushed in and even when we tried to get them out they were non functional. We also reported this. Nothing. FYI there are no ice machines. If you want ice you have to call and wait to have it delivered 15 20 minutes in our experience. And the \u201c sofa \u201d in the room is as hard as a rock \u2013. do n\u2019t sit down too fastWe loved lunch at the bar in \u201c The Living Room \u201d. Hated the crowd and extremely loud DJ music on the pool deck. They clearly do not want anyone over 30 there on the weekends we \u2019re told they only do it on the weekend.

The cleaningnes of the room was poor. The carpets didn\u2018t see a vacuum cleaner for a long time. Housekeeping service didn\u2018t work three days in a row till 5 pm no one showed up. The elevators are very busy always filled with staff members and one day it took me 12. minutes to get down from floor 16 to ground floor. The pool was very packed the first weekend the chair I was offered was next to a wall and to get on this chair I would have had to crawl over other guests. I refused to go to the pool afterwards music was also far to loud and went to the beach which was very nice. In summary here W stands more for Wannabe than Whatever Whenever. I guess the standards of the Best Western are similar to the standards of W Fort Lauderdale but the prices wary a lot. What reconciles me are two outstanding employees which were very caring helpful and friendly after I found them. THANK YOU VERY MUCH KYLE SPENCER W insider AND EROS FROM FRONT DESK. Both of you deserve 5 stars.", "offset": [912, 1020], "date": "2020-03-07", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}]}
