Only con was that our shower was a little weak pressure was a bit low and took forever to heat up but that was minor.

Although the room cost and resort fee were nominal I was very disappointed with the condition of the hotel and particularly my room. 6173. Some things I will give forgiveness. Example the room is so far away from the elevators that it made it inconvenient to get to the casino. I would have played a couple of nights after taking a nap but I really did not want to trudge all the way to the casino and back. But to me the real shame was the condition of the room. If you go and inspect the room the dresser stand that the television is on is absolutely embarrassingly in bad shape. It needs to be removed and replaced with a more current dresser or at the very least it needs to be refinished. There is circuit breaker type extension cord by the sitting desk of the room. It was unplugged when I arrived. I tried plugging it in but it did not work. So that meant that the light on the desk did not operate either. I was afraid it was a fire hazard for it to be plugged in so I left everything unplugged my entire stay. Over the sink is a florescent light and the diffuser on it like a grate was not sitting correctly on the fixture. There was dust literally hanging from both sides of the diffuser. In the bathroom there is a small grate over the bathtub. I am not sure if that was a vent or not because i did not hear it operating. But if you look at the grate it is rusted and unsightly. My criticism of the hotel is not confined to the room. Walking down the hallway on the 6th floor you can see that there are doors that are marred wallpaper was peeling in some places and there was another what I presume was an air return grate which had dust on it and I doubt it had been cleaned in the past 6 months. I stayed at the Flamingo because that is where the friends that I met had decided to stay. I had be hard pressed to stay at it again given the poor condition of my room. Despite my intense criticism of the accommodations I did find the employees I encountered to be friendly and polite. Drink service was good even though I am not much of a drinker and there was a good selection of slot machines to keep me entertained. I enjoyed my time but I doubt that I would ever spend another vacation in that establishment.", "offset": [327, 456], "date": "2017-12-06 03:15:43", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "53f155d7-dc56-4e7d-8b00-61494df35c13", "sentence": "Never again. Just go somewhere else until they decide to completely renovate this hotel and casino. Had to move rooms 3 times in 4 days because the air was not working. Each time we were told it was in the tower we were located in. Well it must have been every tower because absolutely none of them worked. If you do not get a upgraded room you will be very disappointed. The ones that are not upgrades. I promise you the furniture is old and terrible. I would absolutely not ever put a guest in one of those rooms. Now with that being said. They did take our resort fees off for the air conditioning trouble after multiple times of calling and them saying we \u2019re going to but each time I talked to a different person and finely lost my patience a bit. So yes I did n\u2019t get charged that 130 dollars for resort fee. But I had to be very persistent and then get a little rude. We have been to Vegas before and Stayed at other places and they were GREAT.

Water was falling from so many places in the casino elevator lobbies etc. A bucket was put under the waterfall but no one emptied the bucket. I slipped and fell near our elevator because of the water. That is unacceptable. In the casino the garbage can was overflowing right in the middle of the walkway with no one caring to clean it up. The pool areas are so small it could not accommodate the guests. No chairs to sit in were available without a cost. We were down at the pool extremely early and still could not get a chair.

My friends and I separately booked several rooms. Each one of us called ahead to see if we could be located either on the same floor or somewhat close to each other. I am not sure what the standard procedure is for this but they did not accommodate us in the slightest. We were booked on different floors and in one case an entirely different tower. Granted they are all confusingly connected but that is a lot of walking between rooms. The UPSIDE. Their newly renovated rooms are large clean and modestly decorated. Like most modern hotel rooms they opted for the sliding bathroom door. Our only qualm was that the connected door between rooms carries conversations echoes from one room to the other VERY well. that is not a plus when you do not know the neighbors next door. I have not even touched on the parking situation. When we arrived to check. in there was no parking available and the valet was shut down for diamond or whatever they call their VIPs only. they are supposed to have an electronic system that lets you know how many spaces are available on a given level but it horribly miscalculated. It tried to say there were over 200 spots available and I could not find ONE. I asked a valet guy as he was walking up the ramp what the deal was and he said it was wildly inaccurate. He added that if I tipped him I could park in a valet spot. I tipped him and that settled that. He said they almost always have spots available on the parking level so he is not sure why the system is set up the way that it is. CASINO. The property is centrally located on the strip which brings in a lot of foot traffic. I find that they have cheaper tables but the casino is on the smaller side when compared to their sister properties. As an older casino there is poor air circulation. Some seats feel like your sitting under a smokey heat lamp and others are freezing cold. The lobby lights and other decorative fixtures definitely show their age. If you are looking for a great location and big cheap rooms this is a great choice. If you are looking for those two things and then some keep shopping.", "offset": [1782, 1831], "date": "2019-02-19 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "dd985990-c77d-47e3-8d12-279e3612f089", "sentence": "Short stay.
