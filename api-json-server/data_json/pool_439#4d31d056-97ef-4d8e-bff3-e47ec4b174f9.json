We stayed at the Hilton Atlanta for 2 nights while visiting the Georgia Aquarium. Being on the executive level added to the experience. We were on the 26th floor with an excellent view of the city had breakfast and evening snacks included in the executive lounge along with free internet in the room. The rooms were well appointed and spacious. We used the self park option which was easy to do but I will say my husband had some difficulty finding the car when we were getting ready to leave. The fitness center was large and faced the pool. We were in walking distance of the aquarium and restaurants along with some other sights. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

This as a first business trip to Atlanta for a conference not the only one in town. The hotel is showing its age. The staff were great friendly attentive and helpful. I wish all my hotels had staff that good. The lobbies are huge multi story and provide a lot of smaller gathering points. However none are private and none are quiet. Our guest room would have been satisfactory except for the noise coming from both inside and out. We were on the side overlooking the pool and the thruway. Traffic noise was constant with the general interruption of motorcycles ambulances police and fire trucks. The corridors are very noisy and the doors tend to slam shut. Put a rolled up towel at the bottom of the door to help. For the bed my back still hurts. In a hotel of this cost I would have expected free WiFi. Not true. Even the internet hook up at 1295 per day was poor. All the net connections were slow or non existent. I could only consider this a fall back hotel.

I just spent three nights here during the ASHRAE Summer Annual Meeting. This was my first time at this hotel. The food is a little pricey but it is what I would expect for downtown Atlanta.

From a personal standpoint the rooms are large and clean the pool is nice the pool deck is huge there is a basketball court tennis courts and outdoor walking track and a very large anc complete fitness facility that overlooks the pool deck.
