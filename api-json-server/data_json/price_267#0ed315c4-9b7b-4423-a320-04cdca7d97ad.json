It is one of those instances where my vision of my stay and visit did not at all align with the hotel and winerys execution. Check in was easy and quick. Answered all of our questions at the front desk so that was a good start. The room was spacious and very clean. We had a room that overlooked the pool. But since it was March it was closed so I am not sure of the typical noise level if it was active. We decided yo get out and walk the property since it was a nice day. The trails were okay at best. Not very scenic and quite a bit of debris. We then decided to visit the winery for a tour. I will admit I was not expecting to see jorts and t shirts worn by many visitors but there you are. The tour was going to be massive so we just parked it and had a taste of the local wines. The price was just okay and so was the wine. The port is awful. We then went back to the room popped the bottle of wine that came in our package and chilled out by the pool to enjoy the sun. The wine was a local and decent may have been due to our state of mind after our taste test. We then got ready for dinner and chose Cafe Elan. Since we were there for a special occasion wifes 40th. we requested a special table so she could enjoy her day. They accommodated us by placing us by the kitchen door. Nice touch. The service was slow and I mean SLOW. The food was better than average but my steak was under cooked was to be med rare but was rare cold in center. But I ate it because I would rather have an under cooked steak than overcooked and we did not want to wait another hour Dinner without wine salad meal desert for two runs 10ish. When we left the host asked if we would enjoy a transfer golf Club Car back to the resort. It is a short walk but was brisk temp outside so we said sure and thanked them for the offer. We waited 10 minutes but the transfer never showed so we just walked back. When we got back to the room we were quite tired and enjoyed the comfy bed. They are very comfy. But at about 1045 the people next door got back to their room. I honestly thought there was a large group of teens in the hall making so much noise. But nope it was what we think 4 or 5 grown women who apparently 1. were having a girls weekend away 2. had ZERO concern for the noise they were making. It was loud. I will say the adjoining room with opposing door for shared side by side rooms made it worse. We tried to wait it out but we had to eventually ask the front desk to address. They did come by and ask the room to please quiet down. They did until the hotel staff left and they started back up. 10 to 1 odds they were wearing the jorts up at the winery. We got up the next day and went out to enjoy the breakfast buffet. It was good but for two people the retail price is 50. Not that good. My wife then departed for her 50 minute massage and to enjoy the spa for the morning. I went back to the room to listen to the gaggle of women discuss 50 Shares of Gray and all kind of old woman details that no one should be subjected to. Gross. We checked out easy and when we left the front desk person asked how out stay was. I replied fine except the noise next door. She said and I quote oh that is too bad. And then handed my my bill. We then walked to our car parked a good bit away. We were glad to have an adult day but for the money we spent and letting the hotel know it was for a special occasion I was not overly impressed and gave the hotel an average rating.", "offset": [901, 945], "date": "2015-03-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3c5f3f7a-b7e0-4874-b311-d1cec5ae5c0e", "sentence": "Chateau Elan.

My room key stopped working the second day we got there and I had to have a service lady let us back in our room. The third day I paid extra for a late checkout and our room keys stopped working at the normal check out time so we had to have another staff member open our door. Also for booking our room and package over a month in advance I was expecting our room to be on a floor with a view but instead we were on the ground floor where there was minimal window lighting and interior lighting which made the mood of the room dark and unwelcoming.

We really enjoyed the wine tasting but the tour was disappointing. The wine tasting allowed us to find out what type of wine we like being that we are not big wine drinkers. We thought the tour would be for an hour and included a tour of the winery and vineyard but we stood in a room at the top of the stairs for about less than 30 minutes and listened to the tour guide talk about how the wine is made while staff prepared food below which was distracting. The tour only cost 5 so I guess we should not have expected much but the website said the tour was an hour so that is what we expected. We had dinner at Versailles which was delicious.

I \u2019ve purposely waited to share this review because I did n\u2019t want to relay any resentment or bitterness only the facts. So here it goes My husband and I booked the culinary experience as well as a spa day for our short weekend getaway. We booked over the phone as we \u2019d never been to Chateau Elan and wanted to speak with someone directly about the amenities etc. Upon our arrival we see that the Inn where our room was was under going a complete renovation. This was fine however it would have been nice to know considering the building smelled of fresh paint. So we check in and get settled into our room \u2014 400 night and we \u2019re next to the laundry room and also spotted three large bugs in our room and we begin to dress for our first dinner outing. Come to find out the resort \u2019s restaurants were either closed for renovations or weddings. It \u2019s important to note that this information is displayed on the website but was not relayed to us over the phone. Had we known we would not have booked the culinary experience. So we had no choice but to eat room service for most of our meals. Luckily there are a few restaurants off site that we were able to drive to. On day two we headed over to the spa for our very pricey couples massage. Low and behold the spa is also under renovation so where one would typically use the sauna steam room etc. it was closed. The men \u2019s locker room sauna and steam room were all closed. This was not disclosed to us either as we would n\u2019t have booked. Paying the hefty price for a spa service includes the amenities at the spa. So why did we pay for them if they \u2019re closed. Lastly I purchased an eye mask from the resort store the evening before we checked out. I placed it in the refrigerator in the room and subsequently forgot it was in there \u2014. so I left it. I realized this about 20 minutes after leaving the resort and called right away however the front desk was closed they were at the front desk to check us out. strange. Anyway I call first thing Monday morning and they file a report to have someone go to the room and retrieve it. It was about three days before I hear back and the gentleman I spoke said it was not in there and that no one had checked into our room since we \u2019d checked out. So there nothing he can do. So this only leaves one explanation. someone who had access to the room took it. I was told that the only thing I could do was come to the Braselton police department and file a police report. For a 20 eye mask. I also live about two hours away. What \u2019s most disappointing about this is that we spent nearly 200 for a two night stay at this resort and not one person was willing to work with us. Needless to say we will not be returning to Chateau Elan and warn everyone we speak with to STAY AWAY.", "offset": [1545, 1620], "date": "2019-09-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "price"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "83729e70-812b-426b-9f70-404e56f629eb", "sentence": "Service going down except spa.
