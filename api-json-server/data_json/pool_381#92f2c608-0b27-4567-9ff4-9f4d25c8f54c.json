Until about 430 when the place gets slammed with people tossing cups from one side of the pool to the other cups floating in the pool. Kind of gross. If you do go here bring air freshener. They allow smoking in the rooms so they all smell. We had to spray fabreze every night just to sleep. Very musty smell. the comforters needed cleaning replacing. The shows at night go until midnight so if you do not stay up late make sure your room is garden side otherwise you are not sleeping. No joke. Had free wifi but most of us could never get it to work.

Recently returned from punta Cana with emptiness. Staying at this particular hotel was quite disappointing. Hotel is tired and old. The rooms are full of odor. Plenty of leaky walls. Bathrooms are old. Ants everywhere. Room service was awful. Many nights we returned to room in evening and rooms were not cleaned. The lobby is like visiting grandmas house. Trying to be luxurious but worn out. The pool area is a joke. Pools are so old and need major renovation. Too small for the crowd. Lots of nastiness at pool area twerking.

The buffet had plenty to offer. Good choices. The theatre was old. However staff was superb. Staff was a hit or miss. Victor at pool area was wonderful. Any at restaurant was a delight.

The resort was beautiful but after visiting I am not sure we will ever visit Punta Cana again and we will definitely not go to another Riu. First off it is supposed to be a family resort but I found many things that were inappropriate for kids my children were told they could not throw a ball purchased at the resort but there was an inflatable penis and beachball with breasts in it that were being thrown around the pool. The aerobics consisted of quite a bit of grinding and nipple rubbing. The afternoon entertainment dance routine consisted of grinding on the ground. Regarding the rooms they did have a mildew odor and feel wet which I expected we did not expect our ceiling to leak in the bathroom. The second night there it leaked and we were told the tub above overflowed the following night it leaked again but we were not in the room this time and leaked all over our toiletries. They replaced our toothbrush the last night there. They offered to move our room but both rooms were dirty and we had joining rooms and the dirty ones were not. we declined and I imagine they moved the upstairs people. The majority of the staff were rude and not helpful if they did not speak English they ignored you as opposed to letting you know they did not speak English. The seaweed was bad but we were prepared and that was fine till they would bury it and a very foul smelling odor would come. We purchased pictures from the company at the resort and spent 300 only to come home with one of the two disks blank. The food was not great but not bad either we stayed away from the specialty restaurants after speaking to other people on the resort who had eaten there. We had wonderful waiters at the Buffet Sandy and Joel they were interactive with our kids and took very good care of us.

Just returned from a week at the Riu Palace Punta Cana Had been reading the reviews for months so have to give mine at this point. Booked a great deal back in January with a non stop charter flight on the spur of the moment without researching this resort but had stayed at the Riu Tequila the previous year in Mexico so felt we were ok. The riu is noted for generally being a safe and reliable brand and I felt that we had the same service that we had paid for once again emphasizing GREAT DEAL. Transfer was easy and quick from airport and literally we were in our room 75 minutes after landing at airport. We did pay for a garden view but at check in asked for an upgrade and received it. Our room was very clean with no issues and a great view of entire complex which is GORGEOUS. I did notice a somewhat musty smell but expected that as we were in the tropics. It totally went away after a few minutes. We had picture perfect days even though there was rain in the forecast for every day. One afternoon it rained a little but within 20 minutes all was forgotten and the sun dried area nicely. It was HOT AND HUMID. LOVED the beach and would get there early on each day to enjoy my books. Service was impeccable there as well as all the areas of the resort. I never went thirsty or hungry and really feel they go out of their way to please you. I do tip and never felt that it was expected at any time. Ate at all the specialty restaurants and our favorites were the Japanese and Steakhouse. Fusion was good too. The only one that I have to give a sub par review to was Bodega which was the meat lovers place. It was really inedible BUT had avocado slices at the salad bar which made my girls VERY happy. The wifi as reported is hit or miss but besides one day I had good service anytime I tried to get onto the internet. The lobby has the best service but most days we got it on our balcony and at the pool. Several times I checked and had it at the beach as well. I generally would check in on emails at meal times or at the end of the day and always had service. My goal was to disconnect as I truly wanted a restful and relaxing spring break. We really enjoyed the Riu Fun team and the girls were constantly joining into games and dances. They sure do work hard and are there ALL DAY LONG. I want what they take for energy. The best entertainment night was the Circus themed night. truly spectacular. The only disappointing thing that I noticed is that many underage people were getting drunk and were even escorted away from the pool one day to only return the next and continue with the drinking. The parents obviously allow it but a bit sad to see young girls looking so trashed. I enjoyed trying all the different drinks but could not stomach the wine. All in all we felt we got what we paid for. I would love to try another brand at this point just to see what the differences are in the resorts. So may say the all inclusives are pretty much the same but I did hear of some other night time activities at other resorts that sounded fun.", "offset": [2445, 2642], "date": "2017-04-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "a252e749-726b-4fdb-b3ac-1477717fd568", "sentence": "RUI PALACE Punta Cana NOT BOTTLED WATER and Mold.

I have seen some reviews on this hotel that complained about the noise and about their rooms being damp. I cant comment on these because my room was very nice and our apartment was not near the building works next door which appears to be just about finished. Our room was for three people so we had a large double bed and a large single bed in the room. There was a free mini bar which contained Sprite Cola Tonic Fanta and fizzy as well as plain water. There were also optics with international drinks not just local ones. The towels were changed every day and we always seemed to have more bath towels than we needed. The room also had a safe hair dryer iron and ironing board and tea and coffee facilities. The room was also cleaned every day. The pool area had the usual 7 am towel dumpers to reserve beds but we always found three beds together after 9. The number of beds that could be shaded was excellent. The pool bar was good. and there are two other pools. The animation team were always friendly and the pool waiters came round often to see if you wanted a drink. Entertainment was mostly dance based because of the multi language problem but on most nights it was very good. The food in this hotel is excellent. There are some a la carte restaurants steak Italian fusion and Japanese. but we found the selection and quality of the food in the buffet restaurant as good if not better than these. There was a bit of a problem with my grand daughter being vegetarian. No dishes were marked and the staff did not seem aware what food was vegetarian or what vegetarian meant. She was told that one dish was vegetarian but on sitting at the table found it contained minced meat.

We stayed at this resort from July 2 8 2017. Overall we had a great time and a great experience but there were some disappointments. I will speak to the disappointments first and then the positives. Please do n\u2019t read just the disappointments because overall we really enjoyed our stay. I am putting the disappointments first simply because there are things that may specifically bother some travelers and therefore may matter to you more than most. Disapointments Our biggest single disappointment was dinner. Overall they were just not that amazing and definitely not better than lunch. First it was n\u2019t obvious to me that there were two of the five specialty restaurants that required slacks for men. Mexico is 90 degrees with 90degre humidity and I never even thought of packing a pair of long slacks. This precluded us from eating at two restaurants in the evening. Note to all others reading this review men should pack a pair of long pants. On the flip side I am not sure that these two restaurants would have made the difference since our experience in the other three specialty restaurants was so lackluster. The food was n\u2019t bad but it also was n\u2019t good. We live in Ohio and I can promise you that none of the three restaurants steak and seafood Mexican and Brazilian steakhouse would make it on the open market in Ohio. The food was okay just not special or great. We could have made a nicer dinner in our kitchen at home. Since we were excluded from 2 of the five we had a few more dinners than we want in the main buffet that buffet was very acceptable with a wide number of choices except that it was essentially the same dishes as lunch so essentially it was like having the same meal twice in one day. Now that I have made this point please read the positives below as I do n\u2019t want you to think that this was a terrible food week. 15 stars on dinner at the specialty restaurants and the lack of transparency on the no shorts rule Next biggest negative was the entertainment. We joked with another guest \u201c What entertainment \u201d. My family is grown 3 children vacationed with my wife and I but the youngest is 19 and the eldest is 26. we had two adjoining rooms. None of us thought that the stage entertainment was very good and we were all disappointed. I heard that there was an accident a few weeks ago on stage this is only a rumor and that may have affected the shows. There seemed to be nightly \u201c kids on stage \u201d shows and I am sure that this was a thrill to those parents or maybe to parents of younger children but it did nothing for my family. The main attraction seemed to always include some video and several dancers and Mexican music. Not very entertaining in my opinion. Once again though read the positives below as it was n\u2019t all bad. 15 stars on the stage entertainmentThe solution to the above would have been dinner in the area along with entertainment at one of the local clubs however it is hard to justify leaving the all inclusive hotel to pay for dinner and drinks in the area. If the hotel had offered all inclusive except for dinner we would have probably preferred that as an option. Positives I commented on dinner above but I have to admit that breakfast and lunch were all that anyone could ever ask for. There are two buffets for lunch and one buffet for breakfast. The breakfast buffet had every type of breakfast available that I could imagine but I am rather simple when it comes to breakfast give me some eggs or an omelet with sausage or bacon and coffee and I am good. However there was pancakes waffles fish cheese homemade donuts lots of bakery and custom made mimosas choose your fruit from 5 8 types. I stay at a lot of hotels for my work and this breakfast was equivalent to the best hotel breakfast 99 of the hotels I have ever stayed at. It beats some Easter brunch buffets that I have had in my many decades. If you like breakfast you will surely like this main buffet. 45 stars on breakfast lunch is served in 2 restaurants. One is open air and close to the pool and the other is air conditioned. Once again I am not sure that you can ask for more from a resort friendly beach and pool friendly restaurant. You will need sandals on your feet and a shirt or coverup but other than that the atmosphere is very relaxed. It was an excellent lunch lots of salad and fruit hot dogs hamburgers chicken multiple types of pizza multiple fish dishes multiple pasta dishes tacos gyros etc. We had no complaints about lunch in any way. 45 stars on lunch bar bands I complained about the entertainment above but I have to give a shout out to the bar bands that played in the center of the complex in the evening. Excellent bar bands. We heard 3 different groups and frankly my entire family said that they could have played all night and the stage acts could have stayed home. Good covers by good musicians and competent singers. Very enjoyable while have some evening free drinks after dinner. We heard excellent covers of Journey Eagles Pink Floyd Santana etc. 4 stars Beach WOW. This was the highlight of the resort. The beach is MASSIVE. Elderly people may actually get tired walking from the pool to the ocean water. I am not great with distance measurements but my guess is that the distance in the sand from the pool to the ocean exceeded a US football field 100 yards. If you told me it was 150 yards I would believe you. The 40 is covered in evenly spaced palm trees this allowed you to position yourself in shade or sun depending on your desires all day long just move the chair to satisfy your needs. Then you have 60 of open sand that was well raked and fairly well picked up of other peoples trash do me a favor and take your trash to the trash bin really. Stop being lazy your mother does n\u2019t work here. Plenty of room for sun worshippers and people playing games. Beach is long and continuous along many resorts and condos so a walk jog on the beach should wear out the most hardened athlete. Soft white sand that the Caribbean is known for. There were a couple of guys walking along hawking jewelry but they were never obnoxious and we probably only got asked to buy something 3 4 times in any one day. We have stayed at a lot of Caribbean islands probably better than a dozen and this was probably my favorite beach in the Caribbean. The only beaches that I preferred in the world were in Hawaii. 5 stars Pool another WOW 2 pools that are adjacent to each other. The one pool has a swim up bar with places to sit along with \u201c water booths \u201d situated around it and it also has built in water lounge chairs at the ends and an almost continuous water volleyball game going. During the day there are various activities around the pool dancing BINGO water dancing etc. The music is decent and not obnoxiously loud so that you can easily have a conversation or listen to your own earbuds. The temperature of the water is a bit on the warm side for me but my wife loved it I do n\u2019t think they heat the water but the Mexican sun is pretty powerful. In the mornings it was a pleasant temperature and I was able to do laps in the pool before it got too crowded. My estimate is that it is almost a 50 yard length from stairs to stairs the pool is actually larger than this as the before mentioned built in lounge chairs extend this length by about 25 feet on both ends of the pool. Close to the nicest resort pool that I have been in. 5 stars pool beach chairs we were a party of 5. We NEVER could not get chairs together. A couple times we had to move a chair or two to make a row of five but they were always plentiful. I can see that if you arrive at 2P that you may not get 3 chairs together at the pool but I guarantee that you could walk to the beach and find all the chairs that you needed in the white soft sand. As I said above then it is just a matter of rearranging the chairs to chase the sun or chase the shade based on the many palm trees. 5 stars on lounge chairs bar. The pool bar was efficient and fun. It was a swim up bar on one side and a walkup on the other. Lots of selection of very good quality liquor and very good beer Dos Equis seems to be the house brand and that is great for me. I enjoyed tequila good quality brands for sipping were available. bloody mary \u2019s pina colada BC and margaritas and all were well made with very good ingredients. Frankly you would probably have to be a liquor snob to not enjoy something at this bar. I did n\u2019t seen any 30 year old Scotch on the bar but it is a beach bar and it is 100 degrees out and you are in Mexico have a Dos Equis pina colada or margarita and enjoy the atmosphere. 5 stars on pool bar wait staff AMAZING. They were extremely attentive. I can not say enough superlatives about the wait staff at the pool sit in Vincent \u2019s area that guy is on a constant fast walk that would beat some people \u2019s jog. Kind helpful quick efficient fun etc. There are not enough positive words. 45 stars on wait staf maintenance one of the things I worry about in the Caribbean is the upkeep of the facility. These guys rock. We are fairly early risers and if you walk outside before 8 you will be amazed at the number of workers cleaning the common areas. The tile and there is a lot of it gets swept and mopped daily. There always seems to be a crew scraping and painting a section. The bushes are extremely well shaped and it looks like every bush has been trimmed within the last week or so. Grass is nicely cut. Everything is being washed on a regular basis. There are pool fountains in the center of the complex and we saw them get drained swept and mopped. We probably saw 110 of the actual maintenance being done but I was impressed with the diligence of the management to keep the place neat clean and safe. I would give the maintenance 45 stars room nothing special. It was fine but you are not going to say WOW. Towel animals on your bed after it has been cleaned is a nice touch. Probably could stand a few more outlets so if you are a modern family with a couple devices per person you may be wise to pack a multi plug in your bag. I never turned on the TV I was on vacation in Mexico why would I watch TV. 35 stars.", "offset": [5227, 5381], "date": "2017-07-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "aa8fc62a-fa74-435f-9ad3-0fc12b320955", "sentence": "Wonderful Restaurants and a Huge Resort. Our stay at the RIU Palace Resort in Punta Cana last year was very enjoyable. We had a lovely room on the third floor that looked out to the huge center courtyard. You have many restaurants to choose from with different specialties. Yokohama Japanese restaurant a traditional steakhouse by the beach pool area Krystal which has an Asian fusion vibe La Bodega a Brazilian restaurant serving meat off a sword and Luigi an Italian place. There is also Don Manuel which serves breakfast lunch and dinner buffet style. It is huge and serves just about anything. There is also another buffet restaurant closer to the pool which is open for lunch and at dinner it converts into the aforementioned Steakhouse restaurant. There is a swim up bar at the pool with plenty of activities and music. there is even a beautiful gazebo right on the beach. Perfect if you want to get married. The beach is beautiful and the water was warm but it had a strong current. The lobby is spacious and lovely with a large bar that serves drinks late into the night. You will also find the sports bar just off the main lobby which is open late and has basic self serve offerings like sandwiches nachos with cheese to heat up fruits and desserts. There are tour services with different tour operators so be sure to pick the one that interests you the most. We did a tour of Santo Domingo with Nexus Tours and loved it. Every night there is a live show trapeze Michael Jackson tribute Vegas Show girl styel etc. and the music plays on the outdoor patio bar where you can take dancing lessons from one of the many social animators. We found them to be fun and always engaged with the guests. We thought the furniture was a bit dated but our room nevertheless spacious and very comfortable. The bathroom was large with a notably deep bathtub. The spa and fitness facility was large and offers many different treatments at an additional cost. There is also a local market that arrives once a week with typical kitsch items and knick knacks but the prices for earrings with traditional stones was reasonable. We would recommend this hotel for couples families with teens or groups. A family resort is just down the beach and better suited for smaller children as there is a kidie pool and activities for them. There is a large water park nearby connected to a different property chain but you can access to it for a daily fee. The RIU Palace is the first in a series of other RIU sister properties some of which you can access. There are even a few that you can lunch at. They are lined up side by each and offer different amenities and levels of service family adult only couples and a more party style. The Palace was a 5star resort with the most restaurants.

Coffee Lounge is gorgeous. The Junior Suites are \u201c Freshly Updated with new Double Sinks and Walk in Shower with Rain Fall Shower head nice very nice.

New pool area. 1 swim up bar. wow the bartenders are great Matos Jean Alex their Supervisor Wilson are very hard working individuals along with so many others. Felipe the pool attendant towel guys was OUTSTANDING. Now the pool it self no place to be kids running a muck jumping and diving off cement tables with their parents partying not watching them. Just my opinion but NO KIDS SHOULD BE IN A POOL SWIM UP AREA where Liquor is SERVED. There is a larger pool close by where the kids can go there is a pool for volleyball that nobody EVER USED this was our \u201c Happy Place \u201c. the Beach is amazing but waves are very strong which brings in a lot of seaweed on the beach. The hotel did not do a very good job of cleaning it up. Steak House also the lunchtime buffet. best place to eat I recommend you order the Beef filet Salmon their separate on the menu but what the heck it \u2019s all inclusive. A lot of sales offers on beach from glasses to paintings do n\u2019t get ripped off negotiate. Pool parties were CRAZY FUN for younger crowd no 40 over. Must do a major thank you to Victor the 3 11 shift bartender in the Sports Bar. We meet Victor as a pool waiter in 2017 he always greeted my family and I with the warmest smile even while working incredible hard I always new his perseverance and determination to make himself a proud professional man will some day become reality and now I seen it has.

Our special thanks to barman Matos at the pool bar evening time after 7 pm. It was a real pleasure to watch him working and communicating with guests. Ataboy.

My family vacation at RIU Palace Punta Cana was nothing short of euphoric. We met both guests and staff members who we hope to cultivate strong relationships with over the coming years. Although we stayed for only a few days Juan Matos and Robert Alonzo Springer from Scuba Caribe always seemed to know exactly what we wanted and needed without asking. Both treated us like family and made sure that we were always taken care of. My brother dropped his phone in the pool and Robert consoled him in such a familial way. It meant so much to all of us and we will never forget it. The RIU Fit services with Miguel and James were fantastic and made me feel less guilty about over indulging in almost everything this all inclusive resort had to offer. Thanks to the superb services and wonderful staff at RIU Palace Punta Cana my family and I have decided to visit every winter holiday.

Bet it scored 5 before. First time in Dominican Republic 10th time with RiuClasic Riu reception area but you could tell that the soul had been torn out of it during the re firb. Massive open plan aluminium and smoked glass interior with a compact desk stuck right in the middle of it. Half drunk welcome drinks on the reception counter but no offer of drinks for incoming parties of 4 or under although these would have been welcomeEficient check in and room allocation. Given a nice room with view over the courtyard complete with well manicured gardens fountains looking right to the pools the ocean beyond. Make sure that you take dollars US rather than pesos. If you take pesos your agent will give you notes with 200 as a minimum. The nice bell hop brought our cases to the room and whilst turning down a tip of \u00a3 1 sterling was more than happy with the only note I had on me. 20pesos or \u00a3 360 to me or you. He was a happy boy. This scenario repeats in the few shops available in resort. All quote prices in US Dollars and if you ask for payment in Pesos they will take you to the nearest 200 pesos plus or minus \u00a3 360. As the hotel is all inclusive the majority of cash you take will be for tips. If as we do you choose to tip on a regular basis a one dollar tip seems to be the norm. We used reception to change our higher value pesos for 50s which have a exchange rate of around 90 pence or 1 US dollar. SortedThe layout of the hotel was based around two huge wings that ran at 90degres to the reception block bar restaurants. The two wings were separated by a courtyard are with three ponds complete with fountains and surrounded by well kept gardens. The wings themselves contain the bedrooms accessed from balconies either side of a light well with tropical plants and full height coconut palms bit like Strangeways on a good dayThe layout of the hotel as with most Riu hotels means that your holiday will incorporate a modicum of daily exercise by way of longish walks from your room to base camp in the reception block which contains all the restaurants entertainment areas and the like. There are two lifts adjacent to reception one lift half way down one at the end of each wing. The rooms are all decent sized junior suites with separate lounge area giving access from the bedroom area to a balcony with glazed balustrading. One word of warning. There is a step down from the bedroom into the lounge area and the brown wood effect flooring is carried over the step from the main floor. Until you get used to this it is easy to forget that it is there especially late in the evening when you make your way glass in hand for one last brandy on the Balcony. You may want to consider a contrast strip at the step edge Riu before the compo claims start flooding in. Similarly how many guests have walked through the mesh on your sliding fly screen doors. Early days yet after your re firbPlenty of wardrobe drawer space and nice to see that Riu have at least retained the original hardwood doors and furniture. Good sized bathroom with large walk in shower twin basins plenty shelf space. The shower has two heads the main one being the rainfall type. The was cleaned thoroughly every day and we were left with an abundance of clean towels. The mini bar man arrived every evening just as you were getting out of the shower to re plenish the stock in the fridge and in the four optics. Terrific service it must be saidAl the restaurants are on the ground floor pool level of the main block with reception one floor up. The outside area between the restaurants and into the courtyard is laid out permanently with masses of four seat tables giving a viewpoint to two separate stages. We ate at the buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner as we found the variety and quality of food could not be faulted. One big mistake I think Riu have made in their re firb is the severe lack of bar areas adjacent to the restaurants entertainment area and up in reception. We have stayed at Rius in Jamaica Mexico and recall that hotels there had large bar areas in just such locations. Looking at this hotel I would guess that where the secondary stage now is there once stood a magnificent hardwood bar ala Playacar Ocho Rios. where you could sit on stools have a pre dinner drink and generally meet people. In this current layout there is no bar what so ever on this level but rather you take a seat at one of the tables and give your order to a waiter. The amusing thing is that he or she then scuttles off to what we affectionately came to know as the drinks cupboard. This was a staff only room under the stairs where drinks are prepared. By the time they reached your table the drinks were often tepid. If you wanted a change from this you had the option of climbing stairs to the reception area bar. Given the size of the reception area itself the bar is minute being circular with a separating screen. One half is given over to the sale of coffee and cake with the other half operating as a cocktail bar. Again fight for one of the six bar stools or find yourself a table and wait to be served. I suspect that prior to re firb another bar area existed in the area behind what is now the reception deskI suspect that the soul has been ripped out of this hotel when it was re modelled around the main block. There is no atmosphere at all around the restaurant entertainment area at any time of the day or nightThe one remaining observation on the subject of facilities in the main block would be the severe lack of public toilet facilities. Serving the whole of the Restaurant Entertainment level is one male female toilet area just past the drinks cupboard Serving the whole of Reception level is a male female toilet area some distance behind the reception counter which means one hell of a walk from the Sports Bar and even the Cocktail Bar. Apart from an early morning dip in the smallest of the three pools our preference was to use the beach which is accessed directly from the back of the hotel. This is truly a piece of paradise a beautiful sandy beach with an abundance of loungers and palm trees that allowed you to chase the shade as the temperature rose towards the middle of the day. One big advantage over life by the pool was the constant cooling breeze coming in off the sea. At last the option down here at least to choose your drinking preference. By the time you have applied the sun tan lotion and settled on your lounger a waiter will appear and take your drinks order. Exercising your right to choose the Pool Bar is a perfect alternative. A very short walk from your lounger you can sit at a long bar on a stool and in the shade and drink a cooling beer whilst chatting to the bar staff and anyone else who chose to share the experience. The back section of this bar gave directly onto the pool and the atmosphere was always lively. This was a super holiday made all the better by attentive helpful and cheerful staff. The whole hotel exuded quality but in line with Riu re furbs around the world it is lost it is soul. Riu had something special in it is original format but now you could be stopping at anyone of a number of chains with the same ratingShame Riu but you have lost the plot.", "offset": [3409, 3541], "date": "2019-11-11", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}]}
