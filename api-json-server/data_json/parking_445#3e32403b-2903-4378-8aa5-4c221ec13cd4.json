The Sheraton Portland was a very good experience. This is a true 35 star hotel. My room was clean and serviceable. Remember this is an airport hotel and Portland has an active schedule so if you need absolute peace and quiet this is not for you. My room was on the runway side and after the first couple of take offs I tuned this out and did n\u2019t affect my stay at all. The restaurant was good and convenient maybe a little pricey. Nice gym with multiple machines and free weight dumbbells. I would stay here again. The shuttle only goes to the airport and you can catch the MAX line there if needed.

I chose this hotel because of prior good experience with Sheraton. Unfortunately this property was not to expected standards. Our room 250 was in ill repair and dingy. Very insufficient bathroom lighting worn out TV remote and just so many other things below standard. This room at the end of the hallway was VERY noisy and staff banging around in the hallway talking loudly did not help at all. Parking was a crap shoot and I was hit with an unexpected additional 100 self parking charge on arrival. Property is VERY close to the PDX runways with lots of noise.

I was a little disappointed in this property. It is an aging property that is certainly showing signs of being well past prime. I had strongly urge the hotel to close down for several months for a major renovation and overhaul. Or alternatively perhaps the time has come for the hotel to be rebranded from Sheraton to a lower tier hotel brand. Some negatives1. As mentioned it is older. Carpet in common areas and in rooms is frumpy tiling in bathrooms could stand renovation. Elevators seemed a bit clunky. Most everything has a dated appearance or fel2. Mattress was way too soft and seemed like a cheap motel mattress as opposed to a bed in a chain that is normally considered upper middle tier3. Layout is kind of silly you have to walk down a very long corridor from the lobby to get to the elevators that lead to the rooms. And then once on the floor the layout results in very long walks for the elevators to some roms4. The swimming pool and hot tub looked murky I decided to stay out5. Lobby is very large but dark and uninviting abundant opportunity for it to be refreshed. But it was not all negative1. Appreciated the free parking not all airports near PDX offer free parking2. Although dated everything seemed clean including towels and linens3. Staff was friendly4. Check in was swift5. The fitness center was pretty decent though would be nicer if it had exterior windows6. There were saunas something that seems uncommon at hotels these days. FYI the saunas are gender specific7. Rooms featured large flat screen TVs and a refrigerator8.
