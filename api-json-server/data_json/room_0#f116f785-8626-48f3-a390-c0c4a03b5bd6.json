My daughter and I stayed here for the weekend to be as close as possible to the convention center for Metrocon. She was hosting a panel at 1 pm so we arrived at the hotel around 145am to see when we could check in I was guessing around the normal time of 4. The front desk staff were welcoming and helpful would store our luggage and text me when the room was ready. They had overboked so my 2 double beds room was no longer available. For that they offered not only a king suite at the same rate as the double they took off 50 per night. I would have been happy with just the suite so getting a total of 100 off for our stay was icing on the cake. I was pleasantly surprised when I received this text at 115. Our suite was so nice. Lots of room for just the 2 of us a pullout sofa bed in case my daughter was tired of my snoring plenty of closet space 2 TVs a mini fridge microwave kitchen sink and the comfy separate bedroom. It was clean and well stocked with towels. The skybridge connecting the hotel to the convention center made getting to and from it a breeze. For both days we were there we had a complimentary drink offer during their happy hour as well as a complimentary breakfast which was a full buffet of breakfast items. I did not get my drinks but the breakfast was very nice with quite an assortment from which to choose. The hotel staff from the valets to the front desk the bellmen and breakfast staff could not have been more lovely professional and helpful. One example I called to have a bellman take our luggage back to storage right before we checked out so we could spend some time at the conventions final day. It sounded like there was quite a line of guests ahead of me so we decided to run down an get our breakfast. Once back I called the front desk to see where I was in queue and she said a bellman already came by but no one answered. Instead of sounding irritated with me for inconveniencing the bellman at a very busy time the young lady at the desk simply said she had get a bellman back up to me and it took no time at all before he was back. He was so nice and I am embarrassed to admit this he apologized to me a couple of times for not getting the luggage. I told him it was all my fault and there we were apologizing to each other LOL. After a couple hours at the con we went back to get our luggage and get our car from valet parking. The same bellman helped me get our luggage out and told me what I needed to do to get my car there was quite a line of people waiting and I would have waited in that line holding my claim ticket had he not told me not realizing they had already turned in their tickets and were just waiting for their cars to be delivered. I gave him a big hug he was so sweet. The only irritations I had the only restaurant at the hotel Taste had limited dinner choices for very high prices and is not kid friendly I relied on Uber Eats and Outback takeout for lunch and dinner. I do not believe Taste is under the management of the hotel so it is nothing against Embassy. Also if you are attending a convention or maybe just staying there for its proximity to everything you must be patient while waiting on the elevators. There are 17 floors and while there are I think 4 elevators it can take a few minutes to get up or down and if there are hundreds of people staying there for a convention you could wait a while.

I call down to find out they were not sending someone then that person had other things to do and would come up later. Why were we waiting in the rom no idea.
