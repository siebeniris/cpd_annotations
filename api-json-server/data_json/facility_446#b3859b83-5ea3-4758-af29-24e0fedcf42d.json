The staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was very nice. That being said our room as well as the hallway on the 5th floor especially the hallway along with the whole hotel smells horribly of stale cigarette smoke. We were told the whole hotel is non smoking which I am sure it is now but clearly this was not the case in the past and the carpets need very badly to be replaced so that the place does not wreak of cigarette smoke. We were recommended to stay here by the Cincinnati Childrens Hospital so that was why we chose this hotel but had we known it smelled like cigarette smoke we would not have stayed here because we have a son with a tracheostomy tube that he breaths through and a very medically fragile and complex airway so having cigarette smoke for him to breathe in is NOT what we wanted to experience. We would have switched hotels upon arrival but we were so exhausted from a long day at the hospital and we did not have time or energy at that point to search for another in a town we were not familiar with. We then did not want to have to re pack everything after our first night so we just stayed here but until the carpets are replaced and the whole hotel is sanitized of the stale cigarette smoke I do not think we would consider staying here again despite the fact that the staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was very nice.", "offset": [133, 289], "date": "2016-02-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "ad5ca934-903c-4d40-9906-2bcffe8e36ec", "sentence": "Very quiet.
