Two stepping out of the tub onto the tile floor had more of a leap than a step down. The floor was about two feet from the tub so for us short people it was not lije your normal step down out of a tub. Three there was not enough seating for breakfast everytime we went down.

I usually love SpringHil Suites and was pretty disappointed with the quality of the rooms. When I arrived a friendly front desk associate greeted me. There were no king rooms available so I got a room with two queens but she put me on a higher floor to try to make it up. I do n\u2019t see how this helps but that was a nice offer. The room was this slightly green color which made me feel like I was in a nursing home. That \u2019s just my preference however. In the main bedroom area there were no lamps which I found a little strange. There was definitely plenty of room to put a light in a corner. Also I can deal with that. no big deal. The shower temperature gauge was falling off which was inconvenient. still I made it work. The shower would n\u2019t totally turn off either. I would have to use ALL of my strength to pull up on the shower lever to get it to stop and it would still drip. Also the toilet would run continually so every time I used the bathroom I had to lift the back off to add water. It \u2019s not a huge deal because I could fix all of these things myself with some effort but it \u2019s just the annoyance of having to do these things or call a maintenance guy which I thought would be even more inconvenient. On the last night I realized the floor by my bed had this super gross red stain. Not sure what that was. but I realized it was by my kitchen area as well. The halls always had this weird smell to them like a hospital mixed with nursing home. Mostly nursing home. The lobby often smelled like Febreze covering up a bad bathroom run. I figured it \u2019s probably because the main bathroom was right by the lobby. The breakfast was decent. However I \u2019m not sure how long the English muffins had been out there. They were super stale the second day I stayed. The breakfast is scrambled eggs a meat rotating bacon turkey sausage potato sausage mixture oatmeal with nuts etc bagels English muffins muffins bananas and apples yogurt coffee. I stayed for six nights and this menu was consistent. The week I stayed they also do fire alarm tests during the day. I \u2019m sure you can imagine how fun that was. They did have a notice on my desk when I got there that it was only a drill and to apologize for the inconvenience. There is a shuttle that comes until about 9 pm on weekdays and 730 on weekends to take you anywhere within two miles which was nice. There is also a happy hour between 530 and 7 each day with snacks carrots broccoli cauliflower and ranch the night I went as well as drinks franzia wine and bud light. It is definitely a nice gesture. Would I stay here again. No probably not. We booked the rooms based on the location to the auto show but unles some serious renovating occurs it is n\u2019t worth it.

Houston \u2019s Medical Center is world renown and because of that they receive a large number of patients and others who are visiting to see those who staying at one of the many care facilities. NRG Park is popular for sports concerts and conventions so it makes perfect sense that hotels would strategically place themselves in areas convenient to both and a prime example is the Springhil Suites Houston Medical Center NRG Park. I\u2019ve stayed at other Springhil Suites locations and the best feature of these places of lodging is the size of the units. They are suites so you get more space and I like how the front room has its own television and sofa that can be used for sleeping. The back room contains two queen size beds and its own television so you have a good deal of space that exceeds what you get at most other hotels. The size is certainly the number one assets of the suites and I also like the abundant free parking and complimentary breakfast each morning. They even have a coin operated laundry on each floor so you can keep your clothing clean if you have an extended stay plus a small exercise room and outdoor pool. On the negative side however there are some qualities of this location that make it less attractive than it would otherwise be. The most obvious is the apearance the units are a little run down and you can see visible signs of wear and tear. The bathtub in my unit for example was scratched up and the same could be said for the desk counter in the main bedroom. Another issue we had was with the cooling system. You see the cooling unit is in the back of each unit next to the window and right alongside one of the queen size beds. But the thermostat that controls the cooling is in the front of the unit in the first room where the sofa and television are located. This means that the front room is noticeably warmer than the back bedroom. You have to keep this in mind when you set the thermostat because it can take a while for the front room thermostat to reach your desired temperature. And that means that the bedroom can get uncomfortably cold. The good news with the condition of the rooms is that Springhil Suites is renovating right now. They were in fact renovating when I was there so in a matter of time the issues I pointed out with the rooms will be resolved. While they are at it perhaps they can solve the problem with the cooling. Once these two things are taken care of the Springhil Suites Houston Medical Center NRG Park will rank as a better hotel but for now I can only rate it average overall. The convenient location and size of the suites is nice but the other shortcomings make it a mediocre place to stay.", "offset": [1183, 1310], "date": "2018-09-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "9dd353b8-6b5f-4e90-b06e-0950868cd11b", "sentence": "Nice stay.

Manager does not Respond. I love staying at Mariot Hotels and normally have good or great experiences. However this stay unfortunately ended very unprofesionaly. It began when I checked out of the room on the Friday morning before the start of the Memorial Day weekend. That morning I was involved in a vehicle accident and was very flustered. After checking out I had driven about three hours from the hotel when I realized that I had forgotten something in my room. I checked out at aprox. 1030 am and it was now aprox. 130 pm. I immediately called the hotel and informed them that I left a very important item in my room and I informed them exactly where the item was in the room. It was very visible and difficult to miss in the front room as soon as you opened the door. I was told that housekeeping was still cleaning the room and would locate my item and bring it to lost and found. I would then get a phone call about how and where my item could be mailed to me. Well that phone call NEVER came. I called back the hotel later that evening and was told that I had to call back in the morning. When I called in the morning I spoke with a manager named Michael and informed him how important this item was to me. He assured me that he would look into my lost item with housekeeping and the current guest in the room and get back to me. HE NEVER DID. Over the next few days I spoke with several employees and still no one was able to help me. Now I have worked at a Mariot and know that check in time is 30 pm. If I called at 130 pm when no one was in the room why could not someone just retrieve my item. I also know that if housekeeping finds something they are required to turn it in. So since my item was very easily seen in the front room where is it Springhil. I called the hotel aprox. eight times from Friday to Monday and left several messages for the Manager Michael. I was informed that two different guests had checked in and out of the same hotel room since Friday making it impossible to locate my missing item. I was very upset and frustrated because if my request and problem was addressed properly from my first call I know that my item would have been recovered. This is not the service or run around that I expect from any Mariot. Thanks Springhil Suites. To date Michael has still not called me back. I have now contacted corporate and was given a case number.", "offset": [789, 902], "date": "2019-05-29", "cpt": "2", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "cbe56e81-62e8-4bc9-8c3a-2e33118d208c", "sentence": "Springhil Suites.
