I loved staying on The Queen Mary and enjoying all the history. My husband and I took several tours and they were wonderful. The biggest glitch was dealing with the check in out staff. First off we had booked a Deluxe King Room. After waiting in the long line we headed to our room only to discover it was not a Deluxe King but just a standard room. Back in line I got while my husband waited with the luggage. After another long wait we did get the room we had reserved. I actually thought this had been an honest mistake with the room until I met another couple that the exact same thing happened too. It makes me wonder if a bait and switch is going on with the rooms. The second glitch with check in check out was they charge the parking to the credit card with the room. Well when we got our check out receipt under the bedroom door the night before departure they had not included the parking. We had to get back in the long line to get that fixed so that we could get our car out of the parking lot. The two waiters we had were wonderful. Our house keeper was good. We found the food prices fairly pricey and hard to get into restaurants when we wanted to eat. The ghost tour submarine tour Princess Di exhibit and audio tour were all great.

Glad I tried it. We arrived very late and it was hard to find out how to get in there with our GPS. We called and they walked us through it. lol. We arrived and I was very excited. I have never been on a cruise ship and this was my first taste. I am super picky so I kind of wanted to get a feel. I love that they made this a hotel. I arrived and we went up and walked to the front desk check in. The front desk personnel was very hospitable. She got us on our way rather quickly. We went to our room. heads up. all the halls look exactly the same. We found our room with ease. It was so cute and quaint. Some things looked old to the eye at first glance but they are historical. I carefully put the pillow on the floor so they would not be bothered. There was adequate space for everything. I liked that. The bathroom was more spacious than I had originally thought but the toilet did make me think of a port a potty. Warning. the tub is original from France. It Vs so it is really hard to stand up in at least for me with big feet. I guess most people just soaked in them. Asking for a bath mat will helpThe shower worked well. The toilet was a little hard to flush. The TV was fine but I do not watch tv so I did not mess with it. I kept it on the Ships channel. It was a cute view from our port holes. I could see the sunlight. I was sad I did not see the tour. They have a lot. You get an audio tour when staying but the lady did not remind me when we checked in so I forgot about it. I did however looked around the ship and it is really cool. Even if you do not stay there do look at it. its really cool. I am use to finer hotels and standards but this is historical and I wanted to be part of it. There were little bumps in my stay but I would actually stay here again for a night or two. I know it has a spa even though I did not get to use it. It also has dining but we had made plans elsewhere so unfortunately I did not get to use any of the ships amenitiesI loved the gift shops. I went to two of them. I got nice things. I LOVED that they had a Starbucks on the ship. They do not use the ap. and you do not get points but the price was right and you can not go wrong with Starbucks. I enjoyed myself. Do it. Experience it. Oh just so you know. the elevators are old small and kind of creaky. Be patient. it is all I can say and the Valet was super. I think they needed more employees but the crew never showed it. Their attitude was super and they were fast and sweet. I liked them alotwil want to pay for the valet parking. It is only a couple of dollars more and well worth it. I went around the immediate lot once and could not find anything and I was not about to go through any torture of parking. I think they are the cheapest in LA so take it.

The onboard tours and exhibits are well done but this is not the case for the hotel. There is a difference between original and worn out. Upon arrival we were promptly greeted by the bell staff who took the luggage parked the car and directed us to registration. The check in process went smoothly and the staff was friendly and helpful. All public areas shops bars and restaurants were beautifully decorated. The bell man escorted us to our rooms. Upon arriving at my room we entered only to find someone had already been checked into the room. The bell man took us to the other room and went downstairs to get another room assignment. He promptly returned with a new room for me. The condition of the rooms were a huge disappointment. There was no elegance no beauty in fact nothing was appealing. They rooms were so worn they looked dirty. The clocks in all 3 rooms we had were blinking with the incorrect time and could not be reset. Electrical outlets did not work in 2 of the rooms. The bathrooms were in such bad shape that I did not even want to enter them. We did notice there were signs and placards all around and on the bed pointing out designated Quiet Areas. I had also read other reviews about the thin walls but never imagined it could be as bad as it was. Around 11 pm. I was awaken by the occupants of the next room who proceeded to turn on rap music and have a dance party. They slammed against the walls cursed loudly and were absolutely rude and obnoxious. I immediately called the front desk to have security sent up only to have my call answered by a recording highlighting the onboard tours and then a phone tree. I do not want voicemail when I am calling the front desk. Once I was able to reach a human I explained the situation and was told security would come up and I was asked if I would come to the front desk and they would move me to another room. No offer to send bell staff to help with luggage. After re dressing and re packing I headed downstairs. Security had still not shown up. Once downstairs I found that they had not even been dispatched. I am unsure if they ever went up to the room. I was moved to the bowels of the ship where it appeared quieter until I crawled into bed. I then found the my neighbor next door snored loudly. It was as if I was sleeping in the same bed with him I am not exaggerating. The next morning I overheard his entire conference call something I am sure he would not have been pleased about. We decided to cancel the rest of our stay onboard and checked out. No one asked about our stay or why we were leaving early. I did not want to write a review without speaking with someone so I did ask for the manager on duty. Although she was very polite her expression was not one of caring. In fact she gave excuses for many of the issues. I am attaching a picture of the chipped bathroom tub. I was told that because of the age this is normal wear and tear and it just needed to be filled. I do not think this is normal wear and tear. you decide.

We stayed on the Queen Mary for 1night in mid May. We purchased the 1night stay through Groupon and it roughly came to 212 CAD after the conversion. I emailed the hotel after booking through Groupon to let them know that we would be arriving around 10pm and no to release the room. They got back to me the same day and said to call the hotel upon arrival if our flight was delayed but otherwise everything was fine with the reservation. Upon arriving to the hotel property we were able to find parking quite close to the ship and I believe parking was included in the resort fee of 22 also includes wifi. The way finding signage was quite good and we were able to figure out what level we needed to be on to check in. The front desk staff was very pleasant and the process was very quick. We were given instructions on finding our room and headed there. The room was actually larger than I had expected Standard King. We had 2 portholes that actually opened TV and bathroom. The bathroom has some original fixtures but the hotel has done a nice job of updating without ruining the historical ambiance. At breakfast we went to the Promenade Cafe. We had about a 10 minute wait while they found us a table. The food was average but the service was good. After breakfast we walked around the ship as the guided tours did not start until 120pm and we were planning on leaving before then. Outside it was raining pretty good so there were areas that were closed. The rain also highlighted how many repairs the 80 year old ship requires. There were several buckets catching leaks scattered around. Before we checked out we watched the Queen Mary TV channel in our room where they loop 3 different stories about the Queen Mary. definitely worth watching.

My wife and I had yet another fantastic staycation on the Queen Mary. We really enjoy the history and location of the ship to so much entertainment and attractions. This is the second time we have stayed aboard and not the last. The first time was during the week when we pretty much had the ship to ourselves. This time was Friday and Saturday night. I was expecting heavy crowds but that never happened. We had plenty of space to ourselves and never needed reservations for dinner. Our room was great with an operable porthole that viewed the harbor and downtown Long Beach. There are several options for food aboard the ship from a cafe with Starbucks to a fine dining restaurant. We discovered both Sir Winstons restaurant and The Tea Room on this trip both offer terrific views. will not miss those ever again. We shared a Chateaubriand dinner for two at Sir Winstons and agreed it was the best meal we had had in years. Recommend a dinner jacket for there. The Tea Room serves lunch and specializes in proper British tea service with scones and sandwiches. We both had tea while I had a cured salmon sandwich and my wife had a chicken mango sandwich. Both were really delicious but hers was rich with curry and tasted like an Indian dish called punjabi khadi DeliciousDuring the day we caught the AquaBus passenger ferry over to Shoreline Village 1 each. We walked by the Long Beach Aquarium perused all the boutique touristy shops and discovered many new boating activities like a seaplane tour that takes off and lands from the water. Shoreline Village and The Pike offer dozens of restaurants and activities like boat rentals fishing charters mystery dinner cruises sunset cruises talship cruises and more. Back at the ship we did some window shopping at 4 separate gift shops selling everything from high end clothing to logoed trinkets. We could help but buy a few souvenirs. For entertainment at night on the ship we had the Observation Bar with live music and a piano bar lounge at Sir Winstons. it is also nice to just sit at the benches on the Sun Deck and see the lights across the harbor at The Pike and Shoreline Village. Our room came with a flat screen TV phone and modern amenities but they do a good job of maintaining the historic aspect too. We had an operable porthole that viewed the harbor and downtown Long Beach. Parking is 20 per day and a 15 daily resort fee will get you access to the fitness room WiFi and other stuff. You can still board the ship without staying the night by purchasing boarding vouchers for 15 each. Basically you prepurchase 15 worth of food and drink that you hand over for credit in any restaurant or bar. You can reduce your parking to 7 by having them validate your ticket. The only reason we do not give the Queen Mary a full five star rating is due to minor maintenance issues we encountered. Not a big deal but enough to count. We received exceptional five star service from Tom at Sir Winstons and Steve at The Tea Room.

On the one hand the history was wonderful. It was a privilege to be able to wander the corridors at all hours on this Grand Old Lady who featured so prominently in our history. Late at night early in the morning when it was quiet one could almost expect to see Sir Winston himself turning the corner engrossed in critical conversation that might contribute to turning the tide of the War. Most of the public areas are well maintained perhaps better not to look too closely and were suitable for public touring. I visited every part of the ship I was allowed to access and came away with a much better sense of her scope and of the period she was active. The downside of my visit was the hotel experience. My state room was fine \u2013 not large but then again it \u2019s a ship. \u2013. and I found it to be as advertised. As I was staying in June we were not yet in the grip of the worst of the summer heat although it was already in the 90s that week. The cabin temperature was fine and the bathroom or \u201c head \u201d was perfectly adequate the water did drain slowly from the shower but again it \u2019s a ship. I checked in at midnight \u2013 arriving from Orlando \u2013 and found that there was nowhere to get even a snack. I was told I could call for pizza. After adjusting my expectations \u2013 pizza or nothing I did call for pizza. It was delivered after a 45 minute wait and I was shaking my head the whole time. An international hotel without a 24hour even scaled back snack service let alone room serviceMy bed was comfortable enough but I was disappointed in just how dirty my porthole was. I know these are difficult to keep clean but this one looked not to have been serviced in years. The next unpleasant surprise was how thin the walls really are between rooms. Yes sound travels on a boat of that size and I expected that. I did not expect to be awakened on my second night by the very loud couple \u2013 I will leave the details out next door to me who kept me awake for the next hour until I banged on their door. It was unfortunate that on the third evening we had a fire alarm at about 2 am but it turned out to be nothing and we were all able to go back to sleep after an hour or so. I found the breakfast to be good on the first morning \u2013 a nice variety and attentive service \u2013 so no complaints there. The final problem \u2013 and the largest \u2013 was the parking. The hotel appears to have an arrangement with the permanent carnival next door and there is little parking. One is either forced to valet park which of course costs extra or walk a considerable distance in a darkened pier area back to the hotel. As a single if highly experienced traveller I did not welcome the idea of a long walk in the dark. Full points to the valet staff who when I explained my dilemma let me park in the valet parking area. However this was after wasting about 25 minutes looking for parking and pondering my options. At that point I found myself wishing that I had stayed in a modern hotel and just visited the ship by day. The Queen Mary has a wonderful history and deserves to be honoured. She is a monument to a brave past and could serve a beacon for a hopeful future. However by offering a surprisingly substandard hotel experience the management risks tarnishing her reputation irrevocably. Ownership and management need to be clear on what they want out of the Queen Mary besides money as several of my co reviewers noted. If the ship is to be a proud memorial then let her be so and make her into the destination she is meant to be.", "offset": [2459, 2513], "date": "2018-09-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "adb1000e-19b5-438f-bcd2-4244b9ae4a79", "sentence": "Poor Management Throughout. I have to admit I was very excited about booking a room for a night on the Queen Mary. This was actually supposed to be a highlight of our trip to California and a dream place to stay. That dream quickly was squashed. When checking into the Queen Mary the area around the luxury liner was hosting a concert for a couple of thousand people. It was obvious from the get go they were not prepared as we were forced to circle the area without much direction from people working the event. On our second pass I stopped to get help even though the security there continued to send us around the loop. In chatting with security she wanted to see some documentation showing a reservation. Since we were not expecting to walk into this situation we had nothing. One would expect them to be better prepared with incoming reservations or a way for them to radio and check. But again I highlight the idea of preparation. Once we were through and directed to park in a far out spot even behind employees we made our way to the hotel. Upon checking in we quickly learned they were hosting a high school prom. It would have been nice to have been informed prior to our arrival so we could have potentially changed out schedule. but again that would assume a level or preparation and planning by the QM staff. Our fears on the prom manifested between the event running until after midnight with music heard throughout the liner to teens staying in rooms treating it like a motel and finding all sorts of places to hide and make out around every corner. The cap was the they placed teens staying in rooms throughout the ship and one group was just opposite our cabin. They continued the loudness into the evening up until 2 at least 2 am. We called the front desk to check on the room around 115 am and while they sent someone they did not knock on the room to check to see who had reserved the room. At that point I had given up any help from the QM staff and any chance of sleep. We also had an issue related to directing us to a bus to head over to the bay that never came but I just do not have more energy to relive the very poor experience of the visit. I did speak with James the hotel manager but he basically just said this stuff happens so be it. The best way I can close is that all stays usually end with the check out individual asking how your stay was as they strive to want to know and give their guests the best. The woman checking us out did not even say thanks for staying with us much less inquiring. All in all a big thumbs down.

Also did not enjoy finding out that after checking in around 5 pm that all the areas of interest aboard the ship were closed which really defeats the purpose of actually staying on board and not just visiting.
