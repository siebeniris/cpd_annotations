This is the first time we have stayed at the Element brand of Westin. I have always enjoyed Westin properties so I figured we had give it a go. Overall our stay was very good. Not perfect but very good nonetheless. The Good. The rooms are spacious by NYC standards. Each is equipped with a small kitchen with full sized refrigerator 2 burner stove and microwave. I even has a dishwasher. The refrigerator really came in handy for storing and reheating leftovers which my 14 year old daughter ate for breakfast. Food is expensive even with Groupon and Living Social coupons. so we did not want to waste anything. I would expect if one was staying in NYC for an extended business stay or travelling with family you would find this a bonus. Our room was on the 38th floor rear facing and the view is nice. Front facing I think we would have seen the Empire State Building but our view is not that bad will address this more later. The hotel is eco friendly and has cool toilets that you can do a half flush to save water. Lighting is energy saving fluorescent type. There is a big push to recycle. I applaud their efforts to be as green as they can be. There is a rooftop lounge where if you peek around one corner you can see the top of the Empire State Building. The hotel also offers a happy hour with cocktails and hors dourves but we never went so I can not speak to how good it is. The business center has 4 Mac computers and you can print to a laser printer. The beds live up to the Westin Heavenly Bed standards and were very clean. I own a Tempurpedic so I am a bed snob and these beds were great for inerspring mattresses. Enough said. The location is close to Times Square and the Theatre District. The streets are easy to navigate and I logged a fair amount of mileage on my Fitbit. There are many subway stations within a few blocks of the hotel. There are TONS of restaurants some good some meh within a 10 15 minute walk. The Drama Bookshop is only a block away which was awesome my daughter is really into theatreThe Meh. The hotel offer a free breakfast from 630 930 am weekdays and 7 10 am weekends. It is free so that should give you some idea that it is not a Sunday brunch at the Ritz. They do offer egg white breakfast sandwiches and omelettes stuffed into pitas kind of an odd combo. Both are bland but are better with salt and pepper found in your kitchen. There are also bagels croissants small doughnuts juice and coffee. BTW there is a single cup coffee maker in the room but while the breakfast has half and half the rooms have chemical Coffee Mate. Ew. While the rooms are spacious they are very utilitarian and lack warmth. The flooring is vinyl laminate and everything is very sterile looking. No bigie for us but if you want charm this is not the place for you. As others have said the neighborhood is not the greatest. I did not feel unsafe but being 1 block from the Port Authority bus station there were some interesting characters around. One night I swear I saw a guy taking a leak in a corner with his back the the street and two hookers almost got in a fist fight outside the bus station over territory. The hotel is on the northern border of the Garment District so if you are into buying fabric there are a zillion stores within a few blocks. For the money I saved though I can put up with the local color. Also people have complained about slow elevators. We never had a problem getting an elevator however being on the 38th floor sometimes we literally stopped at every floor especially going down during busy times. A minor annoyance but just allow time if you have somewhere to be. The BAD. My ONLY complaint and to be honest the Element has no control over it. is there is a buidling going up right behind the notel and they are working on the floors adjacent to ours. During the day I have no problem with the work noise but these jackasses started hammering away at 7 am ruining any chance I had to sleep in. In retrospect I probably should have asked for another room but we just dealt with it. Hopefully construction will be completed soon and then you only have the normal NYC noise to deal with.

It was cleaned earlier each day after that. The water in the shower was cold or luke warm. My daughter would always shower first and sometimes she had warm water but for the most part in was on the very cool side. it is nice to have complimentary breakfast. It was fine.

Bites continued and spread out onto my arms I asked for a refund in the morning and hotel insisted that since they had changed my room for me I could n\u2019t get one. Finally they agreed after I showed them photos of my legs but I am yet to have received written confirmation of this. I got home today and my legs are swollen and itchy.

With the proximity to Times Square being just a few blocks away along with access to mostly every train you need makes the location a definite choice. When I arrived at the hotel I was greeted with a warm welcome and smiling faces. Flying in from LA and taking the red eye I knew that my room would not be ready right away. However LIz at the front desk was super accommodating and allowed me to change in their restroom got my bags checked for me and offered me breakfast in their dining area before I headed out to some morning meetings. Once my room was ready they notified me and I could not have been more pleased. The room was very spacious clean and eco friendly. I had a kitchenette with a really nice size refrigerator which allowed me to stock it with snacks and drinks for the 4 days I was going to be in town. Also loved the water filter that was hooked up to the faucet in the kitchenette area. Native New Yorkers love NYC water. The desk area was spacious and a perfect size for me to set up my laptop and mouse and take care of business without feeling smothered. The bedroom was separate from the living and kitchen space so it gives you are a really great feeling of a studio one bedroom apt that you would rent in NYC. Also the room had two televisions which made relaxing a lot more enjoyable one in the living room and the other in the bedroom. One of the best perks about staying at the hotel besides having a kitchenette that you can stock 7 11 is right across the street is the complimentary breakfast that they serve. Their complimentary continental breakfast is located on the lobby level and hits the spot. The selection is great as well from eggs and bacon to pancakes and french toast to bagels and cereral to yogurt oatmeal and muffins and not let us not forget the coffee tea and juice station. One of the staff members working the dining area named Juan Carlos was awesome as well. I woke up late one morning and arrived as they were breaking down the stations. He offered me take what was still available and went to the back to get me some milk for my cereal and coffee and invited me to sit and enjoy my breakfast while they broke down the stations. Thanks Juan Carlos. That coffee and bagel chased down by some Raisin Bran was priceless for me that morningOveral the staff was really friendly and made me feel welcome the whole four days I was in town.

I will list them for you bc I would n\u2019t want to anyone else to waste 42550 night at Christmas time on this hotel. Never been more disappointed and I travel every week. 1. Overboked and under staffed. They have known for MONTHS that December around the Holidays was a crazy crazy time. Not enough towels employees elevators housekeeping and front desk. They could care les2. 30 minutes for elevators in the morning and around 530pm. Took stairs from the 37th flow. Insane. 3. Did I mention NO TOWELS. Pillow cases dirty. Never bright new ones or replenished towels. 4. I checked in at 9 am understand that check in time is at 3 pm. did n\u2019t get in room until 430 5pm5. Breakfast non edible. Cereal and milk were good. Crazy insane and just a circus. 6. Line for help or assistance at the front desk was INSANE. Could not get through on the phone EVER 7. 2. THE ELEVATORS are the worst ever. Felt bad for housekeeping. They could n\u2019t clean rooms or replenish linens and towels. bc there was no service elevator and they would give up their space on elevators for customers therefore elevator stopped at every floor bc housekeeping staff were trying to get to their floors to complete their cleaning services. Positive. The beds were comfortable.", "offset": [122, 235], "date": "2019-12-18", "cpt": "6", "category": "general"}, {"id": 66, "uid": "9d266f63-5e03-49b3-ac7f-e946ebd0999c", "sentence": "2nd stay at element times square.

We staid at the hotel during Christmas. Good location you can walk to almost all the must sees like Central park Times Square and Rockefeller centre. The breakfast buffet was included but if you are looking to have breakfast in a quiet romantic setting forget it it was really hectic. They change some of the breakfast items each day we stayed so there would always something new. Staff is very friendly and helpful especially James of the front desk.

Clean friendly and nice. Loved the location. Centrally located to most of the hot spots in NYC. everything pretty much within walking distance. Lots of places to eat and shop. Concierge was Angela. Super friendly and very helpful with the bus tour we wanted to take. The complimentary breakfast is AWESOME. Lots of food varieties. cereals oatmeal yogurt parfait bar hot food including pancakes potatoes sausage and egg dishes. Lots of choices of beverages as well. Our room was like a mini studio apartment equipt with a full working fridge stovetop and everyday kitchen appliances. We arrive very early in the morning as we were coming in from the west coast. The hotel was booked the night before and the staff tried their best to get us a room as soon as possible. However they did not communicate with us very well in the beginning and when we first checked in they did not even have our reservation. The one biggest bummer was the elevator situation. We were on one of the higher floors and sometimes it would take us almost 20 minutes to get to the lobby. They might want to consider certain sets of elevators only going to certain floors.", "offset": [323, 346], "date": "2020-02-21", "cpt": "6", "category": "general"}, {"id": 69, "uid": "46e8a1d2-e2df-43e1-9abb-d27a729ec592", "sentence": "I generally like this hotel but having stayed here consecutively on an annual basis I have kinda seen this place age.
