Location was good. 15 miles south of la jola town center and a block or two away from the ocean where the surf is good. The hotel is very clean mattress and box springs both bagged. They clean the carpets on a regular basis. All furniture was reasonably clean. The staff were all very nice and helpful. The breakfast is mostly pastry toast and some fruit apples and oranges. They have a heated pool which is comfortable to swim in and a jacuzi.
