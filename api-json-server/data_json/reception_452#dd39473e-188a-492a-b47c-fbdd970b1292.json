We decided on the Paradisus for a 9 night stay leaving out of Vancouver with WestJet Vacations. Total cost per person was approximately 240 with a hotel stay over in Calgary while en route. The hotel itself was built in the early 90s and consists of 5 pyramids. Pyramid 3 is the center hub with all the night life and restaurants. We stayed in Pyramid 1 following the recommendations of other travellers for some peace and quiet. Pyramid 5 on the other end appeared to be where those who opted for the Royal Service resided. We were picked up by a shuttle which was quite convenient and dropped off at the hotel. Check in was fine with a welcome cocktail of our choice offered. Definitely a nice start. The Room We had an ocean view junior suite with a large balcony and small hot tub on the outer deck. The room was spacious but dated. All the furniture was well worn and could have benefited from replacement. The bed was slanted on both sides which had us rolling towards the edges when we slept. Our final two nights involved a water leak coming from the floor above us that ran down through the light fixture in our bathroom. It made for quite a mess as the water would collect in the suspended ceiling and then drip down all over the floor. Staff did what they could and offered us a room change but given the late hour the fact that it eventually tapered off and we only had one more night before departure we decided to stick it out. Second night was a bit wetter and we were told that the water had to do with a leak in the upper suites shower. I think we may have taken them up on the room change had we known the problem was not fixed. Regardless the staff were great and very apologetic. They supplied us with extra towels to mop up and all was good. The Timeshare Pitch We were prepared for this and know it is very common. We were offered a free massage a half price tour and a bottle of tequila to attend never did get the tequila tho. We toured the property and were informed of the various properties around the world that are part of Melia resorts. It was informative but not nearly enough to motivate us to make a decision right then whether or not we wanted to spend 500 without doing any research on our own. We asked for a few days to look into things ourselves prior to making a decision but that is not how it is done. The Food Paradisus has multiple a la carte restaurants. We visited them all. Again service was excellent but the food at least for us was simply average. We noted that with the exception of the buffet all food was served in small portions so consider ordering a bit more than you normally would to share. Food was readily available either by dining within the hotel or ordering room service. The Pools and Beach Beautiful pools that were well maintained. At time it was a bit difficult to get a seat as there was a common practice of people staking out their territory in the morning and then not returning until late morning or early afternoon to take up their seats. It was posted that belongings left for longer than 30 minutes would be removed but I had imagine this would be difficult to enforce. With a little footwork though you will be able to find a spot either by the pools or beach. Again we found the service very good. One thing we noticed about the beach was that it was windy and the water quite rough. It had been red flagged for swimming a number of times. I am not sure if this is characteristic to this side of the island or if it simply was the time we were there but we did not experience even one day where the water was calm and the winds were not heavy. The Final Say Overall and almost without exception the service was excellent. The staff were kind and cordial and very accommodating. The pool and beach were beautiful and appearance and decoration of the hotel in the evening was beautiful. Unfortunately for us the room quality and food fell short. In retrospect the price paid for the package just did not seem to be a good deal. At 25 per person per night I had consider simply getting a room at one of the many hotels up and down the strip and spending a bit more time exploring and dining out.", "offset": [3730, 3785], "date": "2015-01-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "024facfb-0098-482e-9857-2b39868775be", "sentence": "Info for RCI members.

The pool service was top notch. Salvador the bartender is second to none. Food was just average but the drinks were top shelf. Chips salsa and guac were awesome though.

All our restaurant reservations and always visited us everyday to make sure everything was going well and if we needed anything. We could also call him if we needed anything. The pool area in this section is just for adults. Carlos took very good care of us. You can ask for as many beach towels as you need they have suntan lotion aloe vera so do not bring any. The bali beds in this section is no charge so well worth upgrading because coco loco will charge you 115 a day in peak season. Plus the Royal service side has its own restaurant that offers very good food for breakfast and lunch and food on the beach if you like. The beach is huge. and lots of chairs and grass hut umbrellas as well. no matter what time of the day you can find something. The atmosphere at this resort has a lot of plants inside which are very pretty. Market grill was our favorite restaurant. They are a Brazilian menu they just keep the food coming till you tell them to stop. Our last night we ate by the pool. They had pasta and all kinds of other stuff but it was all good.

Love love love this place. We were looking for a place to celebrate our 1 year Anniversary back in October and this place was highly recommended by a friend. It exceeded our expectations for an all inclusive resort by far. We typically avoid the college party crowd and while we love kids we tend to avoid them on vacation too sorry not sorry so we really enjoyed the royal service. Our personal concierge Eduardo was fantastic. He made our trip extra special with little touches each time we returned to our room rose petals champagne personalized notes etc. He also did a wonderful job making reservations for dinner massages and polside Bali beds. The rooms show a little wear and tear but overall the design is lovely and our room was kept super clean. Our shower leaked on the first day but we just mentioned it to Eduardo and it was fixed by the time we went to get ready for dinner. They keep your bar stocked with the liquor of your choice and tons of drinks and snacks and the royal service lounge was great for a quick bite of you ever had the opportunity to get hungry. I hated that it was located in the basement while they renovated the real area though. The food in the specialty restaurants was amazing but the buffet was. meh at best. If i had to eat there for every meal my review rating might be vastly different. Decent entertainment beautiful clean beach and the pool was everything. Joel works polside and was wonderful excellent fast service. Our only complaint is that we did not know the royal service area would be under construction during our stay. It was well done and we barely noticed but every now and then there was noise from the construction. Regardless we enjoyed our stay so much we have already booked our next trip back.

The restaurants last year very full of all types of food and different choices daily. This year it was horrible the food was nasty and all out in trays as a buffet and any sit down took forever and service was forever. Several times orders were wrong and never filled drink or brought drinks. Three different places we just ended up leaving.

This was our first trip to Mexico and our first time experiencing an all inclusive resort. If we \u2019re being honest we were a little sceptical about all inclusive. We were n\u2019t sure what to expect and we thought it might feel a bit uncomfortable to have someone wait on us all day long. All these thoughts aside we still wanted to try out this beautiful resort for our honeymoon and looking back we are glad we made this decision. The resort was beyond beautiful and the staff members were ever so kind to us. They were patient with us as we learned how all inclusive worked and what was available to us in Royal Service. As a side note one of the big takeaways was the fact that staff members did not have their hands out asking for a tip whenever they served us or assisted us. We heard from a couple who we met that this is one of the big reasons why they love Paradisus Canc\u00fan. They \u2019ve had bad experiences at other resorts where staff members expected a tip for every act of service. With that being said if tips were given to staff members they were very appreciative and respectful. The work ethic of every staff member baffled us as we watched them go from cabana to cabana in the burning heat assisting guests who were relaxing in the shade by the polside. When you passed a staff member in the hallway or around the resort it was not uncommon to receive a smile and a friendly hola buenos d\u00edas or buena noches. In addition to our comments on staff members a few names come to mind which we hold in high regard. Everyone was very kind to us and accommodating therefore we will mention a few names here and reiterate our appreciation to the staff of Paradisus Canc\u00fan. Hector. A very kind server who transformed a simple breakfast at NAOS into a wonderful memory of Paradisus Canc\u00fan. Aurturo. Our butler who was always there if we needed him even when his shift was ended. Oscar. Our kind polside Concierge with a sense of humour. Martin. Our server who was energetic kind and fun. Valeria. Another very kind server and polside concierge with an amazing work ethic. In regard to the food we had our favourite restaurants and ones which were a little lower on our list based upon our personal preference. The restaurants which we went to during our stay are as follows Fuego NAOS Mole Bana The Market Grill Vento and Enso. Our favourite was to our surprise Mole. The delicious food fun atmosphere and authentic Mexican experience was so exciting and memorable. A few of the nice perks included with Royal Service is the priority in making reservations for restaurants not having to bring your wallet to restaurants receiving exceptional treatment and having a butler to assist you. The majority of Paradisus staff spoke really good English. However there was one housekeeper that did not speak English at all but we were able to get by with simple hand gestures smiles and head nods. Final remarks regarding our stay in Royal Service at the Paradisus Canc\u00fan. We would like return to this resort and stay in Royal Service again as soon as possible. When we return we ca n\u2019t wait to be reacquainted with the staff who made our stay 10x more enjoyable.", "offset": [920, 1026], "date": "2018-11-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "7e02692f-1498-443e-a2d3-7d4986916510", "sentence": "Destination wedding.

I quickly fell in love with this hotel. It is a beautiful resort filled with great people who work so hard to endsure you have a memorable experience. As we were able to do this trip with out kids we chose the Royal Service. I can not say enough about everyone who works in Royal Service. From your dedicated Butler to the people that set up and break down the private area food all day every day these people were amazing. We had a wonderful experience thanks to Rosana who made sure we had her on WhatsAp from check in and tended to whatever we needed. Reservations pool or beach bali beds reservations and more Rosana handled everything flawlessly and with a smile. She was amazing and absolutely helped our vacation go to another level. There is a lot of dining and knightlife options. The Spa is an incredible experience and yes it is expensive but you are on vacacation you budgeted for it and it is worth it. They were professional and the facility is well designed. I enjoed the gym as well. There was just enough. it is clean and seemed well maintained. The pool and beach areas were really nice and staff from the Royal Service Pool to Coco Beach were alwaghs A Game. Do the beach Bali Bed at least one. it is so worth it especially if you have great weather and calm waves. I really could go on much longer but I think the point is made. This is a perfect place for famalies or adults only. I will close with Tempo. This is not part of the All Inclusive plan which I give 5 stars to as well this is seperate. Tempo is a 5 Diamond AAA rated resteraunt that take the dining experience to another level. This place and the staff were knock out. The chef is brilliant and creative.

I was told there that the Paradisus is 35yo and is about to close for a 1 yr or more renovation. I would have liked to have known that ahead of time. I am going to make what could be a LONG review into one as short as possible. The resort hotel is huge consisting of five pyramid sections though you will only be in the main one and the one with your room. A C throughout is lacking and can be uncomfortable even in the restaurants. We used the royal service which permitted almost all food and drink and private pool and beach area so that was a good thing for the most part. However the pool area was marked non smoking but the same daily set of a holes thought they were above it and were not stopped by pool staff. Sodas were mostly zero calorie and served barely cool we ALWAYS had to ask for ice. Even regular canned Coke did not taste quite right though. In house restaurants disappointed the morning juices seemed watered and the food throughout was flavorless. Restaurants in Cancun were much better but were no bargain. Our royal service jr suite was passable but not memorable. The 42in LCD tv had 40 channels but only 3 were English speaking so I was thrilled that my Fire TV stick with Dish Network ap worked there though I did accidentally leave the remote there which no one contacted me about so that is a 30 unforced error. There were popular water sports available right there on the beach but at stupid greedy pricing parasail 65ea jetski 75ea for 12 hr. People they will only drop the pricing to reasonable levels if you refuse to support those ridic prices. Tips the later you book the better the pricing. Change about 75 to Pesos if you plan to do light shopping in the area. Also anything of any value to you must be stored in the rooms safe or your locked luggage. We had something of minor value go missing after our first maid service so that was another disappointment. It was a decent trip overall but I would not return there though it may be better after renovations and they are building a new Paradisus on the north end so maybe that l be better too.", "offset": [1066, 1124], "date": "2019-05-25", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "2fbecaf1-715c-4a97-9bea-274829d049f2", "sentence": "Club Melia at Paradisus Overview. My wife and I spent a week at Paradisus in mid June. Overall we had a great experience. Prior to booking I searched for details related to the differences between Club Melia Royal Service and the standard Paradisus. Since I was unable to find a lot of clarifying info I assume others may also be curious about the differences. So I hope my experience helps. its a long read. I would like to point out that the positives DID out weigh the negatives even though for transparency there were some detailed negatives which I included. Also my most recent all inclusive comparison is with Bahia Principes Don Pablo Luxury collection in both the DR and Cancun. These are very different style resorts and there are different things that both BP and Paradisus do a little better than the other. Lastly I read a lot about Cancun safety before going. I am happy to state that we felt safe our entire trip and there were tons of families in the resort and throughout the Hotel Zone with small kids. During our week we were not privy to any negative reports of crime. We have been traveling to Cancun for over 20 years and the only difference was that we stayed in the Hotel Zone HZ and no longer ventured into the downtown area like in the years past. We did not notice any increased police or military presence in the HZ. This may have been different near the nightlife or in Playa de Carmen. Differences between classifications Paradisus standard hotel bookings. In simple terms the entire resort is Paradisus there are 5 attached buildings Pyramids. The center building 3 has most of the administrative entertainment shops and restaurants. Everyone has access to resources located in the common areas. Even though I refer to Paradisus as the standard hotel type of booking it is still very nice. Its like calling the entire resort a premium. Club Melia Timeshare units. This area is located in building 1 and has access to everything that you would get by booking at Paradisus. There are only very minor differences. I found that the room was the same size but contained a small cook top and cabinets with a full set of dishes and pots for cooking. These were not used due to the all inclusive feature of the resort. Our room also contained a Jacuzi tub on the balcony that was also not used. If anything I felt that the additional cabinets and counter just took up additional space in the room. But not an issue. As you can see in our pictures the room was okay. It was not too old but definitely did not feel modern. CM also provided discounts to the Bali beds which was the best perk that we found. There was also an exclusive section of the beach that was marked just for CM members. Since we were in the CM section booked through RCI. we also had a personal concierge and separate check in area. Our understanding was that the concierge was there to assist us with our stay and to book services. Royal Service. This area like CM is located in a separate building 5. The opposite end away from CM. Access to building 5 required key access. It also has a private section of beach and separate adult only pool with Bali beds. Also there is no charge to the RS members for Bali beds. We only looked over to this area and it seemed nice and much quieter than the rest of the resort. RS has access to all of the same restaurants but adds one additional one for lunch and breakfast. We understood that it also provided 50 minutes of daily Spa access. I could see the value in RS if you could get it for a good price. Pros Great location in the HZ on a very nice section of beach that is close to external activities and shoping Smaller resort in comparison to BP. Paradisus is easily walkable from end to end. there is no need for shuttle carts The majority of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Service was always prompt and the resort was always clean and safe. Pools there are lots of lounge chairs and palapas which provide shade. There are also a lot chairs and palapas at the beach which is a big plus. The pool is large and has a lot space. Even though there were a lot of people over the weekend it never felt too crowded. Seating is spaced out to provide a relative amount of privacy. This is not like a cruise ship where you are elbow to elbow with your neighbor. Bars Drinks very good service and quality options. Many brand names were available even at the standard Paradisus level. This is much better than other AIs. The slight negative is the bars did not have menus posted with ideas about different drinks. So while the bartenders could make just about anything you had to kinda know what you wanted. The premium bottles which were an upgraded charge were truly premium. As an example Johnny Walker was available in Red and Black labels. But the Blue label was an upcharge. This may have been different in RS Bali beds we got hooked. We used Bali beds 6 days. They were worth every penny. what is really good is that there are a lot of them and you can select your location based on your preference. For example some faced the beach and others faced the pool so you could watch your kids. Yery in the bed registration was great to work with. We booked directly through him. One day we also got the seafood package with the bed which was amazing. It included a bottle of sparkling wine two lobsters octopus and more shrimp than we could eat. Food overall the food was good. I do not recall anything special that stood out. We ate at 3 reservation restaurants the buffet Market Grill Bana Blue Agave Sunset Grill and Neos. Blue Agave was the best. We did find that many of the restaurants had the same or similar items. For example I am pretty sure the risotto at the reservation restaurant and buffet were the same. Many of the restaurants are situated around a single backend kitchen. Regarding the buffet there were a lot of options but it was not expansive. Kid Friendly We did not have kids in our group but the entire resort is very kid friendly. The exception is the adults only section. The kids seemed to like that you could use floats in the pools. The Ave Bar which was a great location for just hanging out was a favorite spot for kids even late into the evening. No Smoking can not say how good this was. There was only one open air bar area that you could in. The rest of the resort was smoke free. Plus PlusCons here are just a few things that I thought could have been better. Check out. We checked out at 7AM and had to use the main lobby on Saturday morning. I guess expected a little more. The guy who checked us out asked for our room number and then told me its done. Those were his words its done. I kinda expected a thanks for staying or we look forward to seeing you again at the end. It just soured our exit. Information sharing Occasionally we felt like we got the runaround. For example I inquired about getting a taxi twice and was told it was easy and when I was ready come back and they would have a taxi pull up. I came back 30 minutes later and requested the taxi. A call was placed and we were told to proceed to the entrance and there would be a guy there to assist and the taxi would be there shortly. At the Club Melia area. We waited 15 minutes in the heat. No taxi and no guy. It was also not totally clear where to go and where to wait. Just around the corner. The person who originally helped us walked by and noticed that the taxi had not come. They pressed a button to call a taxi and indicated that there was one just over there at the stand and it would be over in just a minute. They left and the taxi never came. We waited another 20 minutes outside in the heat with out a taxi. We then left and walked to the main lobby and asked for a taxi. Its much busier at the main lobby So the bell hop that asked for a taxi walked away. While we walked away someone else walked up and asked for a taxi and the next hop called for a taxi. 5 minutes later a taxi arrived and we were told it was not for us but for the people behind us. He would have to call us our taxi. This is not big deal and I assume a lot is lost in translation. its just an example. Another example was when we ordered a fresh coconut. I went to the Cocos bar and asked about the coconut. I was told there was an upcharge. I asked how much and the guy said 8 and turned away started do other stuff. It took a while for him to turn back around and ask if I wanted one. Maybe 5 minutes. Like he was surprised when I said yes. The I found out why. He had to get me to fill out a charge ticket get it to his manager to check my info in the system. Them go get a coconut and then do the prep of cutting the coconut. it made sense after the fact. The coconut process was a lot of work that he did not want to do. I see why he hoped I just went away when he told me I had to pay for it. Restaurant Availability There are some gaps in the middle of the day when there are no restaurants open or at least no one is able to direct you to one that is open. Staff appears to float between locations. So they may be working at the pool grill during the middle of the day and have to transition to the buffet at the evenings. Several times because of the shift the Sunset Grill was closing and the other restaurants had not opened. They would also run out of burgers which were the best things at the Grill and say that they were closing in 30 minutes and were not making anymore. The same was true for the Nespreso bar great that it exists but the hours seemed wrong. It was only open from 7 10am and then 3 6pm. Call me lazy but it was a little hard to make by 10 am. The guy who operated it was great and he did not set the hours. On a positive note the Blue Agave taco place was open late until I think 4 am. All in all there are about 9 restaurants which seem like a lot. But one is 5 star and you have to pay. Another is exclusive for RS members. 3 are only by reservations at night. Which means during the day there are gaps when there are none were open. Air Conditioning Most areas are not A C This is similar to most Caribbean resorts that I have stayed. But more areas here just seemed hot even at night. Yes it is June but the temperature was in the high 80s. In the Ave Bar there are open windows which allow in really good air flow. However you have to stand in front of the windows. two feet over on the recliner there is no breeze. One night we had a reservation at the Brazilian steakhouse. Its open air. We were sat near the kitchen and I had to cut dinner short because of the heat. A few of the restaurants have AC but there are limited other places other than the stores that are cool. Maintenance the entire resort was very clean. But there are places where it shows its age. While we were there we noticed that someone cut their foot on loose jagged tiles in a section of the pool. They promptly closed the area and started the repair. Also in building 1 a section of the glass atrium broke and feel about 70 feet to the bridge walkway and garden area below in the center of the building. We were on the side but the caretaker in the pool had to run for cover to hide from falling glass. Thankfully there is not a lot of guest in that area during the middle of the day. In comparison with BP we noticed more wear and tear. Concierge We were assigned a personal concierge prior to our arrival. We were excited because we had a similar experience at BP and loved it. However we found our contact not really helpful. A couple weeks before we received an email regarding our upcoming trip and were asked if we were celebrating anything. We were traveling for our 19 year anniversary and let them know that the date was 2 weeks prior to our trip due to scheduling. When we checked we were told that we needed to next meet with our personal contact to go over our benefits and all of the resort features. We checked in at 10 am and was told the contact would be available at noon at the main lobby. Again no specific place just in the lobby. We went to find food but after asking a few people it seemed like we had just missed everything. Each time we told to check a spot that was just around the corner. At 5 to 12 we went back to inquire about our personal contact and someone pointed us to their supervisor. We were informed that they were not going to be available until 2 pm. At this point we were offered the hospitality room to change into shorts and to shower. See my other point about the lack of cool places to hang out at. At 145 we came back and asked where we could find our contact. We were told to wait around the corner until 2 pm. At this point It appeared that we were disturbing irritating the Russian lady at the CM desk in the main lobby in building 5. We waited until 230 and never saw our contact. So we left. We were in directly across from the info desk so I assume they were happy when they saw us leave. It kinda spoiled our check in process. The next day we asked about our contact and was told to locate her in the main lobby. When we met the contact she was pleasant but wanted to book us on excursions or a time share sales pitch. We were asked again if we were celebrating anything and we stated the same about our anniversary. It was never acknowledged. We were also told we could make 4 reservations with the restaurants. Our contact called to book one place for that evening. When we asked about the others she said that the people on the phone were busy and did not want to wait for us to figure out what we wanted. So they could be booked later and she would let us know. We were told we could also call 0 to ask about the bookings or make them ourselves. The next day notes were placed under our door that we had two more reservations. In the end we got 3 of 4. Honestly I felt like I had wasted several hours over two days chasing after our concierge only for them to be little to no help. Maybe we just got a bad one or maybe I was having a bad day but this is not what I expected. This was polar opposite from what I experienced at BP. As far as personal service BP won hands down. Our concierge experience here was a zero. We just avoided it for the rest of the week since it seemed she just wanted to sell us something else we were wasting her time. do not go to the Royal Service area if you are not in RS Mid day we took an hour long walk down the beach. The first access area back to the resort is though the RS pool. So we took the shortcut from the beach through RS back into the resort. It was hot and we were tired so when I passed the bar I asked the bartenders if I could have a carton of water. He said no he could only give me water from the larger bottle because we were not RS. I get it and I suppose I should not have asked but the response was quite embarrassing. It was water not alcohol. I guess from my expression he changed his mind and gave me the carton there are no individual plastic bottles at the resort. Water is available in paper cartons or from a large water cooler type jug in bulk. There are also glass bottles of water similar to an old school coke bottle in the rooms. He said he would do me a favor this one time which was even more frustrating. We never went back near the RS area again. Despite the service blights that took me by surprise overall we were happy with the resort. There were just a few things that could have been better. The vast majority of the staff were great and promoted a positive experience. I felt it important to share some of the negative details so that those booking would have an honest appraisal. Would I book again yes. Overall the positives outweighed the negatives. After reading numerous reviews Pos and Neg I can totally see some truth and some pettiness in all of them.

This week I was celebrating my anniversary at El Paradisus Cancun and my experience was at another level. The service was of the highest quality they made me feel the most beloved guest for everyone and most importantly they made my wife feel like the queen she is to me. Since we arrived at the Luis hotel at the front desk he was very helpful and attentive. In the restaurant area I want to recognize Dania and gaudencio and abraham at the Mole restaurant Roberto in Palapa Gemma and David in the Spa area and last but not least Jorge and Hugo from the pool area. These people made me spend the best vacations of my life at all times they acted as owner employees. I want to congratulate management because when people work in such a passionate place it is because they are inspired to give the same treatment they receive from their managers.

My wife and I recently spent a week February 22 29 at the Paradisus Cancun. We were somewhat wary of the resort due to reviews touting their Royal Service which is an expensive add on and other reviews where people could not get dinner reservations. We did not pay for Royal Service and frankly it was the best money we did n\u2019t spend. The resort was very nice we had zero problems making reservations and ate at each of the restaurants that were available to \u201c non royals \u201d. If we did n\u2019t have a reservation we just walked up and asked when we could be seated. This may have been due to our only needing a table for two but even when we called a day or so before we got the restaurant and reservation time we wanted. The first night after leaving Vento we noticed people dancing in the Avenue bar with headphones on. No music \u2026 just people dancing. The headphones were lit red green or blue. It looked like an episode of Black Mirror. So we walked over and it was a silent discoth\u00e8que. So we joined and danced for about an hour or so. It was great fun and too bad it \u2019s only on Saturday nights. There were two DJs competing for the crowd to change their color which brought a different DJ selection. Again excellent idea. Other than the usual towels reserving loungers early in the morning everything else was fine. Breakfast was great including mimosas. We loved the tacos at Blue Agave. Not sure why there were so many negative reviews of their tacos but we thought they were good it was empty for lunch and they make a great margarita. As others have posted the rooms could use an update but we had really nice weather and spent little time in the room other than sleeping. The only thing we did n\u2019t care for was the non stop pounding techno music at the main pool and on the beach. It was so loud on the beach that it drowned out the sound of the sea which in Cancun is hard to do. But the resort is large and there are at least two places we found where the music was barely audible. So all in all we liked the resort had a really nice time and did n\u2019t miss the Royal Service. One last thing. not sure what the deal was with the falcon that the handler had on their arm every day. Nobody approached for pictures etc. Just this huge falcon sitting on it is handlers arm making the rounds by the pool. I would think a bird less menacing would have been more appropriate for photos.", "offset": [107, 280], "date": "2020-03-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "d067db7e-621a-45eb-816f-b69611dc0feb", "sentence": "Do Not Stay Here. Physically Restrained from Leaving. In January we paid in full 240 for 2 rooms for 4 nights at the Paradisus Canc\u00fan March 17 21 through Bokitcom. We decided to extend our trip for 1 more night March 21 22 and booked that night through the Melia website. We arrived on March 17 and were not informed of any issues with payment for our stay. We stayed the night of March 17 and at multiple times that afternoon and the next day the keys to our rooms were deactivated. No one said anything about any issue with payment when reactivating keys. Finally in the afternoon of March 18 the keys were deactivated again. I went down to the front desk and had the key to my room reactivated \u2014 no one said anything about payment issues. Several minutes later my wife went down to have the key to her room reactivated and for the first time the front desk stated that the stay reserved through Bokit had not been paid to the hotel and that we would have to pay the 240 again or leave the property. This obviously left a very bad impression upon us. Because we had paid for 1 night through the Melia website not a part of the Bokit dispute and only stayed at the property for 1 night we decided to relocate to another resort. When trying to exit the property with our bags the bellmen physically blocked our exit and stated that we would not be allowed to leave unles we went to the front desk. After arguing with the bellmen for several moments I returned to the front desk. I informed the woman at the front desk Alma that we were leaving as requested. Stunningly Alma informed me that if we wanted to leave we had to pay for another night at the hotel. I explained to her again that since we had already paid for 1 night through the Melia website and only stayed for 1 night we were even. She then had to go speak to management for approximately 30 minutes about my request to leave. Once she finally came back she told me that management had agreed to let me leave but that I would have to pay for a 78 bottle of wine from dinner the night before. This was a surprise since this is supposed to be an all inclusive resort and our waiter never mentioned any upcharge for the wine. After paying for the wine the bellmen were kind enough to let us physically leave the property on foot. Melia knew of payment issues with Bokit well before our arrival and failed to inform us or other guests instead letting their guests stay and then demanding payment in return for being allowed to leave.
