The metal bed frame was too large for the mattress it sat on which resulted in me tripping twice on the bed frame. The desk was broke and had nails that were sticking out. These things were noticed during check in however given it was only adults in the room and it was only one night we figured we could survive. Sadly the situation became worst. At 2 am we noticed the sink was leaking. We called regarding this and someone from maintenance came up to fix it. The worst came in the morning when the toilet almost OVERFLOWED. Upon going downstairs to speak with a manager and request that the toliet issue be addressed so that we could get ready to leave the matter appeared to be of minimum importance. I was told that someone would come to address the issue and we were offered a later check out time. No ONE came to the room to address the bathroom prior to our departure.

Let me add that I was staying at this hotel under my relatives family discount so I did n\u2019t want to complain but this was totally unacceptable. How does this get overlooked if the room gets cleaned inspected before guest are checkEd in. I spoke with Front desk agent Briana who was very polite expressed her concern of the situation. She offered to move my room which was fine. However I expressed to her that I had about 45 minutes to get dressed in hopes of attending my event on time so this was really a huge inconvenience not to mention I was pretty freaked out because I had no idea what fell out of the ceiling touching my skin Initially. I asked Briana could she make sure I was moving to a nice clean room could she accommodate a room upgrade for my inconvenience. Which I did n\u2019t think was unreasonable considering.

I said to Stephen this has nothing to do with money. I asked that Stephen come to my room to look at the hole in the ceiling the huge dust particles falling from it. He said that he would not be coming up but he will send an engineer. Who never came. I expressed to him that I would like to complete an incident report I was told that he was not going to Assist me with completing a report.
