This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and although there have never been any issues or problems we just have not been blown away by the whole experience and have just found it to be okay. There are some great aspects of this hotel such as Excellent staff. Friendly polite helpful use their common sense and bring a good vibe to the place. Location good. Roms We found ours to be adequate but a little on the small size. We could have also done with more plug sockets so that we did not have to move the iron or have to awkwardly balance the kettle at the edge of a table or remove other devices so that we could use or own. The trim around the ceiling joins in coving very poor finish. visible plaster bodged on and painted over. which at one point bits if it flaked off and fell on me. Quality of slep good. Pol too small and slightly uncomfortable when more than a few people are using it. Breakfast amazing selection worth visiting for this alone. The german bar was a nice touch however the customer was shocking. Upon arrival to the hotel we were told they were full. After waiting for a couple to leave we were then seated. Not being happy with our table we went for a wander and found lots of free tables at the other end of the restaurant. Beers were amazing but pricey see below. Food looked great but lacked any flavour. Our order was wrong no apology. however they did correct it. The prices in the hotel we found to be really expensive considering.

We stayed at the Four Seasons next door. Dinner is not good good in this restaurant. We arrived in an almost empty restaurant. We ordered appetizers and a main course. First the main course arrived. We informed the lady that our main course arrived and she apologised immediately and took the food away. Then our next main course arrived in the restaurant luckily it did not reach our table as the head waitress saw this. We received our appetizer. After 2 minutes having our starter our main course arrived again we only eat 14 of the appetizer before the main arrived as well. We tasted the main course During eating the appetiser and it was cold. It was exactly the same plate as we sent away. The lady replaced it and she came back within 2 minutes with a warmer plate. They put the meat in the wok and fried it up. The meat was too large and not delicate. We also had fish with garlic. It did not look good. A lot of garlic on top of the fish. When we paid we got a wrong check. According to AMEX we would receive a discount and we informed staff upfront but no discount was deducted. We informed the head waitress and she walked away with my credit card. Than we got a new correct invoice. The interior is very out dated. We ate better Chinese food in other restaurants in any place in the world. I had the intention to stay at Kempinski as I am a Platinum GHA member but we decided to cancel our stay in this hotel.
