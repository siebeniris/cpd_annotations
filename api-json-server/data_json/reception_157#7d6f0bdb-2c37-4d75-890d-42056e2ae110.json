Let me start with my summary Most regular customers of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group will not be overly excited about their Geneva property. The staff most of them are attentive and efficient but the structure and condition of the property does not correspond with prices charged for their rooms or the reputation of the brand. The hotel management will be quick to point out that their hotel pricing is positioned or aligned with other luxury properties in the Geneva market. That may be the case and is obviously more of a statement of the over all expensive marketplace of Geneva rather than the price quality guest satisfaction ratios of their hotel rooms. I do not mind paying 70 for a good room at a great hotel but this is an expense account hotel for business travelers and frankly an expense account city. On this trip to Switzerland we visited Montreux Zermat and stayed in five star hotels including the Montreux Palace and the Rifelalp Resort. What a downer it was arriving for our last night to the Mandarin Oriental in Geneva. The carpets in the lobby hall floor 4 are dirty and frayed the kick plates of every hotel door down the hall show damage and the very small room river view is in need of a renovation from wear and tear. Food carts were left in the hallway for hours. The bathroom is dated however the water pressure was excellent. We booked this room with the inclusion of a Signature amenity but had to request it upon checkout. The hotel made their best effort but a bouquet of flowers at checkout en route to the airport for an international flight seemed to be a waste. The breakfast buffet offered a reasonable selection and even the possibility of eggs cooked to order from the kitchen. The smoked salmon sandwiches on the buffet however tasted as though they were made the night before. In addition the condition of the covered plastic serving platters was poor they were cracked and malfunctioned. The service at the hotel was overall attentive with the exception of an unfriendly server at the MO bar. Despite most tables being empty in the bar it was difficult to get her attention to place an order. The MO Spice cocktail was excellent but getting a second drink proved to be more challenging than getting the first from the same server. If the hotel managers comments about the price structure of luxury hotels in Geneva is accurate and you are on vacation I would not recommend overnighting in Geneva at all. I would recommend staying in a resort city within easy reach of the Geneva airport by rail like Montreux. It is very easy to get to and from the Geneva airport from many surrounding cities by rail.", "offset": [192, 378], "date": "2015-08-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e43bbcbe-e5dd-49f5-a023-0d1c040992b9", "sentence": "GOOD LOCATION IN GENEVA CITY.

Housekeeping kept the room very clean and added all kinds of wonderful touches including rose petals in the shape of a heart on our bed for our anniversary and Swiss chocolates every night. The concierge was incredible. She made exceptional recommendations for dinners day trips and really seeing the city. And she saved us from a disappointing moment by reminding us to bring our passports to our visit to the United Nations as well as suggesting boats and giving us free passes to take at the end of the day to make our way back to the hotel. She was so excited about her job and ensuring our trip was wonderful that I wrote a letter to the manager highlighting her service. The service in the restaurant was also friendly and great.

I decided to stay at the Mandarin Oriental in Geneva for the first time because I thought they would deliver impeccable customer service like their sister hotel in Paris. My check. in went very smoothly at the hotel and the front desk help me to find a room that was to my liking. The concierge was very polite but did give me erroneous information about a boat ride that in fact was not in service. I ended up cutting my shopping short and running to catch a boat that was never left the dock. That was a bit of a bummer since I promised my son a boat ride. After struggling with my two and a half year old in the cold weather to get back to the hotel I decided to have a drink by the chimney in their bar. Initially I saw that someone was sitting at the table i wanted so I waited until they were gone and asked the waitress if I could move to that table. She told me it was reserved for someone for 7 pm. It was 6 pm so I asked if I could sit until 7 pm. Then I was told that it was reserved for that client the entire day. I then asked who told them it was reserved all day and they stated their manager. I then spoke with the manager that told me that in fact the table was reserved for a guest that had been staying at the hotel for the last 6months and always wanted to have that particular table. The manager told me that the guest usually comes downstairs sometime from 5 pm to 8 pm and they wanted to keep it available for him. The manager then told le I could move to the empty table but if the guest of the hotel like myself came down for example in the next 10 minutes I would have to give up the table. The manager did offer to pick up my tab as a consolation which for me really did not make up for this bad experience. I decided to finish my drinks and leave. I was outraged that the hotel would not allow me another guest in the hotel to have a particular table because one of their long term guest might come into the bar and they had to absolutely have that table. Thus my desires as a guest were inferior to this gentleman. I do not think I will be coming back to the Mandarin Oriental Geneva. I am so disappointed and completely unsatisfied in their notion of excellent customer service. They need to take some lessons from their sister hotel in Paris about treating all guests equally and delivering the best possible customer service.", "offset": [222, 321], "date": "2019-02-06", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "7c08afc3-351f-454e-a475-e8754e65eb60", "sentence": "The service is simply on a different level than anywhere else.

My wife and I have just returned from an excellent short 3 day city break in Geneva staying at the Mandarin Oriental. We last stayed at this hotel in 209 and the high standards and perfect service is still as good as it was ten years ago. From the glass of champagne on arrival room upgrade and various other nice touches we both thoroughly enjoy the visit. We had a deluxe river view room that was spotlessly clean and had all the amenities we needed such as robe slippers and turn down. We were disappointed that the signature Indian restaurant Rasoi was closed for the festivities so on our first night we ate in the Peruvian restaurant Yakamanca and we both enjoyed the meal.
