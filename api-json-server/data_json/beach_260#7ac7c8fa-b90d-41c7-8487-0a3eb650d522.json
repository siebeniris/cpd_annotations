The servers on the beach are not attentive and the women waitresses have a bit of an attitude. The exurtion we booked for snorkeling was very unorganized and a complete nightmare. After talking with Leblanc about it they have no clue about what goes on those excursions you book with them. Overall the resorts we have stayed at in cancun this is our new favorite resort and will not stay any place else.

My wife and I recently stayed at Le Blanc for our sixth visit and the resort is without a doubt world class in every respect. My wife and I and members of our families have stayed at or visited all of the Palace Resorts Le Blanc is the flagship resort of Palace Resorts have stayed at other resorts in the Cancun Mayan Riviera area and between our families have stayed at some of the best resorts and hotels in the Caribbean and the world. None have been better than Le Blanc. Even my parents who we took to Le Blanc for their 50th Wedding Anniversary several years ago and who had widely traveled stated that they have never been to a finer resort and on a better vacation during their lives. My brother in law who has also traveled extensively has declared Le Blanc as his absolute favorite. And the resort has repeatedly been recognized as one of the top resorts in the world and here are just a few of the reasons as to why. Check. In When you arrive at Le Blanc you are genuinely welcomed with open arms. Guests receive a cool towel a wonderful fruit drink and the ladies receive a flower. Check in is made very easy special and private where each guest is escorted to a separate desk where the check in process is completed. Mario the Front Desk Manager and his staff provide every guest the best accommodation possible and assist with any special requests guests may have. He and his staff are top notch all the way. Guests There is a nice mix of guests all the way from honeymooners to more elderly guests. It is a great place for all age groups minimum age 18. Ambiance. This resort is \u201c very relaxing \u201d more so than many of the other resorts in Cancun with a fantastic ambiance if you like it a bit more quiet my wife loves the more quiet ambiance and so do I. During the day a wide variety of planned activities are available at the activities pool and the beach ie water aerobics beach volleyball etc. Special events such as wine tastings tequila tastings and Mexican Coffee making demonstrations occur in the lobby area later in the afternoons. While there is lively nightly entertainment in their 3rd floor lounge or by the pool you will find soloists playing primarily more classical soft music in the evening in the lobby main lounge area. At night clubs are nearby for those guests that would like more of a \u201c party dance type \u201d atmosphere. Rooms and Suites. Le Blanc offers a variety of room types from their Royal Deluxe Suites standard suites to Honeymoon Suites all oceanfront to Junior Suites some with balconies that are larger than their more standard French balconies to expansive Governor \u2019s suites to a Presidential Suite. All rooms and suites have a large two person Jacuzi a small in room bar and either king or double beds. Many of the Royal Deluxe Suites face the Bayside which offers spectacular sunsets please see the Le Blanc website for additional details on room types. Concierge Butlers Fernando Royas Chief Concierge and his group of butlers are the best there is. It does not matter what special request a guest may have or how impossible the request may seem. They make it happen. From serving Presidents to royalty from all over the world to just plain regular guests like us unpacking our bags preparing our Jacuzi or making spa appointments nothing is impossible. I just want to add a special thank you here to Fernando and Tomas one of the butlers. My wife is a football \u201c fanatic \u201d for the University of South Carolina. Well we arrived on Saturday morning during football season to put this in perspective I have to plan our vacations around the football schedule. There was going to be an away game this day. Upon arrival on a Saturday I asked Tomas if there is a possibility that the game would be on TV somewhere in Cancun on the SEC Network. Well about ten minutes later Thomas found me and said that he found a restaurant bar where they can show the game arranged for it to be shown reserved a special table for us right in front of the TV and arranged transportation to the restaurant. Thank you both. Simply exemplary in every respect. And this is just one example of many. And we also received the same level of service from the butlers that were assigned to our floors. Thank you Joel and Antonio. Pools. There are three pools. The main pool area ocean side includes a large infinity pool with a swim up bar and deck with lots of lounges and umbrellas. This area also includes a large hot tub located close by. The moon pool on the bay side is the pool where the activities take place. These include in pool spinning classes water polo morning aerobics and other activities. This pool also has a swim up bar. In addition a smaller pool is located on the third floor ocean side. The nice thing about having a pool on both sides of the building is because when the shade begins to cover the ocean side pools late in the afternoon guests can move to the moon pool at the bayside of the building and continue to get afternoon early evening sun. Laura the Pool Manager and her staff are wonderful in providing every guest very personal attention from moving umbrellas so that guest have shade if so desired to making sure that the ice buckets by the lounges have enough ice in them to chill the water bottles to providing towels and books and magazines. Laura and her staff are constantly checking to make sure that every guest receives very special treatment first class all the way. many kudos to Laura. At the swim up bars it does n\u2019t take long for the bartenders to remember your preferred drinks and many times start working on them while you are still making your way towards the bar. Exemplary first class service. Not at the swim up bar. No problem. Servers at the pool and the beach make frequent rounds to insure that you are never left wanting anything from your favorite drink to your order for lunch. No matter where we were in the pool areas Lucinda our primary server always found us to refresh our drinks or take our drink or lunch order and to make sure that we had everything we needed. She without question helped make our stay at Le Blanc fabulous. The beach Beach. The beach in front of Le Blanc is wide and great for lounging on the beach andor swimming in the ocean. You can also walk quite a long way out into the ocean as the depth increases gradually. Perfect for just \u201c bobbing around in the waves \u201d surf conditions permitting. There are beach cabanas that can be rented during the day and serve to accommodate couples for the romantic dinners on the beach at night. There is also a beach bar. Restaurants. The menu selections food food presentation and service were all spectacular including the breakfast and lunch buffets. Our favorite restaurants for dinner were the French Restaurant and the International Restaurant \u2014 simply amazing in every respect. Try the special seven course dinner at the French Restaurant and the delicious seafood and steaks at the International Restaurant. But those were just our favorites. The Italian Oriental and the Pizza restaurant on the third floor are all excellent. The restaurant menus are extensive as well as the room service menus. The wine list offers many options. But it is not just the menu choices and quality of food that is outstanding. It would not be fantastic without the professional friendly and wonderful demeanor of the managers and staff that make all this happen. Employees such as Marco in the International Restaurant a wonderful manager who always go above and beyond to insure world class service for his guests. Also Aquilino the head chef at the International Restaurant who surprised his guest with different special morning pastries personally delivered every morning and will happily prepare whatever you want absolutely loved my special authentic Mexican breakfasts he prepared for me in the mornings. The selection and preparation of food by him and his staff is beyond compare. He insures that all the food is fresh and replenished and prepared equal to the finest restaurants in my country. And very special managers supervisors and waiters in all the restaurants who are totally professional with such wonderful attitudes and great smiles each and every day. I specifically want to mention Mayra Raul Pablo Jorge Rulo Denaro Armandao and Ivan who always make us feel so very special. And Mario whom we have known for years and who is so customer oriented and knowledgeable that he has been chosen to help train others congratulations Mario. I could go on and on but everyone in all the restaurants was truly amazing. Interested in wine. We are totally convinced that there is no better sommelier in Cancun then Gerardo. My wife and I have known Gerardo ever since we first started coming to Le Blanc. And every time we see him we are totally astounded by his knowledge of wines and equally astounding is his recall of some our favorite tastes in wine. We do n\u2019t know how he does it but even during times of high occupancy Gerardo manages to assist every guest that may have question or is requesting a special wine. He is always so helpful and has a truly warm and wonderful personality. During all our time travelling to different parts of our country or in the world we have never experienced a finer friendlier more knowledgeable and customer service oriented sommelier then Gerardo. The Spa and Beauty Saloon While I do n\u2019t use the Spa myself my wife absolutely loves it. The variety of offerings provide something for everyone and no matter what the choice the experience is amazing. A wonderful and relaxing spa hosted by a super experienced and ever so friendly and accommodating staff. My wife loves the hot stone massage. Mr Schmidt Le Blanc \u2019s Resort Manager has assembled a truly professional and wonderful team of managers and staff all working together like a well oiled machine to provide every guest a fantastic truly enjoyable and memorable vacation experience. We are very much looking forward to our seventh visit in April of 2015. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding this review or if we can be of any help as you plan your visit to Le Blanc.", "offset": [1812, 1954], "date": "2015-01-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "c57fb6d7-6747-4ab2-997d-25d88e260de0", "sentence": "HEAVEN. My husband and I have just returned from a week long stay at Le Blanc. We have vacationed in Cancuns finest resorts perhaps 15 times but this time we booked Le Blanc. After experiencing Le Blanc we will never stay anywhere else and can not wait to return in November. Le Blanc is an adults only smaller resort that is the height of elegance. What really makes this resort so incredible are the employees. Every single employee at this resort treats you with friendly gracious service and go to great lengths to ensure that you are pampered and spoiled every minute. Really the staff is the best we have ever experienced anywhere in the world. We booked an ocean front room with a Jacuzi tub. The room was not particularly large but was very elegant and perfect. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. A C worked flawlessly and would get the room as cold as you like. There is a mirror television in the bathroom and a large flat screen tv across from your bed. Our personal butler would draw us a Jacuzi bath if we wanted and offered to scent our room with our favorite essential oil in diffusers. He was also available to book restaurant reservations or tours have ice delivered to the room or anything else you needed. Housekeeping kept the room spotlessly clean and did turn down service each evening and would leave fancy chocolates by the bed. Robes and slippers are provided. A fridge in the room is kept well stocked with alcohol soft drinks water snacks and candy. There is a safe in the room for valuables. We loved the view and the room amenities. The spa is spectacular and we loved the atmosphere and services. The hydrotherapy area is great and we enjoyed our holistic massages so much we did it twice. The entire Caribbean is experiencing huge amounts of dead seaweed washing ashore but the maintenance people at Le Blanc worked tirelessly to remove it and keep the beach groomed to perfection. There are beautiful cabanas available at an extra fee that have comfortable mattresses and come with a bottle of champagne. Service everywhere in the hotel is phenomenal and the beach is no exception. You are constantly asked by employees if there is anything they can get you or do for you. There are three swimming pools and the main pool has a swim up bar. The other two have bars right at the side. Waiters will bring you lunch or snacks to the pool. Pool attendants place a silver ice bucket for bottled water next to your pool lounges and come by frequently to change out the ice so you always have an ice cold bottle of water handy. A pool attendant came by asking if I would like a cooling mask. She placed slices of chilled cucumber of my eyes covered it with a cool scented washcloth and misted me with cool water. It was so refreshing and a completely unexpected luxury. Pool bartenders mix special drinks you may not have tried and a waitress places them on a pool float and wades around the pool offering them to all guests. And each afternoon the staff comes around the pool with homemade popsicles. The restaurants were lovely with outstanding wait staff. We particularly enjoyed the Italian restaurant and the manager there could not have been more gracious. Food was sophisticated and really great. The International restaurant has an excellent buffet for breakfast and lunch and switches to a more elegant service for dinner. The cook who makes the made to order omelettes there was personable and so friendly each morning. The Asian restaurant was also great. We were less impressed with the French fusion restaurant because the food was extremely trendy but this is a personal preference. Room service is available 24 hours a day and we were delighted with the quality of the food as well as the perfect on time service. Most evenings at this time of the year guests are invited to help release baby green sea turtles into the sea. Le Blanc safeguards 500 turtle eggs from predation in a special beach enclosure and as they hatch they are released each evening after the sea birds have stopped foraging. Normally only 1 out of 100 baby sea turtles survive but this conservation strategy has resulted in a 10 survival rate. It is an experience that you will treasure and is not to be missed. There is so much more to be said about this resorts commitment to absolute excellence in every aspect of your stay but just book your vacation at Le Blanc and I am sure that you will love it as much as we do.", "offset": [1733, 1925], "date": "2015-09-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "fc47389b-96e0-4ad3-b431-0f0ebc95cb70", "sentence": "Relax relax relax. Just arrived home SADLY from our first trip to Wonderful Le Blanc. First of all we ended up totally splurging and booked a Governors Suite. If you are someone who does not spend a lot of time in your room it is maybe not worth the extra money but for us it was so perfect that I can not imagine ever staying in another room EVER. The views were spectacular. Even in the bathroom. Despite the broken motor on our TV dresser that meant we could not watch TV from bed and the massive flooding thanks to a crazy storm our room was OUR room. And it was PERFECTWe enjoyed all the restaurants but our favourite by far was Lumiere. Our second favourite meal was actually ordering room service up to the room and setting up our table and chairs right by the open french doors over looking the beach with a soundtrack of surf and sax from the romantic dinner below. I have a dairy allergy and although there were many many limitations to what I could eat everyone went above and beyond to try to accommodate and to make sure I was still enjoying my food. I appreciated this so very much. Made me feel special and also very reassured that everything I was eating was safe for me. We loved the spa. So relaxing. LOVED my hot stone massage which I was worried I would not and oxygen facial with Lysete. The only treatment both my husband and I would not do again was the Kulkulcan Massage. If you are someone who just likes a very light and relaxing touch in your massage then I would imagine this massage would be heavenly as it is four hands gently rubbing. However I like my massages deep and it was way too light for me and I found myself feeling anxious and frustrated rather than relaxed. We tried the Fish Spa and it was fun. One of those you got ta try it once experiences. The pools were clean too warm though. and that view over the infinity pool ocean is engrained in my memory forever. The ocean was spectacular and there was very little seaweed. The beach was amazing and the service on the beach was like none I have ever experienced before. The drinks were yummy and again the staff went out of there way to help ensure my drinks were dairy free harder that one might imagine and delicious. They even let my husband invent a new drink for me at the lobby bar. Although we never took advantage of this I loved that the pool and pool bar were open past dark. While we were heading to dinner there were still people hanging out in the pool and at the swim up bar. Just another great reminder that when on vacation at Le Blanc you are on no schedule and your day does not have to end until you want it to. Three Tenors was great. Mondays at 830. We got to do the turtle release which was a highlight for us. And we even got a special one on one with the turtles because there was a chance due to bad weather that there would not be a release while we were there so they called our room and invited us down to touch and hold the turtles that had hatched and we got to spend time with the biologist who taught us so much about the turtles. Despite some days of torrential rain or clouds our week was still perfect. Even the full day of rain we had just did not matter \u2026 there is amazing food lots to drink a beautiful spa \u2026. We had said that if we got a full day of rain we would walk around a bit downtown go shopping etc \u2026. we never left the resort despite the rain. We had everything we needed on the resort. Special staff who made our week the best couples get away we have ever had Roger Garcia Valdez our AMAZING concierge who went out of his way not only to make sure everything was wonderful but to fix anything that fell even slightly short of wonderful. Sweet kind hardworking Jorge who made our Cabana day extraordinary in every way including bringing me fresh coconut water and serenading us with his lovely songs. Carlos the waiter we loved so much at Lumiere we asked to sit in his section on our second visit. Alex the bartender at the swim up bar who made all my allergy safe drinks so GODand last but not least Mario and Manuel our phenomenal butlers.

We use trip advisor as a fantastic guide to get a feel for a place. This hotel had fab reviews so we thought we can not go wrong therefore booked it. I believe a holiday is for a rest and recoup from all the usual daily stresses this hotel I am afraid does not give you that. Why you may ask. Well let me tell youIf you are not out of bed before 050hrs every day the chance of getting a bed around the pool is NIL and I mean nil. I witnessed the deplorable action of a gentleman goaded by his wife who remonstrated with an old couple and pool staff those people are on our beds I put my towel there at 5 of the clock this morning I want them moved now this is totally unacceptable. This all happened at 830am. I felt for the old couple who were embarrassed and were moved off to the beach as all the other beds were taken. The joke of this whole situation was the couple re secured their beds then went off for breakfast returning over an hour later. I myself had no choice I was heading for the beach. NO BEDSSo now the ground rules for this hotel are set because in my eyes of weak hotel management. I have been to Secrets hotels and love them why. because there is no stress about beds they have an enforced 20min rule. THAT WORKSIf you leave your bed unattended for longer than 20min your stuff is removed and your bed is free game for all. I believe the pool staff do not turn up for work till 060hrs so why are beds being reserved earlierMy second complaint is there is a row of beds that lay in the water line of the pool. People who secure their beds round the pool at 050hrs automatically think that the beds in the water in front of their beds are theirs as well so they are now holding 4 beds per couple. Once again this is not policed or checked by staff. The good news is I have another 10 days of this joke so I have only two choices due to weak management. get up early every day to play the game and secure beds or it is the public beach fending off the beach sellers and there is hardly any service People say holidays are for relaxing I will not be returning. However I do need to make the point about the staff they bend over backwards for you and can not do enough but due to the lack of support from management. They are the people who are having to deal with this daily.

My pleasure is what you will hear from the staff at the Le Blanc in response to all the thank yous you will say from the minute you arrive. This place is out of this world amazing. Our dear friends who recommended this place to us could not have been more right on about it. While we LOVE children it was great to enjoy each others company without the distractions of our kids or anyone elses kids. The spa wow what word can I even use to describe the services. I think I would have to make one up because nothing I can think of would be fitting. Maybe stupendous. So relaxing so tranquil. The staff was 100 wonderful. We loved our room the Jacuzi in it being on the 3rd floor near the pool and nightclub were big pluses to. Oh and we do not want to forget feeding the iguanas our left over fruit in the morning. What fun. although I am not sure throwing it out of our window down to them was hotel approved. In short I would want to say the following 1 Use your butler they are there to help with any request make sure to tip them at the end they deserve it even if its all inclusive2. The romantic dinner they offer on the beach is a must3. The French restaurant where you have to have a reservation was good but not on our top 104. Swimming with the dolphins in Isla Mujeras. An absolute must. Pictures are way to expensive was the only downfall. Have to keep those memories in our hearts and mind5. Relax relax relax by being a traveler and not a tourist.

We stayed at Le Blanc from June 9 to June 17th it was our second stay and we where once again impressed. From the minute you arrive at the resort until you leave the service is incredibly great. We had an oceanfront suite 214 which was elegant and modern looking and the view from the window. balcony was beautiful. The balcony is small but you can step out listen and watch the ocean. Ensure you close the balcony doors because if you do not you will have water on your floor as you have warm air at 30 degrees plus entering your room which is at a lot lower temperature. We were able to watch two weddings while we were there. The preparation that the staff goes to set up the wedding area is amazing to watch. We ate at the four restaurants that do not require reservations we skipped the French which requires reservations. We prefer to simply walk in rather than reserve. The food the service and variety at all restaurants were very good and the staff was always ready to explain any dish to us. We also went to The Beach Palace Oriental restaurant for old times sake. The service and food was also very good and has you likely know when you stay at the Leblanc you can visit other Palace resorts. As fabulous as the resort is the service at the main pool was extra special. The staff would set your padded chairs up with towels and move umbrellas over if necessary. Le Blanc has a lot of space for all guests so chairs and umbrellas are always available. One day we spent the afternoon at the third floor pool and we were set up on a beach bed with up to six towels. The service was amazing and we had the place almost to ourselves. The butlers are friendly helpful and they always ask if there is anything they can do for you. My wife had two spa treatments and was very impressed with the spa set up and the services she received.

My husband and I spent a week at Le Blanc over Thanksgiving. The location is great as the beach is perfect and if one wanted to leave to go shopping etc it is central. We had a Junior Suite which had an ocean view balcony with seating and a Juliet balcony facing the lagoon side. We preferred this room as it had a private bathroom. The ocean front honeymoon rooms seemed like they had better views I am not a fan of the lagoon viewThe beach pool area was never crowded during our week so it was nice being able to find seats with lovely views of the water. Staff immediately helping with towels and a bucket of ice waters. The service at this resort really was very nice and all the staff are extremely polite kind. We found the butlers on our floor were very helpful offering suggested activities and even anticipating transportation needs and handling arrangements. we have had butler service at various properties and found this team to be the most proactive we have encountered. The restaurants had a more upscale feel and again the service was great. Our favorite was the Asian restaurant and their tasting menu will not disappoint. We used our resort credits to go golfing at Moon Palace but found that it was crowded since the other Palace Resort guests are also golfing there. We bailed after 9 holes because we would rather go back to the beach pool than wait at a course. Later in the week my husband played Riviera by himself and found it to be less crowded and enjoyed a full round there. I enjoyed a spa package with some resort credits. They have the pre treatment hydrotherapy sequence which is nice and the treatments were quite good. Guadalupe in the spa was very professional and did great with my scrub massage facial. The last thing we used used credits for was the dinner on the beach. If you have never done this before it is worth a try. They arrange it very well and it did exceed my expectations.

We used ours for a romantic dinner on the beach a spa day for my wife a cabana on the beach and a dinner upgrade lobster tails in the Italian restaurant. While we did have to pay the 16 tax on all of these things totaling about 200 it was worth it. The butler on each floor is a nice touch if you need ice ring the butler and he will bring it. I had ours prepare a scented jacuzi in our room one day. so it was ready once we got back from the beach. Another day I had him decorate the room as a surprise for my wife on our anniversary. Tipping is a real pain. but I felt a necessity while an all inclusive does offer you the ability to not have to worry about carrying cash I pretty much tipped everyone all day long because each employee really does bend over backwards to cater to you every need. I watched at dinner most people did not leave tips. but I did. Budget 50 75 day for tipping. I did ask upon arrival if they could upgrade us to a higher floor room with an ocean view explaining we were celebrating an anniversary. After the guy at the front desk went to talk to his manager he did come back and tell me he could upgrade us for 30 nite. While I was hoping for a free upgrade I did spend the 30 nite. I did ask for a late checkout which they really did not give me they allowed me to stay for 1 extra hour. My flight was not until early evening and I was hoping for a 3 pm checkout so we could stay on the beach until the last possible minute and then shower etc before going to the airport normal checkout is 12 pm they gave me until 1pm.

DC Roger makes your transition from traveler to guest a very simple and seamless experience. Our Butlers Joel and Cesar responded quickly to any request we had for the day. Our room was well appointed and chambermaid Rosario I think I have that spelled correctly made sure fresh towels were available and our room was perfect each day. I always book Karina in the Salon for a wonderful color highlight and cut. Natural soaps are new to the room amenities and are very freshly scented. I do however prefer the Bulgari selections usually found in the room. We enjoyed entertainment director Alfonso \u2019s new band \u201c. GirlTrapOficial \u201d. and of course the juggle act in the 3rd floor bar and the circus performers around the Lagoon pool. Let \u2019s talk FOOD. New Executive Chef Manuel has brought fresh ideas and presentation to menus in all of his highly rated restaurants at LeBlanc. Manuel has reformated the Chef \u2019s Dinner and I recommend you use Resort Credits for an evening of delicious dining paired with the perfect wine selections from Sommelier Fabian. Food and Beverage Mgr. Manoli is quietly behind the scenes making sure LeBlanc perfection is being served up to all guests. Well done Manoli. We always enjoy the Asian Restaurant on our first evening at LeBlanc. Manager Antoniete Hostess Corina Servers Alberto and Magdalena and of course Chef Jonathan have our favorite Spring Rolls ready in the kitchen. I recommend the Tempura ice cream for dessert. Server Rafael even came over to our table remembered our names and gave us the warm greeting of \u201c Good to see you again \u201d. The Blanc International restaurant has a new menu and vibe as well. We enjoyed this menu several times during our stay. Restaurant Managers Renan and Omar have a capable team in both the dining room and kitchen. The steak with tender grilled shrimps option is always a perfect choice. Special thanks to Chef Carlos server Jonathan and Daysi hostess Jesica and Sous Chef Justine. A definite highlight to our LeBlanc dining was Chef Sergio \u2019s. preparation of a special menu and private dinner for our small group using recipes from his Mayan grandmother. Our favorite dish was the gently spiced lamb served on warm tamale followed by the delicious 85 ingredient Mole \u2019 over duck. Thank you again Chef Sergio and Chef Carlos for a fabulous dinner and presentation. We look forward to menu changes in April as we plan to return to LeBlanc in May. Breakfasts are the best at LeBlanc. Mgr Marco and his team of Armando David Vanessa Jose Isabela and Fernili start your morning off perfectly. The French Restaurant Lumiere is always a special evening for us. Mgr. Victor is exceptional and servers Edgar and Carlos are attentive to your dining needs. Their team of Alberto Alejandro and Andreas never disappoint us. I always look forward to the goat cheese gateau and perfectly prepared filet with chilled Moet. Our dining experience at the Italian Restaurant was wonderful. The Roasted Artichoke dish Minestrone soup and Oso buco are not to be missed. It was a pleasure to meet and welcome Magdelena to LeBlanc restaurant mgt team. We always enjoy the service of Enrique Karla Lorenzo and Ulyisis. Polside dining options include Chef Serviano \u2019s delicious Paella and of course those Wood Fired Pizzas from the 3rd floor terrace. Thanks Chef Serviano for the coconut shrimp. Welcome Amber to the food beverage team. You are in good companyLet \u2019s talk BEACH and CABANA. Leblanc pools are pristine and gorgeous. However this trip we chose to use the lovely cabanas at the beach. LeBlanc \u2019s beach is one of Cancuns best with gorgeous views and easy walking. Mother Nature sends a gentle reminder that she is in charge of this planet with the occasional seaweed sargassum but LeBlanc crews work diligently to keep beaches clear. Servers Jair Daniel Jorge Victor Christopher Jesus \u2019 and Luis have your cabana ready each morning and keep drinks towels ice buckets fresh throughout the day. A fresh wood fired pizza and chilled bottle of Moet for lunch is. pure bliss. Best lifeguard award goes to Hernando. Yes we will return soon. We care about the staff who we consider and love as our Mexican family. The capable staff make the vision of GM Janai real and keep LeBlanc Spa Resort named the best resort always. Thank you from our hearts to our Mexican friends.", "offset": [1574, 1673], "date": "2018-04-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "b406a55a-7cde-43db-8a32-f384e70a6215", "sentence": "Wonderful winter getaway. Greeted by smiling Miguel at the new terminal 4 at the airport and Joe as we arrived at the resort. Our checkin was very smooth with Roger and Erica handling everything effortlessly. Arrived early so went straight to breakfast and Isabel \u2019s fabulous omelets that she prepared everyday for me. Spent most of our stay this time at the beach cabanas with excellent service from Jair Victor Daniel Jorge Christopher and Luis. When you stay 2 weeks you are able to rotate through the entire group. Hernando and Henri were quick with towels and setting up umbrellas. Our room was beautiful with an outstanding ocean view and serviced daily by Rosario with a smile. Our butlers Joel and Caesar were at the ready for any needs. We experienced all of the restaurants multiple times along with a special dinner prepared by chefs Sergio and Carlos. Marco tended to our daily needs in the International along with hostess Vanessa always greeting with a smile and servers Armando David and several others. In the evenings Omar took care of us with servers Jonathan Fausto and Daysi. Victor as usual managed the French with his usual flare along with servers Edgar and Carlos taking care of us. Toni surprised us regularly in the Asian along with servers Alberto Magdalena and Rafael. Magdalena and Enrique were in charge in the Italian with our wonderful server Karla. Isac seemed to be everywhere along with trainee Amber checking if we needed anything. Fabian and Renan tended to our wine selections and Michele greeted us each night in the lobby bar with a big smile. Roberto wished us well as we departed and hoped we would return soon which we will.

The staff accommodations food and spa were absolutely 5 stars. I felt relaxed as soon as I walked into the hotel and looked out on the infinity pool and white d\u00e9cor. The restaurant food and service were excellent and we enjoyed the lobby and third floor live music lounge as well when we were there. Everyone was incredibly friendly grounds were safe well maintained and clean. The room we had overlooked the main pool and ocean and was nicely appointed right down to the chocolates we got every night. Adults only was a plus was nice not to have kids around for 5 days. I would recommend LeBlanc to others and I certainly want to come back some day. We got a 750 resort credit with booking and did not realize until Day 4 when we were called to the lobby we had get the hard sell for a timeshare. They were perfectly polite when we declined just be aware I guess I am naive.

From the time you first arrive at Le Blanc to the time you leave you will find the resort absolutely spectacular and you will be figuring out why you did n\u2019t come before and how soon before you can go back. It \u2019s the total package that makes this resort so spectacular from the physical layout of the resort to the restaurants the rooms the pools and the beach ocean the fantastic staff and the many amenities and offerings that are available here. Arrival When you arrive you will be met by a member of the staff who will greet you with a cool towel a welcome juice and a flower for the lady. And as soon as you enter the lobby you wo n\u2019t be able to take your eyes off the wonderful and eclectic lobby area and the fantastic view of the infinity pool and the sparkling ocean just beyond the pool area an amazing view. You will then be escorted to one of several private registration desks. The registration process is a delight. It is very obvious that the entire staff are experts at customer service will do anything they can possibly do to accommodate any request you may have and always with a wonderful attitude. Many kudos to Rebecca the Front Desk Manager Erica and Alejandro Front Desk Supervisors and the entire staff at registration. Following registration you will b e offered to briefly meet with a guest services representative who will explain the resort to you and the many amenities that are available and will also activate your resort credits. And a side note here you can also have this meeting later in the day or early the next day. But please note that the person that meets with you is also the one that activates your resort credits. Butlers. There is a butler on every floor and he will assist you with whatever you need. You can ask him to unpack your bag for you iron a shirt prepare the in room Jacuzi make a dinner reservation off the resort or a host of other services. You will find all of the butlers absolutely helpful totally professional and all with such a wonderful demeanor. During our stay we mostly interacted with Israel Mario Jesus and Francisco. I can not say enough wonderful things about how impressed we are with their knowledge and services and that really goes for all the butlers at Le Blanc. Rooms. Le Blanc has a number of different room types. They include deluxe and ocean view rooms Honeymoon Suites as well as Junior Suites and Governor \u2019s Suites and a couple of Presidential Suites. Each of the modern rooms has an in suite Jacuzi and a mini bar. Many have a French balcony and some have a regular balcony. To see more about the various room types and additional details I suggest that you visit the Le Blanc website. Restaurants. We arrived close to lunchtime and our first stop after checking in and going to our room was to get some lunch. Le Blanc offers very extensive food choices for both lunch and breakfast. Both are served in a buffet setting. The problem for me is that there are way too many great choices. I have to work on limiting myself otherwise I would probably gain ten pounds while here. Already at the pool or ocean. Well there is also a lunch menu for dining while lounging at the pool or beach areas. Your server will be very happy to take your order and bring your lunch so that you do n\u2019t have to leave the comfort of your lounge. Dining options include Mexican Italian French and Asian restaurants as well as a Pizza area restaurant. All have great menus and wonderful food. Dining in the Mexican restaurant is casual attire while men need to wear slacks and a collared shirt for dinning in the French restaurant. And I recommend a collared shirt in the Asian and Italian restaurants. Also please note that you need to make a reservation for the French restaurant. We have never needed a reservation for any of the other restaurants. And while I \u2019m on the subject of the French restaurant many kudos to Victor the Manager and Carlos one of the waiters perfect service in every way. Dinning at any of these restaurants is always a wonderful experience whether for breakfast lunch or dinner. Aside from the wonderful food what really makes this to memorable is the wonderful and so attentive staff. From Vanessa the perfect hostess at the breakfast and lunch buffets to Armando one of the servers with his wonderful smile fantastic service and wonderful personality to Marco the manager at breakfast and lunch who pulls it all together. He is everywhere making sure that all the guests are well taken care of and happy. And also consider the special dinners that are offered. I suggest the Chef \u2019s Dinner during which the chef explains and demonstrates how he prepares each item that is on this menu and the Romantic Dinner that is served on the beach a table for two inside the beach cabanas. Both are wonderful experiences and very unique. Pools and Ocean Le Blanc has three pools and a large hot tub. There is a very large infinity pool with a pool bar facing the ocean a hot tub nearby and a small pool on the third floor outside. There is also a pool on the other side of the resort building called the \u201c Moon Pool \u201d. This one also has a swim up bar. Later in the day when the buildings shadow creeps around the infinite pool area guest can move to the other side and enjoy more sun at the Moon Pool. Both the infinity pool and Moon Pool are heated during the colder months. Pool and beach service is always spectacular. From Laura Lucinda and Mauricio who always ensure that guests have fresh towels and bottled water by their lounges to helping guests with their umbrella to the servers that always make sure that guests never have to wait to order a drink or refresh an existing drink all are the absolute best. Also many thanks here to Sarahi Myra and Jeanete pool and beach servers who work tirelessly to make sure that all their guests are well taken care of and always with a wonderful attitude and big smiles. Prefer the beach. No problem. The beach is wonderful for swimming and you can find the same level of service that you find at all the other places at this resort. You can even rent a beach cabana here for the day using your resort credits. Spa and Gym Want some time away from the sun. You can visit the fantastic Spa or get some exercise at the well equipped gym. For arranging and reserving spa or beauty parlor services see one of the Vacation Planners. They will guide you through the large variety of choices. When the resort is busy you may want to consider making your spa appointments soon after you get there just to make sure that you can get the date and time that you prefer. Sports Entertainment. There are a variety of exercise classes offered during the morning such as water aerobics spinning and pool yoga with pool volleyball and beach volleyball sessions in the afternoons. During the evening Le Blanc offers nightly entertainment from a live band in one of the lounges bars to a magic show as well as other venues. You can also find piano saxophone or violin music in the lobby bar area in the early evening. Lastly I want to recognize all of the staff and managers at Le Blanc for working diligently and expertly to ensure that all guests have a spectacular vacation experience second to none and a special recognition and thank you here to Leslie the Residence Manager. She is everywhere around the resort and seems to work 24 hours a day seven days a week. Anything at all that can be done to make sure you have a fantastic experience tell her she is always there to help. Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have and I will try my best to answer them.", "offset": [227, 468], "date": "2018-06-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "4197b4fe-be7e-4e55-911c-1743f4f789ee", "sentence": "Never Disappointing.

We thought after our last experience with LeBlanc we would try them again but also try another resort just in case. LeBlanc however really exceeded our expectations the 2nd time around. Cesar our butler was AHMAZING we also had Luis the butler briefly when we arrived and he was GREAT in giving us a tour of our room. Cesar remembered what I liked to drink and had it waiting for me when I arrived back at the room after a long day of lounging on the beach lol. He came to our room late at night when I decided I wanted to try different soap. Literally the service at LeBlanc is the best part of any trip I have ever taken. Check in was seamless the new warm compress is a great touch. The renovations are nice to the rooms but the lobby is really retro a throwback to the 50s instead of the modern forward moving direction I expected. We were on a higher floor room which was quieter than before so I was able to sleep however the resort was only at 40 capacity and I still heard a decent amount of hallway noise I do not think they resolved those soundproofing issues. We loved the new ice cream bar and the chocolate bar.

Thank you LeBlanc for another wonderful vacation in Cancun. Upon leaving the airport we were promptly greeted by Herber who was waiting for us and immediately put us in vacation mode. We were fortunate to also have him transport us back for our departure. We love to sit ocean side in the shade and Laura Lucinda made sure we were covered and comfortable. Pool servers Dana and Mayra knew exactly when and what we wanted as far as refreshments we were never without coffee water or a cocktail. Breakfast and lunch at Blanc was our favorite part of our day as we were always warmly greeted by Vanessa and our awesome waiters Juanito Elias Erick Rafael Candelario Marco Aaron such wonderful representatives of LeBlanc \u2019s \u201c welcome home \u201d vibe. Those gentlemen are one of the highlights of our visits to this amazing resort. Breakfast and lunch buffet selections were varied and delicious. This was our eighth visit and honestly the food this visit was the best ever. Our dinners at Yama with our waiter Jerry Bela and Teraza under a beautiful moon shining over the ocean were outstanding. Great job by the creators of the menus. We hope that someday the chef \u2019s dinner will return as we have previously enjoyed the experience. I \u2019d also like to thank Joel the first floor butler who took the time to set up my device so the LeBlanc ap was functioning for us. He went above and beyond.
