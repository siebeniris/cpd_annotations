The staff was uniformly eager to help pleasant and professional. Good location near the Convention Center and downtown Denver. Bad news 1. The rooms or at least the one we stayed in 1416 needs major refurbishing. 2. The bed was not good. It was overly soft and my back still feels the aftereffects. 3. There were multiple occasions when there was little or no hot water. 4. The shower head was not fastened to the wall and I was afraid to try to adjust it lest it would snap off. 5. The breakfast room traffic pattern could not be worse. The layout maximized the opportunities of bumping onto other people and spilling all the contents of one \u2019s tray. 6. The quality of the breakfast was poor. My wife ate breakfast the first day and would not return due to the poor quality and selection of food for the remaining four days of our stay. I ate minimally orange juice toast and perhaps a banana when they were present. This was our first stay at an Embassy Suites property and it left us with a bad impression of the brand. Hopefully this is not Hilton \u2019s present standard. We stayed there to attend a scientific meeting that was held at the property. The meeting went well but we were disappointed in the accommodations.

The room was very spacious and the amenities were all high quality Neutragena. The staff that I met were all friendly and very helpful. the food was excellent and the evening happy hour was welcomed at the end of a long day of conferences. The Hilton ap worked perfectly and I love the digital room key and being able to check out from my phone. The only reason I did not give this review 5stars is the following. I stayed in guest room 503. The furniture was a bit dated and the choice of an ottoman instead of an office chair for the bedroom see pictures writing desk was uncomfortable to sit at for any length of time with no back support. The single server coffee maker in my room still had water in it from the previous guest. Also there appears to be a bathroom fan vent that did not appear to be working. The vent was filled with lint and the metal was a little rusted. This caused the bathroom to steam up after a shower making the mirror useless. Other minor issues were the lobby noise could be heard in my room until almost midnight. Lastly although I am sure it is for security purposes the wire inside the glass windows the look out onto the hallway is tacky for an upscale downtown hotel.

My husband and I booked a long weekend with another couple at the Embassy Suites. Embassy is pretty much the same wherever you book across the country and you always know what to expect for the cost. We like the included breakfast buffet with tons of options and the food is really good. They also offer a nice happy hour with free wells beer wine and some very basic aps like cheese cracker and veggies. The rooms are all suites which starts with a living room bathroom in the middle and ends with the bedroom. The bed was comfortable but the living room furniture is pretty basic and not cozy at all. There is an Bar Kitchen area in the middle with a microwave and small fridge. Bathroom is pretty standard for hotels and really no extra luxuries. This Embassy is set up a little different. You walk in through the garage and have to take the elevator to the lobby. There is a nice area for seating in the lobby with plenty of room to spread out and about just for chilling happy hour or breakfast. We did hit a couple of the happy hours during our stay. It was so crazy on a Friday night you had to wait in a very long line for like 15 mins. We went back on a Sunday night and it was way less people and much more relaxed. There is a restaurant a fitness center indoor pool and convenient store with basic food and toiletries available on site. Parking is like crazy expensive so be aware. Though you can choose to use parking garages that are around the hotel and are much more affordable. The location is in an ok area of Denver. It is next to the convention center and close to the 16th Street Mall which is totally touristy but I was not really prepared for the amount of homeless people around the hotel. I know that this can be an issue when staying in a downtown area but it was a bit shady at the hotel. I would of not been comfortable if I had to walk around by myself but it was fine in a group. If you have kids and are staying here I honestly would say there are probably better places to go. So the only reason I rated this Embassy Suites 4 Stars was due to some billing issues. I booked this visit with credit card points and some how the Embassy still charged my credit card on file for three nights. I challenged this at checkout and the lady informed me the charges would be credited and not added to my credit card. Well they were still charged and it took about 10 emails back and forth to get the problem corrected. The lady that helped me Mica I think was super nice though. She said it was my credit card companies fault but whatever it turned out all good. just a lot of extra hassle.", "offset": [2063, 2149], "date": "2019-09-26", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}]}
