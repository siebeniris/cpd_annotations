Residence club great. Really good location. Walk out of the hotel and loads of shops coffee places etc. Much more upmarket than Hanoi. Had a corner suite room two bathrooms view on one side over the pool and the other was city view. Room was very large with sitting area. Sleep quality was good but even though we were on 11th floor could still hear traffic noise slightly. Towels were great very soft and fluffy. Best we had on our 19 day tour. Plenty of complimentary items in the room. Water chocolates toiletries etc. When you drew back the net curtains on the window overlooking the pool the paint work was all cracked and the wallpaper was coming away. So in need if refurb. The free wifi was really good. Did two full day tours so not much time to browse around area or the hotelb the hotel pool looked great. The Residence club benefits suited us fine. Check out the benefits of the residence club on their website. You could get free cofe teas anytime. Free alcholic drinks and food was from 530 till 730. The food buffet was excellent. Plenty of choice. Main meals savouries desserts. We ate here on both nites. It has the roof terrace there. Walk through the residence lounge and right out on to the roof to terrace. We had our breakfast there on both mornings. Would not hesitate to recommend it.", "offset": [505, 537], "date": "2015-10-04 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "758542bf-894d-487b-868c-3fd7cad33418", "sentence": "Lovely place to stay in Ho Chi Minh City. Stayed at the New World Saigon Hotel for 4 days and then 1 night at the beginning and end of our Indochina tour. Friendly staff clean rooms and a fabulous breakfast buffet makes this a place I would return to and hopefully soon. The breakfast buffet was excellent as it had a nice mixture of western and eastern foods all well done. The hotel is located close to the night market. Located within the hotel lobby is a small clothing store that will make clothing to order. We had some outfits made by them and were impressed with the quality of their work.", "offset": [423, 513], "date": "2016-01-31 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "6f771e8c-7b2e-4be7-8b64-d3a6e85b86a8", "sentence": "Exceptional service. My experience at New World Saigon definitely set my benchmark for service at luxury hotels. Service was exceptional from every member of staff. From the cleaner to doorman everyone had one job and that was to please. They did that and beyond. Every staff member understood and spoke basic English at the very least. Reception staff and room service attendants had conversational English. Room attendants arrived promptly after each request. I do not recall having to wait any more than 10 minutes for non in room dining request. For in room dining my wait was about 20 30 minutes which is pretty reasonable. We had a mishap one night and cleaning staff came over in minutes and did what was needed without fuss or annoyance. They even replaced our soiled towels. Downstairs in the lobby the attendants will hail a cab for you and tell the driver your destination. Every interaction was personal and they made us feel like we are not just another guest. As an Australian I do not think I have ever tipped as much as I did here but I felt they deserved every dollar if not more. While rooms are conservative by modern standards they are clean and functional. The rooms are spacious and come with fast usable WiFi and cable access TV. While not eyepoping you will definitely feel at home here at New World. If the hotel recently had renovations done since I stay here in February 2016 then it can definitely rival the likes of Hilton and the Mariot.", "offset": [784, 884], "date": "2016-12-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "9d442d1b-64e7-47c9-9840-d1e79da9e71c", "sentence": "Good place to stay in Hochiminh.

This used to be a very nice hotel back in the days and quite popular for its dining area on the ground floor. Nowadays it \u2019s outdated. The bathroom is old and could use some remodeling as well as the furniture. The bathtub did n\u2019t look so clean for us to use. The walls and carpets are a bit dirty both in the hall way as well as the room. At least the bed was clean and comfortable. We had a deluxe room on the 8th floor. Maybe up in the 10th floors were better. Breakfast was n\u2019t that good and did n\u2019t have much selections. I \u2019d been to to 2 3 stars hotels in my younger days with more choices of of tasty food to eat than here. It felt like a continental breakfast. A bit disappointed though the restaurant looked fancy. Glitchy keys. Even though the staffs were helpful and friendly it was really inconvenient that the keys did n\u2019t work. We had to wait for new keys in front of our room the first time. We had to rush down to reception the second time because we really needed to use the toilet but the replacement key did n\u2019t work. The third time was fortunate because we were given extra keys just incase we get stuck outside again. The good things about the hotel is its central location. We were able to walk to Ben Thanh Market Bui Vien street and Nguyen Hue street. The staffs were friendly and responsive. Check in and out were quite easy and quick. They speak English and normally have a smile on their faces. If you want to pay more than 100 usd a night for a hotel for its location a clean bed and simple breakfast then this hotel is for you.

My taxi passed the hotel and could not turn back around to drop us off at the front so we had to walk a few metres and headed towards the hotel. As soon as the staff from the hotel could see us walking up the driveway two bell desk boys immediately ran towards me to take my luggage. what a great startI was greeted by a few friendly staff. Jin who served me at the front desk was extremely nice. The standard room that I originally booked was not ready and understandable since check in is usually at 12 but Jin upgraded me to a higher level room that was ready for us to check into. We are so grateful for that considering we had been up since 4 am to catch our flight. Our room is spacious nice view and good quality toiletries. We bumped into a little issue with the bed sheets but the front desk manager Nguyen Manh Tuong took care of it straight away. Housekeeping was sent up immediately and the supervisor of housekeeping personally came up to rectify the issue and apologised. Once she fixed the issue we received a pleasant knock on the door with a plate of fruit and an apology note. I have stayed in many hotels and the service the team provides here is one of the best. Besides the small issue I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone whether you are travelling as a family single or a couple. The next time I come back to HCMC I will be staying here again. Spa sauna steam room is clean and there is also a kids playground for the little ones. Thank you New World Hotel team. And now for some relaxation time.

Perhaps we are not the target audience for this business oriented hotel. The lobby is huge anchored in marble and felt like a train station or fancy airport than luxurious. The staff were efficient but did not mention any of the room amenities. There are a mysterious pair of masks with canisters in the closet with instructions only in Vietnamese. The room itself is clean and could have been anywhere in the world. The tea is Liptons coffee is Nescafe and no art travel guides or anything that would hint of Saigon. Reminds me too much of the nine weeks I once spent at a Hilton for work. Had a bit of trouble locating the free tea coffee as there are tucked in the same drawer as pricey 40 K instant noodles. Would have made more sense to have them near the water kettle. Shower gets up to temperature quickly but the pressure was not satisfying. Also was not a fan of having a half shower door instead of fully enclosed. High step in bathtub was also a bit of a hassle. Location is super convenient with an exelent Ori Nail spa across street and the superb Sorae restaurant just around the corner. The working desk and chair were also topnotch with USB HDMI outlets handy.
