Our experience at the Tuscan Inn was a good one nice surprise for a Best Western except for 2 important things. Although the room was updated and well appointed it was extremely small. The bathroom sink mirror was IN the bedroom no door and to use the light in the commode shower you also had turn on the light to the sink which illuminated the bedroom. Not nice in the middle of the night. The sink area and the actual toilet were dollhouse sized not possible to share the space. The air conditioner would shift into a very loud overdrive mode every 5 minutes or so again not nice while trying to sleep.

She did move us but warned us it may be affected from the noise of the city this was clearly not true as she put us in a room directly overlooking another properties backyard.

At the risk of sounding whiney the front desk could work on being more welcoming. We booked through AARP and I guess the hotel was a Best Western at one time. Our confirmation said Best Western The Tuscan. It was not a big deal but when looking for the hotel we looked for Best Western and the signage says only The Tuscan. When checking in I said that I had difficulty finding the hotel because I was looking for Best Western. The front desk lady looked at me like I was stupid and said is not our sign still located at the front of the hotel. I guess it was ignorant of me to not know that they were no longer Best Western. I felt like an idiot that she had to put up with rather than a welcome guest. It is just a small thing but it was my first impression and it stuck. Other staff were friendly and really after the initial contact the reception lady was friendly too. Maybe to be fair she was tired of hearing the same complaint or maybe she did not understand what I was saying. The location. Fishermans wharf was a short walk away. There was a grocery store close by as well as lots and lots of restaurants. The best thing about the hotel is the location.

Close to everything. Stayed at The Tuscan Jan 17th21st and I have to say I was really impressed with the staff and the location of the hotel itself. When we first arrived around 10 am they did not make us wait to check in they had a room ready. We had come out to San Francisco for my birthday and to celebrate it the hotel sent up a bottle of champagne and a little chocolate cake. They could not have made me feel any more special. They are doing a renovation in the hotel and our water got shut off from 10 am to 5 pm which was not a big deal since you are outside all the time. The rooms are very small and the bathrooms even smaller. The room has a safe which we found to be helpful. The mini fridge was great too. If you do not have your room cleaned they give you a 5 a day credit towards your bill restaurant or mini bar purchase. There are plenty of stores around and great food options on the pier. Since San Francisco is known for being expensive this hotel was priced perfectly at least for when we went out the rainy season.

We had no idea that the hotel was in the midst of renovations when we arrived. We entered in a side stairwell into a dark makeshift reception area. We were originally assigned a old un renovated room supplied with free earplugs to block the construction noise. After mentioning our disappointment to the staff we were moved to the last newly renovated room. It matched the photo but was not quite ready for use. The tub was still dirty from installation and some hardware was not yet fitted a phone was swapped over while we were relaxing in the room. Access to rooms from the street concerned us as a security issue. Anyone could walk into a lift from the outside drop off area directly up to the rooms without ever passing through reception or seeing a security guard. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were continually offered wine even an entire new bottle after having already had several glasses.

Pleasant stay. The hotel was going through the final stages of a major renovation during my visit so there were some minor hiccups but I can not complain. I believe I was the first person to stay in that particular room since it had been renovated so I was pleased as everything was new and fresh. The bed was comfortable and the room was well designed with a contemporary motif. If you are looking for close proximity to tourist attractions such as Fishermans Wharf this very well may be a good option for you. The hotel is located in an area that is mixed with a few other hotels but I had say it is mainly a residential area I found that somewhat charming as I typically stay downtown when visiting SF. Public transportation is easily accessible with street cars and busses within walking distance. The location does not personally work for me as I prefer to be close to BART and the noise of the city but it is definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a newly renovated property that is in a quiet neighborhood and within a hop skip and jump to the waterfront and touristy stuff.", "offset": [194, 336], "date": "2017-06-27", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "86099803-0856-4b61-a389-45b5b4b2eb34", "sentence": "Modern and Friendly.

They allowed us to check in early around 1 and the staff was efficient if not friendly. It was a bit disappointing that they did away with the evening wine social but now they give you a voucher for a specific glass of wine. There is a restaurant bar at the corner of the building which we did not try since the only thing on their posted menu were drinks and snacks but it was empty most of the time anyway Pescatore. we were there Saturday SundayThe location was great not only for the proximity to the Wharf but just around the corner is World Market Ross Trader Joes etc. Across the street is a Safeway grocery store along with some other shops including a pharmacy in a small shopping center kind of hidden.
