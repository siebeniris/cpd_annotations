I went with my girlfriend and we had opted for the Excellence Club room upgrade and are glad that we did. There were several perks included in the Excellence Club which I will detail below. An amazing experience that I should emphasize is the nightly performances. There are some truly talented dancers and acrobats that put on some incredible shows each night. Different shows every night of the week. truly worth it. Let me try to be more helpful though on this amazing resortService 55The service from everyone was truly excellent. Every single person was there to make sure that our experience was an amazing one. There were several occasions when a server would remember me from two days ago or the day before and would immediately bring something up that they remembered about our last interaction. Check in was extremely easy as was check out. though I can not compare this to the non Excellence Club option. It definitely felt great to have everything arranged through the hotel for transportation to and from the airport the driver had my name on a sign and it was as simple as meeting him outside. Say hello to Hector for me if you go there he is usually at the Martini bar just near the lobby. Take a mamajuana shot from him and you will be buddies almost imediatelyRoms 55I highly recommend being on the first floor to take advantage of a patio area dedicated for your own room. Every morning my girlfriend and I would sit outside while sipping on a drink that we either made in the room or took from the fridge. The room amenities seemed endless. Coffee tea fully stocked fridge and very high quality liquor Johnny Walker Black Label Bombay Sapphire Absolut plus a local rum and Spanish Wine in addition to Beers and mixers in the fridge. The bedroom had a nice king size bed tons of pillows plus a double vanity for an easy time getting ready. The room also had a massive whirlpool tub in the middle with aroma sticks for burning available for use. There were even options to have the Spa deliver specialized in room bath treatments if you wanted. The shower was an amazing rain style head though there was a window from the shower into the bedroom. Could have enjoyed a bit more privacy in the bathroom perhaps but it did not cause any issues. As a couple trip we were treated to daily fruit delivered to the room nightly chocolates and on the first day we arrived to a bottle of champagne in the room just for us. Food 55I wish I could tell you where to begin but truly every experience was outstanding. Started the night off at the Lobster House per the recommendation of the concierge that evening and that was spot on. Breakfast was great every day lunch was buffet style and any time you wanted food or drinks you could easily get it and any type you had like. I would have stayed longer just to eat more of the food hereBeach 55The private beach area of the Excellence Club was very nice relaxing private concierge service was on the beach to serve drinks or bring food from the pizzeria on site. The water was gorgeous perfect temperature. The sand appeared to be cleaned regularly to prevent seaweed from being an issue. You could see the seaweed pile up just off of the hotel property and it was clear that the hotel takes care of the beach as well. If you want one of the beds in the shade I would suggest getting to the beach bright and early we were never able to snag one. Pool 55Several options available for the pool including one swim up bar that is perfect for the afternoon once the sun hits it. The water of the pool was somewhat cooler than the ocean which was interesting. There is also an infinity pool near another bar though I did not spend any time at that pool. There is water all over the resort pools and decorations alike giving an amazing experience. Other Things to Know There is an onsite Ecological Park with many different species of birds and turtles along with feeding sites. The birds will come right up next to you if you let them. Parrots also seem to be present near the shops and are extremely friendly There are shops drug store convenience store souvenir cigar doctor. if you forget anything they likely will have it or can get it for you Spa on site is definitely worth the visit Daily activities happen if you get bored of the beach and pool horseback riding beach games volleyball etc Nightly performances are truly AMAZINGExcelence Club Perks Private Beach Private Check in out Club Access with daily snacks and top shelf liquor wines etc available for self serve along with coffee and tea. Indoor and air conditioned Higher quality drinks in room when compared to guests that are not in Excellence Club roms Spa hydrotherapy treatment included This seems to vary a bit but we had an absolutely amazing experience in the spa lasted about an hourOne of the best resort experience ever. Highly recommend it.", "offset": [3901, 4031], "date": "2015-04-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "406c3b2a-fb16-48d8-8ab5-8470d867d2e3", "sentence": "My wedding was muy excelente. I got married at the Excellence Punta Cana on May 2 2015 and it was wonderful. My review will start with the wedding first. I corresponded in emails with Yesica a year up to the wedding and she was wonderful. However I worked with Livia in person at the site and she was just as wonderful as well. She made me feel very special and everything felt easy and taken care of. We chose this resort because we wanted Adults only a smaller resort not near others so the beach would not have vendors or anything no reservations for the restaurants and the great reviews and the carriage ride for the bride D. Words of advice 1. You will most likely be taking pictures in sand so do not bother with heels or wedges find a beautiful pair of flats. I had wedges but they ended up being taken off for the beach and with my dress they take time getting on so I stayed barefoot even for pictures being taken in the Ecological Park. 2. Las Olas is great for a reception however they cook the food there for the reception and on our day it was more warm than usual and the breeze stopped so it was very hot when dancing. It did not ruin anyones fun but with the wedding dress on my legs were sweating bad underneath. Also we had 2 long tables and it did not leave much room for dancing for 25 people so the table set up is tricky. 3. If I could have done it again I either a would have hired my photographers for 8 hours I hired Severine and Renaud from PhotoSouvenir they are fantastic and very creative or taken the majority of the pictures before the ceremony. I did not want my husband to see me before the ceremony and because our ceremony started a little late we definitely felt rushed to get in group and couple pictures between the ceremony and reception. And pictures for the reception were limited due to that starting late because I had issues with my bustle and the time we spent eating. 4. I had my bridesmaids carry parasols and few days later after the wedding I was thinking of photo opportunities that we could have done but I did not think of beforehand so if you have photo opportunity ideas write them down5. I had the Mile Spa do my included hair and make up and they did a great job their English is not that great so bring pictures of what you want. I initially had loose pieces of curled hair around my face but it was too windy and we ended up pinning them up6. Reception food was okay I honestly took only a few bites because I was not hungry at all so I am not the best judge on that. As for the rest of the stay we had a great time note to readers my husband and i are not hard to please and we wanted a good time and no qualms so we were all about going with the flow. I had initially booked 9 days but I figured i should get there earlier to get the wedding stuff done and ended up booking that extra room too late so we had to pay for a more expensive room for one night. The wedding planner was nice enough to let us stay in that room for no extra charge. It was a junior suite with plunge pool. Ended up only using the plunge pool a handful of times due to wanting to be at the pool or beach and to have drinks. It was nice though when we did not have time between meeting family or having to be somewhere to lay out on the bed or in the pool for 1 2 hours. Our room 14010 was a smoking room I believe at least it smelled like it and there were a few imperfections but we really did not care. When we saw family and friends rooms though their rooms smelt a lot fresher and clean and those imperfections that were in our room were not in theirs. Service was great for the most part. The majority of the employees were very friendly and interactive with the guests. We tipped but never felt like they were expecting or waiting for one. They worked hard and always danced when a good song came on which was great Danza Kuduro anyone. Beach was fantastic. The water was more clear and turquioise blue than i was expecting and it turned out great in our wedding photos. Because we had family with us most of the time we did not hang out in the Excellence club area but that area definitely has more of the shaded huts open than the non Excellence club beach area. We did not hang by the pool much until the end of our stay after everyone left and we regret this because it was really nice dipping in the pool and swimming to the swim up bar for drinks Plus service was much better at the pool. Other reviews are definitely spot on with people reserving the best spots in the morning. We always found some spot and were always able to get a floaty those hide towards the quieter end of the pool. Wifi was spotty but in the rooms it was okay. I thought all the food was good except for the miso and yaki soba at Spice. My lunch buffet pasta was great. I had steak everyday and it was all cooked just to my liking. The drinks were great too. Loved the espresso and chocolate martini at the Martini bar as well as the Mudslides and Crazy Monkey. drinks. Their special honeymoon drink was great too. And again I regret not going to the lunch buffet earlier because I discovered their fantastic sangria there much too late. The grounds are gorgeous and on our last day we discovered the little weird looking birds would take our bread and throw it into the water themselves to try and attract the fish to catch them. It was hilarious. We also got to see the cranes catch the fish we were feeding. We also discovered the Sports Bar way too late a great area to hang out after the pool and either before after dinner. Our last night one of the great staff members Edward joined us in activities and we had such a fun timeOveral everyone in our party had a fantastically excellent time here and we all wished we could have stayed longer. It was definitely sad leaving. I know my husband and I will definitely be coming back. Thank you Excellence Punta Cana for making wedding honeymoon amazing.", "offset": [768, 947], "date": "2015-05-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "14bfe5d0-e02f-49b5-8a66-41221dcbd302", "sentence": "The service was amazing. We went the Excellence Punta Cana for our anniversary. We were immediately impressed with the resort and the staff as soon as we arrived. We were greeted with cool washcloths champagne and Welcome Home greetings. The Bellboy who carried our bags to our room walked us through all the features of the room room service the minibar etc. He did not rush anything and was very thorough. Most of the staff smiles and says hello when they pass you on the resort. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and always willing to help. Our stay was not without hiccups. We had an issue the first night with our bed which was not discovered until late. The front desk staff was super helpful and understanding and got us moved to another room with no issues. We rented a movie one night and our DVD player would not work. Again the front desk staff sent someone immediately to help us and got us a DVD player that would work. I do not expect everything to go perfectly and when it did not the help and service we received to make the issues better was phenomenal. Like I said we were celebrating our anniversary and reserved our special dinner at the Lobster House. They have a section where the seating looks out to the beach and ocean. Our special table was not set up there but I asked to be moved and they did and reset everything with a smile. The entire time I felt well taken care of safe and important to each person who worked there. We will definitely go back. It is beautiful clean great beach and the staff is so nice friendly and willing to help. The umbrellas provided came in handy. it is a long drive to get anywhere off the resort but there is beach horseback riding at the resort that is awesome. The see through shower bathroom is romantic but it does not provide for much privacy.

Hard beds Bad food. Just returned from a 5 day stay at Excellence. I had sent previous email requests to the hotel in regards to some special needs. The emails were responded to but our needs were not met. My husband has a prosthetic leg so I requested to be in a room that was centrally located as the grounds are quite large. We were put in the 90 building. Which was not the farthest away about four buildings from the lobby but not the closest either. I had also asked if crutches were available before arrival and if so for what cost. I was told they should be available and was not told for any cost. When we arrived they claimed they only had one crutch which would not work as my husband takes his prosthetic leg off to shower and at night and I did not want him to fall on a hard slippery floor. So they gave us a cane which would not help for our situation he still needed to hop. When in reality they had a pair of crutches in the medical room but said we would need to buy them for 120160. Are you kidding me. To use for 3 4 days. Cold blooded. At least at the ME in Cancun they offered crutches for a rental fee. I would have even paid 20 a day for 4 days for the crutches but they would not budge to any lower than 100. Smh. It would be smart and nice of the hotel to offer those products crutches for a rental fee as most would not bring the crutches back in their luggage. That way the hotel could make more money off renting one set of crutches and not demanding people buy them. Smh. Poor follow through service hard beds and bad food. I thought the bad reviews about poor food quality and hard beds were just people being overzealous. But unfortunately they were not. The food was poor we only had 2 good meals in 5 days and the beds were very hard. We could not get a good nights sleep unles we were very drunk. And we came back from vacation more tired than when we left. We will not be returning. If we ever do return to the DR we would read the reviews much more carefully and choose a hotel with hopefully better food possibly Dreams or the Hard Rock.", "offset": [1273, 1422], "date": "2015-10-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "332d90c1-2545-4102-9ccb-6c6572456c91", "sentence": "Third time at The Excellence Punta Cana. Although this was our third time here last visit was four years ago so I was looking at reviews before booking and I realized that FACTS rather than feelings would help one decide more easily. So I will try to be objective rather than subjective here we go\u2022 Trip from and back to airport was about 40 minutes each way and without stopping at other resorts on the way\u2022. We were greeted with Champaign upon arrival and the check in took less that 15 minutes\u2022. We saw a couple of rooms. They looked exactly the same king size bed couch Jacuzi mini bar fridge mini safe. Ample room for toiletries around the twin faucet sink. The shower and toilet seat were separated from the rest of the room by a very thin glass wall which provided zero privacy at a time when one needs it most. \u2022. We did not spend time on the beach because the waves were high and the undertow was strong. Also there was seawed\u2022. There are two pools the main one which is what appears in all the pictures of this resort and a cascade pool. All activities games music etc take place at the former while the latter is more secluded\u2022. There are three tennis courts two clay and one hard. You get some bad bounces on either but less on the hard court. The tennis pro is about level 40 and definitely loves the game\u2022. There is a \u201c bike tour \u201d every morning at 9AM. I used the quotes because you do n\u2019t really ride for more than 20 minutes round trip. What really happens is that you go off the resort onto the main road and then about half a mile on an unpaved road to a ranch where you stop park the bike and listen to the owners trying to sell you coffee tea and souvenirs for half an hour\u2022. There is a fully equipped gym with a couple of very knowledgeable and friendly atendants\u2022. The evening entertainment was OK including the shows. The one thing I could quantify is the noise level during most shows about 120 decibels at about 20 feet from the stage. It literally caused me pain so we moved to the back of the hall but then the view was not as good of course. I guess earplugs would have been a good compromise except we did n\u2019t have any with us. OK now for the subjective part. The people are extremely nice and willing to help. The grounds are very well maintained and the gardens are absolutely stunning. I have heard people complaining of mosquitoes just the week before our trip and we brought bug spray with us but did not have to use it even once. All in all was a good trip and who knows we might be back for a fourth time.", "offset": [1454, 1696], "date": "2015-11-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "2057959f-e485-4ea6-a519-9c4320d23974", "sentence": "This review is long overdue but better late than never. When searching for our resort the wish list was Adults only swim up bar casino and an available excursion to swim with the dolphins. We found all those things and more at Excellence Punta Cana. We visited Excellence 4162016 4232016 for a special birthday celebration. We opted for a 9 am vs 7 am flight out of Newark. BIG MISTAKE. The security lines were incredible literally snaking around the airport 3 xs. We were there 3 12 hours early and still almost missed our flight. The lines at the airport in the DR was almost as bad. We did not get to the hotel until 4 pm. We later met a couple form our neck of the woods who took the 7 am flight and were in their room enjoying drinks at noon. Coming home was the same routine. Lesson learned take the earlier flight and do not travel on SaturdayWe had booked private transportation to and from the hotel. It was difficult to find the transportation booth as they pretty much all look the same. You are barraged by the guys trying to give you free day passes ectto visit their resorts they were very pushy and have difficulty understanding the word no. The private transportation was advertised as new vehicles and English speaking drivers. Ugh. no and no. The vehicle was a mininvan not new but was clean and air conditioned. The driver did not speak any English. But was nice and efficient. It appears that Excellence is the furthest resort on that side of the island. Between 45 60 minutes from the airport. We did not really mind the drive as we got to see a lot of the countryside. We did take 3 excursions and since we were the furthest resort we would get picked up first and dropped off last. Again we did not mind we enjoyed the free sightseeing along the way but just something to keep in mind if your not a fan of the long open vehicle ride. When we finally arrived at the resort we were greeted with a cool washcloth and cold glass of champagne and fresh strawberries while our luggage was unloaded. We had a very short wait to check in. The lobby is beautiful open air with lots of plants fountains and comfortable seating. During our stay Reynaldo and David were awesome at the front desk. Reynaldo German was especially helpful whenever we needed anything has questions special requests a special thank you for getting me my Amaretto for our room. One of the reasons we chose the resort was because it was not a sterile looking high rise. We had a beautiful room on the 3rd floor. There are elevators and no wait but we used the stairs which were not steep and easy to manage. Our room overlooked the waterfall pool. The foliage is beautiful well maintained and mature. Our balcony was surrounded by lush plants and provided much privacy when sitting on the balcony. The waterfall was a bit noisy but shuts off at about 8 pm. The room was great plenty of drawers and enough closet space and adequate hangers. The room safe was easy to operate. Water pressure was great no issues with hot water. AC was adequate. Housekeeping staff was very nice. I left them a daily tip and little trinkets I had brought with me along with a note in Spanish telling them we appreciated their service. The mini bar was well stocked. There was juice soda water beer as well as 4 top shelf bottles of rum vodka wine and bourbon. I asked if I could get a bottle of amaretto for the room. I was but had to give up one of the other bottles no big deal as we do not drink bourbon. In our opinion the restaurants and food were just ok ish. we are pretty simple eaters so the fancy presentation is wasted on us. The service at the restaurants left a lot to be desired. It seemed there was not enough staff. I get that you are on vacation and not in a big rush but the wait to even have your order taken sometimes exceeded 45 minutes. We learned to order 2 drinks each when we were seated because it would take that long for them to get back to you. I thought this was one area where the language barrier was an issue. If you had questions about the menu it was very difficult to communicate as well as a simple request as I want my steak very rare was lost. Not sure if any of our food orders were completely correct. The beach was very nice clean no issues finding seating sun or shade. None of that saving a beach chair at 630 am crap. But as many other reviews have stated the ocean on that side of the island is extremely rough. Red flags almost every day we were there. So if you want to spend time in the ocean this is not the place to do it. We did go on 3 excursions swimming with the dolphins which I had arranged prior to getting to the resort. We also went zip lining and on the dune buggy tour that we booked through the hotel. I would recommend all three they were all really fun. The resort has a couple of tour booking agents on site that do a great job telling you what is included in the trip if there are extras such as additional charges for pictures etc. They did a great job of facilitating these trips. The tour buses were always on time the drivers friendly. As I mentioned earlier this resort is the furthest away so you will get picked up first and stop at other hotels to pick up others who are going on the same excursion and you will be the last to be dropped off. We enjoyed these rides immensely. Especially the longest one for the zip lining as you are going up into the mountains. You ride through some small towns and a small city. The tour guide whose name escapes me was awesome. The resort has a nature area where you can walk through on paths and see all the wildlife flamingos ducks geese turtles iguanas birds. I enjoyed it very much. The resort has a casino it is relatively small but just right in my opinion. There were 4 blackjack tables with a 5 minimum. About 10 slot machines a roulette table and a craps table. There were always seats available. The dealers were friendly drink service available. And it does not open until 7 pm which is nice no temptation to waste away the day there. The pools are beautiful and clean. We watched some of the staff cleaning the pool below us each morning. The pools were never overly crowded there was always seating available. Drink service was a little sketchy but the pool bars are close by so to us not a big deal. The swim up bar could use a few more seats but most of the time there were seats available. It was a fun atmosphere and not overly loud. We are not fans of obnoxiously loud music so unles you decided to sit right near where the pool DJ was located you were fine. The resort does have a nightclub on the property but we did not check it out we were too busy winning at the casino. There was some kind of entertainment each night by the main stage which is covered but open air. Very nice atmosphere. Our favorite part of the resort the Caf\u00e9 Caf\u00e9 Bar. It was a short walk from our room. it is outside but the seats are under the roof protective from the occasional rain shower and the sun. Big shout out to Beroa B Orlando and Luis Manuel bartenders who took great care of us during our stay. We spent a lot of time at that bar it was just vey comfortable close to our room the casino the pools the beach. We talked to a lot of friendly people. We even met a couple that live near us in New York. Could the resort use some updates. Yes but considering the friendliness and professionalism of the staff the cleanliness of the rooms and resort overall I think it was beautiful. Not a mega resort where you need shuttles to get around. Two things lacking in my opinion one of which can not be fixed. 1The food and food service could be improved upon. 2. a calm ocean to swim in.

Overall the EPC was fine. I will admit I do like nicer things and have a slight tendency to lean toward the snobby end of the spectrum but I was looking forward to a 5star experience after reading countless 5star reviews here. I personally was disappointed to discover things like the dated rooms bugs in our plunge pool upon arrival and cigarette burns in our terrace lounge bed. I wanted to provide honest feedback for the next person who is expecting a 5star luxury resort. You are walking into a beach resort with the environment more closely aligned with a cruise ship. Detailed review below. Quick list here. Pros. Excellence Club amenities beach beds servers on the beach and at the pool drinks a plenty spa 24 hour room service activities events offered they did a TOP NOTCH job with the Halloween party cold towels and champagne upon arrival to resort and to beach daily easy access to friendly concierge at all times. Cons. Food quality quantity tapas portions on occasion cleanliness outdated rooms you have to go out of your way to find out hours of operation of certain restaurants if you do not participate in the Excellence daily agenda water aerobics crafts dance lessons there is not much else to do unles you pay to go on outside excursions rough beach not able to swim we knew this ahead of time and did not care bathrooms are fishbowl meaning you could see through the shower to the toilet from the bed. We JUST got married and are not on that level yet so that made things awkward. Now the long version We paid for the Excellence Club amenities which offered some nice upgrades express check in a private beach with beds etc however only on our last day did we find out that the Excellence Club office had an upstairs clubhouse with food television playing the ball games and other nice amenities for members. It would have been nice had someone showed us that second floor room upon check in since you are already in the room. Additionally though they boast about 11 restaurants being on site please take note that the hours GREATLY vary with only one true restaurant option for breakfast a buffet the other being beachfront tiki bar esque option. Some restaurants are closed certain nights of the week and some are only open for dinner. My advice to travelers is to be strategic about learning the hours and plan your dinners accordingly. Work with the concierge who is always present friendly and available to speak with you. We missed the dining hours of the restaurants and got stuck with a limited room service menu a couple of times because of this. While on the topic of strange hours the pool closes at 7 pm and the casino opens at 730pm which I found odd for an adults only resort. I suppose this is to encourage you to go to dinner but during our rainy days it would have been nice to have the option to go to the casino. I think most pool dwellers needed to be cut off from the bar by 7 anyways. The bartenders at the pool were very accommodating very nice and made drinks quickly and however you had like them I ordered double gin and tonics which they obliged without hesitation. Mamajuana was dangerous to my sobriety but always in surplus. We did try and order a bottle of champagne from our 24 hour room service option but they declined our request and told us maybe tomorrow. um. whatEach day there is a schedule of events which is hit or miss. No thank you. I do not want to make beaded bracelets I am an adult. I will try and take your money in the Hold em tournament though. At 930 each night there is a show in the theater which is also hit or miss though I had a good time. The circus was GREAT think a scaled down Cirque du Soleil but the others were good. Michael Jackson worked his butt off though which I could certainly appreciate. They did put on a Halloween party while we were there which I thought was AWESOME. Buffet style food scary costumes a haunted house style entry and decorations that they worked on all day. NICELY DONE HERE. Really enjoyed this. The pool was nice warm always had a volleyball game going. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the pool and swim up bar. The polside and beachside concierge were very much welcoming and always had a surplus of towels when we went by. We never had to ask for a drink as there were always staff members walking by making sure we were happy which we appreciated. They were happy to bring waters or alcohol without pressure for tipping though I would recommend tipping because of how hard it is to walk in that sand. The beach was very enjoyable on the days that we could enjoy it a bit rainy during our stay. No shortage of chairs or beds no matter the time of day and we were always welcomed to the beach by someone who would put our towels out for us and walk us to our chairs with champagne lens cleaner and cold towels at the readyThe spa was good the complimentary hydrotherapy treatment for Excellence Club members was nice facility was clean massage was fine wait for the specials to come out before you pay the menu price. This was the only place at the resort that I feel that was kept up to par with cleanliness. The room itself was just a little dated and worn down. We used the jacuzi tub on our first night only to discover a brown foam forming when the jets were turned on. We immediately asked for the jacuzi to be cleaned along with the bug ridden plunge pool and when we used the tub the next day I broke out in a shoulder to toe rash. Think each pore was raised red and slightly itchy. I went to the front desk hoping for some sort of first aid kit cream until the mini market was open the next day to no avail. I asked to speak to the on site doctor hoping to again procure some cortizone to tide me over until morning. The doctor explained that her services were not included in the all inclusive no problem but that a medical consultation would cost me 185. I opted to suffer until morning. Needless to say I did not use the jacuzi again. I did use the plunge pool which I thought would have just been skimmed but again resulted in exacerbating my rash so I assume chemicals were applied. I tried to find out what type of cleaner was used but no one seemed to know or knew enough english to understand or convey the answer to me unfortunately. Note. I still have the rash. One good piece of advice that I can offer BUY BUG SPRAY UPON ARRIVAL. Wear it at all times. do not even go to bed without it. The sand fleas are brutal. Husband whoa that word is still new got over 30 bites on ONE LEG. These are NOT mosquito bites either they are large cystic looking bites. Keep in mind Zika is still a threat too. Just wear the spray and do not risk it. I personally did not have an issue with the bugs but he was annihilated by the sand fleas and started looking like a leper do not tell him I told you. The excursions outside of the resort varied based on the which travel company you used to book I suspect this is not the resorts fault. We used Olympus while another couple used Expedia and we each did the dune buggy tour. Their tour took them winding through the mountains and splashing through mud puddles led by a Canadian tour guide who now lives in DR. They advised us to upgrade to the Polaris for our tour based on the terrain instead of the standard dune buggy so we did. Our tour barely made it over 40 MPH and never went up a single hill. We stopped at a local shop where the guide heckled us to buy from the locals. We were able to jump in a cave swimming hole and visited another beach for about 20 minutes each which the other tour did not do and we thought it was great. Just wish we did not pay to upgrade to a more powerful vehicle when it was clearly not needed. With the Excellence resort you are one of the furthest from the airport meaning you will spend about an hour one way picking up and dropping off other travelers at different resorts for both tours and the trip to the airport. Just know this ahead of time. It was not a big deal to me but thought others may want to know the commute that they are in for with a further resort for flight purposes. There is a new Excellence that has been built called Excellence El Carmen but after speaking with a couple who stayed there since it was newer it sounded like they were still working out the kinks and opened a bit prematurely. As a matter of fact when we went by later they were pouring concrete and still seemed under construction. Glad we did not stay in that mess. Lastly staff will knock on your door at least 4 times daily for things like cleaning turn down service and an Excellence Club snack option this seems nice in THEORY but my goodness we are on our honeymoon please stop knocking on the door. What a buzkil. Our maid was SO SO sweet though and did a great job. She was wonderful.

We revisited the Excellence from October 22 to November 2. We had booked to go to a different hotel but changed our minds because the reviews of it were so bad. We decided to go back to the Excellence as our previous two visits had been very successful and we needed somewhere we could trust to give us the relaxation we needed. Once again we had a really wonderful time. We were treated very well as we were returning guests and some staff remembered us. We had emailed ahead and requested the alcohol selection in the room was swapped out for the particular spirits we enjoy and when we arrived our choices were already in the room with the addition of a bottle of champagne and a bowl of fruit. We felt we were valued as returning guests our room had been swapped out too for one with a really nice view and location. Nothing seemed too much trouble. The room was lovely clean and fresh with a very comfortable bed snowy linen and fluffy bright white towels. Also a good selection of toiletries. Food is of a good standard and well presented. The restaurants are pleasant and we never had to wait long to be either seated or served. The grounds and beach areas are kept beautifully clean and the ecology park with a jogging trail is a lovely place to wander about in but beware of the mad geese they can be persistent but just want you to feed them. There are several boxes around the park area filled with left over bread to feed the birds with. Entertainment and activities are provided all day and there are the usual resort type shows each evening. No shortage of things to do. The music during the shows is a little too loud needs turning down a little. One or two little things could be better there could be an evening buffet maybe all evening meals are in the restaurants and sometimes you do not feel like formal dining. The pizza restaurant could maybe be a coffee shop patiserie ice cream parlour in the day time. Sometimes the top shelf alcohol in the bars does not taste as it should more like the local stuff. The resort has been around for many years now and is maybe getting a little tired however I imagine trying to keep a resort this size in tip top order is an almost impossible task.

My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at Excellence Punta Cana from 7 14 December 2017 in an Excellence Club Junior Swim Up Suite in building 4. This was our first visit to EPC having previously stayed at Excellence El Carmen Excellence Riviera Cancun and Excellence Playa Mujeres all at club level. In Punta Cana we have also been guests at the Majestic Elegance the Royalton Punta Cana Sensimar Bavaro and Iberostar Bavaro and in Mexico we have enjoyed a recent vacation at Secrets Akumal. It has been a true privilege to have celebrated our anniversary at such a breathtaking location. The club swim up rooms at EPC are located in buildings 1 2 and 4 set around the upper and lower levels of the cascade pool. Prior to arrival I emailed Guest Relations as I have done on our previous trips to Excellence hotels requesting a room with afternoon sun stating a preference for building 1 and asking if it was possible for the bottles of whiskey and rum in the room to be substituted for Disarono and Malibu. I received a prompt and friendly reply from Yiefrid Guest Service Manager acknowledging my requests. Whilst accepting that room requests are subject to availability I remained hopeful that our location and liquor preferences would be met as they had been on each of our previous stays at EEC ERC and EPM. On arrival we checked in at the Club and were advised that we had been allocated a room in building 4. I referred to my email communication and asked if by any chance there was a room available in building 1 or 2. We were informed that the swim ups in both buildings were fully occupied for 2 nights however we could enquire again about availability on day 3. This was mildly disappointing news but certainly not a major issue. We were shown to our allocated room in building 4 and were again a little disappointed to note that our request to swap the in room liquor for alternative options had not been met. Despite two subsequent visits to the Club to reiterate the request to exchange the liquor we did not succeed in swapping the bottles. Neither did we ever receive a plate of petit fours in the evening which is listed as a Club perk. None of these issues adversely impacted our holiday but I am mentioning them merely to highlight the contrast in service level compared to our previous experience at the other three Excellence hotels where our room location and alcohol preferences were in place on arrival. Rather than pack up and relocate on day 3 of a 7 night holiday. we chose to fully unpack and settle happily into room 403 for the duration of our stay. The outside deck overlooked the lower level of the cascade pool and remained in the shade all day. We had booked our accommodation directly via the Excellence Resort website and requested the anniversary package which included a special evening meal on the beach or at a restaurant of choice and champagne breakfast in bed. We provided a copy of our marriage certificate at check in. Maybe it is left for guests to organise but we were not contacted about the anniversary breakfast or meal and so the evening before our anniversary we went to the Club to ask about the arrangements. We were asked to chose a restaurant venue for the dinner and to select from a menu containing several set meal options. The following evening we arrived at Chez Isabele at the agreed time of 830pm and were informed with a hint of admonishment that we were expected at 630pm. There had presumably been some miscomunication between the Club and restaurant staff. We duly produced the reservation slip for 830pm that we had been given and were soon seated at a table decorated with heart shaped balloons. We found the lighting very bright and overall this was my least favourite for ambiance and atmosphere of all four Chez Isabele restaurants that we have visited. The meal and service however were excellent. The mesmerising beach and secluded location of EPC sets it apart in my opinion from the other three Excellence hotels as does the ecological park which we really enjoyed. do not miss it. The hotel is set on a wide beach front plot and views of the beautiful beach and ocean caught my breath and had me snapping photos everywhere I walked. I was aware of the lively water conditions at the resort before we booked however I did miss swimming in the ocean which was too choppy for me. That said many guests enjoyed the waves at the waters edge. The sea is much calmer around the bay to the right of the resort. We were blessed with amazing weather during our stay with only one cloudy afternoon. We spent most of our days at the new Club pool where we were well looked after by Andreas Sonia and Hendrux. As the pool is really only suitable for cooling off and relaxing I used the fabulous main pool everyday for swimming. The new Magna restaurant for Club guests offers fabulous views from the terrace and beats the location of Magna at El Carmen hands down. We also took frequent advantage of the pretty nice coffee available at the new Aroma cafe. On the topic of beverages we thought that the variety of cocktails on offer was more varied here than at other Excellence resorts. I believe the cocktail menus were slightly different at each bar. We are always very impressed with the range and quality of food at Excellence hotels but I am admittedly easy to please. As noted by other guests some staff are yet to familiarise themselves with the menus and we encountered some minor issues communicating and receiving our chosen selections. Whilst this was a little frustrating it was by no means an universal issue and I am sure it is one that will resolve in time. In our opinion the quality of the entertainment at EPC was high and compared favourably with other Excellence hotels. We particularly liked the open plan layout and flow between the Martini bar theatre area and beachfront Prelude Terrace bar. In contrast we really missed the presence of live bands by the pool or Las Olas during the day. For anyone trying to decide between Excellence hotels you will have a fabulous time at any of them. In the Dominican Republic we much preferred the very spacious Club swim up rooms at El Carmen but missed the lazy river style pool. The location of EPC is special and in my opinion surpasses that of El Carmen. but I missed swimming in the ocean. In Mexico we preferred the beautiful setting of Secrets Akumal to both ERC and EPM. In summary despite the minor service shortcomings we experienced I would wholeheartedly recommend EPC. The stunning beach and romantic setting may well compel us to return here in preference to any other Excellence hotel in the future. In the meantime we are blessed and excited to be visiting Secrets Cap Cana in 2018. I wish you an amazing and memorable holiday at EPC such as we enjoyed.", "offset": [3906, 4076], "date": "2017-12-31", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "ca1dd4c4-1a54-45d8-b081-2f0fd960f78f", "sentence": "First visit to Excellence Punta Cana amazing will be back.

Our week at Excellence PC April 1 8 2018 was even better than we had hoped. Perfect weather and a beautifully maintained beach. I can not say enough positive things about this resort the villas restaurant natural environment and the people who make Excellence so incredibly special. About us Couple late 20s Canadian escaping stressful careers for a week in the sun. No previous experience will all inclusives. We are outdoorsy and fairly adventurous people. We like laid back vacations and were not looking for extreme luxury although we feel like we found it here. We did NOT purchase an Excellence Club package and we did not book any excursions for this trip. The highlights1. PEOPLE. An enormous thank you to all the staff who made our first visit to the Caribbean unforgettable. Especially Dolores at Oregano who welcomed us on our first night Elizabeth at Agave We miss you already Carlos and Christian at the concierge desk endlessly helpful Edgar maker of the best burgers and delicious paella at Las Olas and younger Edgar who made so many delicious mango margaritas for me on the beach I lost count and Alfredo who brought us amazing room service on our last night at the resort. While almost all guests leave tips none of the staff ever seem to expect it on more than one occasion we had to chase down our server bartender attendant to give them a tip and thank them. They are always sincerely grateful to receive anything. The staff go above and beyond to help you whenever and however they can. 2. RESORT VILLA. We arrived at the resort around 4 PM and were greeted with champagne and cold towels. Our luggage was tagged and collected by staff. Check in took approximately 10 minutes. Our room was not quite ready so we headed to a bar then wandered the beach absolutely in awe of the natural beauty of this place. By the time we received our keys our luggage had already been delivered to our room. We were given a corner unit top floor in Villa 9 garden mountain view. The room was modern and beautifully appointed. Our deck overlooked the canopy of mature palm trees and offered a glimpse of mountains to the south west. We greatly enjoyed the jacuzi tub and rainfall shower. Provided toiletries were very nice. Maid service restocking of the mini bar and turn down service was always on time and thorough. We had no issues with humidity air conditioning or the in room safe \u2013 everything worked as expected. We did manage to blow a fuse in our room but upon calling the concierge it was attended to and power restored in under 10 minutes. The bed linens and provided robes were very comfortable. Great television selection although we did n\u2019t watch too often and built in USB chargers on either side of the bed were nice touches. The landscaping for this property is beautifully thought out and very lush. The urge to take photos of EVERYTHING is overwhelming3. BEACH POOL. The ratio of loungers and palapas to guests is extremely high. We never struggled to find a great place to set up camp during the day. The beach was enormous and breezy in a good way and while portions of the water were often red flagged for swimming the Excellence Club area was only ever yellow flagged perfect for swimming if you do n\u2019t mind big waves. Many people rented surf boards during our stay as well. Towels were restocked constantly although the supply does get low by the end of the day. We could not decide whether the pool was heated or not but regardless the temperature was perfect whether it was 8 AM and 7 PM the current pool open hours. We did not use or seek out pool floats but they seemed to be in high demand. There are several pools connected by river like paths one section of pool has a volleyball net and entertainment staff run games throughout the day here beer pong name that song kayak races while the other sections are deeper and better for swimming. We were in the ocean and in the pool daily. We were amazed to find that we had full strength wifi connectivity all along the beach in front of the resort even at the shoreline4. RESTAURANTS. We ate breakfast at the Kitchen Table buffet daily and were very happy with the freshness quality and variety of foods. It was fun to sample traditional Dominican breakfast foods. The crepes and waffles fresh tropical fruit mimosa and juice bar and coffee were exceptionally good. We ate lunch every day at Las Olas beach side grill often getting take away containers for picnics on the beach. The special menu changes daily and is posted in the morning on the boardwalk cheeseburgers nachos wood oven fired pizza salads and desserts are available every day. We tried most restaurants for dinner. Our favorites were Agave Mexican and the Grill Steak. We were also impressed with Chez Isabele and Spice. The vegetarian spring rolls at Spice Pan Asian were incredible. We visited Aroma for iced coffee pastries milkshakes and gelato ice cream frequently and enjoyed everything we sampled5. DRINKS. My partner does not drink much and I am a creature of habit. I drank mango margaritas and coco locos those beautiful drinks served in coconuts. almost exclusively all week. That being said the cocktail menu is extensive. Beach drink service was extremely efficient and we were approached every 20 minutes or so by a server offering re fills. The bar at Las Olas and the Sol bar were my usual stops when I wanted to get a drink myself6. ACTIVITIES. This trip we got a little too comfortable relaxing and reading by the beach and so we did not take advantage of a fraction of the activities offered by the resort. We took walks through the ecological park to visit the flamingos and parrots and played a few rounds of pool in the activity building. Archery was not available during our visit. We visited the gym and yoga studio both of which were very nice but did not take any of the offered classes. We saw many groups horseback riding on the beach but did not sign up for it. We did take a very long hike westward down the beach past 2 3 smaller resorts before running into some interesting volcanic rock formations and very big waves that forced us to turn around. Walking east from the resort we soon ran into some locals using the beach for a barbecue it is federally owned land and decided not to intrude on their festivities. In the evening we enjoyed the Pop show Michael Jackson tribute and the Fire Show. We missed the Circus Broadway Brazil and Burlesque performances on other nights but heard good things from others. One evening there was an outdoor Dominican buffet dinner but we had other plans. It looked like a great time. A few observations1. You can not pack enough sunscreen aloe after sun. It is available at the resort but expensive eg 30 USD for a medium sized bottle of Banana Boat 2. Shampoo conditioner shower gel and moisturizer are all provided in the hotel room in larger sizes than expected and will be replenished during your stay. 3. The parrots on site are lovely to look at and will hop up on your arm if you catch them at the right time. However the red macaw will try to steal anything that is not firmly attached to your person sunglasses bracelets necklaces hats hair elastics etc. are all up for grabs and he will not give up. Also he bites. 4. After it rains there will be some bug activity on the beach in our case it rained overnight once and we noticed some sand fleas in the early morning before the sand dried out. Consider bringing bug spray andor Afterbite5. While our A C was fine based on other reviews we did bring a couple large Damprid packs as a precaution. We heard others had requested and received dehumidifiers for their rooms but there are likely not enough to go around. If this would be a big issue for you consider bringing something to dehumidify your room should you need it6. We tipped our maid and mini bar stockists and dinner servers daily and bartenders and servers hostesses at the buffets intermittently. We went through about 100 in tips for the week. Bring lots of 1 bills. It \u2019s a good idea to bring extra cash for the mandatory 10 tourist card20 exit tax unles covered by your tour operator vacation package and about 70 to cover the cost of a cab shuttle to the airport should your pre booked shuttle not arrive this happened to us \u2013. NO fault of the resort Air Transat dropped the ball but the resort staff helped us arrange for another shuttle and saved us from missing our flight7. The local vendors on the beach just outside the grounds of the resort are very friendly and VERY determined to sell to you. One particularly enterprising vendor Daniel brought his sweet little puppy Suzie to the beach to meet and play with you to persuade you to visit his shop \u2013 we \u2019re suckers for dogs so it worked on us and we bought some larimar jewelry from him. The vendors are not aggressive and if you say you are n\u2019t interested they will retreat. They will also happily barter with you over prices and you should do so \u2013. the mark up is high. That said if bartering makes you uncomfortable the resort offers several boutiques with a wide range of souvenirs8. The man with parrots on the beach wants you to pay for photographs with his birds. They \u2019re well trained but we decided to take our chance with the free parrots that as said above may bite you in the resort gardens9. MEN MUST HAVE LONG PANTS TO MEET DRESS CODE. You have been warned bring khakis you will melt in denim. Pretty much anything but shorts goes for women. Sorry guys10. You can walk into any restaurant without any wait if you arrive shortly after they open for dinner. Lines start to form around 730 8 PM but it gets quieter again around 9 PM. TLDR While everyone \u2019s experience will be a little different the overly negative reviews for this resort are in our opinion complete nonsense. Excellence PC gave us the vacation of our dreams. We were looking at booking our next trip within 30 minutes of getting home.

We stayed at Excellence Punta Cana at the end of November 2018 for 7 nights in a 1st floor Excellence Club Room room 107Resort overall. The resort is clean and tidy and the layout means the pools restaurants bars and half the guest rooms have views of the beach ocean. The orientation of the resort means there are no sunrises or sunsets over the sea which would be a shame for wedding guests. The resort has an eco park area with birds and other animals which is a nice area to visit. The resort has a spacious gym with a good selection of equipment. Check in We arrived late evening from Europe. We found the check in a little laborious and would have preferred a quick check in rather than be given sparkling wine and a full resort orientation at 10 pm. Everyone on our transfer bus was in an Excellence Club room so we were taken to the dedicated concierge which took forever. Room. We stayed in a 1st floor Excellence Club ocean view room in block 1 room 107. The room was spacious and well equipped USB plugs by the bed means no adapters for phones etc. The Excellence Club upgrade adds premium minibar toiletries to the room and these were generally restocked daily. Room service was quick and efficient with plenty of choice. When we arrived late on the first evening the room was not overly clean smeary shower dusty surfaces but this was much better after the first housekeeping visit. Whilst half the rooms have an ocean view it is actually more a view of the pool area than directly of the beach. The room is also very open plan and there is no door between the room itself and the shower area and a sliding frosted glass door to the toilet which does not provide much privacy. Restaurants. We chose Excellence Punta Cana as there are numerous a la carte restaurants to choose from and no need to visit a buffet. We found the Excellence Club restaurant Magna to be the best option for breakfast and dinner as it is the only restaurant with properly outside seating. The coffee shop cafe Aroma offers good coffee cakes and ice cream and is a great place to visit to break up the day. The main issue with the restaurants at Excellence Punta Cana is that there is no booking system. This means you have to venture for dinner early to ensure you can get a table. There is a reservation system once you arrive at a full restaurant however you can not specify a time to return could be 15 mins to 2 hours. On multiple nights of our stay there were restaurant closures due to a wedding which caused 2hour waits for a table at some of the more popular a la carte evening offerings. One evening the Magna restaurant ran out of both red and white wine before 9 pm and did nothing to resolve and on another the Oregano pizza restaurant ran out of beer at lunch. We enjoyed Magna and The Grill most and were most disappointed by Agave and The Flavour Market. The buffet breakfast was good and the lunch at the beach bar was basic but effective. Overall the food quality ranges from disappointing to average good and we were not enormously impressed. Bars. The resort has numerous bars along the pool and a couple of others within the Resort. These serve a very similar selection of drinks and there are some better brand spirits on offer. The bar within the Excellence Club room serves slightly premium spirits. The issue with the bars is that identical drinks from the same bar vary dramatically in quality and taste depending on time of day and server. We were pleased to discover the Excellence Club bar offered fever tree tonic water however the next day this had run out and there was no more for the remainder of our stay. Pools beach. The pools and beach are clean and tidy. We especially liked the comfortable loungers within the Excellence Club area. The sea is fairly rough given the location of the Dominican Republic so the resort does not offer much in the way of swimming or watersports. There are multiple reviews mentioning a seaweed problem however whilst we saw seaweed on the beach it was constantly being cleared and did not impact in the slightest. Service We were a little disappointed by the service at the resort. The staff only seem interested in serving tipping American guests which can mean long waits at the bar and to be served at your lounger. Staff can also be a little noisy to appeal to American guests and groups. We found that staff are friendly with what they know however more often than not will forget. misunderstand your order request having seemed to understand. This was the case across the resort. The resort attracts a lot of Americans who fully utilise the all inclusive offering. This means numerous groups of loud obnoxious very drunk middle aged Americans by mid afternoon which makes the pool area a lot less relaxing. If you are an exuberant American looking for lots of food and drink then Excellence is perfect however if you are not used to this cultural particularity then it can be a little overbearing. Overall we had a good stay at Excellence Punta Cana. There are many aspects of the resort which are 5 or could very easily be elevated to 5 with small improvements. The resort is slightly let down by the quality and inconsistency of the service and food. Considering the price bracket of the resort and how it is marketed a la carte only adults only luxury resort we would expect staff to better understand the service offerings in each of the restaurants and bars. We had a free upgrade to the Excellence Club as part of our travel package but would have been disappointed to have paid extra for this upgrade. Other than access to the Magna restaurant by key card there is nothing separating the Excellence areas from the standard areas and any guest could access the Excellence pool bar beach.", "offset": [429, 520], "date": "2018-12-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "f85effc0-a070-48e9-a0b5-5d0b178f62cc", "sentence": "Enjoyed our vacation but wo n\u2019t be back. 3 out of 5My wife and I spent two weeks here beginning January 31 2019.

Our room had a plunge pool. I particularly enjoyed our semi private area around the plunge pool because it was sheltered from the wind. We had quite a few windy days. Unfortunately our room was directly across the hall from an elevator a staircase an ice machine and a staff supply closet. That meant that a few late nights sounded like party time at the stairs elevator. Some mornings it sounded like the staff was taking inventory in the supply closet.

Now that I have had the moment to sit back and truly reflect on our EPC experience I want to try and be as specific as possible in hopes that I can shed true light on EPC and our time there. I hope this review will help future guests during their stay at EPCWe decided to travel here for our honeymoon in June of 2019. We stayed Excellence Club in the Honeymoon Suite w Rooftop Terrace Ocean Front room. It was ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. On our roof there was a private pool shower lounger bed and sofa and a gulf view. Inside you had 247 unlimited room service with two separate restrooms a jacuzi tub with gulf view and petals everywhere. it was PURE BLISS. It was so romantic in every way and the details. I can not stress the atmosphere enough. Ozuna showed us around and welcomed us. He was there every step of the way to make sure we had anything and everything we needed. It was so nice to see so many SMILING faces who took such pride in their work. Never did we see someone not smiling and EVERYONE WAS WORKING. We also did not see a single worker on their phone. Our mini bar was stocked daily our plants were watered regularly our bed was made and turned down daily our room was cleaned and stocked daily the service was IMPECABLEIf that does not sound heavenly enough the resort experience was absolutely perfect in every way. There was something to do for everyone. We did decide to do some excursions they were great and I will get to those but the service at EPC was STELLAR. Muy excelent\u00e9 as they say. Also I want to note that our resort was not really a party location. It was very quiet and mosts guests were between 30 and 70. There was one club Alegia the disco but we only went there for a brief moment. We did enjoy the daily games and activities by the pool. Niki Sheiki CoCa Cola Evan and Junior were ALL so much fun and we really enjoyed getting to know them. They made us feel like we were home. Junior even came and set down with us for a bit. He went into his background and told us how he has had returning visitors for as long as 25 years. We enjoyed dancing with him and getting to know him. The staff learned your name after just a day or two. We loved meeting JC Luz too. He was usually behind the bar his drinks were delicious and he always took care of us. Also available are the cabana bungalow beds out by the beach. I would HIGHLY recommend this. They usually come with a massage for 90 a DAY. it is SO reasonable and so worth it. They will even bring you a fruit tray champagne and unlimited drinks. The nightlife was absolutely incredible too. ALL OF THE ACTORS ACROBATS DANCERS SINGERS WERE SO TALENTED. I would definitely recommend the nightly shows. That brings me to the next thing food and drink. ALL were all delectable and you had a huge selectionl We especially enjoyed our romantic dinner at Chez Isabele and the hibachi show at Spice. You do need to get to the concierge early one morning to reserve your spot for hibachi that night. We really really really enjoyed the food at all nine of the restaurants. I will say I think guests are meant to take advantage of breakfast and dinner rather than lunch because there are not many choices for lunch. it is mainly quick snacky foods for lunch. WIth that being said I would HIGHLY recommend Magna and The Kitchen Table buffet for breakfast. Both are DELICIOUS. I guess I should mention that our stomaches were semi upset throughout the trip though. I think that was a result of the excessive drinking and eating that we were doing along with being out in the sun. I feel like this is common for visitors. I would suggest bringing Imodium. Mid week we decided to take advantage of the spa services at Mil\u00e9 spa and WOW. We can not praise this experience enough. We did the 80 minute couples massage with hydrotherapy and we added pedis. My favorite part was sitting in the warm chair outside as it heated your body from the outside in during the transition between the hydrotherapy session and the full body massage. This part also consisted of lavender spritz and a head massage that eventually ended with your head wrapped in warm towels as you listened to the birds chirping and felt the cool breeze while you dozed off into tropical bliss. Our masseuses Rosa and Meiki sp were the BEST. They used the perfect amount of pressure and worked out all of our problem areas. They were so sweet. We truly enjoyed ALL of our spa services and would highly recommend. As for our excursions we went to Scape Park in Cap Cana and we also did the booze cruise both about a 45 minute drive from the resort depending on the amount of stops. The Hoyo Azul Blue Hole at Scape Park was the initial reason for planning this trip. it is described as a hidden cenote with the most astonishingly turquoise waters nature can offer. Here you also had unlimited cave swimming and exploring ziplining water sports activities and you also got to witness various plants animals in their natural habitat. This excursion lasted all day about 830 am 5 pm plus drive time and came with a buffet drink for 150 a person. I would HIGHLY recommend Scape Park in Cap Cana for people of ALL ages including kids teens. WARNING Bring tennis shoes and flip flops or swimming shoes. You will do A LOT of walking in Scape Park. but it is worth itWe also did the booze cruise. It was fun. Before the booze you loaded on a catamaran which took you out snorkeling for 30 minutes and then cruised out to a beautiful tropical sandbar and where you continued drinking and dancing. Our Captain Roberto was GREAT at what he did and made sure everyone was having a good time while still putting safety first. The staff here also gave phenomenal service and made sure your drink was always full. This excursion is about 75 a person. Our only complaint was that we paid an additional 50 for professional pictures that were taken during our cruise and when we got home we realized only about 8 pictures were on our disc. It was supposed to be about 20. We called and are waiting to hear back from the company. OVERALL this was the most amazing trip we have ever been on and we are so GLAD we chose EXCELLENCE PUNTA CANA for our honeymoon. We can not wait to go back to EPC and experience the other Excellence locations as well.", "offset": [5148, 5240], "date": "2019-06-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "2777e22b-b19c-43a7-ae5b-9f99c7850af5", "sentence": "12 Days in Paradise. Just back from this hotel and we had an amazing time. the hotel has an excellent layout as you could view the sea beach wherever you where on the complex. The gardens and park area were lovely and the staff were always cleaning the areas they complex was spotless. We met the manager on a number of occasions and she came across as being very passionate about good customer service which we received. We ate in nearly all the restaurants and the food was good quality although sometimes we struggled to get some branded drinks. This was not a major issue as there was always an alternative. I would definitely recommend the chocolate afternoon tea party they were very good. We travelled as a party of 6 and the staff called us family and to be honest by the time we left we felt it too special mention to Joel from the beach bar always smiling Elizer and Mercedes from Magna. Although all the staff were very friendly and could not do enough for you. We were sad to leave and would definitely recommend people to stay at this place it is Excellent \u2764 \ufe0f.", "offset": [176, 285], "date": "2019-07-27", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "98057ebf-d185-42cd-81ca-cf147662c51f", "sentence": "So so. We stayed at Excellence Punta Cana EPC from Saturday Sept 14 to Sunday Sept 22. It was our first visit to EPC although we have stayed twice in Excellence Playa Mujeres EMP in Mexico. We chose EPC because some friends were also visiting at the same time. All in all this was a so so experience compared to our experiences at EPM. The following is our impression of the good and the not so good. Food. The Good Food was exceptionally good. We never had a bad meal experience in any restaurant. Meals were high quality service was excellence and wait times were minimal. In my opinion the food is superior to the meals at EPM. Excellence Club restaurant \u201c Magna \u201d had the best menu we think. Chez Isabele is second Oregano third the Grill is 4th the Spice \u201c Hibachi \u201d was unremarkable and last in our favorites. We never had a chance to eat at the others. Also Las Olas for lunch was a real treat and the food at the Sports Bar was so so but satisfying for late night snacking. The Bad Because of low occupancy blamed on the bad press for the Dominican Republic only 3 or 4 of the 9 restaurants were open on any night. And you wo n\u2019t know if the restaurant you want is open until late the night before. The Pools The Good EPC \u2019s Club area is not isolated like the one in EPM and is very large with two great pools. Plenty of chairs with umbrellas. Not so many floats. The Bad. The swim up bar usually centrally located and the focal point of activity in most resorts is tucked away behind two restaurants on a narrow and often shady stretch of the long winding pool. Was not appealing and we never went there. Did n\u2019t look like too many others found it either. The Room. The Good We stayed in an ocean view Excellence Club room with private pool. It was two upgrades from the EC suite with swim up that we booked. It cost an extra 100 per night after negotiations. We could have upgraded one level for free but really liked the room we chose 309. Spacious close to everything and yet at the end of the property and private. Would recommend Excellence Club if you have a few extra dollars. The Bad There is a bathtub in the room in front of the TV without separation or partition unlike the hot tubs at EPM. A bit odd although I recognize the romantic possibilities it just seemed out of place in the way. It was extremely humid and the room seemed damp even with the AC performing satisfactorily. We asked for and got a fan for our room a bit noisy and we put it in the bathtub. We heard that you can request a dehumidifier for your room. I would suggest it as our dirty laundry was getting rank when we packed up. Entertainment. The Good \u2013. The performers were very talented and energetic. A different performance theme every night mostly dancing while lip synching the music. But on a couple of nights the actually had singers and one night was a circus theme with a trapeze act. The shows were pretty short 45 minutes or so and started at 930. The Bad The theatre is very very poor. Chairs are uncomfortable and the cloth cushions smell moldy humidity again. They have no ceiling fans in the main center seating areas so it gets hot. The absolute worst thing about this resort and our experience is in fact the idiotic way the stage is lit I should I say not lit. Most performances are in the dark because they do not use or have effective spotlights near the stage. To make matters worse the stage set BEHIND the performers has a band of multicolored lights blinking at the audience distracting to say the least. It seems the only major spot light is about 100 feet from the stage. On circus night someone in the audience actually yelled \u201c turn on the lights \u201d and a few minutes later the lone ineffective spot light was switched on. They need a new lighting technician andor proper equipment because not everyone can see in the dark. Service Quality. The Good All service staff were most excellent especially the bartenders. Low occupancy did not seem to keep the resort from staffing up and all service was timely and friendly. The EC Concierge was very helpful and performed numerous tasks for us 247. Do n\u2019t forget to bring plenty of small bills for tips. You do n\u2019t have to tip for each drink but probably should do so routinely throughout the day and at each meal. The Bad Our room safe failed to open on two days during our stay and the technician has a difficult time getting it open once. While in EC they will stock your mini bar with the booze beer and mixers for which you ask. But they must not record it because they do n\u2019t always replenish what you want. If you are a Coke drinker beware the real Coke is in glass bottles Diet Coke Coke Light in plastic 20 oz. bottles that looks like regular Coke. Messed up a few cocktails at first. The Spa. The God We got a couples 50minute massage the second day we were there. The massage was excellent and the ladies in the spa are very skilled. The Bad \u2013 The EC Concierge \u201c gave \u201d us a special 60 spa discount good only in the first 24 hours. So we went the next morning and forgot our coupon but they still gave us 50 discount which made our couples massage 18. regular price 239. We realized later that the discount was in error and eventually the Concierge fixed it. BUT \u2026. All week long there were daily specials offered even HALF PRICE on one day. Plus they have spa missionaries wandering the pool areas negotiating discounted spa services. So we clearly were duped into thinking our \u201c discount \u201d was so special we just had to book the next day. before we had a chance to see the better offers. So beware. The property in general. The Good \u2013 Love the boardwalk that runs the entire length of the beach great for exercise. Excellent workout facilities as well. Wonderful \u201c Ecological Park \u201d with walking trails plants flowers water features lots of birds. You can feed a flamingo if you have a mind to. The Bad \u2013. The beach at the EC end was narrow and difficult to use. very soft wet sandy. Granted it was stormy while we were there and being on the Atlantic side of the island the surf was very rough. Not really a beach to use as much as one to look at from the many thatched roof covered chairs on higher ground. The restrooms by the main EC pool and Disco Club were disgusting. They smelled terrible appeared dirty because they were so old and not air conditioned. Again they were nothing compared to the beautiful restrooms at EPM that were always immaculate. In summary if we did not have Excellence Playa Mujeres to compare we might have a higher opinion of Excellence Punta Cana. But while EPM is 45 to 5 stars in our opinion we think EPC is 4 stars at best credit to the food quality and staff to make it that high. Its 20 years old without latest designs or amenities and probably needs the economy to recover so they can do some upgrades. But the people are great and if you \u2019ve never been to another Excellence resort you will probably love it. If you go to EPC you should upgrade to Club level to receive the most excellent service and have access to the best pools.", "offset": [5730, 5824], "date": "2019-09-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}]}
