Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Our original assigned room had a broken toilet and no view. The staff gave us drinks at the bar while they got us a newly renovated room with a pool side view. We were hoping to stay in the colonial city to be walking distance to all historic buildings and museums but this turned out to be a fantastic choice. The breakfast buffet was outstanding with a cook to make you pancakes or scrambled eggs revoluetos. A knowledge of Spanish is helpful. The pool is fantastic. We had not brought swimsuits but went to a nearby mall and purchased them. It was a great place to relax and the water was the perfect temperature.

Bottled water was not available the 2nd day. And the elevators required a key for all floors despite the signs in the elevator indicating it was only needed for certain floors.

Off to a very disappointing start in our first Barcelo experience. We are currently mid stay at a Catalonia hotel in La Romana but drove to Santo Domingo for a friends wedding tonight. Check in went smoothly but we were disappointed to open the door to our Executive Club room and find a king bed. We had taken the precaution of calling ahead to be certain we had have two doubles because there was no way to indicate when booking online we were assured that with four people sharing the room they would accommodate us with two beds. Calls and face to face conversations with management have stalemated at they will put a portable twin in the room. At first the front desk insisted that our reservation was only for two adults until I showed them a printout of our reservation.

Maintenance quickly came and we were reassigned a room but they only felt 34 dollars was an appropriate compensation for the inconvenience. Even though the rooms were on average 200 dollars. No follow up was done by management to check on our new rooms or apologize for the inconvenience.

The hotel is very well located close to everything and a few nice restaurants within walking distance. If there is anything I disliked is the fodQuatro Formagi pizza was simply horrible looked like an amateur home pizza and tasted as suchand not even well baked.
