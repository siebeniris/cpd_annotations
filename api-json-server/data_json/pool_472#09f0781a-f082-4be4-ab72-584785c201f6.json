Everything else was provided there for us for a fee. towels beach chairs umbrellas even drinks. Bed was comfortable Pool was great clean warm lots of towels complimentary water and apples. Cons All relatively minor really. The bathroom that some have mentioned was definitely a con. In our room the bathroom was combined with the bedroom so there was absolutely no privacy. If anyone had to get up to use the bathroom it would wake us up. Even the toilet was not completely closed off it had a frosted glass door that would not close all the way. I know this a modern and sleek design but a little privacy not to mention a place to put extra towels or toilet paper would be nice The hotel was definitely dimly lit all throughout. the elevators were practically pitch black.

The parking is VERY expensive and I understand why but as a hotel guest I would hope they would give me a little break. My room was amazing but has a VERY odd feature that some will NOT like. The shower is a glass enclosure open to the bedroom area. If you are there with your kids or someone you do not know well they WILL see you naked in the shower. Although this was totally cool to me as I was alone. I could shower and look out the windows and see the ocean from the top floor. I can imagine this would be an issue for many. The lobby is VERY modern and chic and offers a few really neat features. You can see the pool above you through glass panels in the ceiling. It is neat to see people swimming above you. They do have a pool table in the lobby which is neat to see. If you enter the pool from the lobby you enter through a glass stairwell in the middle of the pool. That is so damn cool. The pool is absolutely amazing. They have a nice bar area that serves food. The hot tub overlooks the ocean but the entire week I was there it did not work which was a bummer because I was there when it was cool in Florida and the hot tub would have been nice. The 2nd pool is very secluded and was nice but on the opposite side of the hotel. There is NO view from this pool but the hot tub was working on that side. Having two pools to choose from in very nice. Take a pass on the restaurant and bar as they are HORRIBLE. Whiskey Blue is supposedly famous but the ONLY thing I can say is that they are famous for their inflated prices and rude and uncaring staff. I have never met a more rude bartender in all of my life. With all the choices up and down the A1A you can walk to much better choices. All in all this is a great hotel. You can find a bargain on it if your not going in season.

I have the unusual opportunity to compare the newly refurbushed W Fort Lauderdale with the W South Beach head to head. I stayed in the W South Beach for the entire month of February 2016 and 2017 in an Oasis Suite and stayed for 11 days in two visits to the W Fort Lauderdale in March and April 2017. While the W Fort Lauderdale is less expensive than the W South Beach it still is expensive a week cost 50 with taxes and the W Fort Lauderdale does not come close to the luxurious W South Beach experience. In fact it does not come close to what one expects of a W Hotel experience. The new lobby set up in Fort Lauderdale is attractive and great if one is using the bar there for lounging but we did not use the bar and lobby area. The room pool and beach are what mattered for us. The pool and beach set up in Miami is far superior. The pool is at beach level is much bigger and is surrounded by landscaping in Miami in Fort Lauderdale it is on an elevated deck on the 5th floor and is a concrete platform with crowded chaises. Food service by the pool in Fort Lauderdale was minimal. In Miami there is a full polside restaurant. The beach service in Miami allows one to order food and drink not so in Fort Lauderdale. The floor plans layouts of the suites are not nearly as roomy logical and comfortable in Fort Lauderdale as they are in Miami and the construction quality seemed much flimsier. The sliding doors to the balconies were very hard to operate and the noise control was not nearly as effective in Fort Lauderdale. The middle of the night car alarms in Fort Lauderdale were an unwelcome alarm clock whereas the soundproofing in South Beach kept almost all noise out. The balconies were large with nice views but the new outdoor furniture was not very useful or comfortable. The admittedly older furniture in South Beach was much more comfortable. The Fort Lauderdale bathrooms were cramped and missing bathtubs in our suites with the outdated glass partition between the shower and the bedroom allowing ones partner to flash the other in the bedroom from the shower. A flimsy suction cup shower curtain is provided for privacy upon request. A staff member said hotel wide frosting was coming. Housekeeping was nearly perfect in Miami. In Fort Lauderdale it was erratic despite requests for early morning service we often did not have our room cleaned up until late afternoon and frequently only when prompted again and requests for turn down in the evening were overlooked more often than they were done. The supplies for the Nespreso were not fully replenished. Almost always we were provided with two flimsy towels instead of bath towels requiring us to call for the right ones. The service overall in Fort Lauderdale was harried and unfriendly except at the concierge desk where the assistance was professional and friendly. The Whatever Whenever phone line seemed sarcastic like the Valley Girls. Whatever and Whenever we feel like it. Valet parking did work well despite big crowds. Trying to get our bill corrected was a trial despite the fact we had what should have been a simple breakfast and parking package. No one at the restaurant told us that the breakfast package that we mentioned every morning meant one had to go to the lobby four floors up and pick up a paper bag with a yogurt in it. So our breakfast charges showed up in full on our bill. Obviously the hotel had complaints about the lack of clarity and agreed to credit us 25 a day for one persons breakfast. But instead of a credit the accounting department including an additional charge. That took an additional call to correct. Then at 330 AM on the day after our departure a resort fee of 25 a day was added and a revised bill was sent to my e mail. A phone call to the hotel taking 15 minutes finally got their agreement to remove that because our reservation was made in 2016 before the resort fee was implemented. We always have preferred South Beach to Fort Lauderdale as a beach destination better beach more attractions better and more restaurants. Had the W Fort Lauderdale been as self contained and luxurious resort as the W South Beach or even if it had been a notch below as reflected by the notch below pricing we might have been willing to consider it as a substitute for our longer stays. But based on our recent experiences we will not be back. The experience was not up to W Hotel standards.

It was nice to use but had a huge ick factor and no servers. The residence patio are is very weathered and past due for repairs. The restaurant in the lobby closes at 9 pm and this includes the bar. The Living Room on the 4th floor while new and beautiful is soleless. The furniture does not lend itself to conversation its missing the cool W lighting and music. We stopped here for 1 drink the entire time as it feels hospital like with white lights and furniture without gathering spaces. Because of the limited service hours I found myself next door spending my money and time at the Hilton. They have a great indoor outdoor patio and bar that has great music and lighting. The W is very nice do not get me wrong. I would stay here again. I just wish they offered more on the pool deck for drinks and pool time and they would move furniture around in the Living Room add some cool lighting other then white and put some good W music on like the music they have on their ap.", "offset": [750, 861], "date": "2017-11-13", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "d17a0a7a-35ec-42d4-b41a-9a83f5a81555", "sentence": "I Just Do nt Know. We had a somewhat disappointing stay at this property. W s are usually fun and an experience. This one is neither if you do nt drive up in a Ferari have a nanny and dog walker with you or be one of the owners of the suites that apparently Platinum SPGs are not eligible to use but the guy who did have the Ferari did. I wo nt whine too much we did get a very nice room with a city and ocean view which worked well for the 3 of us. The problems check in was a nightmare. You would expect the SPG status would mean a happy greeting. It was nt. 60 for an iced tea at the pool. A staff that seemed to be more interesting in people watching than guest needs. Pool furniture at the small pool that is in total disrepair. The walk away breakfast. If you ca nt heat a bagel or a croissant then why have it. But coffee is FREE. And having to spend an extra 600 a night for parking and the resort fee is simply ludicrous. Location is great. The lobby and main pool areas are very nice. Not enough to offset the negatives. We used points for this stay. i m quite glad we did nt have to shell out 459 a night for what we got.

My husband and I do n\u2019t usually get too much time alone together so for our 12th wedding anniversary we wanted to stay on the beach relaxing with no kids. We looked at where we wanted to stay in Fort Lauderdale and decided to stay at the \u201c W \u201d checked in on Friday and checked out Monday. Needless to say it was a great 3 days of adult time and the W was the best choice we could \u2019ve made. Katie Dong took care of us making our anniversary that much more memorable. She helped us get a reservation at 954 which is their restaurant and the food was amazing. Later on in the day we went to hang out by the pool. We had been trying to get a cabana since we woke up that morning and kept getting the run around. No one seemed to know who could set us up with one. My husband and I head down to see if we can at least get some chairs. When we got there Johanes immediately came to help us asked us what we wanted and took care of setting us up in one of the cabanas they sent complimentary fruit plate and water bottles. After the morning run around it was refreshing to have Johanes there to help us. My husband and I would totally recommend the W Fort Lauderdale. In fact we are going again in September to celebrate his birthday and we look forward to working with Katie Dong and Johanes.", "offset": [595, 647], "date": "2018-07-22", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "403fcdd8-a411-45b5-94cd-df323dacf661", "sentence": "Love the W. Second time at the W. Right in the middle of the strip so there \u2019s great people watching and a lot of activity. Service is excellent. Rooms are spacious clean comfortable. One main restaurant for general eating and the food is great. The hotel is very cool. The lobby area and bar is a great scene. The pool is awesome. Very lively. A lot of fun. Nice heated pool. Very comfortable pool chairs with cushions. Find a bar scene at the pool. 20somethings and families with kids all mingled well. Comfortable for everyone. Here is the only thing that is quite odd. There are no doors on the bathroom. Somebody thought that would be a good idea but there are no doors on the bathroom. So if you have teenagers who want privacy you have to plan showers. Giving the room to the girls and switching with the guys. etc. Which really it \u2019s no big deal but seems like an unnecessary design element. There is a door on the toilet area. And of course there is a shower curtain. But for the life of me I ca n\u2019t understand why they designed a bathroom that could not be closed off for privacy. It \u2019s a bathroom. Please do n\u2019t give this much weight. A hotel room gets too crowded with three or four people in it anyways trying to get ready for dinner. Or trying to get ready for the morning. We just split it up. It worked out fine. After a long day at the pool I would go to the bar and get a cocktail or two while the family did their thing in the bathroom rotation. All good. We will be back for sure.", "offset": [421, 450], "date": "2019-05-01", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}]}
