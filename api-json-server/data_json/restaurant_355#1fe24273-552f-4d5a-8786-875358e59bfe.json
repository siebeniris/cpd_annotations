It seems like I am an outlier in saying this but this hotel just was not very impressive. The lobby is kind of cool but the rooms are underwhelming considering the price that was paid to stay the night here. For instance the are on the wall looks like it was pulled from a 80s movie and it clashes with anything else in the room. Every single lamp in the room has something wrong with it whether it be a missing switch rust or a bulb that looks like it is about to go out. The TV is set weirdly high from the bed for viewing and is pretty small for the overall room. In room dining was OK. Honestly it seemed more like Cisco truck food than farm to table style grub that this country is getting used too. Again though the room service staff is amazing. The positive is the bed was comfortable and the toiletries were of high quality and the coffee station was decent Keurig. The service is incredibly friendly and that can not be overlooked. So I would say that if you can book this place in the 100 range it is fine.

We were greeted by Melvin at the front desk. He was warm and very personable. He went above and beyond to ensure we had e everything we needed. The hotel is beautiful clean and sprawling. We got to our room and it was very nice. However I did not pay attention to what kind of room I booked and we ended up with two double beds. That was n\u2019t going to suit us comfortably so I called down to see if there were any king rooms available still. Marvin and the night mgr Bre were so super nice and acomodating. They immediately checked and determined there were and moved us. We did n\u2019t even have to go downstairs you can electronically change your key in the elevator. I have never seen that before. We easily did that and moved rooms. This room was perfect with a beautiful view. We enjoyed an evening drink at the bar downstairs and sitting at the fire pit. We went down and had a fantastic breakfast. After breakfast we played shuffle board and had a lot of fun doing so. I loved that the checkout time was 12 pm Bc we did n\u2019t have to feel rushed. Just all around great job1. In a hotel this large noise is n\u2019t an issue so why not have no pool hours or late night adult swim until 12 am or even 2 am. \u2764 \ufe0f2. The fire pit area is so pretty but more comfortable seating around it would be awesome3. The pool table darts and shuffle board table are very hidden and not labeled we sat at the bar and still had no idea they were there. We found them by total accident the next morning3. The parking deck is a long way from the hotel and the front desk is even farther. A shuttle golf cart or something would be a nice touch4. Since you all are in chatanoga but a little too far for walking distance from Main Street a shuttle would be greatThese are personal opinion not complains. I loved it and our stay.
