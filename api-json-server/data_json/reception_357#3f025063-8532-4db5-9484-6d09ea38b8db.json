I have mixed feelings about this hotel but think it would be unfair to grade it as merely average. We stayed as a couple for one week from the 20 27 June on a Jet 2 package holiday from Leeds more about that later. On arrival we were immediately offered a free upgrade to one of the modern rooms overlooking the outdoor pool and bar with a lovely sea view apart from the hideous unfinished concrete shell of an apartment blockThis is obviously beyond the hotels control. The room facilities were excellent including good free WIFI but there were certain issues already covered by other reviewers worn towels which resembled sandpaper ouch erratic shower temperatures failure to replenish complementary coffee and milk supplies and inconsistent cleaning standards that should really not occur in this level of hotel. We were on half board and the overall quality of dishes on offer at breakfast and dinner was good BUT why on earth can they not serve HOT food on a consistent basis. For our last meal we decided to pay extra to eat in the Caper Grill what a difference. Excellent cuisine superbly presented and served with a high degree of professionalism by helpful knowledgeable staff. In fact the friendly helpful approach by all the personnel is a major strong point of this hotel. One of the highlights of our stay was a concert given at the outdoor pool by a famous Croatian singer Petar Graso a great experience. Curiously there was little publicity before the event almost as if the hotel management did not expect English speaking guests to be interested. We have just ordered one of his CDs on line we were so impressed. The situation of the hotel is ideal for visiting the magnificent sites in old Split but to save time we splashed out on taxis to and from the port area near Diocletians palace \u00a3 5 each way on average. For \u00a3 9 we took a taxi to the splendid Mestrovich Gallery on the scenic Marjan peninsular. Taxis were always on hand outside the main entrance no real need to book. Other memorable trips were to Hvar by ferry and to Trogir by bus. Both reasonably priced. Our package was with Jet 2 Holidays. As usual this company will suit the more independent traveller no sign of even a Jet 2 file in the hotel let alone a rep. But we like the extra security offered by a package tour operator so it works for us. We were lucky to enjoy hot sunny weather for the most part and if you like relaxing by a pool after a days sightseeing this is an ideal venue. The hotels Mistral beach area is accessible via flights of steps from the back door in the basement you may need SATNAV. to find the best way there. It is certainly worth the effort to try out the facilities there and the sea MUST be warmer than the pool. To sum up there must be better Radison Blu resorts but it certainly met our main agenda requirement to explore and appreciate the impressive historic sites of Split.", "offset": [1239, 1336], "date": "2015-06-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "e87cc01b-280f-4b45-a103-b842a11ff644", "sentence": "Luxurious week in Split.

It would have been nice to at least had some ice cream or cream from time to time to go with fruit salad and other deserts and know fries are not to everyones taste but not served at all my husband was disappointed.

Only about 10 USD to town in a taxi which were always ready to go. and it was nice being close but not in the middle of it all. Did not like that there was a row of buildings apartments between the property and the beach which interrupted the view and made the walk to the beach a little sketchy. Also the service in the wine bar was poor impossible to get a drink even with two persons right in front of me washing glasses.

The only 2 things which we ate at the hotel were the room service Red Thai curry and vegetarian club sandwich which we only ordered because it rained so much during our stay and breakfast. The bar was pleasant enough it had football on and other sports and the bar staff were friendly. Very sneaky with the gin cocktails and others I \u2019d imagine we asked for a gin and tonic then a gin and a tonic with the tonic left in the bottle and the latter tasted so much stronger obviously charging for doubles but only putting singles in. The water went out for 3 hours one day but I was told that it was a pipe problem and \u2018 even the hospital did n\u2019t have water \u2019.
