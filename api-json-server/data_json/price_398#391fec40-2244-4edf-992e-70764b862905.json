Before I walk to the buffet area I wana ordered scrambled eggs on a la carte menu the staff told me it was peak hour the kitchen is busy and he suggested me to the buffet area where also got scrambled eggs. The scrambled eggs in the buffet area however is cold. And very soon I saw other guests ordered eggs on a la carte menu were served. On the last day I ordered in room dining scrambled eggs baked beans and latte which is very nice the dishes are warm and fresh service on time and politely. SPA. Took two spas at hotel which is very relaxing and comfortable Hungarian mud and Winter sth the staff can really help to release my muscle sour which can compete with Chinese massage massage. One thing need to be careful is that even many prices on the menu or list provide EUR quotation when you check out the hotel does not receive Euro but only charge Hungarian dollars they said Euro is only for your reference the ex rate they use is quite better than ex rate outside. Actual Euro price should be higher. So be prepared to pay Hungarian dollars or credit card if you consume anything in hotel.

Positives Beautiful hotel central location excellent facilities polite friendly staff. Great massage. Spa pool area is lovely but a bit small. Wow Factor we got a free upgrade to a suite because they did not have the room we had booked availableNegatives 1. The hotels no cancellation policy is punitive. My wife and I went to celebrate a 50th birthday but we almost lost all the money we had used for the 3 night booking due to a family illness. Having to pay for the whole trip in advance to a hotel which does not accept cancellations means you have no right to redress. Personally I would not book Corvinus hotel again for this reason alone2. We almost arranged a spa package but the wording on the website was strange. When I rang up and asked a member of staff I discovered that the spa package includes free massage but only on 1 day and not every day. So do not book a 10 day spa package at a much higher price than a normal stay because you will be paying a lot extra for the package and for only 1 massage. 3. We accidentally broke a very ordinary looking table lamp worth maybe \u00a3 20 30. I rang reception to apologies and expected to be charged about \u00a3 100 at checkout. The next day at check out we were charged \u00a3 300. for damages. Consumables in the room have a huge markup \u00a3 3 for a small 25p plastic bottle of mineral water anyone that philosphy seems to extend to anything you accidentally break. 4.
