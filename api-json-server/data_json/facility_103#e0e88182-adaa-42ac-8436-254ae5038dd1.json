We picked the Hilton garden hotel through Thomas cook as part of our package because the hotel looked great and very good location and we knew the group of Hilton in UK are generally good we was not disappointed on arrival a warm welcome and lovely room with 2 large beds en suite with all the usual free toiletries good quality nutrogena ones replaced daily with bath and over bath power shower with large and small towels replaced daily. The room had a good panasonic telly large wardrobe ironing board and iron with a safe in the wardrobe free and a small fridge. The hotel had a nice pool and spa tub to the side the pool warm from the sun and the spa heated. It does have restaurant and bar which we did not use so can not comment. A guest room with free internet access computers. The hotel is close to all disney parks 5 mins away seaworld 5 mins and restaurants and bars within minutes drive. Orlando airport is probably about half an hour by car down the I 4 motorway.

The soup of the day was finished the day before can not make this up. I did manage to grab one of the last burgers. Waitress was embarrassed but did a great job providing service. Like I mentioned the staff is fine. The breakfast was a great deal. For 1060 inclusive of tax you can have an omelet bacon and eggs fresh toast or bagels and fruit. Nice portions.
