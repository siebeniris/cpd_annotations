The weather was not the best so the heated pool and hot tub would have been nice but who can control these thingsWe were told that RCI was supposed to call us to advise of the closures but we never got a call and they only updated their advisory on the website a week before. We asked at check in if we could get an upgrade since they were not at capacity but were told no. My husband later spoke with the manager who was nice enough to upgrade us to an ocean front room which was marvellous and totally worth upgrading if you can get one. The best thing was that we were able to watch a rocket launch right from our balcony on the first nightThe rooms are as described and pictured on website the furniture in our unit was updated and the sleeper sofa was actually quite comfortable with a pillow top gel never seen that before. Extra linens were available and you can swap out for clean linens and pool towels everyday. Kitchen is a bit dated in cabinetry but has nice countertops. There is a musty odour in the closets which is expected in beach properties. We had a minor maintenance issue which was resolved fully and quickly the first day. We actually received a call to ask if we needed anything and when we mentioned the issue a maintenance man arrived in 5 min.

We did not attend the magic show but had heard good things about it. The kids club is a nice treat. thanks goes out to Molly who watched and entertained the kids for 2 hours a day so we could have a little break. There is a fun play structure for the kids that is open all day. Some kids activities were also cancelled due to the roof construction wish they could have been more creative in relocating these activities for the kids. this could have been done with some planning and forethought but otherwise it \u2019s a great place for kids when all is operational.

The resort has a heated pool that was never too crowded a hot hot tub two tennis courts on site a game room a kids room a moderately priced and fairly decent Mexican restaurant on site free beach and pool towels a gym I never used it and ample parking. The beach was right there out the boardwalk with a sand washof station to rinse off at when returning. The beach is clean and the waves were great for boogie boarding with the kidsunles you are a pro. the waves were not huge. You can walk to the Cocoa Beach Pier along the beach. about 1 mile. Easy drive to Disney 1 hr. straight in on the Beachline highway. 45 min. to Orlando airport. A great place for a vacation.

We were not told of ongoing work to the front fountain or the scaffolding that went to the top right beside the pool. It was quite unsightly. The furniture had chips or something sprinkled on them. There were dirty doors on the wall. The coffee maker and other small appliances were from the 90s. The toliets were about 12 inches off the floor. The master bath had one sink and the shower was an insert from the 90s and the bath tub was stained and took up must of the bathroom. The linens were old. The mattress and pillows were below par. The light switches were all over the place and hard to identify. The balcony sliding door had a 2 or 3 inch trip yourself lip. Very FEW of the rooms are actually Beach front. If not you get a pool parking lot view. it is a pretty good walk to the beach although the beach is beautiful. The security team is plentiful. The fountain in the pool had an unsightful board across it. The staff were just ok. The rooms were spacious for the beach. If they did not hype it up so much perhaps we would have been less disappointed. The washer and the dishwasher were the most base model and extremely loud.
