Booked a hidden name hotel and got this one. Of course you get the older rooms and have to pay a fee to get the tower rooms. We felt the upgrade fee was worth the price because they were significantly brighter and bigger bathrooms. We were a bit disappointed with Expedia and the hidden room rate since the rate they show and the one you actually pay are higher than you had expect because Expedia charges taxes plus a recovery fee. This fee is added to the same line as the taxes. If you do not pay careful attention to the amount being charged you are surprised at the total cost. I feel these extra fees should be shown when they are advertising the price so you only have your taxes added on as someone would expect. Newly renovated tower rooms and the breakfast buffet. Close to Fairview mall and the highway so good access to get around. The rooms in the older section the bathrooms are some of the smallest you barely have room to close the door.

Made a wrong decision when I decided to book a room at The Sunbridge Hotel Conference Center in Kitchener Holiday Inn still do not know what it is was not listed as a Holiday Inn on website even though their receipt has Holiday Inn heading. It was one of the worse experiences I have had at a hotel. Not knowing weather or not it was a Holiday Inn or a Sunbridge was my first mistake and also thinking it would be a nice place to stay was my second. The problem started the morning of August 15th when we went down for the breakfast I had paid 20 extra for. Thinking at that price it would include bacon and eggs and toast but what we received was totally pathetic. It was very small with cereal stale bread stale pastries a few slices of roast beef and a couple of other meats that tasted disgusting along with a few cubes of cheese and small servings of yogourt. Upon our arrival we were informed that there was no wifi available which was no big problem and they mentioned breakfast would be served up until 930 and we would sign for our breakfast but failed to mention that the kitchen was under renovations and that it was a VERY limited buffet. When I checked out I complained about this and it fell on deaf ears on top of that I was NOT charged the amount that I signed for or that what was CONFIRMED on my reservation. The reservation confirmation stated Room Rates Starting 08142019. CAD 1240Subtotal CAD 1240Total Tax CAD 2108Total CAD 14508 But when I got my receipt my credit card was charged 15332 again falling on deaf ears as they added more taxes than stated on a confirmation which is false advertising and I have contacted the better business bureau about this matter as the front desk agent would not listen to my complaints and was very rude and uncaring that I was so frustrated by that time I walked out I did not ask to speak to the manager again it probably would not have helped. I found this hotel not forthcoming with their problems and not willing to refund the extra money that I had paid for their so called 22 dollar breakfast. I really wish I had of kept my reservation at the Quality Inn where I have stayed before and they actually had a great breakfast well worth the extra money but they include it in their rates.
