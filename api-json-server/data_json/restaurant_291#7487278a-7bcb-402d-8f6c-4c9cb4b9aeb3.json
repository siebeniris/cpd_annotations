Usually I love the Ritz Carlton especially when the rooms are new so we extra booked a renovated deluxe room. Ahead of our stay I informed the hotel that we would need 2 separate duvets. At checkin I kindly asked the girl at the reception if our room would be with the requested 2 duvets. She answered in a typical not very friendly berliner way all our rooms come with 2 duvets. Surprise surprise. there was only one big duvet in our room. And as the room also had a connecting door so we asked reception to move to another room and told them we are a bit noise sensitive. Reception swiftly moved us to room 908 and after a walk in the city they also managed to change the duvet to 2 small ones. thanksThe renovated room is lovely nice colors and decor really really nice super cosy with the sofa. The bed is a bit on the smaller side rather a queen size than a king size. but alright for our needs. The room was super clean and wifi worked fast and reliable. For privacy reasons there is only a turndown service on request. Come on. what are the No disturb signs for. just another trick to save money. SO not COOL for a Ritz Carlton. The aircondition was a bit too loud like in most hotels and also didn\u00b4t heat the room enough it was cold in Berlin. At 730 in the morning we thought they started to clean the room above us. It was loud and very disturbing for our sleep after a night out we wanted to sleep till 930. NOT possible. The noise continued all morning. At checkout we learned that above our room was the employees lift NOT COOL. especially after we asked to be moved to a room without connecting door because of our noise sensivity. Breakfast at 38 \u20ac if not included in room price takes place in the brasserie Debroses huge huge restaurant for us not very inviting. Way too hectic and not cosy at all it was not busy at all but the waiters ran through the restaurant as if they were in a hurry. We missed the quietness and also luxury that we would have expected at a Ritz Carlton Property. Adlon Kempinski has a out of the world breakfast luxurious quiet way richer buffet go take a look there Ritz Carlton Berlin and learn from themStandard breakfast items nothing really exciting. Items not refilled fast enough the cheseplate was NOT inviting as if it was there all morning. The very much from the very friendly hostess praised Eggs Benedict turned out to be one of the worst eggs benedict i ever had at a hotel. and i had many. The bun was not really crispy and there was way too much sauce hollandaise. and it came without any decoration at all. Poor for a Ritz Carlton. So to sum it up lovely new room. but we expected much more especially after a recent stay at the Ritz Carlton Osaka and will probably not be back to this one. also for the fact that we paid the normal price booked via Ritz Carlton and that other 5 Star luxury Hotels in Berlin were actually WAY cheaper at the same date but we wanted to try the new renovated rooms.

Stayed in room 908 for 04 nights over Christmas period with my partner as we were celebrating both our 12th anniversary and Christmas. This was our second visit at The Ritz Carlton in Berlin and regrettably it was quite poor compared to my previous visit last year. I booked my room under a non refundable rate on hotelscom and was not aware that the restaurant was closed for refurbishment and the only option was to have breakfast in the conference room. The price is \u00a3 38 per person despite the restaurant is closed which was shocking. This should have been communicated on hotelscom at the time I was making my reservation and would have booked another hotel instead. As I booked a non refundable rate I was stuck and left with no option. Upon arrival the person who did my check in lacked customer engagement and also did not even know that I was a regular returning guest. It would be good for the staff to ask the purpose of our visit if we need maps etc. There was no anticipation of guest needs and instead it was the traditional here is your key and lift on your right. Despite I have emailed the hotel a few days before my arrival to inform that we were coming back and also celebrating our 12th anniversary there was nothing special done. Also mentioned it on my booking on hotelscom. Recognition of your returning guest is important and would have make me feel valued and continue to be loyal of the Ritz Carlton brand. Although the hotel bedrooms have been refurbished regrettably it did not have a luxury Ritz Lacking clasines glamour. feel about it. Felt more like a Hilton or Intercontinental hotel bedroom. I requested for a kettle and it took over 30 minutes to be delivered when called room service the staff told me that they have a lot of breakfast orders at the moment and needed to wait. Not sure if I needed to know this The slippers in the bedroom were of very poor quality product and did not feel comfortable wearing it. The suspended office lights were awful very Intercontinental and also there were both white light and warm white lights throughout in the bedroom which was quite distorting. Very poorly design and lacked glamour. The tv experience was not great and no pay per view movies service instead was the standard tv channels. The person who checked me out was outstanding and provided a great check out experience but some of the reception staff were just trying to look pretty rather than being efficient. The hotel does not have letterhead paper and I requested a pen and the girl at the desk took a while to find one and gave me a damaged one. Depending who was cleaning servicing my bedroom everyday I received a different level of service. Sometimes our clothes were folded and placed in a good manner sometimes it was still on the floor and wondered if they actually hoovered the carpet. There were days we received 02 bottles of water and days only 1. Bathroom acesorises were arranged nicely and days I got back it was same the way it was left in the morning. No big deal but small things like these must be consistent especially for a brand like The Ritz Carlton where consistency is an expectation as a guest perspective. Went to the spa on the last day and there was no staff present visible at all. Wanted to use the steam room around 1340hrs and since it was not working and there was no staff had to use the emergency phone to get to speak to a member of staff. I was told the steam room only works as from 140hrs and will take about 45 minutes to make the steam room ready. Not sure WHY not earlier as the 02pm rule does not make any sense when staying in a super luxury hotel.

Horrific Service. This was our first time to Berlin and being a seasoned RC guest I was excited to try another RC property. However the entire experience went downhill as soon as we walked into the club lounge after check in. Spoiler alert it did n\u2019t get any better for the next few days. The club lounge is one of my favorite things the RC has to offer that is for the properties that actually have a club level. I like the feeling of \u201c home \u201d when you are in the club lounge and the concierge greeting you by name getting to know you. However this club level did n\u2019t care to know you at all or be able to anticipate any of your requests. Need something or have a request. It will most likely be followed up with \u201c Uhm I will have to call and ask about that \u2026 \u201d. and then you are left to wonder if the \u201c call \u201d ever actually took place or if your request was simply ignored. We were only one of 3 different couples that we saw \u2026 visiting the club lounge. Surely it is n\u2019t that hard to identify us by name. At only one instance did someone ask for our name and at no point during the three days that we were there did anyone ever address us personally in the lounge. How hard is it to make a handful of people feel welcomed. The club lounge boasts many of the similar offerings that you will find across the entire RC portfolio breakfast lunch snacks dinner drinks. However I was very sad that this property does not offer a dessert setting post dinner for guests. This is the first club lounge that I have ever been to that does not provide desserts in the club after dinner \u2014 a MAJOR letdown. You may however find left over cookies still out from lunch or a single dessert offering that has been sitting in the refrigerator all day long for you to take if you wish \u2026 just do n\u2019t take the guacamole in a small ramakin on the shelf next to it because God knows how long it has been sitting in there turning into a flavorless pile of green gunk. Another mistake we made was scraping the bottom of the mustard jar that probably has been near empty for months now. But the dry mustard or should I say sand. pairs great with the guacamole if you want a flavorless and odorless meal past the date of expiration. If you \u2019re able to get over the no dessert offering in the club that \u2019s only step one. Step two is trying to order a drink. Never in my life have I had an issue asking for a drink in the club lounge. In fact I have had club level concierges go out of their way to make sure that I was able to enjoy my favorite tequila in the club EVEN IF the hotel did n\u2019t carry it. NOT AT THE RC BERLIN THOUGH. When I asked for a simple cocktail a margarita my request was met with some hesitation \u201c Uhm \u2026 I\u2019m not really sure about that. I \u2019d have to call down to see if we can get that from the bar downstairs \u201d. Since WHEN does a club concierge not have the ability to make a cocktail as simple as a margarita. I told her that I would kindly wait to enjoy a margarita even though she said that \u201c It \u2019s going to take a little bit \u2026. \u201dFirst thing there was NO ONE else in the club at this point. Second thing every time we went downstairs and passed through the lobby bar there was hardly ANYONE even there. It must have been a very slow elevator ride from the lobby to the 10th floor. I would never in my wildest dreams think that a simple request such as a margarita would cause someone such distress and take so long to complete. Tanja every time you replied with \u201c I \u2019l have to call and ask about that \u2026 \u201d it was as if I was asking you to do something illegal. We are n\u2019t in prohibition folks. Make a margarita. And for heaven \u2019s sake learn the wines that you have to offer in the club. The guest rooms have a beautiful bath tub. Many other RC properties have bath salts as requested bath amenities. Tanja had to call and ask about that no response. One of my favorite things to do in the club lounge is play games cards or board games while enjoying dessert. Well you can obviously cross out the latter but what about the cards. She had to call and ask about that as well. Tanja did you literally just arrive to this hotel. I saved everyone some headache and went downstairs to the hotel concierge and asked if they happened to have a deck of cards. Nope. This is literally the first RC I have ever been to that the club lounge does n\u2019t have ANY games. Is having fun illegal in Berlin. Good thing there is a shopping mall across the street where I was able to score a deck of cards for less than five euros. I was even able to pick up a few desserts to enjoy whilst playing cards. PSA if you \u2019re looking to stay on the club level here be prepared to a provide your own desserts b bring your own activities c. mix your own drinks if you want them in a timely manner \u2026 EVEN IF you are the only one in the club lounge at a specific hour. Oh and you might as well just call yourself to ask guest services for whatever you need because the Club Concierges are less than helpful. If that is not convincing enough then perhaps you should utilize the Les Clefs d\u2019Or concierge in the lobby who had WONDERFUL recommendations if you ca n\u2019t read my sarcasm already then perhaps you should \u201c call down \u201d to understand more \u2026. As a person who travels often I always trust the concierge \u2014 especially staying at the RC and even more so if they are sporting the fancy Les Clefs d\u2019Or keys. I spotted them instantly on the lapels of the gentleman at the concierge desk and knew he would have great recommendations for places to get dessert not a difficult request right. WRONG. He asked us what we were interested in \u2026 ice cream cake etc. I said it could be anything \u2026. but something that he would recommend us to try. After all it was only 7PM we had an early dinner. and I did n\u2019t think it would be such a hard request to follow through with. A bakery. A restaurant with great desserts. No. His first suggestion was the Italian gelato place in the mall across the street. I had to pass on this one as I LIVE in Italy and simply can not fathom eating gelato outside of the motherland. His second recommendation \u2026 STARBUCKS AROUND THE CORNER. I hope I did n\u2019t embarrass myself when he said this but I literally had a visceral reaction. Never in my life would I EVER think to have a Les Clefs d\u2019Or concierge recommend STARBUCKS to a guest. If I was his manager I would rip those keys off of his lapels so fast that he would n\u2019t know what to do. In fact it really makes me question the legitimacy of Les Clefs d\u2019Or \u2026 or shal I call it Les Scam d\u2019OrWe ended up finding a bakery on our own in the neighborhood to grab a dessert and bring back to the hotel of course to play cards. Tanja was sweet to ask if we wanted any after dinner drinks \u2014 yes absolutely yes. But then disappeared after she brought them and never checked to see if we wanted another or perhaps something else. But honestly it \u2019s for the better because she probably would have to \u201c call down and ask \u201d for the something else. The RC Berlin is a beautiful hotel and everything seems to be updated. They even have one of the best Nespreso machines I have ever seen in a hotel room. However aside from the beauty and the Nespreso machine I would caution anyone from booking a room at the hotel especially if booking club level. At the end of the day I think the Motel 6 can recommend a place better than Starbucks for dessert and certainly would n\u2019t have to call down for every simple request. Oh by the way we had to ask twice for shirts to be pressed which was complimentary for club level rooms and then came to find that the hotel billed us for the complimentary service. Upon check out I inquired with the lovely gentleman at reception regarding the error on the folio and he made sure to remove it. Fun fact the hotel still ended up charging my card for this \u201c complimentary service \u201d and it has yet to be refunded. What A Scam. It is an experience like this that questions my loyalty to RC and Mariot. Perhaps I have been spoiled by some of the best RCs in the world and the rest fail to measure up. Or perhaps I need to take some time away and experience other hotels and brands. When I do come back to Berlin however I wo n\u2019t be staying here. The Hotel Adlon Kempinski seems quite nice and hopefully their housekeeping understands to unwrap the slippers when placing them at the side of the bed for turndown service. Or is this some new RC rule that was recently implemented \u2014 to provide turndown service with plastic wrapped slippers. I guess it goes hand in hand with plastic wrapped desserts from Starbucks.
