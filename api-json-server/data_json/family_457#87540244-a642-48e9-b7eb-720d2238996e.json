Our luggage was missing. that \u2019s OK and fixable because the staff here really do want to help we were upgraded which was much appreciated. In our new room a simple touch such as a do not disturb sign was still missing not terribly inconvenient but still. In the bar you will wait a long time to get served it is understaffed which is not the fault of those working here but a 35 minute wait to be served seems a little taxing. I would return with caution the key word here. there are some great deals to be had at The W and via BA. just know it is n\u2019t perfect and you will be fine. In summer months I \u2019m sure it \u2019s incredible but can only imagine that an in season stay would only present further issues with the hotel at full capacity. While writing this I \u2019m also looking at a promotional video for the group which features predominantly white privileged and extremely skinny people. I would urge the group to reconsider this too. We can all be a little better and realistic. Not in any way the worst experience just not the best.", "offset": [1125, 1273], "date": "2020-01-02", "cpt": "2", "category": "family"}]}
