There is no coffee or lite breakfast and in order to get those things you have to pay 4 per cup of coffee or eat at the very expensive red Dun restaurant.

I was hoping for a great night. To my surprise these hotels upkeep seems to be poorly managed A friend of mine checked into our room as I like to do in any hotel room I stay I like to do a quick once over to make sure the room has been cleaned. my first room has empty wine bottles and dirty clothing left in the room. Dirty clothes left in the cabinets where the fridge is stored and clothes still out in the open. this is something that could possibly be overlooked. but the worst part of it all is the stained sheets. Stained sheets are not acceptable for any hotel. I go down to the front desk speak with the gentlemen at the front desk he apologized for the room not being clean then switched our room the next room fortunately did not have any left of belonging from the last guest but the sheets on this bed were even dirtier this was so disgusting I could not stand being in this hotel any longer this hotel room also had a jacuzi with brown stains. Bathroom tile is dirty the windows have not been cleaned and overall a terrible experience with the romsThe hallway had heaters to dry the leaking ceiling multiple buckets in the hallway to catch dripping water one ceiling tile fell into the hallway in front of an emergency exit door no one cleaned it up for at least a day. The front desk guy is the same guy running extra towels to your room as well this hotel has so much potential the restaurant is laid out well and beautiful the hotel needs a lot of maintenance and attention to the decaying walls and frames around the windows.

Im sorry there is nothing we can do since you booked through a third party hotel tonight. you already received a discount I would love to see this hotel taken care of because it has so much potential as of now i would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.

Trumbull Porter was one of my most bizarre hotel experiences and I have had many hundreds at all price levels. It started at the check in desk where four staff members were apparently carrying on a staff meeting oblivious to a guest waiting for attention. The trend continued for my 3 night stay where I found the staff generally self absorbed and inattentive. The hotel is located just an Uber ride from anywhere in a run down area near downtown called Corktown. They automatically added 100 per day for parking without asking if I would be parking in the lot. I was not and had to wait while the check in person inquired on how to remove the charge. I would recommend any guest with a car pay to park because it is very likely it will be broken into if you park outside the fence in the street. I did see one car with a broken side window. The hotel itself is a very old style building typical of cheap hotels 60 years ago. The welcome book claims they are an authentic artisan boutique hotel and recently spent 11 million on renovations. Most of that was likely spent on paint and promotion. What to do with old acoustic ceiling tiles in the hallways. Spray paint them black and maybe no one will notice. Threadbare and stained carpeting. Rip it out and declare the exposed concrete a hip industrial look. The room furnishings looked like they were supplied by the Dollar Store. It seems the 11 million renovation moved them up from 1 star to maybe 2The room services guide was another strange touch with at least three pages dedicated to safety information. TV channels were the usual selection and all came in sharp and clear with the exception of the Fox News Channel. The picture was clear but the audio so garbled it was unwatchable. It was really comforting to realize that they are concerned with both my mental and physical safety. But do not expect any morning amenities. A cup of coffee in the lobby will set you back 3 bucks. So my overall impression was this. hotel makes a real effort to market itself to a specific demographic. They actually claim this is the place to see and be seen in Detroit. A place where you can rub elbows with Detroit is celebrities. Really. If you are a twenty or thirty something guy with a man bun and a tattooed female companion with maybe a nose ring you will likely feel safe and have a comfortable hotel experience.
