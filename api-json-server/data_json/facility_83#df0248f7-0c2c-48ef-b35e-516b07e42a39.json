I always feel comfortable booking a Hampton and have never been disappointed or unpleasantly surprised. We stayed a Friday and Saturday for an event at the nearby casino. The front desk was very pleasant and helpful and I loved that I was able to check in online the day before. it is great to see the layout of the hotel and choose the room you want. I hate being near an elevator or vending machine so I picked accordingly. It was SUPER quiet. I can not speak for every room or every floor but we did not hear a peep from the hallway or any slamming doors the whole time we were there. This is what I loved the most In the elevator they have a notice requesting that all guests behave respectfully. do not yell in the hallways do not slam doors unnecessarily basically act with courtesy toward the other guests. EVERY HOTEL SHOULD POST SOMETHING LIKE THIS. Sometimes people forget their manners when they away from home a little reminder never hurts The only thing I might complain a tiny bit about was the breakfast. They served until 10 but we were there at 9 930 and did not see anything replenished even though the yogurt was all gone and no fruit left but a few sad apples. Not as big a selection as other Hamptons but ok. As always love the 24 hour coffee bar. Always comfy beds and pillows would probably stay again.", "offset": [730, 842], "date": "2015-02-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "25182475-8938-4d9a-b5fe-37250b567fc3", "sentence": "NO SLEEP. children running around the halls slamming doors til 1230 at night.

Nice hotel located just down the road from the King of Prussia mall and Valley Forge. 20 minutes from downtown Philadelphia worth the drive to not pay the cost of the downtown hotels. Was able to get connecting rooms traveling with parent. Good breakfast included my kids always love making waffles in the morning. Only negatives were that we had a non smoking room but were across the hall from smoking rooms and the ventilation system let tobacco odors into our room occasionally.

Pull in at the Hampton Inn sign. We checked in and all seemed smooth after someone showed up at the desk. Manager James was very apologetic that we had to wait an entire 2 minutes. While room was getting old it was still clean and beds comfortable. Went out for a while and came back about 2 hours later. UH no water in the room. Oh wait there it is and it is BROWN. HMCaled front desk and they put us in a different room. Person who helped us was apologetic as well and said they would give us 100 points for our troubles and that will be enough for a free room. Really. Do you know how many points a room costsAnyway Temperature in room was a little off that night as hotel is showing its age. Very noisy guests that night which is not the fault of the hotel but the next morning there were people sitting on a luggage cart outside our door talking pretty loudly. Come on people please respect your environment and others who may be staying there. Upon check out we met the Manager James again and told him of our displeasure with our stay. We walked up to him and he knew our names and he remembered that he checked us in and even what room number. That is very nice. He said he was very sorry and that the night person did send him an email about the brown water. He explained about the lobby that was just renovated and the in December the rooms would be completely renovated. Bedding furniture bathrooms.

Our room was plenty large for two people and spotless. The amenities in the bathroom were just right. The beds were comfortable and we got the rest we desperately needed. Breakfast was included and while not fancy it was better than expected. We loved the coffee in the lobby all day and night too. The only drawback is that because of the high traffic in the location it can be tricky navigating in and out. But that is a problem in the entire King of Prussia area not just that neighborhood.
