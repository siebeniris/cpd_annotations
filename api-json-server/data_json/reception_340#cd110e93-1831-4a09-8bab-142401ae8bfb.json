The food and service was impeccable the room a Courtyard Suite was amazing the staff were attentive and on hand at all times. The breakfast and the roof top pool added to the luxury. For us this was a once in a life time indulgence and to add to this we made arrangements with the hotel for a limousine pick up from Changi. The Black chauffeur driven Mercedes pulin up gave style and prescence to our arrival but also meant we were greeted at the steps of this wonderful establishment by the reception team who whisked us away to our fantastic accommodation which it so happened was two doors along from a room once used by Ava Gardner and named as suchFor a treat and as we were staying over Christmas Day we decided to book a table at the hotels substantial evening buffet yes an expensive treat but. wholly worth it for array of food which seemed endless from Oysters and Prawns to Cheeses and a variety of roasted meats desserts and everything in between this was surely a feast for which Caligula would have been embarrassed. We had chosen the Bilecart Salmon Champagne option which meant a continual supply of the delicious pink sparkling libation in fact the price of the bottle alone and the amount served pretty much equalled the cost of this dining extravaganza.

Our room on the ground floor was not sound proof which made it impossible to get a good nights sleep especially when sleep is primary purpose of a hotel. The guest from the upstairs room sounded like an elephant stomping around for 2 hours each morning from 6 am. We feel that a hotel should be able to offer an interruption free sleep first and foremost. Raffles Singapore is a tourist attraction as much as it is a hotel. At Singapore Raffles there are barriers to enter the hotel to deter tourists that are not guests of the hotel from entering which has merit although as a guest this made entering the hotel cumbersome. The front door at Singapore was not always attended and when it was I was once questioned about my intentions to enter the hotel which I thought was odd considering I was a guest there. At times my hands were full of shopping bags I would have thought that the doorman would open the front door considering as such. My stay at Singapore Raffles is a stark contrast to my experience at Raffles Le Royal in Phenom Penh which was so elegant gracious whose staff were equally as elegant and gracious. Sadly Raffles Singapore did not deliver an equal or better experience. I also feel that maintenance on furniture could be addressed.

To confirm bonefides I stayed at the Raffles in room 26 from 28th June to 1st July as a private solo traveller. Raffles Heritage. There are many hotels in the world that claim history and heritage but it takes more than a tarted up old property with Art Noueau Art Deco decorations and potted palm plants to achieve this. The Raffles Singapore is the genuine article with not only an historic building that is lovingly cared for but has retained the standard and style of service long since forgoton by most hotels. What I found amazing is that you could spend a whole day just exploring the hotel and it is history. There are various nooks and crannys where you do not find anybody around and it gives you the feeling of exploring for the first time and enables you to soak up the history. My two favourite areas were the little area just before the lifts that had sofas chairs and book case and the first floor towards the front of the hotel with chairs tables sofas and magazines. You really could get away far from the mading crowdRafles StafIt would be incorrect to call them staff it would be better to say the Raffles Family for indeed that is what they really are. I was amazed at the standard of service and care offered but most importantly there was a genuine warmth which I had never experienced before in a 5 star hotel and I have stayed in many over the years. Of note was Ayako butler who provided outstanding service care and genuine interest. She is a credit to Raffles the hotel profession and a shinning example of all the best virtues and qualities of the Japanese. There was also Bernd at the reception desk who took time to explain the mysteries of the Apple watch to me I went out and purchased one and was able to take a genuine interest in my day. He is also a credit to the hotel and the profession. Last but not least was Reuben the bar man who sent over much a much needed glass of water to me without asking as I waited patiently in the lobby killing time before my flight home. Hotel RomThe hotel fom was situated along a long veranda beautifully laid out with Fantastic wooden flooring. On entering the room you encounter a beautifully laid out lounge area with sofas and a dining table area. Close at hand are cabinets stocked with best quality cups plates etc and most importantly for someone British like me an electric kettle and proper china teapot I was in heaven. The bedroom is large and the furniture is in keeping with the style and heritage of the hotel with no dings cuts or cup marks. The bathroom is large with two separate basin areas and mirrors sufficient to allow two if not three people to operate without getting in each others way. There is a separate side room for toilet bath and shower and needless to say all is beautifully tiled and maintained. Hotel Places to Eat. Needless to say that Raffles caters for all tastes please look up the various eating venues but I would recommend the billiard room and bar for a light snack and the tiffin room. You can eat in the long bar but it is often crowded with general tourists and can be a bit noisy. Previous Trip Advisor Gripes. You may see some gripes about the hotel there is no ipod docking station in the bedroom the mirrors do not light up and magnify in the bathroom the bath has no jacuzi jets the TV in the lounge area is not flat screen. While respecting what people say they fail to understand that in staying in the Raffles you are buying into the style of room and service of extremely high quality from a sadly bygone area. If Raffles were to put in too many gadgets it would would detract from the real heritage and history it has in spades. Finally I would recommend that everyone should experience Raffles.

I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to stay during the grand re opening of the Raffles after such an extensive renovation. The grounds the rooms and every inch of the hotel was spectacularly beautiful. I was impressed with the attention to detail on the finishings of the rooms and the technology upgrades functioned flawlessly. Please consider any feedback below within the context of an overall very enjoyable stay from a detail oriented individual who understands that you too are striving to be at the very top of a competitive group of luxury hotel experiences Peninsula HK Tokyo Aman Tokyo Mandarin Bangkok MO HK MO Singapore as reference point for some of our prior travel experiences etcThe check in process left some room to be desired. We were greeted appropriately at the door and ushered to the check in area. I did feel that the check in staff though friendly and efficient were too few and thus frequently tied up having to handle other requests on the phone or even other in person interactions with other guests. I noticed this both at check in as well as check out. I mention this only as other hotels offer in suite check in which removes the distraction to this portion of the guest experience and allows the guest to explore the room during the check in process. Bag handling at check. in was excellent on point and largely invisible. We requested bags to be stored at check out for about 3 hours prior to our late flight that evening. There was some confusion as we did not know whether we could leave them unattended in the room to be picked up and we had already checked out and handed in our keys. It was clarified that they would be taken care of and we did not need to sit in the room and wait for them to be picked up. However upon picking them up from the concierge we were asked if we had a ticket. At any other hotel this would be a non issue. But it represents a break in the continuity of the experience either the process is completely invisible the whole way through and the concierge when we pick up the luggage simply asks for our name or maybe our room number from earlier that day or we interact with the people who pick up our bags andor receive a baggage ticket from the check out staff. It is a little incongruous to have an invisible baggage pickup from the room but then be asked to provide a receipt of the transaction at the concierge desk upon pickup. The round soap dish as found in the shower is difficult to remove the soap from and re place into the dish as the dish is almost exactly the size of the soap bar. The alternative is to leave the soap bar bare on the ledge in the shower however there is no corrugation to keep the soap bar from sliding around on the smooth surface. The butler service is friendly but also likely on an early learning curve. We received our complementary welcome Singapore Slings in the room and enjoyed them in addition to snacks from the minibar. We returned to the room after a decent period of time I believe over an hour to find the room uncleaned. I would not expect an automatic full room recleaning at every exit of the room however one might anticipate that first completion of welcome beverages will leave the room partially unkempt and it might make a strong positive statement as to the attention to detail if this was briefly surreptitiously taken care of when your guest makes their first exit of the room to explore the grounds etc. I also noticed that the butler pages to a general number and not our specific butler which partially detracts from the personal nature of the relationship. The bartender at the Writers bar was extraordinary as you might expect both in knowledge capability and attention to detail. At this level and price point would anticipate flexing up more support waitstaf as the bar got crowded around the time that the Long Bar made last call and there was an influx of additional guests to the Writers bar. I do recall a similar bar in Tokyo where both chairs for myself and my wife were pulled out for us simultaneously not even having had any prior reservations. Details like these are memorable and understandably difficult to pull off routinely. The cocktails were phenomenal. The breakfast was truly wonderful. The captain was deeply apologetic at a small misstep of the kitchen with regards to a request to serve an ingredient on the side but it in no way detracted from my overall enjoyment of the atmosphere the service or the quality of the meal. Afternoon tea was impeccable. There was an error in our reservation that we had to clarify both to confirm the same day reservation reservation was made on the day of after check in and to cancel a reservation which had been made for the following day. But thoroughly enjoyed the quality and creativity of the dishes the tea the atmosphere and the service. With regards to the feel welcome endeavor for the stay I did sense the effort to make guests feel more like residents than traditional hotel guests and this was noticed and appreciated. I think there are some challenges at the front door with separating guests from tourists passing in for food and beverage with regards to the welcome. Regardless of these small details overall we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and hope to be back in the future.", "offset": [4287, 4526], "date": "2019-09-02 05:21:30", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "941384b8-609c-42e2-960f-48c1ab3749a9", "sentence": "I wanted to love it but only liked it.

We stayed for 4 nights during the F1 2019 Grand Prix. The restoration is amazing visually pleasing and gives a lovely feel to this charming historic property. The rooms are very well appointed but the absence of physical switches for lights temperature curtains is a major irritation having to click through a menu just to turn on the bedside light is supremely irritating. The ipad is a nice addition but should never replace physical controls entirely. This will irritate generations of visitors. Also there was a fault with the airconditioning in the room. when the shutters and door from the parlour to the bedroom were shut the parlour aircon switched off. so walking in there in the morning was very unpleasant. Finally on the rooms We were jet lagged for the first two days. Having no means of darkening the window above the entrance door is an irritation. The swimming pool is a beautiful and private space. But the access to it is a major disappointment. Having to walk through the Gym to find an unmarked door that looks like a fire escape with no window or sign is confusing and uninspiring. This is a major missed opportunity. The service concept is very confused flipping between over zealous to non existent. Upon arrival after a long haul flight from Europe we were greeted by two competing butlers who were both trying to greet us saying they were our day and night butler and bombarding us with information about all sorts of aspects of the hotel does not feel like a warm friendly welcome. It is overwhelming and burdensome. Please find a gentler approach to guests arriving long haul straight to your hotel. eg by asking them how they are and what they would prefer to do. We just wanted to get to the suite sit down and freshen upThe service in the outside courtyard bar was terribly poor. there were multiple waiters and bar staff serving less than 20 guests. After we were seated we had to wait 20 minutes with no waiter paying attention even when being signalled. Then we walked to the bar to place our order ourselves which then took at least another 15 minutes to arrive for a beer and a glass of wine. Very poor experience. We never returned after this experience on the first evening. The service at the pool bar by contrast was impeccable. The final concern is about security. When we arrived back after midnight on two occasions and walked through the main entrance lobby up the stairs and to our room without seeing a single member of staff or security. Anyone could come in and gain access to the residential part of the hotel in this way completely unchallenged. This is a concern. Secondly on the first night there was a group of individuals assembled in the courtyard crouched under some trees playing cards drinking shouting and laughing loudly I have a video if this. This could be heard loudly in the room. I understand that the grounds are open and public spaces BUT this does not mean that the hotel should tolerate assemblies and private parties in its grounds disturbing guests after 1 am in the morning. Unable to sleep with the noise we called to the reception and someone from the hotel came to move the group on. But I should not have to do this. At the very least I would expect a regular patrol to discourage such behaviour. Thirdly on at least 3 occasions when I got into the lift from the ground floor in the courtyard to get to our room there were people in the lift trying to figure out how to get to the second floor. But they had no room key. In fact they were trying to get to the long bar. Some better signposting would help to keep non residents pointing in the right direction.

The renovations in my opinion are not to the hotels advantage and many of the antique d\u00e9cor and decorations are gone. The reason l travel to Raffles is for the ambience of the Hotel. l was more than shocked to hear by 2 staff in 2 different areas that while yes the hotel is open it is a trial period and the real opening is 181019 and that the hotel was only running at 70 as the staff are all in training. so l was a guinea pig as such. \u2026 Many areas just no longer work.

Gone is the special room that it was \u2026 the butlers 2 of them were fine but not knowledgeable. Slow at times to respond which is via ipad and if that fails a phone call to reception if you can get thru \u2026. The Long Bar is a huge disappointment. The Band of 20 years has gone. The top floor was boarded off and shut.

The Writers Bar can not cope with us being turned away on 1 night and sitting outside in the foyer area which is now a tourist spot which was never allowed before. Only residents were allowed past the front door. Now there is the palm court doors left open no security and children running in and out unattended. Anyone and l mean anyone can go thru to the residents areas. Woeful security and lm at a loss why it is even allowed. Tour groups possibly travel agents l saw on 4 or 5 times in the 2 days l was there which confirmed to me that the Hotel was not really open and that yes it was a trial period. After the Writers Bar problem we tried to book into the 2 restaurants. Both booked out. So no drink area no food for us seriously was not a great experience. One of the managers managed to get us into Pic Restaurant as they had a cancellation. Never at booking into Raffles were we warned to book Writers Bar or Restaurants. never in the past have l had to anyway. It amazes me too that l am never recognised by Raffles coming back even after 6 or 7 times they have no record of me. The staff are lovely as helpful as they can be but so new that they lack the history of the place which is very sad. Simon at the Writers Bar and the Food Beverage Manager are both exceptional staff who should be rewarded for the circumstances they are currently working under. The rooms have been improved but the bathrooms really have been ruined by a blank white canvas baths that really do not fit in the room and tiles that make you seasick. Sorry but mass swirling designs on tiles are a very selective taste and not everyones \u2026. in closing l am sorry to be negative but my experience was really not a good one and l actually cried when l saw the renovations of the billiard room. This was my 60th Birthday event and lm glad Raffles was the end because it truly did devastate me. l hope my comments are taken onboard by management.

We recently stayed at the Raffles Hotel in a State Suite for 4 nights. Overall we enjoyed our stay especially liking the high fit and finish of the newly renovated rooms and the under stated luxury of the historic rambling low rise property. However we were somewhat disappointed by the standard of service and in particular we found two aspects soured our experience. First we never really felt welcome when we returned to the hotel through the main lobby. Unlike other luxury hotels doormen were n\u2019t consistently present to open the doors for us or welcome us with a warm greeting. In fact we felt that we were being challenged by staff almost every time we returned and forced to justify our presence. My wife commented that when she entered the lobby multiple staff members would approach her and instead of saying \u201c Welcome back \u201d or \u201c welcome back Mrs P \u201d they would pepper her with questions implying that they wanted her to justify her presence ie. \u201c How can I help you \u201d. \u201c Ma\u2019am where are you going \u201d. \u201c Are you going back to your room \u201d. Etc. Frankly this sort of questioning was impertinent and highly frustrating. I experienced something similar. It was an uncomfortable experience and something we have n\u2019t seen at any of our hotel stays. It got to the point where I would take out my leather keycard so that the staff could see I was a guest and not bother me. But this is a luxury hotel not my office building and I should n\u2019t have to do this. I get that you \u2019re trying to keep non resident tourists out of the lobby but this is coming at the expense of hotel guests not getting the sort of welcome that they would experience at other luxury hotels. Second we felt that the service from the suite butlers was perfunctory and lacking in warmth and grace. We utilized the in suite check out and our butler did n\u2019t smile once did n\u2019t ask us how we enjoyed our stay or where we were going next. We really felt that we were n\u2019t valued guests. In addition despite confirming our preferred check out time of 115am the butler showed up at 123am. Our initial suite briefing by the butler also felt very perfunctory. We really wanted to love the Raffles and in many ways we enjoyed our stay. This is why it was so disappointing that key points of our interaction with the service our returns to the hotel through the main lobby and our check out made us feel unwelcome and left sour memories. We travel to Singapore once or twice a year and we enjoy trying different properties to get different experiences. Our first impression upon checking in to the Raffles was that we might want to return but after 4 nights and the check out we were left thinking that we would continue to try other hotels. Finally we e mailed these comments to the hotel and never got a response which I find really telling that management of the hotel does not seem to care about guest satisfaction or thoughtful feedback.

After travelling from Koh Samui we were picked up by our transfer and taken to Raffles. On arrival we were asked by the doormen if we were checking in. We replied that we were and taken my the same gentleman to a sofa next to the lifts. We were not asked for our names but then left. Over 10 minutes went past and both myself and husband began to feel cross as we had not been approached by another member of staff. I left my husband and stood close to the check in desk and soon after I was approached. The lady asked if she could help and told her we had been left and had been waiting to be checked. She apologised but we were not happy. I had never experienced this at any hotel that we had stayed before. We were offered a glass of champagne and taken to our room to check in. This took away some of our disappointment but not all. Our butler showed us around the room but did not explain about the DND button and this was accidentally touched which resulted in our room not being serviced whilst we were at breakfast or during the day. The fire alarm went off at 6 in the morning and this may have been when the button was touched but can not be sure. The rest of our stay was wonderful. Could not fault the rest of our service. Our room was wonderful and all the facilities that it offered was second to none. The staff were very attentive other than our check in experience and the food was lovely. The breakfast was the best. We also had afternoon tea on our last day and that was lovely. We were in holiday to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and staying at Raffles was to be the icing on the cake to round our 3 week holiday off. If we had not had a bad experience on arrival I would say a perfect hotel. This should be addressed. A glass of champagne does not excuse the service on arrival. Please ensure this never happens to any other guest.", "offset": [1255, 1295], "date": "2019-12-06 09:14:04", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "a0646760-6385-4adf-a28d-e308f458b4ce", "sentence": "Amazing historic hotel needs some fine tuning. We stayed here with my elderly mother in November and had booked 2 Personality suites requested John Wayne for my mother for 2 nights. We were warmly welcomed on arrival and shown to our suites by our Butler. The rooms have been recently renovated and were very luxurious. Unfortunately the air con in John Wayne was broken and could not be fixed. As there were no other Personality suites available we both chose to change rooms and downgrade to a lower room category the Front desk Manager offered us some small financial compensation each to cover the difference. The room sizes and design were identical however a glass must have been broken in our new suite and not properly cleared up as I stepped on broken glass and cut my foot. The rooms suites themselves are very well appointed and very quiet. We could not hear any external noise at all. However my elderly mother really struggled with the new iPad which controlled the lighting the curtains the air con and the TV. The lights etc had manual switches which helped but she could not manage the tv controls at all and it would have been nice to have a traditional remote control as well. We contacted our Butler to arrange to have our complimentary Singapore Slings at a table in the Long Bar but after an hour of calling him he never came back to us so we asked for them to be delivered to our suite. We also asked to have a table booked at the Bar and Billiard Room restaurant for that evening at 7 pm which he called back and confirmed. Our drinks arrived and were delicious. However when we arrived at the restaurant they had no record of our reservation and all the tables were fully booked. They could have sat us at the high bench surrounding the kitchen but we would have been sat on high stools which my mother could not manage. The Restaurant Manager was fantastic and after a short wait he managed to place us at a table that had just been vacated. We had an amazing meal. The breakfast was good quality and plenty of it. We had to leave at 6 am on our last day and a picnic breakfast was delivered to us. it was huge and really good. We chose to wheel our own cases to reception to check out but could not get into the main lobby as all the doors had been locked and no one heard us knock my husband managed to get around to the front door and the night porter helped us with our bags to our awaiting driver. We checked out without incident. I have yet to check my credit card to confirm we were paid the room change compensation. It was wonderful to stay here and it is a beautiful grand hotel. The staff issues need a little fine tuning but we would come back.", "offset": [2153, 2427], "date": "2019-12-11 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "d4e9c98e-49d8-4192-a612-2c7422d8d6ba", "sentence": "Bucket List. I rarely put reviews on tripadvisor because hotels typically send surveys to guests. My husband and I stayed at the Raffles Singapore in February and clearly a guest survey is not part of their MO. The hotel has done an excellent job in their renovation refurbishment. It has all the modern features but has retained its colonial charm. We booked one of the personality suites and the room was nothing short of spectacular but still has its flaws. The chest drawer fridge was leaking and not closing properly so all frosted up. The water bottles that are available for guests were n\u2019t stored in the fridge both still sparkling. So unles you want to drink them at room temperature you have to always ask the butler for some ice everyday. Ice bucket everyday being refilled twice a day upon request would have been easier. The dressing table with pop up mirror with the hairdryer inside was too low. Or maybe they just need to tilt up the mirror angle so it \u2019s the right reflection instead of looking at your neck while sitting you can actually see your hair. The Ipad control was really hi tech but honestly we prefer the old fashioned light switch and remote control. The staff over promoted it like it \u2019s the best room feature but was n\u2019t really that impressed as it is more of a pain to operate. It \u2019s not difficult it \u2019s just inconvenient. We spent most of our time at the hotel during the whole 3 days we were there. Only went out to dinner once as the La Dame De Pic was closed on our last evening. Breakfast on Day 1. the yogurt from the fridge was past its use by date. They got removed from the cabinet when I pointed it out to the staff. Lack of attention to detail obviously from the kitchen staff who put the yogurt in the fridge. Lunch at the pool was very pleasant. We had lunch there twice and pre dinner drinks once. Drinks at the The Long Bar was very enjoyable as the butler has made a reservation for us so we did n\u2019t have to stand in the queue. Dinner at the Butcher \u2019s Block was very good and the staff were very attentive and engaging. Lunch at the BR on Sunday was also very good as far as service and some of the food quality. Only disappointment was the shrimp dish that my husband ordered. They were serious when they called them shrimp because they were so small. Hardly any meat. The biggest disappointment for us was during check out. We were given a late check out as we had a late flight. We checked out early it was arranged that our bags were to be picked up at 530PM from the suite to be loaded into the car booked by 6PM to the airport. There was clearly a disconnect in the communication between front office and the concierge. Our bags were n\u2019t picked up from the suite on the arranged time. As we have been sitting in the lobby we asked the concierge on duty she said the car has been there all along waiting for us. but without our bags. I imagine it was also the concierge \u2019s duty to organise someone to go to the suite to pick up the bags and load them into the car at 530PM as arranged by front office. We were n\u2019t late for our flight we had plenty of time but the attitude of the concierge was unfortunately left a bad impression for us after a lovely 3day stay.", "offset": [2741, 2866], "date": "2020-03-15 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}]}
