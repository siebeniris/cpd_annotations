This was our first stay at this property and it was the best. The staff was incredible friendly warm and attentive. The front desk staff was very nice and welcoming. Ernesto at the welcome desk is so fun to talk to. He has tons of good info about the area and PV in general. He was awesome with kids. The room was beautiful and comfortable. We had a room on a higher floor so we had a nice ocean view. The property was very quiet too. The room and bathroom were spacious enough that our family of 3 had plenty of room. Housekeeping did a great job every day for us. We also had turn down service every night. The room was well taken care of daily. We went to walmart and bought a cheap styrofoam cooler to keep water and beer cold in. It was super convenient to use in the room. We ate at all of the restaurants. They were all great it s hard to know where to start. If you like asian sushi you need to try Mikado. The prices were incredibly reasonable and the food was exquisite. The sushi was super fresh and delicious. We even got take out a few times. The Ceviche Tequila bar is absolutely the best we ve ever had. The tuna had pecans in it and it was crazy good. They also have a really good chocolate cake. Their drinks are super good. The purple kiss is refreshing and flavorful. The bar sits in the lobby and overlooks the pool. It s an easy nice place to sit at night and relax. La Estancia has a great breakfast. We never ate dinner there but i m sure it s just as good. They have regular menu options and a breakfast buffet. The juice was super fresh. We tried menu options and the buffet. All of it was good. The buffet has a lot of options eggs of any variety pancakes waffles beans soup rice cereal fruit anything you can think of. The a la carte breakfast options were just as good. Reyna is the best server. She was cute friendly attentive and sweet. We sat in her section for 4 days of our trip. If you go to La Estancia you should ask for Reyna. The polside service is just as great as the rest of the hotel. Elio Raul Warren were all fantastic. Warren has all kinds of information about PV and is very helpful. Elio is incredibly friendly and fast. The pool fills up quick. We went down at all different times of the day. In the morning 8 9am maybe 10 is the easiest time to get chairs especially if there s more than 2 pl. If you save chairs make it more believable than just a towel. We did see them remove towels if people did nt make an appearance in a while. After 10 1am it was very busy most days. Generally after 2 pm the pool cleared out and getting a spot was pretty easy. We bought food from Las Casitas from the polside menu. The chicken tenders were surprisingly good. They will make chair side guacamole if you request it. They have floaties to rent if you want something. We just bought floaties from walmart and brought them in. We left them at the pool when we checked out. The deli in the lobby also has ice cream which my daughter and husband ate more than once a day. They serve coffee snacks ice cream lattes. It s a nice place to grab a quick snack. Champions restaurant was the only place that was not really great. The food was mediocre nothing impressive but if you re hungry for onion rings or fries it s good to try it. They do have 3 pool tables to play on. It s open to all ages too. The hotel is a short walk to the marina and is easy to catch a cab to downtown. There is a bus that runs by about every 15 min to the malecon. Super easy and cheap but hard to catch a bus back to the Mariot. It s easier to grab a taxi.

Beautiful Grounds and Service. The ResortOveral the resort is beautiful and we really liked the location. It \u2019s near the marina 5 min walk and about a 20 minute drive outside of downtown Puerto Valarta. There are two main towers of rooms with a nice selection of places to eat and a huge pool area. The rooms are nice although the standard sized room is pretty small. The Governor suite is a nice sized and allows for more of a living room area. The RomWe were given the \u201c Imperial Suite Presidential Suite \u201d Room 8040 which is an absolute gem. We were staying at the resort to attend a wedding and this room served as the perfect home base for our entire party. There is a large and open living room area with great views of the ocean. To the right is a formal dining room and small kitchen. The kitchen has an apartment sized fridge microwave sink and a full set of plates cups bowls and silverware. For part of our stay we also had Room 8046 which is the adjoining room and adds two additional full sized beds and an extra full bathroom with a nice sized shower and spa. In the main suite there is a half sized bath off of the \u201c family room \u201d and another nice seating area with a large TV. The bedroom itself has another large sitting area a queen sized bed and opens into a huge bathroom. There is a full sized walk in closet a giant rub double sinks with plenty of counter space and a nice sized walk in shower. There is another private balcony area off of the bathroom that overlooks the pool. In total this room is huge and very comfortable. Having a 25 year old and 9 month old this was the perfect setup as it allowed the kids space to explore and feel at home. The hotel was great about having a crib in the room and also included some extra baby supplies which was an excellent touch. The PolsThe two main pools are the huge infinity edge pool and the smaller kids pool. The main pool is about 4 ft deep throughout which makes it deep enough to \u201c swim \u201d but also so you can be standing walking anywhere in the pool. There is a nice swim up bar and plenty of seating all around the pool and in front towards the beach. The water is warm and everything was in great condition. We had great service from the wait staff and the pool menu is a nice typical polside selection served from the Las Casitas restaurant. Towels are plentiful. The kids pool was great for our 25 year old. The water is less than 2 feet deep allowing him to walk stand up and he LOVED the four different water slides. This is a great feature of the hotel and makes it very family friendlyThe FodLas Casitas \u2013 A very nice beachside restaurant that is primarily seafood with a few steak options. Prices for steaks were around 350 pesos which is about 20 as of Oct 2017. This is a great place for a night in at the resort. Service was always excellent and a nice selection of bread is given before the meal. Champions \u2013. This is an American style sports bar that features a decent selection. Our party had a few different hamburgers which were good but pretty typical of a large American chain. No complaints it \u2019s a nice change from the other places around. There are huge TVs and it makes for a great place to watch some sporting events.", "offset": [1214, 1313], "date": "2017-10-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "a88a652e-4b89-48b3-849c-2e0a82ba6cc4", "sentence": "A MAZING Vacation. After I booked my flight to PVR I started to look at different hotels and the Mariot came up as an option. When I went to book it on the Mariot website Mariot was offering a promotion with a 50 daily credit along with a reduced rate of 175 night. The room was not an oceanfront or pool view but I figured I could always walk to the beach if I needed to. Upon arriving at the hotel the main lobby was being updated so you had to enter through a small walkway. Once you walked into the building you could see the beach from the Lobby Bar. Check in was easy and I was able to get into my room at 11 am local time. The bell hop brought my bag directly to my room. Even though the room was not oceanfront or pool front it was very close to the pool beach area it took me less than 3 minutes to walk to the area. The room was beautifully appointed with a king bed sofa bed bathroom with a tub shower combination and water closet. The pool and beach area is SPECTACULAR. You are steps away from the beach with lounge chairs and umbrellas available for use. In addition the infinity pool was refreshing to have after sitting in the warm sun. The staff attending to the area wait staff bartenders attendants were very attentive to every ones needs. The food OMG The food was amazing. I ordered the Mexican burger while I was at the pool my first day. Mind you I had not eaten that day except for a small snack box on the plane. That burger along with a huge pile of fries kept me full for the rest of the day. Along with a strawberry daiquiri the total was 16. The currency conversion rate is excellent have 18 pesos for 1 dollar so things such as room service for a full breakfast eggs ham potatoes orange juice tea and toast was less than 1The service. The staff is so friendly and helpful. If I had any questions or concerns they answered it right away. I went to the spa one day and fell in love with the service the staff gave me maybe because I was the only person receiving services at the time but it felt amazing to be pampered.
