Okay I am thinking that true Four Seasons customers do not need to read a review about a Four Seasons property. So for those who would love to indulge I offer this review. We just returned from a Hong Kong Thailand and Bali trip which we saved for with another couple. For those who do not believe they can afford this resort on their own then I suggest sharing the cost with others you can travel with and have fun. This Bali trip and a vacation to St Barth were made possible with hard work saving and sharing the costs. You need to negotiate your package and stay at a villa with Four Seasons directly or through a great and powerful travel agency. Travel agencies have credibility with resorts so the better the agency the more bargaining power they have. Much like anything paying a travel agency sound silly when we can just Expedia and Travelocity our own stuff but that and some personal input as to what you want included makes a big difference breakfast included driver spa or shopping credit. Anyway let me say that the Residences at the Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay is beautiful everything is perfect and if you do not think so just ask for a manager and perfect becomes their goal. The beauty of the place has more to do with physical design the people employees managers etc is why I will return one day. The people of Bali also make going back a must. I will let any photos speak to the beauty. We were met at the airport by Four Seasons airport employees who get you through the airport administrative process quickly next your in your transportation and on your way with a cold bottle of water in hand. Once at the villa we were met by the head butler and the butler assigned to us for the week. Drinks were waiting as were local snacks provided while being given the tour of the two bedroom villa residences one bedroom is its own building pool indoor and outdoor showers garden and the WOW factor of being made to feel like we all should feel at some time in our lives important and deserving of good things.", "offset": [201, 297], "date": "2015-02-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "4040ab7b-a5d2-4437-b56b-0172319eff59", "sentence": "Good for family trip good location actually not bad not stunning but more down to earth i guess lol.

The staff made an effort to remember our names and always kindly acceded to our girls request for more fish food to feed the fishes. Sundara was lovely though it did get too hot at times more shade perhaps and the food was excellent. The kids club with its own shaded pool was also a hit with the girls.

The stay was excellent in an ocean facing villa which was maintained to the highest standards. The staff were so courteous and everyone had welcoming smile on their face. The practice of addressing the guest by name immediately breaks the ice and makes you feel most welcome in this amazing resort in the best location.

It was the last of 4 hotels we did stay during our trip to Bali dedicated to 10 t Anniversary of our wedding. I found this hotel in the internet 10 years ago when we were planning our Honeymoon and immediately did fall in love with it at least according to pictures. We ended up having Honeymoon in Dominican Republic however I told myself at that time that once we will visit Bali we must stay at this one. So when was planning trip dedicated to anniversary did n\u2019t have a doubt on which hotel to choose to finish it in style and leaping ahead can tell that this was perfectly right choice. I did write to the hotel in advance to inform that we are coming on special occasion and asking for smth nice to be arranged. To their credit hotel \u2019s GM answered very quickly and promised that hotel team will take of our stay \u2013 and they really did. On arrival we were greeted with refreshing towel and welcome drinks. Lobby itself worth separate word \u2013. it is open plan with thatched roof structure situated on the very top of the hotel. As hotel is located on a quite steep hill and lobby overlooks the Ocean the view from the lobby is breathtaking. Check in done by Julia was very fast and efficient and by the end of the process General Manager came to greet us in person \u2013 which was very nice and pleasant touch. We were informed that due to our special occasion we were upgraded us to Jimbaran Villa on the renovated side of the hotel and then buggy brought us to villa. Our villa 26 was in the second row from the sea with wonderful Jimbaran bay view. Villa is really well designed with open air thatched roof living area huge bedroom located in separate building opening into huge dressing room and followed by gorgeous bathroom \u2013 with free standing huge bath separate shower and 2 separated wash basins. Also there is an open air shower which you can reach from main shower surrounded by small while very nice tropical garden. Between open air living room and bedroom there is an open plan patio with greenery small temple sun lounges and private plunge pool 3x4 m with great view over the ocean. On arrival we found in our bedroom chilled Champagne not Sparkling wine Spumante etc while rather real Lanson champagne from official supplier of British Crown along with fruits refreshing non alcoholic cocktails. yummy. and welcome letter from the GM. Villa does have all amenities you would expect form luxury 5 Star hotel. Hotel territory is really huge and unbelievably beautiful around 150 thatched roof pool villas are located on the hill descending to the sea creating a feel of an ancient village surrounded by lavish well kept gardens with a number of small ponds and waterfalls. Creating atmosphere of pure peace and relaxation hotel was more than 80 full at the time of our stay while when you are on the territory it seems that you are almost alone in the big green park. As territory is really huge you can always call from your room or any dining location you are in and ask for buggy to bring you to any spot within the hotel and this service is obviously complimentary. Hotel has 3 main pools \u2013 one with infinity edge and unbelievable ocean view. Water from this one freely falls over the infinity edge into the lower Waterfall pool. Finally the longest 56 m and probably the most used hotel pool is located right on the beach it also has an infinity edge and one can really feel like swimming almost in the sea as pool is only separated from salt waters of Indian ocean by narrow sand line. Hotel \u2019s beach club consists of 2 parts \u2013 you can either use sun lounges or cabanas for 2 near the 56 m long beach pool or use the separate dedicated beach club area located 50 further. Once you arrive to the beach staff is immediately coming to prepare the sun lounge with 2 white towels they use only crispy white towels for the sun lounges throughout the hotel one more sign of great hotel. being whit towels must be not old or dirty unlike many other hotels which are trying to masque in darker colors badly washed or old towels and also to propose you complimentary water with ice. Near the pool they also provide complimentary fruit infused water. Beach is sandy and entrance to the ocean is quite shallow so will fit both adults and also families with children. Also hotel has own Spa located at the very top of the hotel right near the entrance while we did n\u2019t use it so ca n\u2019t comment. Finally to entertain the guests hotel organize some complimentary tours of the grounds eg temples of the hotel orientation tour etc. several times per week as well as some sport activities and master classes. All these activities for the whole week are listed in the booklet every guest receives on arrival. There are several dining options at Four Seasons \u2013 main restaurant located high enough to provide panoramic views of the Jimbaran bay and where also the breakfast is served \u2013 we also did have breakfast and although it is very sumptuous I would say. and this is probably my only minor point of criticism in the whole review that it is still slightly overpriced as per Bali standards even for hotel of such caliber so if you plan to have breakfast better book it in advance it comes much cheaper in this case few other restaurants and bars and also several gazebos located closer to see for romantic dining. Finally they do have famous Sundara restaurant located right on the beach. The location and setting are awesome we were fortunate enough thanks to Julia form the reception to have a very nice table in the evening round table with sofa for 2 overlooking the pond pool and ocean \u2013 so wonderful and romantic. Restaurant is specialized on Asian cuisine and one of the peculiarities of the concept is that they offer all salads and mains dishes in 3 different sizes small medium and large. so one can choose either to take big portion of one dish or rather to taste few things by taking smaller plates. Also what differentiate the restaurant form others is that they offer cocktail pairing instead of standard wine pairing cocktails also can be ordered in different sizes and are all special ones. Just on separate note \u2013 prices in Sundara are very reasonable giving the caliber of the hotel can tell this as we did dine in all our previous hotels as well as in some other fancy places \u2013 eg St Regis Nusa Dua famous KayaPuti restaurant. We decided to opt for small portions to try more dishes and all food was delicious as well as cocktails and the service was second to none we were greeted by Mathieu \u2013 new hotel \u2019s Director of FB he was very nice and attentive trying to have a word with all the restaurant guests. Sundara manager also was checking whether everything is fine with our food and finally our waiter apologies forgot his name was perfect. It was perfect dinner with attention to every detail ie when I said the one of the dishes was slightly spicy I was immediately brought the watermelon to eliminate the spicy taste \u2013. never knew that watermelon can do it so quickly \uf04a. At the end of our dinner we were provided with nice complimentary desert with greeting for our 10th Anniversary \u2013 small while extremely nice and pleasant touch. Service deserves separate mentioning all the hotel staff really doing their very best to make all guests happy and they are really succeeding in this. They are trying to foresee and fulfill every small wish of the hotel guests and it is clearly visible and greatly appreciated. We really did have a wonderful stay and really did n\u2019t want to depart. We definitely will be willing and waiting to return and without any doubts can highly recommend the hotel to anyone searching for perfect getaway.", "offset": [7551, 7697], "date": "2016-05-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "5a7295ac-37aa-460a-a92c-16c236ce88ef", "sentence": "Absolute paradise.

I have visited Bali for ten years now and have always stayed at The Legian in Seminyak which unfortunately has taken a turn for the worst. After beginning my trip once again at The Legian and being sorely disappointed with the state of affairs both at the hotel and in the new Kuta Seminyak we decided to cut our trip short at The Legian and move to the Four Seasons in Jimbaran a hotel which has always piqued my interest. It is without a doubt the best decision I could have made. The hotel grounds quality of the rooms villas staff food level of service amenities and attention to detail are flawless and will now be our new home away from home in Bali. We stayed in the recently updated Deluxe Villa which features all the modern amenities one could expect from the Four Seasons brand and a five star resort without compromising on the authentic Balinese feel that makes visiting Bali so special. The design of the villas and resort itself is sympathetic to local Balinese design and architecture which is important when visiting a cultural wonderland like Bali. The resort is beautiful impeccably maintained and feels like you have the island of Bali all to yourself which is challenging on an island where overdevelopment is rampant. The beach in front of the hotel is spotless and inviting without the dangerous rips or trash that one finds along the Seminyak beach. A vast array of water sport toys such as paddle boards kayaks and others are supplied by the hotel and the fact that these can be used safely should be welcoming and reassuring to families travelling with children. I certainly would not let my kids in the Seminyak beaches and I m from Australia where dangerous rip tides are common but the calm waters of the bay are so inviting. The spa as well as the many cultural and physical activities on offer are amazing and provide a unique experience of the healing and holistic traditions of Bali. The hotel caters to ALL types of holiday makers. be they families couples groups or singles and with the many pool and beach options everyone can find something to suit their needs. From a late check out to suit your flights departure time to catering to specific dietary requirements the Four Seasons goes above and beyond to ensure your stay is memorable and your every need is catered for. The hotel shop has items that you wo nt find anywhere else at reasonable prices. The dining options are vast and after a week I never felt like I was repeating a meal. It is a truly unique experience staying at the Four Seasons and it is obvious that the staff are genuinely interested in providing lasting and positive memories from your stay with them. The Balinese people are truly the most hospitable people in the world and I feel that the Four Seasons has the best of the best in their employ. On an island where 5 star options for your stay are vast and varied I can confidently recommend the Four Seasons to anyone who is considering a visit to this magical island. So much so that I was compelled to share my experience on TripAdvisor. Credit given where credit due and The Four Seasons Jimbaran is deserving of all praise. My only regret is that we did not stay at the Four Seasons Jimbaran all those years ago when we first visited Bali as I am sure I would have ten years worth of amazing memories from this truly unique and incomparable resort. Well done and many thanks to the residence manager Mr Wirawan for not only maintaining the level of service one comes to expect from Four Seasons but actually surpassing it. He has a great team behind him and Four Seasons should be proud of him and the entire staff for their achievementswe are already planning our return visit to Four Seasons Jimbaran and I implore anyone considering a visit to Bali to come experience the pure joy of a stay at the Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran Bay.

We managed to secure tennis lessons with the resort pro Kata. Although the sun was intensely hot and the humidity high we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The lesson came complete with cold towels water. Kata even sent us a summary of our lesson and what we learned. Again would expect nothing less from a Four Seasons property. Also took a cooking class with chef Kris. A MUST. One of the most enjoyable experiences at any hotel to date. The food was delicious and learned about Balinese food and culture along the way.

It was our first time to visit Bali we are originally from Asia currently live in NY and the stay at the FS Bali was wonderful. We got a bit tired of Caribbean resorts so decided to try Bali despite long flight. We stayed at other FS properties Peninsula and Ritz Carlton in Asia before but this is one of the best vacations we ever had. I felt the staff at the FS Bali were genuinely welcoming you and caring about the quality of our stay not because the management told them so. We did not stay at a renovated villa but the experience was still great. The Residence Villa 7 we stayed was a bit far away from the main section of the hotel but we liked the privacy. After pickup from the airport we were greeted at the living room of our villa with welcome drinks fruits and sweets. The check in process was done at the villa and it was nice after long flight. The private pool in our villa was well maintained. It was cleaned constantly by housekeeping staffs and our teenagers enjoyed it very much. Our butler Mr Aryo Yudo Susanto was fantastic. He made our stay so special. Magically he appeared when we wanted to make a request. I did not have to make a phone call to him so I called him Genie Aryo. When we went out Aryo made sure everything was smooth and pleasant. He communicated with our chauffeur all the time to confirm our departure arrival at the hotel and restaurants. I made restaurant reservations through the hotel concierge before our arrival as I was a bit paranoid about the crowds during the Easter holiday week. The concierge was very professional and prompt for all my requests. Breakfast at the hotel was very good. Lots of fresh tropical fruits and nice selection of bakery items. Indonesian noodle served at breakfast was just okay. Lunch was good as well. We went out for dinner in Semiyak most of nights so did not have dinner at the hotel. The staff at pool beach were nice as well. They brought cold bottled water all the time and helped us set up our cabanas and umbrellas immediately after our arrival at the pool beach areas. We tried both upper and lower pools as well as the private beach. Lower pool staff Mario was especially great.

Having stayed at four seasons elsewhere in the world I was very excited to go to this resort. Overall the villas are lovely and the whole experience is very nice but it just does not have the wow factor you are expecting when you pay the kind of prices this place commands. We stayed in a garden villa as a family of 3. The bedroom was a bit tight but manageable with an extra bed in it. The bathroom was nicely laid out and my daughter particularly liked the large bath. However the constant smell from the drains in the toilet was not pleasant and need not have persisted. The outside space at the villa was very good. The deck got plenty of sun and the outside dining and lounge space was a real favourite with our family. The pool is very small definitely the smallest plunge pool I have encountered but fun for a laze or little splash with young children. Despite being a garden villa we were also pleasantly surprised to be able to see the sea. What I should emphasise is this is not a retreat or peaceful oasis. The villas are very tightly packed and heavily overlooked. Our outside lounge shared a roof with the neighbouring villas lounge with just a dividing wall between. We also realised that we could see into a villa immediately behind us when the lights were on at night so we assumed others could see into ours. The resort is designed in the style of a balinese village and whilst the gardens are really beautiful it feels exactly like a village with narrow dark at night. paths in some places and buildings quite tight together. I certainly would not chose it for a couples holiday. The breakfast felt a little limited and a curious hybrid of a la carte and buffet. Even to the extent that meats and cheeses were served from behind a counter rather than self service. This seemed a little unnecessary and on occasions slowed down service. There also seemed to be a large number of pastries and danishes on offer but quite limited breads and no rolls. When food was brought a la carte it was not especially well presented either none of the nice toasted bread or garnish on the side of poached eggs for example. It was nice enough but not extensive. The restaurant at night was a real disappointment. The food was nice but the menu was quite limited. This was something of a surprise as the menu in the in villa dining was much more extensive. Perhaps as a result of the limitations the restaurant seemed very quiet and lacked any atmosphere. For our part we chose to eat most often in the villa. The focus for drinks and dining seems to be on Sundara which is also a public beach club. As a guest at the hotel the use of the day beds is complimentary but it is first come first served so at weekends etc it can get busy. This is not quite the exclusivity one thinks of when paying four seasons prices. Additionally there is nothing stopping anyone in Sundara from walking into the grounds of the four seasons. Indeed a notice by the main pool at the hotel states that the pool side restaurant is for guests only. So I guess the hotel accept that people may just walk in. Getting pool side service at Sundara could be challenging at times but the cocktails were worth it especially when you get them 2 for 1 on happy hour at sunset. The food is the same menu by the pool as for dinner in the restaurant. Again we found this limited and felt it did not really work as pool side snack options. Sundara is very popular in the evening and thus even as a guest of the hotel it can be hard to find a spot. Given that there appears to be no functioning bar to speak of in the relative privacy of the hotel grounds this is the main place to go for a drink. However it felt that hotel guests were second class citizens to the outsiders coming in. There are separate entrances from the hotel and the road and repeatedly we arrived to find no one to greet us and had to find a table for ourselves. This would not have bothered me where it not for the fact that all outside visitors seemed to be met guided to find a table handed menus and thus served much faster. The hotel has two main pools one described as the quiet pool although there was nothing to guide users on how to ensure it was a quiet pool so as a parent I made an assumption that my child should not go there but I really was not sure. The other is below the quiet pool and has a waterfall into it. This was a lovely spot and rarely got busy. Although the pool water was a little too cold. In all this was a nice hotel but it is the little things which make a place like this really stand out. The staff were mostly pleasant but did not go out of their way. There were no little extras in the room.

Also it was very confusing when we got room service in the morning. At Four Seasons Sayan we were allowed to pick whatever we wanted off the menu complementary due to our package. At Jimbaran we were offered a buffet or room service and not full menu like Sayan. The room service person would leave a bill each day. It was n\u2019t clear until we left if we would be charged or not. Everything ended up ok. And also of note. Anyone who is visiting now. If you decide to leave early because of worry of the volcano the hotel will not refund any of your stay. I thought maybe the hotel would try to calm us but we decided to leave a day early right before the volcano erupted and we did not get any kind of compassion.

Separate room for fresh fruit starters breads and bakery dairy products and a staff member on hand to make pancakes all morning. An array of fresh juices to choose from. Absolutely everywhere was spotless and beautifully designed including the garden areas. We had a 90 minute massage in a cabana overlooking the sea with the sound of a nearby waterfall. Many weddings took place in the week we were visiting. A perfect venue for whatever the occasion and celebrities could easily feel relaxed in this little piece of paradise. There was live music in the outside bar restaurant comfy seating and tapas style dishes to enjoy. You must try the coconut and lime salad which is prepared in front of you so simple but so delicious. They even printed out the recipe for us. The beach area is never crowded but comes to life just before sunset at around 530 and is athrong with families dog walkers joggers and the likes.

The team at the Four Seasons in Jimbaran Bay from the Manager to our Villa Butler were faultless kind considered service with special attention to our three kids. The residence villa we stayed in was potentially too big we were gobsmacked by how massive it was full mansion sized acomodation 20 metre pool three massive bedroom suites. The furnishing was well thought through. We ate most of our meals at the Four Seasons primarily because with three kids one of whom was a small toddler. we were limited by the youngests needs. The spa was also something we took full advantage of the hibiscus tea was very refreshing and the treatments very unique. The beach club was fun and the family really enjoyed the sunset cruise. The downside to the experience was Bali itself traffic has become unimaginably bad. so on our trip to Ubud we were stuck in traffic for several hours. The crowds have also meant that UNESCO heritage sites are strewn with plastic litter and that the beaches are choked with plastic. The Four Seasons is like an oasis in this respect but the beauty of Bali used to be that it was not only a resort you visited but the island and the culture. Unfortunately if you want to expose your family to the wonderful culture of Bali it is much harder these days with the traffic hordes of tourists and huge amounts of plastic pollution and debris everywhere. The experience at the Four Seasons was. FAULTLESS. so the tiny suggestion I would offer is really merely a suggestion from an environmentally aware tourist. when we were there a child and her mother who were guests at the Four Seasons went down to the beach and collected in a plastic tank. what can only be described as thousands of little baby crabs. One of the Four Seasons staff aided them. Much as I applaud the attention to each and every guest as a responsible corporate steward of the environment where their hotels are located they should have discouraged the guests from taking wildlife from the beach Balis beaches are already fragile ecosystems and there was really no excuse for the child taking these creatures away as playthings. Another one of the staff at the front desk was certainly to be applauded when asked about the dolphin experience from a flier she said very tactfully those are captive dolphins not free ones perhaps you may take the children to the one where you may potentially see them in the wild. I was very very heartened to see this level of awareness and guiding us to the responsible tourist operators on the island.", "offset": [1202, 1408], "date": "2018-08-03", "cpt": "3", "category": "family"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "3c6d7c1a-17e2-4ce5-a114-575dc9684f34", "sentence": "Fabulously relaxing family stay in Residences.

Our stay truly exceeded our expectations in every way and with both of us having a background working in 5 star hotels that is no mean feat. The resort was sprawling and gorgeous and even though it was at high occupancy everything still felt peaceful and unhurried The 3 Br Residence was indulgent to say the very least and we really did not even need to leave. Our Butler Dina was by far the single most impressive staff member we have EVER come across throughout our family travels in Australia North America Europe and Asia. Not only was she warm and friendly she anticipated every need we had from efortesly producing a thinly sliced lemon for the afternoon GT to discussing Balinese culture and cuisine and laughing with our children. Restaurant recommendations trips to the Escape Rooms in Jimbaran for the kids you name it she was worth her weight in gold and adopted very quickly into our family. Equally all the staff in the breakfast restaurant both waiters and chefs the waiting staff in Sundara the staff in the Spa and the guy in the Gym were also smiling welcoming and genuine. The quality of the food throughout the resort was equally top shelf as was evident in the BQ read 12 course banquet that we had in our villa with friends. No one got sick the food quality hygiene and standards were excellent. To find any fault I would have to look very hard except perhaps the quality of the cocktails in Sundara please visit Metis in Seminyak for a lesson in how to make an authentic Mojito or Mai Tai. Also just a note in terms of entertainment there was no TV in the Master Bedroom of our villa and a total lack of any in house movies DVDs or Board Games to access or even Netflix compatible TVs and hence not a lot to do after dark with kids around the Resort.

You never know if you have saved the best till last \u2013 until you get to the end. But on this occasion \u2013 I think we can safely say that we did \u2026 just. We have been travelling around Bali over the past fortnight staying in pool villas across 5 hotels. You can read more on my blog smaltravels dot blogThe Four Seasons at Jimbaran Bay is about as close to perfect as any resort we have ever stayed in anywhere. That is a big call for this trip let alone when you add it to all the other amazing places we have been lucky enough to stay in. As a travel writer I get to stay in some magic hotels. The hotel is on a hillside just at the end of Jimbaran Bay. Close enough to walk to other restaurants or hotels but far enough away for it to feel quiet and secluded. The hotel itself was busy with the IMF annual meeting on in Bali so lots of extra security and people but you really did not notice. There are only pool villas in the resort and 3 main pools so you can always get a seat and they never feel crowded. Sundrana is the beach club so it is shared with the public but other than late in the afternoon we never struggled to get a seat. It is clearly very popular and it is stunning with its Olympic sized beach front pool. It is something else to sit there at sunset with live music and cocktail in hand. The meals served are reasonably priced and lovely. It is however quite a distance from parts of the hotel so it \u2019s a good thing buggies are plentiful and fast. We preferred the terrace pool located in the middle of the resort partly because it was almost always empty it had stunning views and it was close to our room. The small person also was decidedly happy to have a really deep pool to swim in. It is 24 metres in parts. Younger children had a waterfall pool below. And the beachfront pool is 14 metres. From the terrace pool the husband loved watching the planes take off and land across the bay and I had the delight of swallows ducking and diving between chapters in my book. The grounds are lovely. Full of colour and manicured gardens all lit at night with lanterns. It really is the stuff of dreams. The flowers in the gardens are amazing and the colours at sunset spectacular. There are many choices for where you can have sundowners or dinner but the resort could really do with one more restaurant. There are really only two dinner venues unles you feel like a set menu on a private table at an eye watering price or a Balinese chefs tasting table. We ate at the next door Intercontinental the Italian restaurant on one occasion and it was also very good. We also had a lovely villa meal delivered promptly with candles and cleared away just as efficiently. The food was of a very high standard generally. The villas themselves are spread out across the vast resort. The are traditional on the outside and modern on the inside. Equiped with outdoor showers and plunge pools day beds and sun loungers. They really are perfect. Ours came with its own birds nest and baby bird next to the outdoor shower. I ca n\u2019t imagine there is a bad villa here. All offer something a little different depending on your budget. Each villa comes with candles baths insect repellent incense sticks cooling gel and the usual amenities. They also offer glass bottled water which is great given the plastic that washes up on beaches here. We were upgraded to a deluxe Villa with a view of the ocean and more importantly from the husbands perspective a view of the steady stream of planes. The airport is close enough to see but not so close you here jets taking off and landing. I could imagine that might put some people off but given the nightmare that traffic is here I am really happy we are close enough to get to the airport easily given we fly home late at night. Our pool was warm if a little on the small side. I think we have been spoilt by the size of the Villa pool at the Four Seasons Nam Hai. It was private but we did not use it all that much. That may have had more to do with the alternatives rather than the villa pool itself. The entry level villas here are not cheap but if you can stretch the budget then this place is well worth it. The breakfast buffet is fantastic. Literally everything you could imagine is there and the team take great care of you. As you would expect from a Four Seasons the service was impeccable. They have a great iPhone ap from which you can text for a buggy make a restaurant reservation or order up room service. It is prompt and easy and made a big difference. It was too easy to be at the beach and just magically text for a buggy to deliver you back to the room. Or when the small person left various belongings at the other end of the resort. They take great care of small people with welcome amenities a complimentary Four Seasons rash swim top beach bag cookies. They whisk them off to feed the fish watch the water lizards serve up frozen yoghurts for breakfast. They remembered her name as well as ours. Our days were spent polside reading playing outdoor table tennis cards or just hanging but had we wanted to engage in any activities there were plenty on offer. You can head to coconut grove and take a surf lesson ride a water bike sail a catamaran head to the spa take a cooking lesson watch a cultural dance visit a temple. the list is endless. We chose not to and I feel completely relaxed. Moving villas every few days might sound crazy to some people but not to us. We like new hotels we like new places and it meant that really made the most of the villa and hotel we were in. Sightseeing took a back seat. I do not regret that at all we will be back in Bali soon enough. We saw a lot of the island and definitely know where we had come back to and what we would avoid next time. Having stayed at the St Regis the W the Indigo Four Seasons Sayan and now here all on the same trip I can say that this hotel is the best. It \u2019s a close call though. And if you are planning a trip to Bali then you could n\u2019t go wrong with 3 nights in Sayan and 4 5 nights here.

While a very different property larger beachfront it did not disappoint in the least. My husband and I travel often for work 100 hotel nights year each and this is our first time staying at a Four Seasons resort property. We each have seen a LOT of hotels during our travels. We came to Bali for a couples vacation wanting to enjoy some RR and we found it. Note there are a number of families here and this would be a great property for a family trip but we were also very easily able to find a peaceful adult escape. We have been beyond impressed by the ever attentive and smiling staff the pristine property and beautiful scenery. We love the winding roads between the villas. You feel like you are in a Balinese fishing village. We have had a number of meals across the island and have found the best food at Sundara we have eaten there three times. try the Miso Cod and the Tuna Chirashi. Jimbaran Bay is quiet though I do n\u2019t recommend venturing too far off property the off property beach restaurants offer standard burger pizza beach fare and extremely crowded sand. The property offers a welcome respite from the crowds you might see at the larger resorts on the island. I \u2019m impressed that even at a resort with over 100 rooms we are frequently greeted by name. We also very much appreciated the personal welcome from Mary who oversees Rooms and the GM of the two Bali Four Seasons resorts Uday. Both have done a tremendous job in leading an exceptional property. I highly recommend this for frequent travelers who want a highly personalized luxury vacation. We stayed in a partial ocean view Jimbaran Bay villa that had a beautiful view thank you for the upgrade see pics. It was incredibly clean and well maintained. Note the spa is under maintenance but they have temporary accommodations set up in a residence villa. Also I was concerned that the proximity to the airport would be an issue or make the resort feel less authentic. Despite our villa looking directly out onto the airport over the bay 25 miles away we did n\u2019t mind this at all. We did not notice any jet noise and it was fun to see some of the planes taking off landing. This is very easy to forget if you \u2019re not interested. Tips Grab a cabana by the \u201c quiet \u201d pool. There \u2019s great shade a lovely view and terrific service. The attendant was hyper focused on our care bringing refreshments and even offering to clean my sunglasses.

The resort has security located at certain access points gate areas next to beach which provides an extra element of safety for those with any concerns about such issues. The pools are quite nice and ideal for relaxation but the pool in front of Sundara and next to the kids center had kids and families enjoying the pool throughout the day. I never encountered an issue with getting a seat or lounge bed close to the pools during the stay. This is quite different than Maui Four Seasons where it was imperative to be up and out early to reserve polside seating. Kid Center two levels with an easy procedure for checking kids in and out. You can also order a lunch for the little ones and they can eat at the kids center if parents are wanting an extra long break from the children. The staff were friendly and responsible with their work. Restaurants. Both locations were very good with a wide selection to choose from especially the buffet. The Indian options at the buffet were especially my favorite. The check out process was fast and friendly. I arranged for a car via the resort for transport back to Denpasar. Highly advisable but the hardest part was realizing the vacation was over at that point.", "offset": [1904, 2048], "date": "2019-07-24", "cpt": "5", "category": "family"}, {"id": 35, "uid": "479881a2-e5d4-44d1-8ab6-1257ed142a4f", "sentence": "Unforgettable memories.

This beautiful place is now well and truly in our hearts to stay. The four seasons have well and truly ticked all the boxes on hospitality. Have to say on a slightly negative note the rooms could do with a fresh coat of paint.

We think its the best we have had. From the moment we arrived late Tuesday night after a long trip with a heavily pregnant wife to the time we left today the staff and that s what makes a place could not have been more impressive. It was actually sad to go and even though we are off to another amazing hotel i think it will be hard to beat. The villas are incredible the food just mind blowing. For us not to leave the resort to eat elsewhere is unheard of but that s what we did. Views straight out over the bay. Absolute privacy. Nothing to hard or to difficult to be done. Wonderful beautiful people in one of the most picturesque settings imaginable. Photos simply do nt do it justice. We will be back with baby baker next year and probably more of our very large family and we can not wait. Thanks for making the last four days very very special.", "offset": [184, 379], "date": "2019-09-27", "cpt": "5", "category": "family"}, {"id": 38, "uid": "9d834351-46da-4251-9112-7ee0fda01106", "sentence": "Special exclusive and luxurious stay with phenomenal food. Wow nothing but high praise for our stay at four season Jimbaran Bay. We let the resort know it was our 6th anniversary and we were surprised to be upgraded from a garden villa to a sea facing villa. The villas are as just as good as you would expect from the Four Seasons reputation for luxury. The resort was beautiful very big with a lot on offer yet it felt private and exclusive. The staff were so friendly and welcoming they always greeted us by name in the restaurants. We had many restaurant bookings around Bali but we ended up cancelling them to eat in the resorts \u2018 Sundara beach club \u2019. We are here repetitively for 4 nights because the food was so delicious and the live band over cocktail hour created a great atmosphere. Ps do yourself a favor and order the octopus salad. We also took a day trip up to Ubud organized by the concierge. Here we visited the rice fields luwak coffee house and the other four seasons Bali hotel. From the Ubud hotel you can go water rafting or just hangout at the Ubud hotel location for a change of scenery. I ca n\u2019t wait to be back.
