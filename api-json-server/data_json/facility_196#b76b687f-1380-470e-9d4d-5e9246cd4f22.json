I have stayed in the Hyat a number of times over the years. The rooms are comfortable but a bit dated. It is always worth asking if you can upgrade to a slightly larger room. On every floor they have a number of rooms which are a few feet longer and have some extra furniture in. The extra cost is well worth the extra space. Check in and check out is always a pleasant experience and quick and easy. The staff here are brilliant. Always really friendly and really helpful. Nothing is too much trouble for them. I always have the hotel breakfast which is available by the lobby bar. Decent coffee all sorts of sandwiches fruit and snacks. You can load a tray up and take it back to your room to eat in private or sit and eat it in the lobby. You have Mortons right next door you can access from the main lobby. I have reviewed that separately. As well as serving snacks at the bar which is what I generally have if staying in there is a nice restaurant at the back of the hotel which I go in sometimes good sized portions and great value for money. and of course room service as well. They offer valet parking which I always use and find really convenient. I love sitting at the lobby bar in the evening especially when travelling alone. The staff are great and I always get to chat with some interesting people. They serve a range of draft beers as well as wine spirits and soft drinks. Finally this hotel is brilliantly positioned. The Washington Metro runs right next to the hotel and is perfect for getting around quickly and easily. There are hundreds of great bars and restaurants nearby but using the Metro you can get to thousands very quickly.

Even with the Construction. We stayed at the Hyat Regency without choice my husbands work booked us to stay here while visiting local area for holiday party. This hotel is a 5 star hotel by far with a beautiful lobby great staff and beautiful modern traveler friendly rooms EVEN with the horrible parking garage construction experience. I will include the bad part first please read threw the entire review because the room and hotel itself makes up for the garage mess and keeps it at a solid 5 star rating. Upon arriving and entering the parking garage we where furious. They are clearly doing MAJOR construction in the parking garage which is attached to the hotel. We spent about 30 minutes trying to find parking. some signs say go right then left you literally have no clue where to park. We just kept circling around the garage in a dark dust cloud of a garage. Lots of other cars where confused as well as everyone is looping around in the parking garage which has construction signs equipment tarps wires everywhere. major mess. We finally found parking. The jackhammers where so loud we had to cover our ears as we covered our faces in our jackets to shield us from the dust cloud. Every single car parked in the garage had about a inch of brown dust construction grime from all the work going on 247. The elevators inside the garage did not work either so we had to find our way out of the garage dragging our bags threw the filth. Upon checking in the lady behind the counter was very welcoming and made us feel better after the mess of the garage. She said because we where so upset about the garage she was going to give us a room up on the 8th floor quiet up there and a great view. The lobby was beautiful and besides one tarp on what seems like escalators that were not working it was not any construction in the lobby that was major. I love their glass elevators that climb up into the bee comb style lobby. Each floor wraps around and you can look up and see each floor in a very modern feel. The hallways where clean and beautiful. Our room was just as lovely. For 200 a night it was well worth it. Most hotels lack the most important features to make it a comfortable stay and here they nailed each important thing well and beyond lots of room comfort cleanliness tech lots of outlets. can not get over how room LARGE and very spacious the room was. The carpets where spotless the beds where fresh clean and the bathroom was spotless clean. The beds where very comfortable and the TV that faced our beds was a 60 inch or larger with great quality images. I really enjoyed the color theme of the room and the modern wallpaper and bedposts. I really loved all the outlets in this room. sometimes hotels you have to fight for spots to charge your tech gear not here. They even had USB ports in the walls with the outlets so you do not even need a iphone brick you can just plug in your usb to the wall. The room is VERY modern and tech approved. It feels like a brand new room to be honest very nice. My favourite part of the room was the beautiful white bathroom. What a beauty with great lighting. It has a large walk in vanity area that has the large sink area bathroom towel rack and makeup vanity attached to the wall. The actual bathroom that has the shower and toilet was in another door within the vanity area great feature. You can be using the actual sink and mirror while your guest can be in the actual bathroom closed at the same time. The mirror was bright great for ladies putting on makeup and had a digital clock IN the miror which is great because while getting ready in the morning you have a clock to watch. Great modern tech add. Very roomy closet is in the vanity room as well which includes your room safe. The hotel may be going threw a lot of work but it still will leave you feeling great. The only negative was the parking garage which once you bear threw the mess and park and enter the hotel you will be impressed. We loved our room got great sleep and enjoyed our stay.

The hotel lobby upgrades are sharp and clean and definitely reflect the latest aesthetic appeal of most high end hotels. Checking in and out is painless. The rooms are superior in style and furnishings. However our king bed had holes in the sheets which I found odd after renovations see the pic. Mortons Steakhouse is located in their main lobby and I will review it separately. They have an indoor pool exercise room and since they are located at a Metro stop it makes it convenient for many travelers to simply hop off the train and walk less then 100 feet to check in. The hotel is also located walking distance to a Dunkin and a variety of high end or brand name shops on Wisconsin avenue. We only encountered one simple problem in that we asked the front desk three times for extra pillows and never received them even after an in person stop at the front desk.
