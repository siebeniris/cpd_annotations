No need to valet since the self parking lot is adjacent to the valet lot. Check in was quick and easy. Kudos to front desk staff with checking in guests quickly Rooms were modern clean and stocked with essentials. Recommend a room facing north east away from the noise of the highway interstateBathrom restroom were uncomfortable bath tub and toilet placed in a small rom Pool and hot tub were dirty leaves and branches floating. It did not look like the pool or hot tub were cleaned during my 3 night stay. As well towels were limited or non existent. Receipt invoice was not delivered therefore physical check out had to be done at the front desk rather than express checkout leaving room card in the room. Invoice included County Tax and City Tax on top of the Room Sales Tax. I do not recall paying 3 taxes on top of the room cost at any other hotel.

The manager was not very helpful nor very nice. there is construction so lots of noise. There was also a kids birthday party so the pool was over run by kids and it was LOUD.
