The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and I am sure many of the rooms are too but for me this hotel just did not live up to 5star standards. I have stayed in many excellent hotels in Bangkok and while this one has many strengths it fell short overall. I booked a King room and when I arrived they only had Double Double rooms available. I normally would not care much and sometimes even prefer having two beds in my room but when I walked into my Double Double room I realized it did not have the nice long sofa against the back wall under the window that I had seen in all the photos of the renovated rooms. I went back downstairs to ask to switch and they tried to find another room but did not have anything available except an ADA room but said maybe I could switch the next night. It was only a two night stay and I had a lot of work to get done and I really did not want to change rooms the following day. I asked if there was any other higher level room available and they just said no. A manager who was European had taken over at this point and he was nice enough but I just felt it was not sincere. He made the excuse that they were very busy and had people coming and going all day and just said things like that is not this a 5star hotel. It does not matter if you have 1 guest or 1000 guests I feel he could have been much more sincere. I walked away very disappointed in the whole interaction but was hoping maybe they would leave something nice in my room as a way to make up for the fact that they did not have the room I booked available. I came back to my room later in the night and they had left nothing and there was no turn down service either. Again is not this a 5star hotel. I have had turn down service at every 5star hotel I have stayed at. I had seen many reviews with posted pictures of little treats that were left in peoples rooms but that did not happen for me. My company does a lot of business at this hotel but I got the message loud and clear that our business is not important to them. I am sure they have enough other guests where our business truly does not matter to them but at this level of hotel they should be striving to make every guest feel valued. The lounge was nice if crowded for happy hour but comfortable and nice for sitting. I was underwhelmed by the choice of hors doeuvres it was a Japanese theme the night I was there and felt that nearby 5star hotels have better offerings. The breakfast was quite good and the dining room The Rain Tree Cafe I believe was quite nice and modern and I thoroughly enjoyed both my breakfasts there. There were however other elements that lacked at this hotel. The scale in my room was beat up and old and not well cleaned. Not a huge deal to me personally but again is not this a 5star hotel. Buy nice scales for the rooms that match the quality you are shooting for. Also the actual layout of the room was not great. It was just a normal hotel room and bathroom. Small ish shower in the corner and a plain bathtub no element of design that was unique or different or luxurious at all. The silver and white in the room was quite pretty but the bathroom was just so so. Also the hallways of the hotel were not air conditioned at all so every time I walked out of my room it was 85 F at least. Not comfortable at all. Maybe this is normal in Bangkok hotels but again 5 star. Also most of the doorways are surrounded by dark wood and they all look like they were sloppily painted or lacquered over with a new coat. I suppose this was part of the renovation but it was obviously done on the cheap and it shows. Another quirk was the clock in the room it was as bright as daylight and when I went to sleep I had to put multiple towels on top of it to block out the light. There was no way to dim it and it was much brighter than a normal clock. One last thing is that I was on a non smoking floor and the people in the room directly across from me were smoking and then propped their door open to let the smoke out resulting in the hallway smelling strongly of smoke. Being sensitive to smoke I alerted the front desk and they just looked at me sheepishly and did not really respond. They made me feel foolish for even saying anything and did not seem to take it seriously. I know they can not control the actions of other guests but an apology for the inconvenience and even just saying we will look into it would have sufficed and made me know that they realized it was an issue for the guests on that floor. I will say that the Thai staff here were all very kind and have been well trained to provide good customer service but overall I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I usually stay at another hotel in Bangkok and I will be returning to that hotel after this experience. No one wants to be made to feel like they do not matter.", "offset": [3170, 3292], "date": "2016-01-19 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "b77b865b-42aa-4336-a737-8180a535dbc2", "sentence": "Value for money.

I have stayed here in the past and enjoyed it. I brought my brother and his wife to see Thailand with me this time and we had 2 rooms. The service was very good in general. The people working here are friendly helpful and kind. They upgraded me to a redone beautiful suite from the one I had originally booked that looks great with comfortable furniture great views. The bed was great and the bathroom has a nice tub with separate shower and an electric toilet. When I checked in I noticed there were no hooks anywhere in the room for bathrobes or bathing suits. The drawers in the closet also were blocked from opening. It bothered me enough I went and spoke to a manager and brought him to my room he was surprised. With in the next hour I had many engineers and house keeping staff in the room and by evening time there were hooks on both the bathroom doors and the drawers somehow worked. They even set me some extra chocolates for the inconvenience. I think rather them apologizing they should have thanked me for pointing out some major problems with their best suite. Made service came when I asked for it and they were very good. I had asked for this like ice to be delivered daily and it showed up spontaneously on 2 days but when it did not show up I called and asked for it. 2 hours later it had not shown up and I had to call again. Again they tried to appease me with some chocolate and fruit. I can be bought but this felt a little off. They have an executive lounge that we had booked and it is open all day with breakfast afternoon tea and evening cocktails and food. The staff working it are really nice one recognized me from another hotel I stay at frequently in Bangkok. The breakfast in the first floor restaurant is excellent and worth doing. The club room is nice and quiet for breakfast but has less options. They offer ti clean 2 pieces of clothing per day of stay. The pool health club and spa are all very nice. They redecorated the pool and took out some of the features I loved that included some old Thai scenes and a fountain that dripped water into the pool. They also puts a plantar in front of the mirror by the steps you use to get out of the pool. I used to love me emerging from the water and seeing what looked like a turtleme. getting out of the pool. The also upgraded the deck and I goes it is a popular wedding destination now. The hotel location is great not far from the sky train and a nice walk to Lumphini Park in the morning. I just came form talking to the people at the front desk about the blasting music at 230 in the morning and they said the pre wedding party was going on until 3 in the morning. Thy offered me another room to sleep in on a lower floor I declined. I was 5 floors below the party room and the walls were vibrating. I would recommend this hotel but be prepared for possible wedding parties that do not seem to take into account other peoples needs for things like sleep and use of the pool.
