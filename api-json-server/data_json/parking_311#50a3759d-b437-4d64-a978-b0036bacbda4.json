We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and had to go up 3 flights of stairs to reach the top bedroom.

One of the pools also features the pool bar with a great variety of beers spirits liquor and cocktails \u2013 they even have a 2for1 happy hour in the evenings. Check in at the beautiful Reception building was quick and easy and they even gave us some complementary ice cold Sangria whilst we completed the check in process. We were given room 12A on the ground floor \u2013 a large room well furnished and very clean. It had a back door leading to our own private porch and a couple of steps down onto a communal man made sandy beach. Note there \u2019s no actual access to the sea from here as the property borders one of the many river inlets but the palm lined beach is amazing and feels very tropical.

Who closes at 6 pm when check in is at 4pmCheck in we arrived a little early and was told our room was not ready yet but we gave all information and the front desk clerk said she would text andor call when our room was ready. that never happened. I had to call back and guess what it was readyNowhere on the site does it say we have 5 stairs to climb to carry our luggage up nor that we would be sharing a foyer with the people up above us. We have stayed at several resorts in our travels and I would name claim this as a resort. Check out. we left early and left a message on your voicemail.

The only thing that bothered\u200b me was the parking issues. Any time that we would go out and come back in Valet service would stop us and try to tell us we could not park our own car. This was a pain in the ass because I am a disabled vet and have my handicapped parking pass displayed right on my mirror and could see all of the empty spots to park plus they recognized us and yet tried to tell us that we were not supposed to park the car they are. Also they said that when we wanted to go out we we are supposed to call the front desk for them to get our car and bring it up front at least 15 minutes before we were to go out. Our car was right in front of our room area so no that is just foolish. We did try to get out one morning and a valet had parked a car right up against our vehicles so we could not get Into the passenger side door. I took pictures and showed them at the front desk and was told that Valet would be talked to. Other than that the place is very nice. We had a room all the way in the back where it is known to have a great view and a dock area. What needs to be done is to just trip down the mangroves so you can see over them out into the Bay area as the view is extremely limited. It could be phenomenal if just trimmed down. There is no beach there or access to the water even though it is right on the inner Bay. The receptionist at the main desk very very nice and helpful and the place is very laid back and comfortable.

Personally I did not care for the valet service I would have preferred to park my own car and leave whenever I wanted without waiting for my car to be brought to the front. I was disappointed there was no swimming beach or beach access. My reservations were made for me as we went as a group of family and friends. I knew in advance that the valet service had to be used and there was no swimming beach so I can not really complain just not my preference. There was a nice sandy beach at the rear of the rooms with nice chairs but with no access to ocean it was very hot. I believe you can see in some of the hotel pictures the thick row of mangroves that block the ocean and pretty much the view from ground level especially if you are seated.
