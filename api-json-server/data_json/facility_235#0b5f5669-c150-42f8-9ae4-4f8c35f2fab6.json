I had the pleasure of attending a business meeting on Friday 22 at noon at the turnbery hotel. I am new to this area of Florida and had no idea what to expect when I pulled into the beautiful landscaped long entrance of this beautiful over the top hotel. I was greeted by a well groomed valet who personally welcomed me to the resort and right behind him was an equally smiling bell hop. These staff really put me as ease and I knew I was in for a welcomed surprise. As I approached the main huge doors of the lobby I was again greeted by a smiling employee who kindly directed me to my scheduled event in the main ballroom. As someone who is in the hospitable business I gave the resort a through inspection as I made my way to ballroom I peeked inside one of the restaurants and inspected one of the mens restrooms. I found the place to be spotless clean the bathroom large clean and had extras like the ritz Carlton real cloth hand towels marble and granite throughout and spotless clean. As you traverse through the front entrance to the ballrooms you are provided with views of the sprawling landscaped golf course and sparking clean swming pool. Even the pool towels were upgraded and extra long so the extend from the head of the chair all the way to the other end of the chair. veryplush and the pool was crystal clear and clean. The main hallways were wide and spacious and could easily acomadate large convention style parties and business meetings. The floor staff were seen cleaning and polishing tables lights and fixtures. They kept in communication with each other with headsets in the ear just like the Secret ServiceMy meeting room was cool as it was a hot may typical Florida day. The tables were covered in pressed table cloths and logo style pens and paper were set up for all guests on the tables. Ice water stations were also set up and was refreshing to see just professional organization for my event. This turnbery hotel was truly an unexpected surprise. The only comment I could possible add is that I think the uniforms for these front line staff at drab. They should punch up the status on these workers with professional comfortable tailored uniforms like at the ritz Carlton or Waldorf Astoria.

I wanted to surprise my husband for Fathers Day some place away from Miami Beach so I selected Turnbery Isle Resort in Aventura and I was not disappointed. In fact I was truly blown away by all the special features and offerings of this resort. First and foremost Turnbery Isle is a beautiful resort with two stunning golf course a newly renovated Spa a recently opened Starbucks and they are across the stress from my favorite mall Aventura Mall. Secondly the service exceeds exceptions. We arrived around noon and were greeted kindly by Stephanie from VIP Services. She personally walked us to our room and verified our brunch and dinner reservation. We had brunch for Fathers Day in Bourbon Steak a special brunch for the occasion and it was exceptional. The food offerings were great my husband particularly loved the seafood offerings. They had a balloon maker Randal for the kids and our daughters loved that. The service was equally as good and Chance the Restaurant Manager and Raul the Dining Room Captain were both gracious and attentive. Cesar was the omelets chef and he was fun and engaging not to mention he made us the best omelets with a lot of love. Their Director of Food and Beverage Brad Randal was also very attentive always checking in with us and ensuring we enjoyed the food and service. After our delicious brunch we headed to the pool were the service continued to impress us. Paola was our amazing server she was truly wonderful and really spoilt our daughters getting them ice cream and other treats. Lucas was very accommodating also and the Pool Manager Bridgete checked in with us throughout the afternoon. Turnbery has a great lazy river and walk in pool that our kids enjoyed thoroughly. Before dinner we went back to the room to change and met Judy in Housekeeping. She was wonderful and just wanted to check with us to ensure we had everything we needed. Joel their Director of Rooms was fantastic also and he gave us a very nice amenity making us feel very special. We love Bourbon Steak and were excited to enjoy some alone adult time and as always it did not disappoint. The service steaks and desserts were all perfect and the restaurant manager Rafael was engaging and attentive. We loved our dinner and can not wait to go back again soon. Overall our Fathers Day at Turnbery Isle Resort was perfect from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. I can not say enough good things and we are already planning our next trip.

I had heard and been told many nice things about Turnbery Isle Resort and had kept it on my list of places to visit. This past Labor Day my schedule allowed me to organize a trip and stay for the long wekend 3 nights and four days. I am not certain what all the hype was because overall the hotel was just average given its category the service was spotty housekeeping barely mediocre and the golf course was under complete renovation. The disappointing fact is that this was my golfing vacation. When I booked the vacation nowhere was there any information regarding the closure andor the construction on the resort. Furthermore when I called for tee times it was not mentioned. This is just not acceptable for a resort of this type. I am told that once all the construction has been completed the property will become a JW Mariot flagship hotel great does me no good nowAs a summary I have listed the following The God\u2022 Walking distance to Aventura Mall with many good restaurants and a movie theatre\u2022. There is a beach club with free shuttle service\u2022. the valet staff is attentive and good The Average\u2022. the other staff was hit or mis\u2022. The outdoor pool was okay but pool service spotyThe Por\u2022. The property is under construction \u2022. The golf course is a mess of holes described later\u2022. The room was spacious but dirty carpet and smely\u2022. Housekeeping was poor with soiled towels and robesThe Galing\u2022. Not sure what the resort fee charge is supposed to provide since the property is being renovatedPardon the lengthy review as it is my intent to provide some more perspective for new and potential returning guests. The hotel itself is comprised of several buildings with its main entrance and check in and two functioning buildings not sure the destiny of these two but the third was completely torn downIt is heaven for golfers as you walk down from your room have breakfast and the course is right there. The buildings face the 9th and 18th greens of the Miller and Soufer courses. Check in Average minusUpon arrival you are greeted by some very friendly valet staff. I arrived by cab with limited suit cases and was whisked to the check in area. There was one staff member for the 5 people waiting in line and no readily visible priority check in I only saw the placard later but it would not have mattered since there was only one staff memberI had booked a junior suite with resort view. The check in was uninspiring and no upgrade offered as a Gold member. When I inquired I was told that I had a nice room not sure that I asked that particular question. I made sure to keep further inquiries to a minimum. The bellman was affable and talkative as we walked quite a way to the room. Since I arrived at night I could not see any of the construction that enveloped the property. Rom very porThe room chosen was the junior suite resort view. 3435Upon entering the room was large with a king bed and sitting area which had a desk and couch. A small terrace faced the golf course. The bathroom was extremely large and frankly a little wasted space. However the room did smell musty stuffy and \u201c unfresh\u201d. The bathroom which had accents of elegance marble floor and plush bathrobes but was sparse with the customary bathroom amenities Q tips cotton balls mouthwash etc. Instead both a towel and terry cloth bathrobe were soiled. I called housekeeping to make note of these deficiencies. They came 45 minutes later with 16 towels and 4 body washes and shampoos I asked for neither I wanted a tooth brush and mouthwashAfter the first night of enduring an unpleasant smell I figured out that the carpet was the culprit. I had to request this service twice before a gentleman really did spend considerable time tending to this problem. He solved it rather well. With daylight the room did not have a resort golf view. It was one of a palm tree and building next door. Oh well so much for paying extra. Restaurants good service The only restaurant that I frequented was for the breakfast buffet there is another more elegant one at the entrance which serves dinner and candidly is overpriced. Although it was warm sitting outside in the early morning with the golf course view was very relaxing. The staff was extremely nice and service was good. In particular they visited the table frequently. I had the buffet for the entire stay which had an average selection of items and the same choices for every day of the week. I would recommend some creativity and it would not take much. Service hit or misit is really hard to find good help these days. If you hire average you get average. There are some bright spots from the valet bellman and restaurant at breakfast. The rest of the property is below par. Golf course horibleThe property boasts of two golf courses the Miller and the Soufer. The latter is the more difficult one. Both are being renovated with no announcement that this was being done. Frankly I would not have been here if I had known this. In any event the course is chopped up with some holes taken from one course and some from the other to arrive at the required round of 18. From the Miller holes 1 through 9 and then holes 13 through 16. Completed these 13 holes you take the cart and migrate to the Soufer course and play holes 10 through 14The driving range is on hole 12 of the Miller and the putting green is on number 17This is not my idea of how to spend time and 120 per round. In summary there is no need to spend top dollar for this resort or for that matter visit it. The attention to detail from service to amenities does not reconcile with the price paid. There are many other hotels in the Miami area that have a better offering both with the property and with the surrounding golf courses.

I created a TripAdvisor account just so I could leave a review on this hotel. I could n\u2019t believe the subpar and shockingly horrible service that I received at \u201c South Florida \u2019s Most Prestigious Resort \u201d. I was only in town for a couple of days for a friend \u2019s wedding \u2014 I stayed at the St Regis in Bal Harbour for the first night and then checked into this hotel for my second night because my friend \u2019s family lived closer to Fort Lauderdale. Upon checkin we were given a room that faced the golf course and Brittany warned us that there was going to be some construction right underneath our patio. I had already read that on the website and said it was fine. When we stepped into the room a pungent odor of funk and musk hit us in the face. The smell was pretty strong almost like a mixture of mold and something else. We started sniffing around to see if we could find the source of the odor and we concluded that it came from the bed. The decorative throw pillow on top reeked and the sheets felt very damp to the touch. I called down to Brittany at the front desk again and very politely apologized for the inconvenience and requested another room any other room regardless of view or whatever. She did n\u2019t apologize at all simply said that there was another room a couple floors down and a few rooms over \u2026 Then said that she would send one of the valet guys to bring up our new room keys. About 10 minutes later someone who appeared to be housekeeping came by \u2014 she said she was told about the odor in the room and came to investigate. She sniffed around and made a face. I asked her if she also thought there was a bad smell to the room and SHE AGREED WITH ME. Shortly after another gentleman showed up sans new room key so we figured maybe we misunderstood and were supposed to meet at the new room. We get to the new room and wait about another 10 minutes no one comes. Keep in mind we are in the Jasmine building which is literally the next building over from the main check in lobby about a 5 minute walk at the most \u2026 and on our way to our building we passed half a dozen valet guys who seemed to be standing around doing a whole lot of nothing. We sat on the floor in front of our room with our luggage and finally I decided to call down to the desk again. No one answers. I \u2019m on hold. After 3 mins on hold my friend gets fed up and she said she was just going to go back down to the front. In the time she was gone another valet guy passed me in the hallway and asked if I was locked out of my room. I quickly tried to explain to him that no I was waiting on someone to bring me my new room key because my original room had a really bad odor to it AND IN THE MIDDLE OF ME EXPLAINING TO HIM WHAT HAPPENED HE WALKED AWAY FROM ME \u2026. like \u201c. Oh you \u2019re not locked out. Cool continue sitting on the floor in front of your room then cause that \u2019s totally normal for a guest to do \u201d. My friend came back to the room with room keys and BY THEN NO ONE HAD ANSWERED THE PHONE. I WAS STILL ON HOLD. 9 MINUTES I WAS ON HOLD. She said when she went down to the lobby Brittany was there and seemed surprised that no one had come by with our keys. She gave us a new set of room keys AND STILL NEVER ONCE APOLOGIZED FOR OUR INCONVENIENCE OR FOR THE LACK OF SERVICE. It took over 30 minutes for this whole entire process. Needless to say after we got into the room we were completely frustrated and decided to walk around the property to get a lay of the land and the amenities. We checked in on Valentine \u2019s Day so the lobby restaurant was completely decked out with Valentine \u2019s Day decorations. At the front of the restaurant entrance there was a photo booth plugged in so my friend and I decided to go check it out. Once we got inside we saw a sign that it was 1 for 4 pictures. Awesome we love photo booths. We whipped out a dollar and eagerly looked all around the inside for the slot. We did n\u2019t find one so we walked out of the photo booth and started walking around it to see if maybe the slot to insert the money was on the outside. This photo booth was right at the entrance of the restaurant literally no more than 5 feet away from the hostess stand where the hostess and 2 men in suits stood. They saw us walk around waving this dollar bill in the air like idiots and inspecting every corner of the photo booth without saying a word. Finally I looked at one of the men and asked if he knew where to put the money in and he replied to me \u201c Oh it \u2019s not operational right now \u201d. WHAT. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING ON TELLING US THAT. At this point we \u2019re both convinced that we are in the twilight zone so we took a tour of the rest of the \u201c resort \u201d before heading back to our rooms. In summation everyone at this property was rude and negligent except this nice older lady who gave us a tour of the spa amenities and encouraged us to come back when we had time. Even valet was rude. That evening we paid and requested to get our car pulled around \u2026 seemed like it had been awhile so we just wanted to make sure the request was in \u2026 asked one of the drivers and he curtly reminded us that \u201c it \u2019s only been 9 minutes \u201d. I am honestly appalled at the level of service here at this Mariot property. I work in the hospitality industry and can never imagine a guest receiving this type of experience regardless of the property \u2019s brand or tier. The entire resort carried an air of unnecessary unpretentiousness which is almost ludicrous considering we stayed at a property the night before that sells their rooms for 90 a night and we never once felt like we did n\u2019t belong or were out of place. I do n\u2019t know whether to assume that the lack was service was because we were deemed \u201c poor \u201d or because we were n\u2019t Caucasian \u2014 ideally I would like to give people the benefit of the doubt and just chalk it up to someone having a bad day but I do n\u2019t think everyone was having a bad day on the same exact day. I do n\u2019t expect anyone from Turnbery to acknowledge or apologize for our terrible experience at this point either \u2026. I \u2019m just doing the only thing that patrons and guests ever have the power to do which is to share their experience with others. I will never return to this hotel and at my friend \u2019s wedding reception I recommended for anyone who inquired about the hotel to not stay there either. PROS. it is very close to Aventura Mall which offers a great selection for shopping and also features a 93 foot slide. Very fun I highly recommend this activity. CONS.

Very different property now I stayed here twice with family during a one week period and until now this hotel had been my favorite in the Miami area. The switch to JW Mariot is a big step down from the Turnbery brand that its management carefully cultivated over the years. they have gone to mass production and conventions and decidedly down market. The problem so far is that things are not really working well we saw luggage going to the wrong room computer stations consistently not working and staff people not knowing things they should know and not being prepared to go out of their way to make things work until a manager stepped in. One time we checked in at 10 pm and our room was still not ready and although our reservation was marked with connecting rooms we did not get them that night they did offer to move us the next day. In the new tower the air conditioning works well the shower water pressure is fair but not particularly good and the rooms are pretty nice although for a new tower i was surprised at how stained our carpet was in one of the rooms already. The hotel was busy and I was not too happy that at 10 pm on a Saturday night room service was backed up an hour and the hotels coffee shop was closed. We ate appetizers in one of the fine dining restaurants that was still open and the front desk comped our dinner which I found out later and which was rather nice of them and unexpected. When we checked in we called 3 times over a 2 hour period to get some door stoppers for our connecting rooms. We waited about half an hour to get our car from the valet. It does not help that when you call on the telephone people do not answer their extensions and we never succeeded the entire stay in reaching the car valets over the phone which is a problem because they tell you to call 15 minutes in advance to allow time to get your car. I would recommend ditching the car for a stay here and just use Uber. The front desk did not reach them either. I was upset that they do not get the New York Times at the hotel and you can not buy it at the sundry shop either. The Wall Street Journals they kept in a closet were gone before 9 am. I never saw a concierge in the lobby so I do not know if there is one. The front desk person said she did not know when the concierge shows up and I was perturbed because I thought that someone whose station is right in front of the concierge desk ought to know what goes on across from them. But that is what you are now getting here staff people who are not really part of a whole hotel but just compartmentalized in their own little worlds. The new pool area is a bit like a theme park you go through an entrance area with turnstyles and a scan of your wrist band to make sure you can enter. The pool area is cool in design with warm water and the water slides are average. no big deal but nice. It is hard to get shade which is really tough in the hot summer sun and by 11 it is hard to find a lounge. You have to climb a tower of about 4 5 stories for each ride and there is a limit as to how many times anyone is willing to do this. The Flow Rider is hugely busy they make you sign a waiver each and every day and my kids just gave up looking at the long lines to get on it. The hotel sells day passes and we saw a lot of people paying for things with cash and credit card which is a good sign that they are day pass guests the hotel is cheapening its resort by letting too many outsiders in to give their guests a good experience and it is not a relaxing place by any means as you might hope for in a resort. The crowd at the pool is different than it used to be and you see a lot of body paint around. Breakfast at the Corsair has definitely been Mariotized they got rid of many things they used to have and the quality is definitely down. A few years ago a buffet breakfast here was in the top 10 of hotels in America in my opinion and my wife was taking home recipes for home made cakes. The elevators in the tower have temporary certificates in them that expired in March and it is 3 months later. I saw the county inspector there and nobody seems to be bothered by it because the certificates are in the office but good management puts up their certificates and this kind of thing adds to the feeling that the place is just becoming too large to be managed well and that management is just not on it and walking the floor. I really got the feeling throughout that Mariot did not send in their A Team to take over this property when it opened up its new tower and shifted its focus to groups. I do not think that guests of Turnbery are going to want to be put on hold with a recording for several minutes every time they want to talk to someone at the hotel and have lots of extensions simply not picking up the phone ie for instance the front desk tried to call the business center at 9 am and nobody picked up. Three elevators for a 17 story tower is not enough especially when bellmen are using the same elevators for check ins and check outs and when one elevator goes out as it did when we were there. The hotel is dominated by groups and can not handle the turnover they told us that they could not possibly clean 400 rooms by 10 pm. One morning at breakfast there was only one person manning the omlete station and a line of 8 people waiting. Lifeguards at the pool do not have bandaids around and the person watching the exit of the water slide can not tell you where a pair of lost goggles in that pool goes from there. Lots of people wait in line at the front desk and computers do not work. You get the idea. The hotel has so many promotions going on that when you check out you really have to go over your bill to make sure the proper credits have been applied. It used to be very hard to use Mariot points at this property you can now use them which also means you have more guests coming with points than paying cash which is a disincentive for a property to provide quality goods and services. The gym here remains excellent and the spa is OK they need investment there. The Swiss shower was being repaired when I visited and it was the same thing last time I was there a year or so ago. A resort like this should have a better spa more than just a waiting area and some treatment rooms a locker room and a sauna. My feeling is that the way forward for this place is to take one of the buildings such as Jasmine and make that a boutique hotel within a hotel that runs at a 5star level and cater to their clientele with that carve out. Otherwise the kind of guests that would go to Turnbery will probably be looking for another property to take its place. We would not think of going back unles we knew that this place got its act together. Hardly anything we did here was hassle free and I do not care how cheap it is it is not what I want in a resort. I saw a VIP area at the pool area but if I were a VIP I do not know that I would want to be here in the first place. I wonder why the owner trashed his own brand to do this I guess he thought this kind of mass market property would be more profitable.

First it \u2019s really annoying that no one ever seems able to answer the phone. Leading up to the stay and while here we called numerous times to the front desk valet concierge restaurant room service etc. Always placed on hold. Second we were woken up early in the morning by very loud groundskeepers and motorized vehicles at 50 60 am right outside our 3rd floor window that ran constantly. I called the front desk and complained and they said they would stop them but it continued unabated for another 45 minutes. Not a very relaxing trip to wake up to the sound of loud screeching equipment at the crack of dawn. One night we asked the concierge to make a reservation for us at Bourbon Steakhouse Luckily I called to confirm the day of the reservation because she never made it. The girl at check in gave us lots of incorrect information. She told us Titanium members were entitled to complimentary green fees for golf. Obviously that is incorrect so I told her that must be wrong. Then she said I would get 10 off which also turned out to be wrong because that only applies when the tee time is afternoon. She also told us we were entitled to half off drinks during happy hour 5 7 at the lobby bar. Also turned out to be wrong. She never offered me the Titanium welcome gift until I asked for it after she said goodbye. Then I find out I do n\u2019t even get a free breakfast only a free continental breakfast with an up charge for the Buffet. Really. Not even free breakfast for someone who had been loyal to Mariot for 20 years. So we do the breakfast and it \u2019s just ok. Nothing special. Maybe a little better that what you get in a typical Mariot lounge. And the tables and seating in the restaurant are very worn down and dated. Not at all what I expected from what I thought would be a high end upscale resort. The service was hit and miss. Some people like the bartenders and golf valets were great. Others seemed indifferent or borderline rude in particular the lady who works in the pro shop and certain people who work the phones. The place is very expensive but we knew that coming in. And the place was crazy busy the whole time. Swarming with unattended kids. I assume the water park is a big draw for families so keep that in mind if you are looking for a quiet peaceful trip. If you come during Christmas or Hanakah expect it to be chaotic everywhere in the hotel. Especially during breakfast where we had kids pushing through us in line.

We called and they were not apologetic as one should be they told us it was housekeeping error that the Jr suite we booked did not have the bed couch as we were expecting.

Which means those members seem to be given an unspoken priority. We had put our kids towels and items out on chairs we woke up early to get tidal cove. A member demanded our chairs when we were away from them. The pool people then gave our seats up and moved our items. The hotel has a poor way of handling member and guest relations.

Spotless. The best of quality in toiletries and sumptuous bathrobes. As well the view was idyllic from the huge double glass sliding doors with a balcony that would rival the size of our entire stateroom on the ship. We looked out to the finely manicured golf course and the huge water park with multiple waterslides and climbing courses. Getting to our room was a quite a hike around and through several buildings. Long inside halls much wider than actual hallways were carpeted and hard to pull or push luggage. We saw the beautiful pool area that had lounges and umbrellas. The whole area around each building was beautifully landscaped and widely side walked. However there were a series of three steps most everywhere and those with walking difficulties struggled when those obstacles arose. There were ramps in various places but not easily visible by those who were not familiar with the grounds. We went to the in house restaurant for lunch. It was crowded and busy and the wait was long because of all the arrivals from the cruise ship. The price was an eye popper. However food was good the gal who served us was great. There is a golf tuck shop that had a few snacks chocolate bars and single sodas. They were 5 each. We wanted to run off our boarding pass for our flight the next day but the unattended FedEx business centre charged 05 minute plus the price of the paper. We waited till we got to the airport. I looked up the price for a room during the night of our stay. 49 plus all the local and sales taxes. I see that the prices have come down with travelers coronavirus concerns.
