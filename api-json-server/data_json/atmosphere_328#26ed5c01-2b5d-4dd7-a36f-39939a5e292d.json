I had stayed at the Sheraton in Melbourne the week before and was expecting the same experience in Sydney pretty good but not fantastic. but I was blown away by this hotel. I am a regular at other major Sydney hotel chains and had never thought to try this one but had got a web deal for a very reasonable price and thought I had give it a go glad I didI must say it was the best service I have received at check in for a very long time Louise was the staff member who was extremely friendly and genuine. so off to a good startThe room was fantastic a large very comfortable king bed all the amenities you could hope for the quietest room I have stayed in in Sydney lovely city views good tv selection and the spa and pool were fantastic the pool is on the rooftop. The location is exactly what a tourist in Sydney would hope for right near the shops and train stations and Hyde Park of course and walking distance for any Sydney city tourist attraction. I live in Sydney so can say this with confidence. The bar and restaurant were also amazing which to be honest I was not expecting and there was a great DJ playing on Friday night good food and good service. Great ambience too. so much so that I am surprised it is not busier. I am truly impressed with this hotel and will most definitely stay there again.", "offset": [31, 167], "date": "2015-03-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "d245ea54-3ff1-4153-95ee-165af7fab139", "sentence": "God knows how this place gets such high ratings. We did a 4 week trip to Hong Kong and Austraila staying in several hotels. Sadly we found Sheraton on the Park to be the weak link in our stay.

One reviewer described the management here as argumentative. We did nt find this to be the case but we did find them to be very provincial when we had to complain about certain aspects of our stay.

I rated this hotel a 5 star on my previous visit and again I would have done the same if it would not have been of this extremely poor customer care services provided on my last visit August 5th. I am a SPG Platinum member and was traveling with 2 Mariot Platinum member whom I convinced to stay at Sheraton On The Park due to my previous satisfaction. I booked all 3 rooms under my name and paid for the three rooms in order to obtain my Platinum status for my partners. I was declined this by the front desk manager and the second manager who attended upon request. I was told this they were just following SPG policy and that there was noting anyone could do. After many attempts to negotiate we gave up and the manager Mr Cherry offered the lounge access to my partners at a discounted price of 60 per day which we declined in return. So no room upgrades or lounge access provided for my 2 partners. Made be feel extremely humiliated and embarrassed because they had given up their status at Mariot because i told them the Sheraton was very nice which I extremely regret now. I forwarded an email to the hotel manager Mr Stanton but to my surprise he never bothered replying to my request for assistance. I tried my best to have my two friends trying an SPG experience and perhaps switch from Mariot to SPG but it will certainly not be the case. Overall my experience was humiliating and far from meeting our expectations. On a different note this is the first time in my SPG experience that I do not receive a request for survey online.

We checked into your hotel yesterday. I would like to put on the record our dining experience. It started by being told we could not have a table at the early sessions this weekend. We are staying in this hotel because of previous positive dining experiences over the years and intended to have most of our meals in the hotel. Maybe we should have been advised that we should book in advance if we wished to dine when we booked the room. We booked and arrived for the second sitting at 805 to find a throng of 100 hungry diners queued in a melee that would make you think a Sizlers queue a pleasure to line up in. We went back to our room for half an hour had a drink and tried again. This time no one was there not even someone to show us to our reservation. The food and service was some of the worst I have experienced in years I \u2019l just itemise1The shellfish had been well picked over by the time we got there. Half the oyster and clam shells were empty. The oysters although sweet and fresh were the smallest I have ever been served I presume guests had been picking them off the shell to double up2The bugs were tasteless probably due to being frozen to long3SERIOUSLY the blue swimmer crab was off. One whiff walking past them told the story I would be surprised if no one eating them did n\u2019t end up in the loo for the night4On the main buffet half a whole salmon was all that was left for protein. Oyster Kilpatrick never surfaced. The pork cold leftover and half an hour later the meat titled \u2018 lamb shanks \u2019 which they were not arrived over cooked dry and swimming in a black onion soup of some sort yuck5Why there was a three person deep throng at the dessert table is beyond comprehension. The deserts were so bad that the woman next to me left with jelly beans and Jaffas in a bowl comlaining about the quality of the jelly beans. I just had ice cream only one to choose from the waiter said he \u2019d be back in 5 minutes with the other6We ate our desert and had to ask for the table to be cleared this was half done and reluctantly we put the waste seafood scrap bowl on the floor so we could eat desert without the whiff of prawnheads7Tea and coffee was not offered as has been usual in the past. So my wife ordered tea by the time the milk arrived had to ask. the tea was cold and my coffee still had not arrived. I finally had enough and complained to a young woman who said she was the manager. I had n\u2019t seen her all night she was talking at the register rather than running her restaurant. She said she would definitely get back to me and pass on my complaints to the staff I \u2019m sure she \u2019l blame the staff but I did n\u2019t believe she would get back to me because she scrawled my name and room number on the back of a soiled drink coaster. The worst. guests at tables around me were complaining as well. Needless to say I \u2019m canceling my other restaurant reservations and do n\u2019t expect to be billed for this meal. And further if you expect payment without argument for minibar items may I suggest you supply a minibar menu with prices. Further I asked for my room to be made up at 10 am. When I returned at 3 pm it was still unmade and I waited in the bar till almost 4 pm. bloody disgraceful.", "offset": [212, 356], "date": "2015-09-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "d1732ad7-ab51-403f-90d9-1adbe366b95f", "sentence": "Fun stay.

Stayed here many times. Service has been on and off. We sometimes stay in the club room. Once when we did not we had a bit of an issue with the manager on duty when booking we had listed one adult with the other to meet in the morning and they refused to provide the second complementary breakfast even though the rate remains the same when 1 or 2 adults and the booking clearly states breakfast for 2 even when booking for 1. We were told that the rate would rise if booked for 2 instead of 1 false in most cases. He then told us that it would only work that way in the club room which was highly exclusive and seemed to be emphasizing this quite strongly. He seemed to imply that we had no right to complain since we were not one of their exclusive patrons. Speaking from experience the club rom Sheraton club is not particularly exclusive. You get access to a nice part of the hotel and a couple of perks in terms of food but other than that there is no real distinction. This was highly disappointing since we had booked there at least half a dozen times and are part of the spg. Other than this particular issue we have had no other problems.
