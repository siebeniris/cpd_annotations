We did not have any expectations for this hotel as we were just using it for a quick getaway but everything in the hotel was absolutely great. The room was completely updated and extremely clean and eye pleasing. Although housekeeping unfortunatley missed our room one day we were so suprised with how well everything else went that we did not mind. Our favourtie thing about this hotel was the staff. They were exyremely professional and for the most part super friendly. Our favourite place in this hotel was the lounge where we could relax at the end of the night. The bartender was amazing and actually took the time to talk to us and he made us feel very welcome we will definitely be back.

I found that everything met my expectations and beyond. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I thought that he lobby was very presentable. I found that my room was excellent. The beds were very comfortable for sleep. The bathroom was clean and very good overall. No complaints what so ever. Everything. Especially the room. Great location right by the highway and close to a mall. My friend and I went to Stratford to see a play. This worked out well. Just continue to do what you do.

To start I want to let everyone know that I recently switched from staying 75 nights per year at Best Westerns and in the past few months have recently changed all of my stays to the Holiday Inn chain. This hotel in particular was what convinced me to change in the first place. The new renos on the tower are perfect and make the room exceptionally friendly for a business traveller. The 1 King room in the Tower has a perfect set up to do work without being crammed into a little desk or far from an outlet. The best part of these rooms is that your bed is surrounded by open outlets no need to unplug lamp or clock. the phone has an iPhone 456 charger cables as well as a mini USB for non Apple users. I know this seems like something extremely small and trivial but it is a HUGE piece to have when you are traveling as much as I do. Bed Very comfortable sleep Holiday Inn is very well known for doing the firm and soft pillows and these do no disappoint. Washroom. Heated floors and a glass walk in shower what more do you want. Overall this is a perfect place to stay if you are on business in kitchener waterloo area. there is a huge access to basically anything you want to eat within a 5 km area or 15 minute walk. Access to the major highways in all direction is right off the parking lot. Love this place and looking forward to many more stays here.", "offset": [851, 972], "date": "2015-09-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9ad1ad55-95ca-41b0-9d27-8d3152e970cf", "sentence": "OK visit but checkout was strange. Stayed at this hotel for Moparfest car show. Hotel room was clean and comfortable. Indoor and outdoor pools were nice and areas clean stocked of towels. We enjoyed a breakfast which came with our room and service was pleasant. However when I checked out of my room I was asked if I wanted to keep it on my charge card. Well as I was coming back to the USA it was a chance for me to spend my Canadian money. I told the clerk that I was going to pay cash. When I said this she told me they had NO CHANGE and I would need exact amount. This I have never heard of and quite honestly got a little nervous. So I left it on my card and completed my transaction. When I got home immediately contacted Holiday Inn Customer Care and explained this to them. Their representative assured me this was not policy of Holiday Inn and did not understand why they could not provide me with change. Representative told me she would forward my concern on to general manager.", "offset": [690, 781], "date": "2016-08-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "632020c8-13d2-4bc4-b0b9-af5f565325fe", "sentence": "Updated rooms.

After a long drive it was a pleasure to check into the Holiday Inn Kitchener and get a room without a reservation. Our room was clean cozy and spacious. We especially enjoyed the sauna swimming pool and jacuzi. This Holiday Inn property is easy to navigate around as it is the perfect size. In the summer months the outdoor pool is open. An extra perk was the free coffee at the entrance of the restaurant.

We where going to stay one night Saturday. They had a kids hockey team and parents staying there also. At 9 pm the kids were yelling in the hallway slamming room doors banging all our door and other rooms kicking and screaming and fighting in hallway. Kids told me there parents where upstairs drinking and drunk. So no parent supervision and I guess parents did not care the trouble there kids where causing. I call front desk and spoke to a manager she did come and observed kids behavior but could do NOTHING about it. We checked out at 10 pm Saturday night and drove 2 and half hours home. Will never stay there again or recommend Holiday Inn in Kitchener to anyone unles there there to party and have fun.

Hotel has converted from a Holiday Inn and has been completely renovated. The lobby and bar area is very nice with lots of room and 2 large TVs for watching games. The room was new and had a nice Keurig maker. Had the diamond member breakfast buffet and it has a very large selection from eggs sausage potatoes etc. The table next to me ordered omelette and it take a while since the kitchen still working out the changes. The night clerks were both very friendly and gave me a shaver and can of shaving cream since I forgot mine.
