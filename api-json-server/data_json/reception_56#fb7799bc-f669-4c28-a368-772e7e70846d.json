I started out quite pleased with choosing the Westin for our stay in NOLA. The lobby is beautiful with sweeping views of the city. Location is perfect staff at the entrance were friendly and we were offered a late checkout when we checked in. Then I went to our room. The room appears to have last been updated in the 80s. The furniture is beat up paint is missing or peeled off the trim. The toilet leaked from the base despite someone coming to fix it our second day. The connector for the handheld shower sprayed all over the bathroom initially but that was fixed. The tub was dingy looking and the blow dryer had a mind of its own one minute blowing high. the next barely blowing at all. The bed was OK but not the heavenly comfort we would have expected. The coffee maker only brewed half a cup and spit the other cup out of the sides no matter what I tried to do differently which is not a good scenario when dealing with piping hot water. On our last night there we ordered pizza from room service. This was probably the most disgusting pizza I had ever eaten. Unfortunately in NOLA kitchens seem to close by 10 so if you want something to eat late at night your choices are the food court area at Harahs or room service.

The low standard of quality at the Westin New Orleans place was so disappointing I was so disgusted and for health and safety and sanitary reasons we were moved to 4 different room before the manager found room that was clean I took pictures of the disgusting rooms and mattresses that were all urine stained and emailed the Manager katie who promised to take care of this disaster for us we were promised 2 nights free acomodations to make up for the disastrous stay we had have emailed Katie the manager several times and I have not yet had any compensation for what had happened the manager does a great job of avoiding customer service and not responding back.

Currently staying at the Westin for a conference. The location is a short walk to the convention center. For background I am a loyal customer of the Westin chain and have stayed at several of their properties across the US. In a nutshell the New Orleans facility is far below par. My experience has prompted me to do something that I \u2019ve not done before actually write a review before my stay is complete. I \u2019l explain below. I arrived for check in at 2 pm and was promptly informed that they had no rooms available at the time. They were kind enough to hold my luggage. I confirmed that they had my loyalty program details which they did. No acknowledgement of my business or gold elite status was offered. Thought that they were saving it for the actual check in. After a long day at the conference returned to find an unattended reception desk. Another guest who was clearly irate for his own reasons had to yell to get attention. At this point the staff had their second opportunity to rectify the aforementioned issues. I explained that I was checking in. The receptionist rather casually printed off two keys without providing any further details of my room directions to said room or any of the amenities. No instructions provided by staff or in room to access WiFi I \u2019m literally using my cellular data to upload this. I presumed that based on my prior discussion I would get an upgraded room. But boy was I wrongThe first clue was that I was not put on a preferred guest floor. The moment I walked in I was struck by the musty smell of old carpet. The theme continued in the form of really old furniture tired and stained bedding and the unusual absence of any USB terminals. The bathroom vanity old and cracked. The grout is horendously discolored suggesting a lack of cleaning andor insidious mold. Sensing a mistake I called the front desk and was rather promptly informed that there were no upgrades or alternate rooms. Had I not been traveling solo I would have asked to speak to a manager. However given the general apathy and ineptitude of the staff I shudder to think of interacting with their leadership. Also I am too exhausted to care at this point. For 80 for 2 nights I think anyone who reserves a room here deserves much better. To reiterate my previous assertion this facility is not fit to bear the Westin name for either service or room standards. Would not stay here unles major changes are made. Hope that Westin is aware of these problems and is working to fix them.

We checked in received our \u201c elite status \u201d room cards and proceeded to another set of elevators to our room on the 15th floor. After a delicious dinner a block from Bourbon Street seriously give Coterie a try \u2014 you wo n\u2019t be disappointed and a walk along Bourbon Street we grabbed our Cafe du Monde beignets and walked the short two blocks back to the hotel. After a 10hour driving day from Florida all we wanted was a nice relaxing and HOT shower. Unfortunately the water never reached above an incredibly sad luke warm temp. My husband called the service express number only to be told there was a known issue with the water temp and that we would not have hot water that evening but \u201c hopefully \u201d it will be resolved by morning. After being transferred a few times we were then told by the front desk clerk that there was no manager on duty. We were offered a measly free breakfast but nothing else. We each took TWO cold showers in a row the water issue was NOT resolved by morning and then they attempted to charge us 57 for two breakfast buffets that were mediocre at best. After speaking to a manager who very clearly did not like his job we were assured the breakfast was comped as well as our 45 charge for valet parking your only option unles you want to lug your luggage from an hourly charged public garage a block away. All in all the experience at this Westin was incredibly disappointing and the service was lacking a great deal.
