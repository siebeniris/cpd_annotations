The Boathouse has a beautiful location on the Beach it took 3 minutes to get our morning swim which we enjoyed very much. We had a lovely Beachfront Suite nice large size room suite very clean and good comfort. Not to many furniture and a lovely big bed in the Suite. We had a veranda with two chairs and a small table enough room on the table for coffee cups and drinks. Nice coffee maker good coffee in the suite used it every day. There was an elevator and stairs leading up to the rooms so you could do what you felt like getting up and down to your room. Two very nice pools the best pool for us was the pool closest to RaKaTa where breakfast was served. The staff in general were very serviceminded and they all did their very best to help you. I would suggest the management to have some of their stafmembers attending an English Course I think it would help everyone stafmembers and guests it would lift the place up to 5 stars in our opinion.", "offset": [489, 614], "date": "2015-04-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3d61fc25-55a5-4718-a95c-868d8b640643", "sentence": "great location right on the beach.

We had researched hotels and locations for our holiday with our 2 children at length. We read the reviews on The Boathouse and looked at their website we thought it sounded perfect for us. Imagine our shock when we arrived to find that the hotel was far from what we had expected. The location is busy noisy road side with the appearance being old tired and run down. The hotel reception is dark and dismal the staff of similar appearance. No Thai smiles greeted us here. I had to check we had been taken to the right place. After checking in this is what we sawTired restaurant with gloomy table linen. Filthy pools with grime around the inside of them. Not fit to put my dog in let alone meThe surrounding the polsides were dirty. The sun beds were black with mould. The wooden sun beds devoid of stain or paint. Fit for the tip and the other style of sun beds were rusty. Sun bed cushions were split with the filling spilling out of them. The steps and tiles around the pools were broken and yellow in colour. Guttering was broken and just left on the floor. The bedding and towels grey in colour much past their best. Both our rooms had a horrible smell to them which had been tried to be covered up. The beach front description was a joke admitting I could see the sea but I was not beach front. The room was in the corner of a court yard. dirty polside. When we have previously booked beach front elsewhere in Thailand I have stepped out of my room onto the sand. The room booking was wrong even after I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to confirm we required a twin for our 21 and 25 year old son and daughter. They could not sort out the mistake suggesting they give our children extra pillows to put down the centre of the bed. ApalingWhen we complained we were met with frosty and unhelpful faces who suddenly could not understand or speak English. No wifi was available or telephones offered to assist us to sort out our unhappiness. We vacated the hotel to use our mobile phone to call our tour operator who did sort our problem very quickly. We were refunded 7 nights out of 8 booked. It was the local agent however who charged us for the night we did not stay there. We did not want to spend a single night then it was so disgusting. Hotel from hell best describes this experience. This is our first and hopefully last experience where the hotel has not met the standards and expectations.", "offset": [382, 453], "date": "2016-07-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "48c2779a-211a-46b8-aa69-79e458f8e19b", "sentence": "Ok food ridiculous Sydney NY prices. we have been to Phuket many times and I must say this place takes the cake for the most overpriced meal we have eaten in Melbourne let alone Phuket. Most stakes are 150 baht per piece without tax service condiments etc. We ordered the tbone speciality for two 300 baht with a side of mashed potatoes. The meat was lovely and tender but with quite a lot of fat on the bone. The potato serving was very small but tasty. Whilst the meal was nice with a good mix of gravies the price value is not acceptable for Phuket. The total cost with an average wine was around 850 baht. Whilst the venue may be on the beach there are far better and more reasonably priced options in Phukey such as Mom Tris beach views SAMs steaks or the simple kata BQ house for beach views and cheap meals.

If you are looking for a small hotel with personal service right on a glorious beach with safe swimming look no further. It may not have a gymn but makes up for that in so many other ways. All the staff are so welcoming and go out of their way to make your stay special. Our bedroom on floor 3 was lovely with a sea view and comfortable balcony. It was always spotlessly clean with no shortage of towels. In addition to the usual toiletries we were provided with excellent mosquito repellent and also sting relief. Whilst these are not a problem within the hotel you can certainly get nibbled whilst out and about in the evenings. The beach is right in front of the hotel no roads to cross and worry about getting a beach bed as the hotel provides really comfortable ones around the pool which overlooks the beach. There is security on the gate leading to the beach so no worries about leaving kindles or phones with your stuff whilst you go for a swim. Other than breakfast we chose to eat out. The breakfast area has been moved into the dining room and terrace in the last year and this is a huge improvement as it is more spacious and there is a bigger variety of food available. The freshly made fruit vegetable juices are superb. My only minor criticism would be about the bread which is really poor quality and not in keeping with everything else. This hotel has recently been bought by another company. I do hope sincerely that it does not change much other than perhaps including a gym and that the present staff are kept on.

Sawadekap from Singapore. We have to say each and everyone in The Boathouse has played a part to make our stay so special and memorable. From the moment we arrived at the resort until our departure we have been treated with so much care and hospitality from everyone from the reception the restaurant and even housekeeping. It is wonderful how everyone always took the time to greet and chat with us and welcoming us with such warm genuine smiles. Other than the team what sets The Boathouse apart from other hotels we have been at are really the small gestures and little lovely touches making each moment spent there extra special. Instead of the usual reception check in we were welcomed to the lounge and served with complimentary mocktails and fancy hors doeuvres. We were then personally ushered to our room by Ms Pond who delivered very well showing us around the resort and the room. The sweetest part of their nightly turn down service was these little sea creatures folded from coconut leaves which was such a delightful touch that we even brought them back to Singapore as keepsake. Most importantly the team at The Boathouse made sure that all our special requests were taken care of from the halal restaurants to the late checkout and best of all giving us the room with the best seaview to wake up to every morning. Such little efforts and attention made for a fantastic stay at The Boathouse. But the most memorable of all is of course the chef of The Boathouse. He really impressed us with his delicious food warmth and humbleness. Again we felt so touched having the chef taking the time to sit down and chat with us and making the effort to ensure that our special dietary requests were attended to. We fell in love with a dish of coconut shoot and dried shrimps which he specially prepared for us over dinner. A simple dish cooked with so much flavour and finesse. And finally to the General Manager Max many thanks once again for taking your time to chat with us and making our stay at The Boathouse amazing. You are blessed with a great team please take care of them and send our warmest regards to themWe really hope to come back to The Boathouse in the near future and hopefully it wo n\u2019t be too expensive for us to come back regularlyLots of love from Singapore Wandi Faz.", "offset": [184, 370], "date": "2017-11-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "09600e83-ce6d-4f0b-bdab-5ff15dc9b39c", "sentence": "Thailand Boathouse Kata beach.

There are not enough kind words to say about this hotel. From the minute we arrived we were immediately welcomed with refreshments and snacks to enjoy as we sat enjoying the view while we were checked in. We could tell immediately that this was going to be an amazing stay. They did not say it but I think they may have upgraded our room as we had a balcony that I was not expecting to have. The room was spacious and filled with every amenity we needed even sandals and a beach bag tonuse for our stay. There was fresh fruit ready for us and each day more fruit and sweet treats were given to us to enjoy. Every staff member we interacted with or even just walked by was so warm and friendly we felt like royalty. Watch night at turn down they left cute little lead origami and the second day even left a sweet Happy Anniversary laid out on our bed with roses. The property is small and quaint but the service was spectacular. The infinity pool along the beach made for amazing views and relaxing days. The spa is next to the pool with large open windows doors so you can hear the sound of the waves during your massage. I did the 60 minute aroma massage and loved every minute of it so relaxing. Around the hotel there are a lot of restaurants and shops a little convenience store and pharmacy right across the street. Two Chefs restaurant right across the street had fun cocktails and a live 2 person band that took requests they were amazing. The next night we ate at Mama restaurant and it had amazing food too. But on our last night we chose to make it extra special and had dinner at the hotel and it was the perfect ending to our trip. The food was phenomenal we shared the Thai and western set with wine pairing. We could not stop raving about each wine and each course everything was so tasty and the wines paired perfectly. We had an early flight the next morning and they offered to make us a breakfast box to have ready for us in the morning since we were leaving before breakfast started. the breakfast is also amazing buffet and a la carte included so many options. It was another example of how they go above and beyond in the service they give you. We were blown away and were so appreciative that they cared to offer it.
