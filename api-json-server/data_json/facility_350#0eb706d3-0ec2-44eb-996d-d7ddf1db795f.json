The room was a corner king facing Canal Street. The room itself was spacious and had a great view.

Stayed over Labor Day weekend for our first trip to New Orleans. First bit of advice use the alternative address listed for GPS directions as the front entrance is accessible but undergoing renovations. We arrived an hour or so before check in time and Lisa was able to quickly and efficiently check us into our room thank you. Our room was a beautiful corner king with a Canal St view definitely would recommend this type of room for anyone traveling. Aside from the rooms view the location is fantastic. it is located on the boarder of the French Quarter and Business District. This hotel is great location especially if you are going to spend most of your time in the quarter as it is just far enough away that you do not have to deal with the noise and mess yet close enough you can walk to and from with ease. I also noticed that throughout our stay all staff I encountered had a smile and were rather helpful. Demi and Ricky in particular at the front desk were outstanding these two are valuable assets to the hotel.

The JW Mariot New Orleans is nice but it does not even begin to approach the atmosphere of other JW Mariot properties. It is a very small property. The lobby is tiny and cramped. I was there for most of a week and out of the 4 elevators only one was operating most of the time. With no exaggeration I waited for more than 5 minutes for an elevator going down on multiple occasions. Simply inexcusable. When I checked in they had me staying for only one night even though it was a prepaid reservation for 5 nights. When they got that straightened out they gave me a room key to an already occupied room. Nice. The concierge lounge is under construction so they have a temporary one set up in one of the ballrooms on the 3rd floor. In all candor I will not be back.

I particularly like the strawberries blue berries and black berries available every day for breakfast. The gym is well equipped and open 24 hours a day. However there was one equipment which seemed to be out of service and was not fixed during my stay. The only problem was that the bed metal frame stuck out beyond the mattress but was covered by the bedshets so it could not be seen.

Perfect NOLA party headquarters. A bunch of friends and I stayed here for two nights from 08 10JUN2018 and WE HAD A BLAST. We booked one of the two bedroom suites on the top floor of the hotel which is actually 30stories but you would not know from the pictures. and OMG it was a stunning suite. It was larger than I expected so if you are looking for a spacious party HQ close to Bourbon Street and all French Quarter festivities this is the spot. The room had fantastic views was very well furnished perfectly clean had cold A C good WiFi and especially nice toiletry amenities. I miss that shower in the master bathroom. We must give a special shout out to Daisy the concierge. She secured us perfect balcony reservations overlooking the Pride Parade route. That was so much fun. She really found us the perfect spot and even followed up with the restaurant to make sure they were opening up the balcony for us to watch the parade. All the rest of the staff there was also greatit is also worth noting that the gym was bigger and had more equipment than most hotel gyms. The pool was also nice. The executive lounge was on par but nothing to write home about. It was good enough for a light breakfast and good coffee. My only suggestion is that the suite really should have a much larger bar kitchen wet bar area. The refrigerator was comically tiny. So was the sink and lack of glasses. There was also nowhere to store drinks and snacks in the wet bar area. That could be greatly improved. Also it was a little disappointing only having access to the lounge breakfast in the morning. I was hoping for more as a loyal Mariot customer who was spending so much on the largest suite in the hotel.
