Very tardy with this review but still wanted to make sure that the proper comments were shared. Although this was a business trip last year we are definitely planning on returning to this property for a stay. The staff was amazing. Everyone went out of their way to make you feel welcome and special. This is an example of what customer service should be. We had a day of giving back and our whole group went out into the community and spent the day at a school doing an overhaul of classrooms exterior and interior work was done as well as the surrounding grounds. This was the first time we had coupled a business trip with an experience like this and the outcome was tremendousI share this because we later met resort staff that had children at that school. Knowing we made a difference to those that were making a difference to us IS the reason I am looking at this beautiful property againThank you for the stunning views wonderfully maintained grounds fabulous food and amazing staff.", "offset": [403, 612], "date": "2015-04-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "482e199a-63f6-47f0-b1f7-f66394a9968e", "sentence": "Resort living at its best. I did nt know what to expect as I had not been to Punta Mita before. I know the resort was over 16 years old. Well I was not disappointed. The grounds are magnificent with lush foliage and wonderful sculptures throughout. Everything was kept up beautifully and was clean and pristine. We stayed in a 3 bedroom villa that was beautiful and luxurious. We had our own plunge pool overlooking rolling hills and the ocean There was a full kitchen fully stocked a living room and dining room as well. All the comforts you can ask for. We were travelling with our kids and grandkids and there was a lot to offer for the little ones. There is an amazing kids club with wonderful staff who are very helpful and creative. There are great babysitters for the young ones under 5 yrs of age. The Lazy River ride is fun for all ages. There are 3 pools and a beach. The fitness center is quite large and the spa although not huge has very good technicians. I hear they will be renovating and expanding this area this summer. The food is very good at all 3 restaurants. Bahia is Latin Mediterranean Ketsi is Mexican and Aramara is Japanese. The food is much better than the newer nearby St Regis. And the staff is also better more gracious better English skills and not expecting tips as they do there. The service is outstanding everywhere. Everyone tries to call you by name and they aim to please. Carlos was one standout staff member who actually serves drinks in the pool. He swims out to wherever you are. Besides this he was great with our grandkids teaching them to make flower necklaces and playing with them. He was a rock star. Another great staff member was Juan Louis who serves free snacks all day long such as snow cones ice cream coconut juice and fresh fruit. He also is an eye glass doctor and comes around to clean your sunglasses and readers a few times a day. There are always cold towels to cool off under the hot sun. We are well travelled and quite spoiled and the Four Seasons Punta Mita not only met our expectations they surpassed them.", "offset": [969, 1036], "date": "2015-07-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "4964aa79-5a74-4499-85bf-999f05d7bb0b", "sentence": "Good service but tired resort. Four Seasons Punta Mita \u2013. the staff generally get an A for effort but occasional service lapses and a tired resort in need of renovation means this is not a five star resort anymore. it is the tropical equivalent of your grandmother \u2019s living room that will not be featured in Architectural Digest anytime soon. We stayed at the FSPM for 9 nights with our two young daughters. We ended up choosing FSPM largely for the Kids \u2019 Club more about that in a bit. We had stayed at the One Only Palmila last year which truly was a five star resort in every way except for the Kid \u2019s Club that was underwhelming. So this year we decided to try the FSPM. And in the end we did enjoy our stay most importantly our daughters had an amazing time at the Kids \u2019 Club. But I struggle to describe the FSPM as five star and we do not plan on returning given the other high end options available in Mexico. First the resort itself. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with an adjoining one bedroom room. The size of the rooms was fine but you will notice this is a resort built in the 80s and it desperately needs an update. While the grounds are lush and well manicured and quiet and peaceful. the room d\u00e9cor is what I had describe as \u201c utilitarian \u201d rather than stylish. The bathrooms are fine but dated and smallish compared to many other resort bathrooms. I can not help but recall the exquisite d\u00e9cor of our rooms and the One Only Palmila last year. The FSPM simply can not compete on that basis. The gym. After we dropped our girls off at the Kids \u2019 Club each morning we had head to the gym. it is a good sized gym with a good selection of weight lifting and cardiovascular equipment. One problem was the air conditioning in the side with all the cardiovascular equipment did not work very well. Most days the thermostat showed temps between 25 27C 7 80F despite the a c being set for 2C that is on the warm side for a long run. And the management seems to know it is an issue as they had two floor fans there but if you were not one of the lucky two you ran hot. It was also in the gym where we saw some of the small but constant lapses of service. There was not an attendant in the gym that often. In all the days we went and we had be there for at least 90 minutes each day. an attendant would pop their head in for short periods of time. that is fine. But what was lacking was when they appeared they did nothing other than generally stand around. Once or twice they had distribute cold towels but most days I just went behind the counter to grab them myself. We never saw them wipe down a machine pick up towels that had been left on the floor pick up empty water bottles cups or the half eaten apple sitting on the floor one morning 5 feet from the weight conscious staffer who was standing on the scale or the half full cup of something on my treadmill one morning. Most mornings my wife and I had to wipe down machines that were splattered in sweat I guess people on vacation see no compunction about leaving their sweat for others to enjoy. it is perhaps a small thing but the gyms I have been to at Rosewood Mayakoba Sugar Beach Viceroy Anguilla One Only Palmila I could go on had attentive and present gym staff that did the little things like diligently wipe down equipment when people finished and constantly distribute water service that is the hallmark of a five star resort. The service. The service was generally very good and what you had expect to find at a high end resort in Mexico. The pool staff were incredibly attentive and hard working. Oswaldo Aldo Eduardo Luis and others at the Tamai pool and Joel Alonso and others at the main pool were paragons of how to take care of guests and always with a smile. But it was also at Tamai where you had see the resort failing it is staff. there is over 50 chaise lounges around the main and very sunny Tamai pool but only 7 umbrellas. We were there in August so lying directly in the sun during a 92 degre80 humidity day really was not a pleasant experience. But if you were not one of the lucky 14 chaise lounges under the scarce 7 precious umbrellas you were out of luck. The staff were incredibly apologetic but their hands were tied by the lack of umbrellas. And as my wife wanted to swim laps something not really possible at the main pool we had to stick it out and roast when no umbrella was available. But why the paucity of umbrellas. Penny pinching perhaps. Or obliviousness by management but either way not exactly five star. But that is where we also saw the staff try to overcome the failings of the resort. One day while my wife was swimming laps and I was roasting without an umbrella a group who had been under an umbrella got up and started to leave. Without skipping a beat Ramiro the bartender quickly came out from behind the bar and went over to the group to check they were really leaving. He then waved at me to come over and he set us up under the umbrella. Now I had not spoken to Ramiro about our preferring to sit under an umbrella but he was observant enough to know and took care of us. that is five star service trying to address a three or four star pool. We also had another service snafu that suggested some training issues. My wife took my daughters to the bathrooms at Ketsi one morning. As she entered there was a maintenance man and another female staffer in the women \u2019s bathroom working on something. With two young daughters you had hope the male maintenance worker would step out for a few minutes but he remained firmly in place with the female staffer looking on as my wife navigated having both my daughters \u201c go potty \u201d. Another example of something that you had not expect at a five star resort. Also in terms of good service Housekeeping was very responsive. We asked on our first day if they could clean the rooms first thing in the morning and do an early turndown service so it would not interrupt our young daughters bath bedtime routine. While that sounds like an easy request it is surprising how many resorts can not manage that. But Housekeeping at FSPM did it consistently and we were grateful. The cuisine. it is not the One Only which is about the only resort I have experienced with seriously world class cuisine. The food at FSPM was hit and miss. Bahia was consistently good and I had recommend it as your first stop here for dining. We did breakfast at Ketsi which offered a good buffet. The lunch polside was hit and miss. Tamai has a limited menu compared to the main pool. The Tuna Ceviche and Thai Steak Salad were good. The Vegi Wrap was not. At the main pool the pork tacos and the cochinta pibil tacos and carnitas at Ketsi were extraordinarily good. The grilled fish tacos were bland and the shrimp tacos bland and much too runny seriously over sauced. Aramara was a disappointment. The sushi rolls were fairly pedestrian and the sushi rice most nights was overcooked. After two tries at Aramara we ate all our dinners at Bahia where Eduardo took great care of us and again underscored the dedication of the staff. But it was also at Aramara we had one of those service lapses you had not expect at a five star resort. We were conscious of getting back to our room by 9 pm that night so that the baby sitter could catch the staff bus at 915 back to Pto. Valarta they only run every two hours. We had ordered desert but it had not appeared. We asked the waiter if we could simply take it back to our room with us. He kindly suggested that he could send it via room service but we would have to wait 10 minutes he had already put the order in to the kitchen 10 minutes before. We thought that was a very elegant solution. If only it had worked that way. About 20 minutes after we had been back in our room and this would have been 30 minutes after we had ordered dessert in the first place. we decide to call room service to see what was happening. In the middle of that call Aramara calls our room to say we could get our dessert in another 30 minutes. And the remarkable thing was the woman who called thought it was the most natural thing in the world to wait another 30 minutes. She was utterly oblivious that I had simply suggested to take the desserts back to the room about 25 minutes earlier. We told her to cancel the order as if we waited another 30 minutes which would be an hour after our waiter put in the original order we would likely get multi colored puddles of what had once been sorbet and a room temperature brick that previously masqueraded as a warm molten chocolate cake. I am dubious as I type this that they will have a flash of efficiency and manage to remove the desert charges from our bill. But I should note that the next day a mystery plate of chocolates and cookies arrived at our room in the afternoon. We have no idea why but perhaps the previous night \u2019s dessert snafu had been noted and this was a culinary apology. If so I will credit the management for doing that but with no explanation or note I can only speculate. The golf carts. Generally most places you need to go at FSPM are walkable. But with two under 5 year old daughters we had to rely on our share of them to get around. And if you need them expect to wait. Five to ten minutes was typical. One time it was 20 minutes and in the heat that was wilting our daughters. They simply do not have enough carts something more than a few of the drivers confirmed to us and heres another example of apparent management decisions to have fewer golf carts hampering the staff \u2019s desire to proffer great service. The Kids \u2019 Club. That was an unadulterated success with a snafu at the start. We had confirmed three times pre arrival with the resort that they had arranged for a full time baby sitter nanny for our two daughters who were both under the age of five and hence could not be left unattended at the Club. Every time we were assured that all was arranged. When we called upon arrival about when we could meet the baby sitter the people at the Kids \u2019 Club had no idea what we were talking about. That said they quickly arranged for Antonia. If anybody is coming to the FSPM and needs a baby sitter ask for Antonia. do not stop at Go. do not collect 200. Just ask for Antonia. She was amazing and our girls could not wait to ditch mom and dad each morning and head to the Club. it is also a great reflection on the program at the Kids \u2019s Club that was thoughtful and well executed. The arts and crafts were a particular strong point of the Club and our girls were proudly showing mom and dad their projects at the end of every day. If there is one reason to come to the FSPM it is the Kids \u2019 Club. it is a five star stand out. In the end how do I sum up the FSPM. Sorry to say it is not in the same league as the One Only Palmila for those considering the two. We \u2019l be going back to the OOP next year. On the plus side the staff at the FSPM get gold stars for being friendly and attentive. They were five star. The resort holds them back. It needs a refresh as it is a Grand Dame who is past her prime and living off of past accolades and I sympathize with management as I am sure they know this but it is ultimately not their decision but that of the owners funnily enough which appears to be Bill Gates family office after a few minutes spent on Google. We did enjoy ourselves at the Four Seasons in the end but with so many other truly five star offerings out there we will not be coming back.", "offset": [10986, 11302], "date": "2015-08-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "58f8600b-83a8-4183-8ff5-bdff5e0e9786", "sentence": "Great Great Property.

My husband surprised me with a long weekend to Mexico a country I had not been to in 30 years. His choice of the Four Seasons could not have been better.

Upon our arrival Pablo the valet greeted up with a delicious welcome drink which could be had with or without tequila. we chose with. The check in was seamless with Priscila welcoming us as if we were a guest in her home. We had an ocean front suite with a very private patio plunge pool. We have stayed in other Four Seasons resorts I have to say this met all our expectations. Our service out by the pool was excellent with Josue going beyond to check in with us to make sure we were taken care of. We did have an issue with our TV the first night that was handled quickly. The AC worked well the bed was comfy. They were undergoing a spa renovation during our stay so the check in for my massage was in a regular room that they were temporarily using but it in no way diminished the excellent service I received from Christian out in the cabana on the sand.

This was my first stay at a Four Seasons resort. We were a large group who stayed in a penthouse residence unit last week. I had high expectations going in based on the glowing TA reviews of this property. Overall we enjoyed our stay here but this was not the best hotel experience rooms property service food etc that I have had. Our transport van from the airport was not air conditioned so our 50 minute ride to the hotel was pretty uncomfortable. We did not receive the warm welcome at the front door as other reviewers mention below. Once we sat in the open air lobby area hot hot and humid with no relief we received cold towels and drinks. Our room was to be ready at 4 pm so we had a light lunch in the outdoor restaurant. We were told that our keys would be brought to us at 4 pm and that our bags would be delivered to our room. They keys did not arrive so after a phone call and personal visit to the reception staff we were finally able to go to our room around 445pm. Our 4 bedroom residence was nice and clean. We had ordered the grocery delivery service online 2 days before our arrival in Punta Mita and there was some sort of mix up and our groceries were delivered to another room. We received our order on day 2 of our visit. The staff was nice and the manager Andrea went out of her way to please our large group after a somewhat chaotic first few days at the property room keys were not working wifi was not working groceries not delivered etc. There are only 2 restaurants on the property serving dinner so this was not ideal for a 6 night stay with a group wanting to stay on property. We did venture out to Sufi one evening and the Italian restaurant in Punta Mita for dinners ofsite and they were good. The food at the Four Seasons was good and the prices commensurate with that of the room prices 6 cappuccino at lobby coffee bar. Service on the beach and by the pool was top notch just as other reviewers noted below always provided with cold water bottles cold towels drink and food service free drinks and fruit treats throughout the day. We had lunch most days at the Whale of the Tail golf club and these were our favorite meals Felipe is amazing. It was extremely hot and humid during our stay and we are from Houston which is a very similar climate and fortunately the cooling system in our residence definitely kept up us cool. All of the restaurants are outdoors so the only relief from the heat was in our rooms jelly fish warnings on beach so asked to stay out of ocean. We took golf carts to dinner most nights due to the heat and the large expanse of the property and we never had an issue with having a cart pick us up upon request. We used the fitness center on a regular basis and aside from issues with the wifi the fitness center provided all that we needed and the staff on hand were quite helpful provided cold towels while running on treadmill etc. The spa was under renovation so we did not use the services although they did have a makeshift spa set up in a guest room area. The spa shop was very nice as were the resort shops near the lobby. We participated in the hotels tequila tasting and that was an enjoyable experience. Perhaps our biggest issue overall was the billing. With 4 different couples staying in 1 residence unit we each provided our own credit card for incidentals and were told to provide our last name on all receipts. We ended up having to review our account folios in detail the last few days to work out the charges. The hotel staff was helpful in correcting each folio but this system should be much more seamless in this day and age and at an upscale resort such as the Four Seasons.", "offset": [2947, 3074], "date": "2016-07-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "0d2b5fbb-c45c-43b7-8547-e75c42cd712d", "sentence": "Four Seasons hands down over St Regis. AWESOME. Four Seasons hands down over St Regis. Fabulous time. We were in limbo which property since we knew St Regis was a newer property. After reading many reviews we remained loyal to Four Seasons and so so glad we did. I IT is absolutely fabulous. The grounds amenities the food AND THE SERVICE are EXCELLENT. Truly the best. Outstanding service and the most friendly service of any property we have ever been. They are in process of updating their new spa is about to open which will be fab. The restaurants were superb. We went off property 2x and then decided no point when 4 Seasons has the BEST. I can not say enough. We had 2 teenage boys and 1 adult daughter with us. They loved it and prefer it over Four Seasons Costa Ricoit is also a great property. The rooms might be nicer bec. newer however Four Seasons Punta Mita is the BEST. We met a couple who were there without their kids and they were also glad they had chosen Four Seasons over St Regis. We stayed away all these years from Puerto Valarta thinking it was unsafe totally wrong. it is completely safe and Punta Mita is so incredibly safe. u feel safer there then u do at home. The property sits on 2 beaches and they are beautiful. What was great is that sometimes water was completely smooth and other times there were waves where u could boogie board and surf. Which is very nice to have both to be able to do different things in the water. I know it depends on weather however we had best of both over our week stay. The chef prepared our fish we caught and it was excellent. My daughter I snorkeled and the boys scuba. It was one of the best scuba trips with the clear water. they especially loved going thru the caves. The resort is spread out so you do not feel it is even full or that u r on top of each other which is the feeling we got when we went over to check out St Regis. One of the most beautiful amenities you get at FS is the 180 degree view of the sunset each evening. TRULY the most beautiful sunsets that last 30 minutes our highlight each night. We looked forward each night to having a margarita sunset. The F S was the 1st to build in Punta Mita so you know they chose the best spot with the best beach on where to build. The golf course is beautiful. I am not a golfer the rest of my family golfs. and this was a treat to ride with them on the golf cart. Beautiful. Spectacular. If you are not a beach person it is worth it to go there just for golf. U felt like you were in Hawaii. One of the most beautiful courses. Also the airport was unreal how quickly to check in upon our return. I was dreading it and it was the easiest ckin that we have done in an intl country maybe it was july. IDK but it was quick and easy. I am very sad that we had avoided Puerto Valarta Punta Mita all these years bec of safety. I know at one time it might have been unsafe but today it is. We have been very blessed to travel to many spectacular places and this is now one resort that my family has on the top. Kudos to Bill Gates in now owning the property. I have no connections to four seasons other than being a loyal customer. However i do want to put this one plug in. we met two lovely ladies on the plane to Punta Mita and 1 works for the Four Seasons Marrakech. My husband and I went to Marrakech 2yrs ago before there was a F Ss and its an incredible place to visit too. We are now tempted to return just to stay at F Ss. Four Seasons Punta Mita is truly wonderful. I hope trust that you will have the same experience. not wanting to leave and can not wait to return. it is the top of any beach resort. This is my 1st time to write a review I feel that Four Seasons Punta Mita deserved a write up.", "offset": [455, 536], "date": "2016-08-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "44bfc088-59ee-466f-bbc3-cbf201c25f8c", "sentence": "A year later. and it is still paradise beyond description. I went back \u201c home \u201d to FS Punta Mita and it was still as I had remembered it perfection. Stayed in the same Oceanfront room which for me is the best room on the property. You get an unobstructed view of the Pacific and a hammock to do it in. I took a photo of the sunset while swinging in the hammock one evening pic attached before dinner. Not sure I have seen anything like that before. I mentioned this in my prior review if you leave the doors open but keep the mesh doors shut you \u2019l fall asleep at night in bed with the sound of the waves gently caressing the sandy beach the only lullaby I needed during my entire stay. Note. a friend of mine stayed in the Ocean view room. also gorgeous view of the ocean and palm tress from the balcony. I kept annoying him by saying \u201c No hammock though\u201d \u2026 \u2026 I should mention that my friend was celebrating his birthday and upon arrival there was a bottle of Champagne and a birthday cake waiting in his room from John the GM. Those little things just make you feel very special indeed well he did. We tried all the restaurants and enjoyed every single meal. Aramara is a bit more \u201c dressy than Bahia but this is a beach resort you wo n\u2019t be out of place even if you turn up with a nice pair of shorts a shirt and flip flops for dinner. It \u2019s all very relaxed. All of my comments from the previous visit still apply yes my toothpaste was running low again and yes they left a fresh new one next to it without having to ask for it. Attention to detail at its highest level. A few points I wanted to ad the spa is currently being renovated so they \u2019ve used a different block to provide treatments. Do n\u2019t be dissuaded by this the service and treatment are still top notch. Even at this temporary location they managed to install a small sauna in the men \u2019s locker room for your use before after your treatment. I had the 80 min customised massage and my therapist Christian knew exactly what to do. I also had the pleasure of having a foot massage at the adult only pool by Christian a really nice and friendly guy. I definitely would recommend him. I may be wrong but I think the newly renovated spa should be ready in a month \u2019s time or so. Ca n\u2019t wait to use it for my next visit the gym which is in the same building as the renovated spa is open with full service but you do n\u2019t hear any construction work whatsoever in fact you do n\u2019t hear any construction work from anywhere in the property and I did walk all over the property throughout my stay. An example of the \u201c little \u201d things that they do really well is that someone at the gym will walk around and hand you cold refreshing towels and bottle water while you \u2019re working out. If only my gym at home provides this service we tried all the 3 pools. the Adult pool is probably the most relaxing one for me. The staff walk around periodically offering cold towels \u2026 and Evian mist sprayed on your face how spoiled is that \u2026. they even offer to clean your shades. Then there are goodies that suddenly appear in front of you eg hibiscus gin and tonic various different types of munchies etc. We spent time at the Lazy River pool too but purposely chose to hit it at 7 pm when most people are back in the rooms or having dinner. It was relaxing and so much fun with a cocktail beer in one hand while gently floating on the river. When you \u2019ve almost done a full lap the staff will come around and ask if you want another drink and ready for you as you start a new lap. I love the main infinity pool too but it tends to get a bit busy during the day. So we used it at night. you wo n\u2019t get the full service as you would during the day but I \u2019m fine with that. It \u2019s really lovely to float around quietly played tennis at the local tennis centre which is about 5 mins away. they provide the shuttle service tennis rackets balls cold bottle water and of course cold refreshing towels. All very convenient. One note though the tennis centre shuts at 7 pm. so if you want to play at night and you can just make sure you tell the Concierge during the day. They \u2019l make the necessary arrangements including floodlights are turned on one newish thing that FS has created is the FS Ap. I was obsessed with this Ap when in Punta Mita. It \u2019s so easy to communicate with the staff at the property without having to speak to anyone 21st Century problems. I was on the beach enjoying the sun and would drop a message to the House Keeping team via the Ap. It was so easy. The same with restaurant bookings and concierge service etc. Try it I did yoga one morning on the \u201c Rock \u201d a really great way to start the day. Thoroughly enjoyed the class. I did say that I would try and visit Sayulita small village near PM. but I really could not extract myself away from the property. Everything was done to perfection. the idea of picking up my wallet and venturing out to the real world was just too much of a hassle. Whenever I spent time talking to the staff they were all so positive about the FS brand and FS Punta Mita in particular. Marco Zefiro the Front House Manager is also very professional and helpful. Would I recommend this property with no hesitation. I only wish I could visit them more often than once a year. Thank you John and to your 950 warriors.

The Four Seasons Punta Mita has once again demonstrated that its quest for perfection is not only unending but uncompromising. This is our first return since the new Apuane Spa salon and workout amenities reopened and the new Tamai adult pool was renovated. The Spa is a remarkably designed celebrating local materials sourcing onyx tile work woods and craftsmanship. Expanded steam and dry sauna areas three luxurious plunging pools including whirlpool. You could just spend the afternoon there if you can peel yourself away from the white sand beachesThe Tamai pool area renovation is also top shelf. Hand hewn stick roofs shelter glorious new daybeds. The restaurant has been greatly expanded and there is a new huge palapa for quiet reflection and events. Turn a corner and there is an artist alcove with an easel and watercolors waiting for your inspiration. And be still my heart the afternoon treats include tequila ice pops and a chai tea frappe with Baileys. What. We have been coming to this Four Seasons paradise for six years.

I have enjoyed many visits to the Four Seasons Punta Mita. Spring Summer Fall and Winter each season with its own weather and resort vibe. What remains consistent and astonishes me each time is the warm hospitality outstanding service and beautiful culture that are all demonstrated and celebrated by the team at every turn. On this particular visit the resort was full of families on Spring Break. Having no kids we realized quickly that we had perhaps made a planning error. After so many years of traveling to Punta Mita how did this happen. It was not long before we realized that no matter how high and crazy the kid quotient the Four Seasons always finds a way to provide an amazing holiday. We took refuge at Tamai the adult pool which has recently undergone a complete renovation. It was incredible. The pool team was the most hospitable and attentive we have ever encountered and we have experienced more than our fair share of pools at Four Seasons resorts and Amans. From freshly made margaritas to foot rubs the service energy was kind timed well and very thoughtful and the guy who cleaned our sunglasses iphones and ipads was awesome too. The perfect example of Punta Mita perfection. We also loved the newly renovated spa and fitness center aesthetically beautiful and well designed. When you combine an Irish poet GM with an incredible Punta Mita staff of genuine souls Mexican magic is bound to occur. Punta Mita never disappoints.

Bahia is a great restaurant food is delicious Aramara needs some renovations new uniforms and better food so disappointed service is great. People were dressed like they were at the pool and Aramara supported to be the main best restaurant at the resort.

I am not sure how anyone could give this resort anything less than 5 stars. It was the first time I have been on a trip that I did not want it to end usually after 4 days I am ready to go home. My husband and I have travelled to many places all around the world but this was a great trip. We arranged car service from the airport to the hotel through the Four Seasons our driver Javier was great. He was able to explain everything to us that we asked about. I \u2019m very thankful for the comment about poisonous snakes we did not do any hiking this time as we were not prepared for that. The location has several guard gates to go through before getting to the lobby. Even when walking to town from the resort there is a guard gate to make sure you are a guest of the resorts. We were given a tour of the property after checking in thanks Alejandro and taken to our room. We immediately changed and got into the pool even though it was already 6 pm at this point. Travelling from the west coast was great as we did n\u2019t eat dinner most nights until 9 pm and it gave us the entire day to do what we wanted which was mostly be in the pool. Dinner was great at both Aramara and Bahia the 3rd restaurant was closed for renovations and Aramara had live music the 2 nights we were there. It was a fantastic Cuban band. The Asian Mexican fusion was really interesting and the Red Snapper was the best fish I have ever had. The next morning we decided to do the Aquaforze class. Even though I was really hungover the class was great. Guilermo and Alejandro were terrific instructors 2 different days and made the difficult class fun. It was definitely tough to balance in the pool while doing different exercises and I was a little sore the next day which surprised me. The breakfast buffet at Ketsi was delicious. I stuck with the \u201c Mexican \u201d dishes and the pastries all were outstanding and the coffee was nice and hot. We also decided to walk into the town of Punta Mita from the resort. FYI when you get to the traffic circle you kinda go straight. which is a little to the right not left and you should pass the sales office on the right then the urgent care clinic on the left side of the street. That means you are going the correct direction. The town seems rather small but if you go Blue Shrimp a Four Seasons spot on recommendation is the place to eat. They had some outstanding ceviche and octopus the red snapper and yellowtail here was fantastic but the portions are huge. This was a real bummer as we did not have anywhere to store leftovers. Back at the resort more people started to show up on Monday but it was still not that crowded. You are not more than a few feet away from a drink or a server. The grounds are lovely staff is friendly and the views are amazing. We met some great guests Hi Sid and Aiden from San Francisco and had a wonderful chat with them as we did with most of the guests we spoke to. It was truly the most relaxed I have ever been on vacation and my family is from Hawaii. Even the airport was a breeze. We walked into the airport got our ticket and walked right through security. I ca n\u2019t imagine in the busy season you could do thatThe only negative to this trip was the humidity. However we were the ones that decided to go in early September but even that was n\u2019t enough to dampen the trip. Though with the humidity came some amazing lightning shows \u2026 which were thankfully far enough away to not pose any danger to us. Even though our weather aps called for thunderstorms each day it only rained one time and that was overnight. All in all a fantastic trip that I \u2019m sure we will never be able to duplicate but we will certainly keep trying.", "offset": [1181, 1324], "date": "2017-10-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "df3d9527-9790-4d82-91e3-f78b832456c2", "sentence": "Spent 3 nights at this fantastic full service hotel.

We stayed for 12 days with our 10 year old boys and I ca n\u2019t say enough wonderful things about the resort and the staff. The property and views are stunning. We had an ocean front suite with a plunge pool which we were able to book due to the discounted June prices and the staff set up two very comfortable roll away beds in the living area facing the ocean for our boys. The staff here made the experience over the top and are so professional warm and helpful at every level. From the concierge desk who helped us weeks before our arrival and throughout our stay those at the airport who warmly greeted us and drove us to the hotel the front desk who welcomed us in the stunning lobby with drinks and checked us in the man who brought us to our room and gave us a lovely tour of the resort when we arrived the attentive and friendly room service pool beach and restaurant staff with whom we interacted daily housekeeping who were the best I \u2019ve ever experienced and the man who refreshed our fruit every day \u2014 impeccable service. Every where you go the staff asks if you need assistance. I \u2019ve stayed at hotels where a private butler is assigned and I highly prefer the Punta Mita service model where everyone is there for you. We ordered room service breakfast every day as well as a couple of lunches and dinners and it was fabulous \u2014 delivered quickly and was an incredible value. We normally never order room service that often but that \u2019s how good it wasWe loved the sunset \u201c announcement \u201d every night daily churos cart continuous treats at the beach pool and lazy river. There was also a taco cart set up at the Nuna pool at lunch daily which we did n\u2019t try but what a great option for a quick lunch and hungry kids. The shack on the beach is lovely with great service and a fire at night. Given our long stay my husband and I appreciated the numerous and varied drink options and my kids loved the mocktails available for them. We also were able to order off a sushi menu at the Nuna pool \u2014 it may have been the menu for the adult pool area which is lovely but we were with our kids and the views from Nuna are spectacular. We appreciated and used the complimentary life vests kayaks and snorkeling gear and rented the yacht for half a day which was wonderful and special. There was a complimentary washer and dryer down the hall from our room which I used and I now know I can pack half as many clothes for our kids on our next visitThere was construction going on when we were there but the noise was minimal and it is tastefully screened off. We will be back and this is now our go to beach vacation destination. As a comparison we went to Hualalai two years ago I had also been there previously without my family and loved it but we loved Punta Mita so much more.

AMAZING. AMAZING. We returned to the Four Season Punta Mita after a few years hiatus. When they greeted me with Welcome Home it really felt like it. From the moment we passed the main gate during my arrival until the day we left we felt like we were at home and we were well taken cared of. This time around we did not do as much resort activities as we would have liked to. One of the reasons is that the Water Activity Center did not have as much activities. That said there were other activities to do nature walk beach walk tequila tasting etc. The beach areas now have bed cabanas which made it really relaxing. I loved this adtion. The spa has been renovated since we were last there and we LOVE it. We arrived in the morning and since our room was not ready we went to the spa. We enjoyed the facility immensely. There are now more relaxing beds and also in quiet areas. We used the spa facility every day. The Four Seasons uses the local Gourmet Market so if you want to order grocery they will deliver your grocery for free. We made a few orders for the week for fresh fruit and bread baguettes. Of course items a slighly higher than US grocery stores but watch out of slcied deli meat. That is really expensivce like 25 lb. But in generally we like this service because it is convenient and they just come in and stock your fridge. We stayed in a 3bedrom residence bottom floor still able to see the ocean but the noise and craziness stuff going on from the 2nd floor drvoe us a bit crazy. Frankly famileis with children or children that are rowdy should be on lower floors. So in our next return we will reserve the penthouse unit. No one will be above us. Service well service is always exceptional. I had worn a new pair of shoes and had some blisters. When I was on the beach I asked for a bandaid and they sent a beach doctor with bandaids and to check up on me to make sure I did not need further medical help.

Having travelled quite extensively I had always heard about the Four Seasons and its stalwart reputation as a leader in luxury accommodation. What I came to learn during my visit was that for the FOUR SEASONS PUNTA MITA luxury is not defined by crisp Egyptian cotton sheets and spa services that border on being over the top. The true luxury of this very special place is the natural comfort they provide even when you are 30 miles away from home. The resort is divided into 3 areas. There are the resort grounds which from first appearance seem too expansive and make you wonder how long the walk from your room to the beach is going to be. The restaurants and shops nice places to spend ten times too much on tacos and rattan \u201c Four Season emblazoned \u201d beach bags. And of course the rooms which depending on the tier you choose either come in small enclosed villas with private courtyards or more typical apartment like complexes. Whichever room you choose I was delighted to find that every room is no more than 10 steps away from a water source whether it be a pool or a lazy river or the beach itself. I was impressed by housekeeping which was probably about the best I had ever encountered and relieved by the fact that every complex has an ice machine at your disposal and get this \u2026 a washer and dryer so that no one has to pack sweaty gym clothes or wet swim suits when they return home. The beaches are absolutely flawless. Please note that I said \u201c beaches \u201d as the resort resides on 3 beautiful beaches each one with an its own inherent personality. I spent most of my time on Manzanilla Beach which was for the most part luxuriously deserted aside from the attentive beach crew who always made sure that my complimentary cooler was always refreshed with ice and water bottles. One of the more clever moves by the FSPUNTAMITA is that guests may claim their beach cabana on their first day and it will be reserved for them for the duration of their trip. No need to wake early to claim your territory and fight off other tourists for your precious seat. As an added bonus every 20 minutes or so a smiling crew member would come around with a complimentary entremet or refreshing iced beverage just to keep things interesting. Equally as impressive is the FS ap that you can install on your phone. With the ap in hand I was able to easily request golf carts for quick transportation or dinner reservations or if I needed to get a hold of my personal butler all I had to do was tap. Aside from all the physical luxuries the resort provides I realized after a few days that every guy down by the beach knew my drink by heart even the added extra ginger. And that every morning when I had breakfast at the breathtakingly beautiful Aramara restaurant the hostess made sure my exact table was always reserved with the fan on exactly as I asked the first day and my coffee prepared exactly as I asked on my first morning black and extra hot. It did n\u2019t matter if the servers changed or if the time of day was different every one at FSPUNTAMITA knew how I liked things exactly. It was as if there was some sort of secret system that recorded all my likes and dislikes. It was that attention to detail that truly put the FOUR SEASONS in a league of their own. The FS Punta Mita is the closest thing to a Safe bet that I \u2019ve seen in years. From airport pick up to last day check out everything was easy efficient and comfortable.
