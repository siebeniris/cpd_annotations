We arrived at the hotel looking pretty scruffy and without a reservation but the receptionist could not have been nicer or more welcoming. When she established that there were rooms available she started the check in process and then suddenly said ooh I can give you a free upgrade to a superior room with a balcony and sea view. Of course we leapt at the chance. The SPA is fantastic really spacious and clean with a lovely indoor pool steam room sauna ice bucket shower plunge pool and relax room. For dinner we opted for the running buffet which cost 28 Euros per person and was worth every penny. Enormous choice of dishes for every palate roast chicken sirloin steak fish burrito station salads sweets fruit and cheese. Indoor and outdoor dining with a lovely view over the bay. All the staff spoke very good English and were smartly dressed and very warm and genuine. We slept very well and the breakfast buffet was just as good as the evening one with a chef on hand to make omelettes etc to your taste.

We spent one week at the Radison Blu the main part of the hotel is very modern but there is another part that is old. We stayed in a Senior Suite 2 adults and 2 children. we have ordered an extra bed in advance but when we arrived there was no bed there and they apologized as they did not find a bed for us. I was a little upset and we had to improvise a bed for my 5 year old it was late and we just wanted to rest. A little after midnight someone came with a bed and woke us up but al least we had the bed for next day. The furniture in the living room looked once nice but now it does not any more. The size of the room was nice the balcony with two chairs a table and a sun bed was used every day and the ocean view was beautifulOur kids had long baths in the nice bath tube. Something that we did not like about our room is that there is no door between the living area and the bedroom. We wanted to have some time after the kids went to sleep to play and have some wine but it was not possible because we could wake them upOn the other hand we heard people complaining about the size of the rooms and my parents in law booked a double room they were in the old part of the hotel. The room was tiny indeed but the bed was comfortable. They had for 3 days no kettle or coffee service until I went to the front desk and asked. I think that this kind of services have to be a standard no matter which room you book. The outdoor swimming pool was nice and big. NO loud music to be heared and we loved that. The indoor swimming pool was really nice also. The hotel is separated from the beach through two roads and a garden if you are in a big beach resort you walk exactly as much to get to the beach but we did not like it that the beach kind of is not in the same ground. In the entrance from the beach club we saw the prices for the sun beds we do not actually know if alThe hotel guest have to pay extra for them or it was just for other guests. We did not like the area and we did not stay as the polArea was much more inviting. By the way if you want to go to the city center take a taxi just from outside the hotel and in around 7 minutes you are there it costs around 50 Kuna one way and you avoid all the traffic. For people traveling with kids there are some restaurants along the second road which have trampolines and play areas we went for a fresh orange juice and let the kids play we really liked and the kids loved it. I forgot the name of it but if you are facing the beach club from the hotel go to the left and follow the road is the second restaurant to your rightThe food was very good at the Radison. the breakfast a bit boring with no change for all the week the waiters were very attentive this can I say from almost ALL the staff in the hotelWe had lunch every day in our suite and the food was very good we ordered pizzas wich were not on the menu but they were made in the pool restaurant and they made them for us as well. We loved having a nespreso coffee machine in the room. Exactly like at home. With a better view of the beach. The caper restaurant was very good. My parents in law had the fish for two and they were able to try out different kinds of fish. The clams the pasta avocado carpacio the sea bass and the shrimps. All was very nice. You have to try it out. The food at the pool restaurant was very good also they have pizzas burgers fish and sea food skewers salads and we liked everything. The waiters are busy but they are kind. The day of our departure we asked for a late check out the people from the dront desk told us that they will let us know if it was possible so we stayed in the romwaiting for a call then my husband called and they told him that they were fully booked so there was no chance for us to stay we have a two year old and we wanted to have a bes dor him to sleep as our flight was leaving until 9 PM. I am not sure if they really made the effort to try to give us a room but they told us that we can use the facikities as long as we want so we went to the indoor pool and made a bed for our boy he slept we went to swim to eat and then had a shower in the spa they have really nice shower facilities there. We had a great week and if you are traveling with kids and want to have a nice place to sleep with a swimming pool go to the Radison Blu.", "offset": [2278, 2489], "date": "2015-08-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "3ae1b589-8e92-4b69-9219-27c615ba36f4", "sentence": "Gorgeous location Lovely attentive staff Clean Modern room Great spa fitness area Terrific meals.", "offset": [0, 97], "date": "2015-08-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "9c7cd5da-b236-4c43-89e1-71c031ef72df", "sentence": "overpriced.

Thoroughly researched resorts before booking on here and the hotel website. Decided to book the Radison Blu and upgraded to the Deluxe Sea View Room with a balcony. I did not particularly care about the balcony but the deluxe rooms have supposedly been renovated and that was important to me. I am not sure what is considered renovated but I do not think this is it. That was just the start of what has turned out to be not a great stay here. When you consider the price probably one of the worst values and hotels we have stayed at on a vacation. First the good the employees have almost all been exceptionally nice and tried to do whatever has been requested. The bad this room is dated and rundown particularly the bathroom. There is one elevator for this side of the hotel and it is slow. Like really slow. it is only 7 floors but you can easily wait several minutes if it even stops at all. Tonight trying to come up from the restaurant floor 1 it just kept passing us. The gym is not nearly as nice or big as the pictures show. There are a few weight stack machines a couple treadmills and elipticals dumbbells up to about 30 lbs and a TRX setup. The AC takes forever to cool the room down maybe 1 degree Celsius in 24 hours running constantly thankfully it is not that warm here yet good luck in the summer. The included breakfast buffet is not bad but we just had the dinner buffet in there and it was one of the poorest dining experiences we have ever had and it is expensive at 28 person and that includes no beverages. Do yourself a favor and eat in Caper or off property. The hotel website makes it seem as if this is close to the historical landmarks you are probably here to see it is not. it is a pretty lengthy walk so plan on taking a cab or the bus. Lastly the Internet is slow and unreliable. Both hotels we stayed at previously we were able to stream video with no problems but that is not the case here. I definitely can not recommend staying here.", "offset": [990, 1048], "date": "2016-05-21", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "47edd1a1-fac3-4270-ab36-ff9c2793dfd5", "sentence": "Great hotel but misses some key details.

Good variety for breakfast and sea facing seating for breakfast outdoors is a plus. Great spa for massages. I highly recommend Mariana for deep tissue Swedish. Spa entry and treatment area is great. The Sauna itself is very clean good and clean. Indoor pool area is spacious and has glass all around overlooking the sea. The not so good. The shower area outside the Sauna is 3 star at best. The tiles are worn out and it simply does not look clean. No soap in these showers. There are two dipping pools in front of the Sauna. they just do not look clean at all by mid afternoon. The steam room was 3 star at best. Looked dirty and cold puddle of water at your feet. Did not like that part at all. Another surprising weakness was how poorly the beds were made after room service. Really did not look like the beds were fully made up. Linen was wrinkled and comforter kind of bundled up. We had put both bathrobes on the floor to Be changed after websites them at the spa and the pool. They were not replaced. Neither were the shampoo and conditioner bottles.

First things first hotel grounds are one big construction site. The new hotel building is being erected end main terrace is also being overhauled there is work force on site making loud noises with grinders and other power tools in action you get the picture right. However this is not the problem with this hotel. So front to back here is my honest impression. The reception desk is terrible it is an airport check in desk like structure with no place put your stuff on motorcycle helmet in my case and although the staff behind the structure is forthcoming and kind this is the first negative mark. The room was ready an hour ahead of the regular check in so that was very nice. Before actually giving me the key I was in for a surprise. I was asked to provide a credit card as collateral although in our reservation email there was no mentioning of this \u2013 due to the book now pay when you leave arrangement and before you say it is common practice I am just going to say that I do n\u2019t like surprise and new conditions of something that I am anyway going to pay. Have you card ready if you decide to visit RD Blu after this review. The room on the sixth floor was labeled Deluxe \u2013 but really there is nothing de or luxe about it. The washed out light blue color was more hospital like then the light blue that Adriatic has to offer. The atmosphere was not helped by well paper of see life in extra low resolution that look like they come out from some sort of low end arcade video game from the 190 \u2019s. Now to the business end of the room. The toiled has a leaking roof with tiles ready to drop. Also upon entry I found a long hair in the middle of the toilet which made me suspicions of the entire clasines of the accommodation. Bed was way too soft spent. so no relaxed sleeping from me or my wife. Air conditioning was not responding to commands \u2013 go figure. Luckily you can open the balcony door to enjoy wobbly floor boards andor sound of your favorite power tool. The room is cheap both in design an quality the sense is just intensified by a TV that music wise has just a creation fold channel \u2013 no joy there either. Well off complementary dinner. The restaurant Caper was very nice the staff was very sleek ambient was relaxing and seating was swiftly taken care off for four of us. The menu was a bit narrow with just two appetizers and two main courses to choose from \u2013 fish and chicken without vegetarian option but all meals were very good in taste and presentation. Morning broke and we were at the Spa. The facilities are good swimming pool is 20 meters long and 4 m wide. Its clean and war but the sun beds around it are not. Probably because they are old as the hotel \u2013 which is just over 6 years. Sauna and steam bath are very god working properly as the thermal and massage pools. Wellness center also has a small but sweet gym with coupe of treadmills bicycles cattle bells TRX mats benches dumbbells and few shoulder and leg machines. Nice. Back to the room with an elevator that has now been vacuumed since new year I presume nor was it in the next three day of stay. Back down again to breakfast that is very nice indeed. From banana smoothies. Fresh fruits pooched or scrambled eggs selection of ches Mediterranean spices olives and freshly baked bread you want be left wanting for some more. \u201c Pi\u00e8ces de r\u00e9sistance \u201d of the breakfast was a big thermos bottle of delightfully tasting coffee or in my book the real black gold. The pathway to beach was not cleared from grass and fallen branches and with old unused structures around it was like a movie scene and the movie was about a abounded place. The tourism workers are always complaining that the summer season is too shot but when you visit them Labor day weekend nothing is ready. Interesting. Hotel had a very good garage space just across the main entrance the bike was safe and in under a roof. If you like local cousin best recommendation is to go West from the hotel as the hotel beach restaurant is not operations still on the beach promenade for about 10 minutes of slow walk and come into Zenta bay. Find Barkarola restaurant and enjoy top end local cuisine with more than appropriate prices. Top tip. So this is it a promise undelivered by Radison Blu Split. I had high hopes but I do n\u2019t think I will be going there anytime soon again you know how first impression are often spot on and all important. This was will be tough to reverse into a positive one. Recommendation.

We were a little concerned about our stay at the Radison Blu due to previous comments about the construction but we had no issues whatsoever. We were looking for a hotel that had a nice pool area and overlooked the sea and the Radison Blu did more than deliver. The room and bathroom were very comfortable and we upgraded to a sea view room. The room was modern had a huge bathroom and was extremely comfortable. The resort is not in the old town but is worth staying there since it is only a 10 minute cab ride to get into the town and offers a relaxing stay if you want a beach day or gives you a place to relax after a day of sight seeing. The pool area was lovely. Breakfast is a plentiful buffet and you can sit outside on the terrace to eat. Only suggestions would be to change up the breakfasts a bit on a daily basis and to do something to control the bees on the terrace. Also it would be nice if the hotel offered a shuttle to the old town. We did not have time to use the spa or the gym but one of the unique features of the hotel is the beach area. it is a five minute walk down to the beach and when you arrive there is a multi level restaurant that served delicious lunches and on the beach level had a huge deck with a bar that played great music and had lots of chairs loungers and umbrellas.

We stayed here for 9 nights and knew that the hotel was not in the centre however we were disappointed by the surrounding area around the hotel and surely the owner could do something to improve it. There is a building site to the right of the hotel that we were told by a local person actually belonged to the hotel but not sure if this is true or not but the unfinished building is not great to see when you are either dining on the outside terrace of the hotel or using the beach facilities. The way to the Split old town is via a back entrance of the hotel which if you follow the steps down to the promenade leads into the old town but is a good 40 to 45 minute walk. There are no handrails on the hotels steps either which leads to the promenade and there are alot of steps which tests your fitness levels if walking back via the promenade from the old town. The dining room staff and staff at Mistral Beach which is part of the hotel are all friendly and helpful but the same can not be said of the reception staff who do not seem to be very customer friendly. When we arrived at the hotel to check in at around 130pm we were told that our room was not ready and we should come back in 20 minutes. When we have had similar occurrences on previous holidays we have had a more friendly introduction and offered a drink on arrival and told a little about the hotel which was not the case here. We were not even told about using the back door and going to the beach and when we did wander through after not being able to check in we actually got locked out and could not even get back in to the hotel as we had not been given a door card at that point. Despite the above we thought the choice and quality of the buffet breakfast was excellent and the rooms were very clean despite our deluxe room with balcony not actually having a bath which you would expect in a room described as deluxe.
