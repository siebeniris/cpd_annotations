We checked in late flight from FL that got in at 80 pm I was disappointed to find that a hotel of this stature had no shuttle to the airport PHX. Traffic out of PHX is really bad even late at night due to a crappy highway design and bottleneck. They city really needs to fix that. The hotel is beautiful very spacious lobby lounge dining room. The elevators are from floors 1 15 16 30 so it is a fast ride. We were on the 18th floor and got up there right away. Since they stop seating for dinner at 9 we hurried back down. Dinner was intentionally light I had a sweet potato bisque and we had their 3rd Street Chop Salads with grilled salmon added. The dressing was delicious and the warm breads were terrific. The room was very nice great bed. The water was nice hot took seconds to get that way. We checked out early the next day to go to our course. That afternoon we returned to get our luggage and took a cab out to a hotel that was closer to PHX and did have shuttle service for a 949 am flight the next morning.", "offset": [317, 379], "date": "2015-02-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "46c12b65-2d99-435c-ac3c-4586bcda54ae", "sentence": "Upgraded to a suite on the 29th floor.

We stayed here for two nights at the beginning of our South Western adventure. The main reason for booking here is the price. I made a blind reservation a few months in advance. It was not difficult to work out what we were going to get and after I pressed the submit button I received confirmation of this 4 downtown hotel with pool for only 120 per night. This is incredible value. No wonder it is so full. Despite the conference and competitions taking place around us the reception area was uncluttered and stress free. Check in was prompt and the receptionist added a crib to our room without fuss. The guys managing the parking area were kept busy throughout our stay. They acted professionally and promptly whenever we needed their assistance. The odd number rooms overlook the city and the even face south to the airport and ball park. Take your pick. The rooms themselves are International 4 star. Brown is the dominant colour. We were given two double beds I am not sure whether a king was an option. There were soft almost over sumptuous mattresses coffee machine wifi and wired Internet access and a free small bottle of water. The bath is not deep enough to lose yourself in but as we are in the middle of the desert perhaps we should be at least thinking about water conservation. We used the pool both evenings. The attached bar closes at 5 pm. The polside area was not the cleanest and the pool itself whilst long was narrow and shallow if you were trying to do lengths there is not a lot of space for your turns. Also the water is cloudy and a little salty which stops it from being the most pleasant bathing experience. The pool brought the overall rating for this hotel down. However for price and location the Sheraton Downtown Pheonix performed excellently.", "offset": [543, 622], "date": "2015-05-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9c071245-3c2a-40fa-9f29-2071d4c792b6", "sentence": "Enjoyable Stay.

The hotel was very clean comfortable and quiet. Loved the location of the hotel and ability to walk to from dinner and events.

The bars in different areas of the hotel were nice and had ample room to socialize with big group or intimate conversation. Was great to return to the room and crawl into a very comfy bed. There was not much we did not like. We did eat elsewhere as the prices were pretty expensive especially when there is so many other great places in the area for much cheaper.

My colleagues and I were here to attend a conference couple days ago. We took ride share from airport to Sheraton. The entrance to the hotel looks big and modern. There was no sign for the check in line which was confusing. So everyone just sort of walk in and cut in front of you. I requested a king bed room but they were out so I got pushed to higher floors with a double beds room. The room was good size with a good size bathroom. The TV was small and pillows were uncomfortable. However the best part of the room was the shower pressure. It is very hard to find a hotel with good shower pressure. The hotel was very big with two ballrooms and mini rooms for the conference. The staff seems courteous to the guests. One thing that bugs us the most was the elevator. It was n\u2019t just us complaining but the rest of the guests here for the conference. There were four elevators each for floors 1 17 and 18 32 respectively. The wait time was horrendous it literally took us 15 minutes to get up to our hotel room from the lobby. It was insane but I guess this was due to the conference traffic in the hotel. Nonetheless this seems like a clean hotel. The location is not too bad it was right across Arizona Center with some restaurants and an AMC theater.
