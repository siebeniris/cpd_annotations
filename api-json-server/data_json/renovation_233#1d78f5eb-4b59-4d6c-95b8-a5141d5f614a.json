I like the idea of a lower end westin property in places like NYC. I was there after new years and so the rates were really cheap like 99 night. so that was appreciated. it honestly was neither great nor bad. I would stay there again if the rates are cheap but otherwise I had look elsewhere. pros. low cost kitchenette in rooms fairly clean westin brand free wifi. free beer wine aps was nice cons it was a zoo in there. I mean it seemed like there were always dozens of people in the lobby loitering about and long lines to check in out. it screamed chaos. the lobby area and lounge area where the cocktail hour was held was FREEZING. staff were all wearing scarves and coats. they built a temporary pre entrance to stave off the cold but it does not work very well plus the door is so shoddy that it violently slams into you. I got a bruise on my arm when someone in front of me let the door go. sort that out. elevators were not working when I got there due to a fire alarm going off. I was on the 20th floor. it was very confusing. room was adequate but kind of dark and in need of a remodel and I imagine the rooms are not that old. location is kind of eh if you are the kind of person who does not care about where you sleep it will be fine. but if a hotel is part of your experience stay somewhere else. it is on a block nearish the port authority and is on a street with several other lower end chain hotels think comfort inn holiday inn etc. no character whatsoever. just an overall chaos confusing cold average place. the next night I checked into the hilton garden inn nearby and it was glorious in comparison. so calm and nice and warm.", "offset": [1096, 1197], "date": "2015-01-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "68e0150e-6496-4eb1-a662-8c638ec9a71c", "sentence": "I loved the breakfast very diverse and good quality the little coffee booth near the entrace was very much appreciated especially during the snowy cold days.

Small also and shower head you can hold it did not go very high. But it worked. Perks free full breakfast. More seating is needed as this fills up with lots of people but I do not know if there is a place for that. Great. Mon Thurs. free appetizers and drinks including wine beer and pop.

I was in town for business and booked this hotel because I had heard good reviews of a central location super easy access to the subway comfortable bed and nice rooms. I will say that if you are looking to stay near Times Square this is an excellent value. That being said I found a few things about my stay to be sub par. Upon arrival there was only about 13 of a roll of toilet paper in the room and no backup roll. It was just me traveling so it was not a problem until housekeeping came the next day but I felt it was a little unprepared should I need something else. There were also some facial hair trimmings around the sink. I was too tired to pack my stuff back up and call for another room. The biggest problem with my visit. The carbon monoxide detector. I noticed there was a small plastic flap opened on it the day after arrival but did not think anything of it. The next morning I start hearing loud beeping 5 piercing beeps and then silence for a few minutes. It woke me up and I had to call maintenance and rush to get dressed. They showed up and remarked how there were no batteries in it thus the noise. It was entirely preventable. Maintenance disconnected it and brought back a new unit. It did not fit correctly so they said they had come back after I left for the day to fix it. I got back to my room 10 hours later to find the monitor still hanging off the wall unattached see photo. Was told I had have SPG points added but have yet to see them. Called and waited for maintenance to come back to fix. It was a big disruption to my sleep and then my night coming back to find it unresolved. The elevators were also a problem. I know that elevators in NYC take much longer than normal but this was an entirely different level of delay. While the free managers reception and breakfasts are nice every morning it is nearly impossible to get the elevator down or back up at that time because everyone is rushing down to get food and then carry it back to their room. I was on a low level 4. so I just took the stairs but the final day upon checkout had to manage 1 50 pound bag and 1 25 pound bag down the stairs after waiting 30 minutes for an elevator down. This hotel has so much potential but it fell way short. The room was large by NYC standards and the kitchenette and TV and bed were all really nice. Cleanliness aside the bathroom was well appointed. I went up to the rooftop terrace which was a nice amenity with tables and chairs overlooking parts of the city. Though it was littered with cigarette butts despite signs saying it was a non smoking space. it is a great value but personally I had rather pay more for better service.", "offset": [1006, 1074], "date": "2017-01-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "d09fe264-4fdb-4cd5-a5c5-62ef60023501", "sentence": "Great value for money and location.

Our family has been staying at this property annually for the last 6 years or so. In the beginning we welcomed the fresh design with the faux wood linoleum and the spanky mosaics on the backsplash of the outstanding kitchenette.

Some things like the extreme lack of elevators and the annoying wait time in the mornings never can improve as obviously they \u2019re not adding an extra elevator anytime soon. Just expect a long time for the elevators. Nonetheless we \u2019ve been returning every year as the pricing is excellent and we need the kitchen for dietary reasons. However this trip was a bit disapointing1. The metal bead that lowers the sun shade snapped immediately on pull. Obviously the room stayed bright from the lights outside all night2.

The bathrooms are spacious and the baths feature both a shower wand and a larger overhead rain shower head. The latter does not seem to get particularly hot however but this is merely a quibble. The daily breakfast is not bad at all and you are well served by noting when the busy hours at the buffet are according to the in hotel information literature. The size of this property plays a part in its biggest drawback despite its enormous size and 40 floors only 3 medium sized elevators serve the guests. The long wait can be exasperating and it is likely way much faster to simply descend the staircase when leaving the hotel. Alas it is likely faster to ascend the staircase given the elevator congestion and it was terribly below average to have to descend the staircase WITH our luggage when we left the hotel.
