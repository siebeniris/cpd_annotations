This was a business trip for me to an office building out the back door of the hotel through the lovely grotto of waterfalls stream woods and walkway to one of the three Ravinia office towers. My client was in the nearest building Ravinia 3. About five minutes from hotel to workplace that week. Did have buffet breakfast the first morning there but did not want to pay the high price of the buffet again and with a convention in town it was hard to even get seated but I met three perfect strangers at breakfast. Room was always clean bathroom always clean well lighted. This was a quiet property for my take being on the back side toward the so called grotto. I saw no other cars parking people only trees below my 8th floor room on that side. After one day the room card keys quit working but the renewed version worked fine after replacement. These card keys do not go in a slot on the door lock but are just waved over the handle receptor and they are supposed to unlock. If you do not position it just right or try to swipe it too fast it has to reset then you try again slower. No problem just be patient. The exercise and workout room on 2nd floor is nice to have not a full fitness gym but well stocked with aerobic and some weight training equipment even free weights that had not been stolen by guests which I imagine does not happen a lot but who knows.
