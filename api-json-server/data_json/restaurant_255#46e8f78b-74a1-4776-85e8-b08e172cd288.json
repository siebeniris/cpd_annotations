Love this hotel because of its setting. Only hotel right on the water in the middle of Jack London Square. Prefer the balcony rooms on the marina with a sitting area. Beds are comfortable.

Great fun to just relax on the restaurants outdoor patio and watch festivities in the area. Lots of events scheduled for this summer 2015 street dancing USS Potomac cruises farmers market wine expo and more. The landing for the Golden Gate Ferry is right next door.

Website oversels the beauty of the place it needs some maintenance for old age. Drapes do not close very well carpet is older and the views are crummy once you look past a row of boats to the cargo port and dirt hills of Alameda. The staff lets people use the pool who are not guests of the property and our room was 4 ft above the pool party that night. I literally had to wrap the pillow around my head to go to sleep. On the bright side a tip is to certainly use the complimentary shuttle that runs on the half hour for about 8 hours during the week ONLY. It goes a short radius but will get you over to Lake Merit with a much nicer area. Walk the lake enjoy the restaurant there etc. It is only 4 miles away.

From the moment we pulled up to the valet parking we were greeted with warmth and excellent service. The gentleman who parked our car also drove us to our event that night and was really wonderful. There is a small lobby that is very inviting and comfortable. In the lobby was ice water coffee and tea set up all day along with a fireplace and computers for use. The restaurant bar area was really nice. There was live music on the Friday night we were there and it overlooks Jack London Square and the waterfront. We did not get a chance to eat there but did try their Its It cocktail and it was amazing. everything looked really good. We had the opportunity to stay in a Penthouse Suite and it was unbelievable. Huge wall of windows overlooking the water with a long deck area with furniture and a heater. It has a full kitchen full living room extremely comfortable king bed in front of a fireplace and a bathroom with a jetted tub surrounded in windows with a view of the water. The staff even sent up some champagne and chocolates we felt like royalty. We also really enjoyed Jack London Square and all the great eateries around. We will definitely stay here again.
