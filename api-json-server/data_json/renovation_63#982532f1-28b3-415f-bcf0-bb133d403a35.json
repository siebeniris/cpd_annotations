Words can not describe how disappointing this stay was. As a SPG Platinum member I am usually treated like a valued guest. Not here. The staff was rude the rooms need a refurbishing the shower has no pressure but most of all I hate being lied to. I was given the wrong bed type upon check in. I called to complain and was told that I would be given a King bed the next morning as soon as a guest checked out and the room was cleaned. I was told to wait for a call from the front desk Informing me that a room was ready. The call never came and I had to go down and ask what happened and explain what to a completely untrained employee exactly what was promised to me the night before. His initial answer there is no way anyone told you that. Worst of all however was that when I checked in I informed the front desk agent that I would. be staying only 3 nights and not 4. I explained to her that I had called earlier in the week to make this change and I was told at that time that it would not be a problem. Now at check in it still had me for 4 nights despite my earlier call. She told me that it would be no problem to change it and not to worry. Sure enough when I checked out I was told I was still booked for a 4th night and would have to pay an early departure fee equal to a full nights stay. You can be sure I will be disputing that with my credit card company.

Not only that once in the room she also sent us up a cupcake card and balloon. To say that is great service is an understatement. Antoinete if you are reading this Thank you so much for your friendly efficient and welcoming service. It was greatly appreciated. The room is absolutely fabulous on the 30th floor with a spectacular view of the town and mountains. The bathroom looks newly renovated and is gorgeous with a big shower and very clean. The bed is also one of the comfiest beds me and my partner have ever slept on. Every morning my partner has been going down to use the gym on the 4h floor. He said it is a winner with modern machines a clean layout and enough equiptment to actually have a proper work out. Everything is fairly close by. The main street Market is only about a 7 minute walk and from there you can either walk or get the F line towards the Castro or Fishermans Wharf 2 must see things here in SF. If paying with cash on the tram make sure you have the exact amount of 3 per ticket as they do nt give change. Also we found in San Francicso restaurants tend to close a lot earlier than the UK.
