We just spent the first week of March at the FAC and had a wonderful time. We have previously cruised many times but this was our first trip to Cancun and our first all inclusive resort. We traveled with two other couples and we are all in our 50s. We booked the resort airfare and airport transfers through a travel agent. The Cancun airport is a zoo on Saturdays which is the busiest travel day. We flew Delta Airlines and upon arrival we parked away from the terminal and had to deplane via stairs and board busses standing room only for a ride to the terminal. Thankfully it was not raining but it was hot and you had to juggle your carry on luggage while holding on while standing. Then upon arrival at the terminal you have to stand in long lines for immigration and customs and baggage. Oh and there was no A C in the terminal. The outbound flight was worse with a three hour wait in in a 90 degre90 percent humidity in the terminal with limited seating. We felt as if we were waiting for our flight in a sauna. Exhausting. There was a nice Margaritavile restaurant bar but it was packed and it looked like 30 people or so we are standing outside waiting to squeeze in. Nothing to do with the resort or the airline just the way it it. So be prepared for chaos at the airport. The resort was fantastic. At first I thought it was kind of weird that the lobby restaurants and common areas are not air conditioned but unlike the airport you really do not need it. There is a constant sea breeze blowing and the resort is designed to take advantage of it. It was always very comfortable in all of the common areas and the rooms have great A C plus ceiling fans. The room was very nice. We booked a Garden View but were upgraded to an Ocean View upon arrival. We also had a balcony overlooking the pool area which was fantastic. Lots of negative reviews about the small bathrooms which they were but it was not an issue for us. The toilet and shower tub were in the small room but the sink vanity mirror were in the bedroom. There was a hairdryer provided also. The mini fridge was stocked with soft drinks beer and small bottles of water. There was also a large bottle of water on top of the fridge all of which are complimentary. It took us a few days but we discovered that if there is anything that you want just ask. We were running out of water each day so we asked housekeeping to leave extra water and they did. They only provide 3 towels 2 hand towels and 2 wash cloths and we usually took two showers a day one in the morning and another before dinner. So we asked for additional towels etc and they gave us as many as we wanted. The pillows on the bed the first night were terrible so the next morning I asked for different pillows and they brought several different sizes and firmness levels and let us choose. So if something is not the way you want it they can not read your mind so just askThe pool area is the center of fun so you will have to plan ahead to get a lounger especially in an area that you want. The lower pool is where the party is with music playing all day and the swim up bar is shot central. One day there was a large group of young guys that we found out later had crashed our pool bar from the spring break resort next door. They went through hundreds of shots and were getting pretty rowdy and loud so we moved to another area. We heard that later that night it got really out of hand and security ejected all of them out of the resort. This was a good response and we did not have any more problems the rest of the week. The upper pool area is more peaceful with areas of sun or shade if you choose. I know that this is not fair but if you want a lounger in a specific area you MUST get down there early when the pool opens at 80 and throw some pool towels and yesterdays t shirt on a lounger to reserve it. You can then go back to your room for room service or to breakfast and you can enjoy the pool all day. We never had any issues with our towels of shirts being moved or our personal items including phones iPads etc. being messed with while we were in the pool. There are four main restaurants and I will not go into reviewing them all but we did discover late in our stay that if you are in one of the restaurants and there is nothing that you want on the menu you can order anything that is on the room service menu burgers fries etc and can have that delivered to your table. Again if there is something that you want and do not see just ask. I do wish that there were more options for appetizers or bar food later in the evening. After dinner or if you choose to skip the sit down dinner and just want a light snack with cocktails in the bars that is not available. There is a nice sushi bar but if sushi is not your thing you are out of luck. The only other option is to return to your room and order room service but if you want to hang out in the lobby drink and watch the shows you will either eat sushi or nothing at all. This is the only part of this vacation where I think that cruising has the upper hand. I think that during our next visit we will take the bus to Wal Mart the first day and pick up a few snacks to have available for the evenings we just do not want a full meal. We were also a little disappointed in the entertainment options late in the evening. First all of the shows are in the lobby bar area so seating is at a premium. They would usually start the entertainment at around 80 pm with a lounge act of singers kareoke ect. Then there would be a break and the production show would be at 90. After the show the lounge act would return for about 45 minutes stopping no later than 1045. That was it. Many of the lounge acts were quite good and we would have enjoyed several more hours but that was not an option. I suspect that the reason is that the noise echos throughout the open design of the resort and into the rooms. Even when there was entertainment outside by the pool the sound reverberated into all of the rooms that faced the pool so the entertainment had to be cut off early. The resort did offer a bus to a different spring break style night club every night for the 20somethings Too bad they can not have something similar for the adult crowd to a bar that is more age appropriate. One suggestion if your travel schedule is flexible. Ask if the week you are considering has a convention scheduled. Two days before we left a very large convention came in and the resort began to kind of revolve around them. They had large functions every night that took over areas of the pool and beach and some restaurants shifted to adjust their hours and meals to the needs of the convention. Money talks. Also without a convention and a full to capacity hotel you will have a better opportunity to get that room upgrade. Finally a few words about tipping. When at the pool area the first few days we would tip the server a dollar or two when bringing a round of drinks. We thought we were tipping OK and we got OK service. But then we started tipping 5 for the first round of drinks and at least 2 for each additional round and the drinks never stopped coming. We even got refills delivered without asking and if we happened to be in the pool she would find us and deliver the drinks pool side. So if you want OK service then be stingy with your tips and you will get it. But if you want great service you will need to ante up with decent tips. The service was usually exceptional in the restaurants and the tips reflected exceptional service. I would add that there are lots of very hard working young men and women behind the scenes who are cleaning and making your stay more enjoyable that you may or may not have personal service from. For example there are always people walking around with a broom and dust pan picking up trash and sand emptying trash cans etc. There are attendants in the restrooms cleaning replacing paper towels etc. These folks usually do not receive or expect tips. If you want to make their day and yours walk up to one of these hard working people and say Muchas Gracias give them a dollar two and watch their face light up. These people are so poor and work so hard. A dollar or two makes no difference in my blessed life but can make a huge difference in theirs. Trust me it is habit forming. Overall it was a fantastic stay and look forward to our next visit.", "offset": [2466, 2608], "date": "2015-03-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a312bb2a-c9e5-4216-845d-c61d843893f2", "sentence": "Very nice and friendly hotel with great service. I went with my husband and two daughters. We enjoyed the food and drinks and felt very comfortable at the resort once we were settled in.

The staff took very good care of us from arrival to departure. Thank you MEXICO we will be back. My 8 year old loved the kids club and wanted to go everyday.

Treated like royalty. We will return. We read all the reviews on Tripadvisor both good and bad. We understand that sometimes bad things happen on vacations. Some issues can be blamed on the hotel and some need to be disregarded just due to bad luck. Sometimes people just need to realize the world does NOT revolve around them and they are the problem. This review is from an easy going couple in our mid to late 40s from the USA. We were traveling without any children and this was our first trip to Cancun. Check in. Flawless. We arrived 4 hours before check in. We upgraded to an ocean view in the Sea Tower and was told it would be 1 12 hours to get room ready. We went to pool bar and had cervesas and then had lunch at the fantastic buffet. The service was phenomenal and set the vibe for this vacation. We checked into our ocean view room at 1230pm 2 12 hours early and luggage arrived 2 minutes later. Room. The room was immaculate. Housekeeping had made a mural out of colored rice of 2 dolphins waiting for us on the dresser very cool. We had fresh sheets towels fully stocked fridge and a spotless room everyday for the duration of our stay. Beds were super comfortable. The balcony was the best a couple chairs and a table. Cruise ships to view every night all lit up. One night there were 4 of them visible. Every day in the late afternoon housekeeping would stop by the room and ask if we needed anything. They had a cart full of towels toiletries bottled water etc. What a nice touch to make sure guests are comfortable. Food We ate at the buffet for all breakfasts and dinners. We only had lunch once on the first day. The food was great and was varied for every meal and each day. the food was excellent. We never visited the ala carte restaurants for this reason. I would recommend the fish tacos from La Cevicheria they are awesome. Pool and beach. The pools are clean cool and a lot of fun. The waterfall was a free massage when you stood underneath it. The swim up bar has great service I would suggest a rum punch or Mango Tango. The beach was. well can not get much better. The sand is cool the clarity is amazing and the waves were fun. There was a lot of sea weed on the beach. The staff was trying their best to rake and bury it but it was windy and there must have been some storms way out to sea to make it difficult to control unusual according to localsThere was entertainment every night in the lobby by the pools in the ballroom or in the lobby bar. All the shows we saw were very good. The Fire show by the pool at night was exceptional. They also setup dinners outside by the pool most nights. they are a smaller version of the buffet and looked very good although we did not attend them. This hotel plays the towel Game for pool chairs. Just get up early throw a towel on your chairs then go to the coffee bar and get a cappuccino or whatever they are a nice eye opener all inclusiveThe difference in this smaller hotel compared to the larger resorts is the service. The service here is second to none. The entire staff is phenomenal. We want to thank one of the wait staff that made our visit extra special. His name is Juan Jose J. He told us to call him Batman. We did. Every day he greeted us with a smile and treated us like family. Like a lot of the other employees there he had several jobs and we saw him frequently. He made this trip very special. Juan Jose you are a true Super Hero and we are looking forward to see you on our next trip to FACRom Tip. Upgrade to a Sea Tower ocean view room with WALKOUT BALCONY. some rooms do not have balcony. Get 4th floor or higher. Well worth the price. Wi Fi Spotty. My wifes tablet worked everywhere Dell. Mine sucked Asus. I will upgrade. LOLNote for great pictures video go to the top floor of Sea Tower and head towards beach. There is a nice patio that overlooks the entire oceanfront pool area. The lobby is covered by a huge palapa that encompasses the whole front of hotel and is open air so unique. Not a mosquito or fly anywhere. The hotel layout blocks out the hotels next door. the feeling is like an oasis. After a day on Isla Mujeres or seeing Playa Del Carmen this place was a quiet retreat. There is a burger hotdog stand munchies stand brick oven pizza stand and La Cevicheria seafood bar all near the pool. The chef also cooks a mixture of seafood in a huge wok grill next to pool once a week. We did not have to deal much with the timeshare vacation club people. They are there if you are interested. We said no and that was it. A rep asked us for our room number so we would not be bothered after explaining we were not interested. The grounds have lots of trees flowers and a lot of Iguanas. There is a cash machine on the ground floor that is secure best exchange rate. There is an OXO convenience store 5 minutes away by foot. Photographers bring in Monkeys birds Iguanas daily by the pool and beach for photos you can purchase later in the shop on main floor. Very reasonable and high quality. I recommend. My one complaint. After 530pm the outside bars close. The only place to get a drink is the Lobby Bar. The place gets busy and the wait increases. This is not a big deal but needs attention by management. We fully enjoyed this place and plan to return.", "offset": [4210, 4327], "date": "2015-04-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "6f465363-5c48-4014-b916-ba0d20318f66", "sentence": "GREAT VACATION. I will be as honest as possible. We have stayed at several all inclusive resorts and this resort actually rates as one of the tops on our list. Not because of the accommodations which were a little dated and not because it was the best food it was not the best but it was really good. but because of the staff and the hard work they did to make us comfortable and happy.

We just returned from 8 days in Cancun Mexico and a great stay at the Fiesta Americana Condesa. We have never done an all inclusive in Mexico and had some reservations about the all inclusive experience but we love Cancun and most of the properties are now all inclusive. In the past we stayed at the Gran Melia right nest door to the Fiesta Americana Condesa. And the Fiesta American Condesa was our favorite place for an afternoon batch of Nachos and a Margarita as it had the very best view of the beautiful ocean from it is position on the beach. So as a known quantity we returned this vacation. Upon arrival we were treated very well by Rene at the front desk during our check in process. He understood our desire for a room upgrade and made an ocean front room available to us as to very fair upgrade charge for the week. As a result we woke up every morning to a beautiful sunrise and sounds of the ocean waves lapping the shore thank you Rene. Because of our lovely view and covered balcony we took advantage of room service every morning. The in room dining menu was comprehensive and included in the all inclusive experience and it certainly beat getting ready for the morning buffet and crowd of people. Our food was delivered as ordered in a timely manner and always with a smile from the delivery person. We spent a lot of our time at the beach under a Palapa versus by the pool. The pool is pretty active with music and adult games. We were looking for a bit more peace and quiet. The beach side bar service we received from Oscar was wonderful. He read our minds and would have the next cocktail or glass of ice without our even requesting it. thank you Oscar. Another perk of sitting around the pool or the beach is that the spa personnel come by an offer a free 5 minute seated massage. For a minimal gratuity of your choosing you can extend the 5 minutes to whatever length of time you would like. I had 3 wonderful 15 minute massages ocean side give by Ricardo. He is certified and gives a great seated massage. We dined most evenings at the fabulous Italian Restaurant Rosato. A dress code is enforced casual elegant and reservations are highly recommended. The food here is prepared by Jesus the chef he is VERY talented and the menu is broad and varied. Haime was our waiter on several of our visits and he is also top notch. Ernesto is the manager and Marlene is the hostess. They are a FABULOUS team who handle all of the guests needs with a smile on their faces and a desire to connect with the people they serve each evening. Ernestos understanding of wine was very helpful to us as we like to order a special bottle of wine with dinner and his suggestions were right on target. Our last night at the restaurant we were treated to a very special chefs menu as designed by Ernesto and Jesus and we were seated at a very special table. Thank you for making our visit so special and we feel as if we have made two great friends in Ernesto and Marlene. The hotel offers very nice adult entertainment in the lobby area in the evenings. We were treated to a DJ a pair of singers and an electronic violinist during our visit. Guests were invited to make requests for selections of music and many of us danced. The lobby bar area is a very busy place. We made a great connection with Jazmin a lobby bar server. She took care of us every evening and we got to know a bit of her personal story as well. We really enjoyed the fact that she was friendly and personable even on a busy night. She does her job very well and always with smile. In closing the Fiesta Americana is very family oriented and seems to be a favorite choice for the local people. The feel is old time Mexico with many contemporary upgrades such as the lobby the restaurants and rooms. The hotel is well located on the hotel zone and you can walk the beach and view other properties for as long as you like in both directions. The beach on this particular property is beautifully maintained. There was some seaweed at other locations but the beach at the Fiesta Americana had none. I would also say that the property overall was very well maintained. We will be back at sometime in the future.

I can say that these positive reviews are correct and it was a fantastic resort. I was very impressed with the variety of restaurants having that many choices is awesome and not needing reservations is a HUGE plus. Yes you need to reserve for the steak house between 2 4 for the following day but that is the only one. The Italian does have a dress code so men you must wear a collared shirt and closed toed shoes. I loved how much variety there was for all meals. they also asked if there was any allergies at all restaurants. they also will provide a gluten free or vegetarian menu if requested. The room was good did not really get cool water in the shower which i found odd since normally it is the other way around. lol. The bed yes is a tad hard but i ve had worse in mexico. No balcony and had a view of the oasis hotel. over all for the time spent in the room is was perfectly fine. our room was on the 7th floor and chose to do the stairs several time a day to ward off all that food we ate lolThe resort yes is a bit older but it is a beautiful resort. I loved the charm of it and was not too new modern and fancy. It had a nice warm casual feeling to it. It was spotless clean they are always doing little updates paining planting etc. It was beautiful. The lobby was nice and big but got very noisy at night. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Loved that the pool was huge with 2 separate section to it. A smaller one up top and the larger size down on the main ground area that had the swim up bar and a smaller kidie area with a pirate ship and water slidesthe beach was great soft white and blue water it was reg flag every day the whole week rough waves and sand erosion. It was very windy the entire weknow for my pet PEEVE. chair saving. This was a huge problem at this resort as i ve read in other reviews. We would be down by 715 every am and only got chairs twice. We met people that were up at 630 and said it was crazy to see everyone running around saving chairs by 630am. to me that is insane. Most want to come on holidays to relax and sleep in a tad and not use a alarm clock to wake you up just to have to get a chair. now what i see as a huge problem is because they have a no towel card policy so many take 3 4 towels a person. They leave towels on chairs when not using them. IF your done have common courtesy and return your towels. that way as others come out they know if those chairs are now available. The other thing we saw every day was one that had chairs saved by that 7 am mark and we would not see them finally get to their chairs till 1 2 pm. that is so rude imo. one day we seen this saving chair issue first hand result in unhappy people. One day there was 6 chairs saved beside us. we arrived to our chairs at 830 after breakfast and sat there all am. no one there. finally around 11 we seen people starting to sit there. had no idea that they were not the original people that reserved them as there was only towels on them no personal belongings. someone asked us about the chair beside us how long it is been empty. we said all morning. so they sat down. the people behind us asked a employee where they could get the chair pads from that some seemed to have. They then started to remove them off those chairs. at 2 pm the owners of the chairs came up and caused a huge issues about it. most people were already leaving the pool area and they were just arriving. Apparently they went for a tour in the am. They caused such a about it got the manager involved etc. IMO they were the ones in the wrong. there was no personal belonging there to save them just the resort towels on each chair. you do not have chairs reserved super early and not use them. just common courtesy. The pool area did get packed and congested. There is not enough room around the pool and yet chairs are packed all the way around it. The beach could use more chairs. I do not think it is a good thing when you pay thousands of dollars for a vacation and have to lay sit on the ground to get a spotover all it was a excellent holiday we do not care for the cancun area or the airport but i would come back to this resort. they just need to fix this chair saving issues and the lack of towel cards to help control it. It was nice being able to use 2 towels if needed but i found a lot of waste going on which only results in the resort spending more of laundry service which can affect resort fees in the long runwe were also told that they will be undergoing renovations soon. the moon tower first 3 months for each building.

The rooms are comfortable and spacious our room in particular overlooked the pool and beach which was breathtaking all on its own. Although there was construction going on at the time you could n\u2019t hear it from the room. Being all inclusive the hotel has something for everyone in the family. My grandparents loved sitting by the beach and having such friendly staff wait on them. My younger cousins loved the Teens Club where they were able to hang out with other kids their age. The rest of my family enjoyed the food and drinks the performances and again the amazingly friendly staff. From Alejandro who greeted us with cafe de olla every morning and with ice cream in the afternoon everyone at the Kalmia and the Grill and Valentin and Felix who waited on our table in El Mexicano on our last night everyone was so approachable and kind it really made leaving the hotel difficult. I would like to give a special shout out to Andres. Andres waited on our table during the baile folklorico and was so patient with my cousin and I when we asked him to bring us a specific shot of tequila tequila de almendra. We both felt so spoiled when Andres went out of his way to bring us the drinks. Several days later Andres saw us again at El Mexicano. Even though he was not our waiter he greeted us remembered us from that night who knows how many other he had waited on since then and brought me another shot of the same tequila simply because he remembered how much I enjoyed it. Now to some people it may seem odd that that these were the highlights of staying at the Condesa. But my point is when you stay at the Condesa you are made to feel welcomed. You will be remembered you will be appreciated.

Let me start off my saying how incredible this resort is. I have been to Cancun several times before at both 4 and 5 star resorts all inclusive and adult only resorts and this place truly took us by surprise. We traveled with our two children ages 8 12 during our spring break and although the hotel was at full capacity it never felt crowded. I spent countless hours reading review after review I like to be very prepared in what we are getting ourselves into and trust me when I say those negative reviews must have lost their minds. Yes this is an older resort an even in Late April they were in the beginning stages of construction. The resort is showing its age in decor but it is spotlessly cleaned. Every restaurant and bathroom is well kept. Our rooms were cleaned every day between 11 1 which was perfect because we spent all morning and afternoon at the pools and beach. Pols there is a kidie pool with a pirate ship with several small slides that lead into about a foot and half splash pool completely sectioned. There is a larger pool about 45 5 ft deep that leads into the swim out bar area which also connects to a 35 ft deep swimming area with a volley ball net as well a jacuzi. There is an infinity pool which is HEATED that is 3 4 ft deep we spent every day at this pool as my younger could not really stand in the other pool areas. The water in the pool was about 80 degrees which was lovely once the sun started to set around 5 pm everyday. We brought our own pool rafts for the kids and ourselves and the pool staff was kind enough to blow them up for us. There are plenty of pool chairs and beach chairs. Some are newer ones that have cushions. There are several towel huts located throughout the resort no card needed. We never had an issue getting 4 chairs everyday with umbrellas. By 1030 the pool starts to get busy. There are waiters that come around the pool and beach area taking food and drink orders and they were amazing Angel Hercules were the best thank you. Our children loved being able to order fresh smoothies chicken nuggets and ice cream with sprinkles in between swimming laps. Roms yes the rooms are dated but they are well maintained and super clean. The rooms either have a king size bed or 2 full beds. There are several different types of balconies so you can walk out and be able to have chairs on and some are more like a tiny little ledge with no seating. As well as some have extremely low or no railings at all those with small children should certainly keep this in mind I emailed the resort 3 weeks prior requesting a full size balcony and they were great in delivering just that. And I can not forget the incredible characters they created out of colorful rice for our children. The kids could not wait to get back to their room to see what surprise was waiting for them on their beds. Restaurants almost all the restaurants are open air seating. Our children really enjoyed the fresh omelet station and fresh juices every morning at Kambu located right off the beach. The ceviche is amazing just like everyone said. The Mexican restaurant was beyond delicious and so authentic the chef came over to our table to make a special meal for our family as it was our daughters 12th birthday that night. Being from NY we know good pizza and the brick oven pizza severed by the pool was amazing. Whatever you may want more of they are happy to bring seconds or thirds. Yes drinks are a little weak but the bartenders will add a double shot if you want just simply ask. Everyone at this resort went above and beyond to make our stay so memorable and beautiful Fernanda from PR went out her way to find us and ask what could be done to make our stay even better she was such a sweetheart in arranging a special night for our daughters bday. The waiters remembered our entire families drink orders at every place we went little touches like that are seen throughout. They went the extra mile to ensure we were all satisfied. Although gratuity is included please tip as they work so incredibly hard and it is so deserved. The decor and over all atmosphere is 4 stars but The service is 5 stars without a doubt and I can not wait to return in 2017 to see all the remodeling that is taking place and this resort will definitely be 5 stars all around. I would recommend this resort to couples families or singles. it is definitely not a party hotel but it has a great charm to it. do not hesitate in booking I promise you will not be disappointed.

Decided to have our wedding here after a friend had hers here the year prior. We unfortunately went through a couple coordinators and was worried that our day would be chaotic however Lisbeth was absolutely amazing and made sure everything came together and exactly as we imagined it. The food was great at every restaurant we tried and everyone raved about the poblano soup that was served at our reception. Unfortunately we had no idea the resort was under renovations which caused a few inconveniences but the renovations we saw from our guests rooms were beautiful. The only thing that we did not enjoy was our phone ringing in the middle of the night for no reason. Happened almost every night and since we had a suit we had multiple phones we had to try to remember to disconnect every night. I am sure it was due to some glitch during the renovations and they did try to fix it but were not successful. The staff at the hotel is incredibly friendly and try to accommodate every request so if it was not for that waking up at 3 am from the phone ringing this would definitely be a 5 star review. We look forward to going back again once the renovations are complete. Staff incredibly friendly and acomodating We did not have time to do much outside the resort but some guests enjoyed the cenotes jet skiing snorking and the underwater museum.

We had our company event here for the week. The service is friendly but the quality of food is just GOD AWFUL. I tried every restaurant and the only one that is any good is the fish taco hutI would go as soon as they open. I would actually leave the resort and go out and eat every night because the food is SO BAD. I tried the pizza hut and it was by far the worst pizza ever. The breakfast buffet is ok but its just breakfast. The Italian Restaurant ROSATO could be the WORST meal I have ever eaten. The pasta with bolognese is like canned food. The pasta carbonara was just awful and the so called tenderloin is just a small flat piece of steak drenched in brown sauce. The calamari was terrible too. We had a table of 7 and they all hated it. We tried the steakhouse which you need to make reservations for and it was terrible. Overall the grounds are ok and nothing to fancy. My guess this place is more for people on a VERY TIGHT budget because you are paying basically to stay on the beach and surviver the week on poor food. I had a friend say What do you expect all they know is Mexican food and you would expect the other types of food to be good. good point by him.

Everything you need to know. Stayed January 19 26 2017 with my girlfriend and her family. First off i do not know how anyone can give this place a bad review or even just 4 stars. This place is 5. I think sometimes people have one little bad thing happen and then blow everything else out of proportion. This place is amazing and appeals to all age groups. The best resort I have been to yet. Not one little detail goes forgotten here at FAC \u2013 especially the food and the service. We are not the type to visit a resort twice because we like to experience new places however ever since we have gotten back we have felt like no place will ever be able to stand up to FAC. That being said it is only a matter of time before we return. Our check in was painless. We booked a garden view room and were pleasantly surprised to have an ocean view on the third floor. The view was perfect and appreciated. The resort is beautiful extremely clean and so easy to find your way around. Staff. previous reviewers do not lie the staff here go above and beyond. We had not even been in the resort 5 minutes and Francisco had us taken care of and kept the drinks coming. They are always smiling and working to meet your needs. If you pick a spot by the pool ocean or lobby bar they keep the drinks coming. We felt special at the Asian Kambu restaurant on our last night when they surprised us with a beautiful goodbye dessert and round of special drinks. Pools pools are very clean. the infinity pool is warm no need to tip toe in. The lower pool is refreshing. We have not had issues getting chairs. I believe this is because the one tower is empty and under construction so not as many guests. Beach. soft sand big waves and beautiful. If you like wind surfing or just jumping in the waves this beach is perfect. There is not anywhere to snorkel off the resort but there are many different snorkeling day excursions you can go on close by. There is an Aqua World rep right on site by the pool who can find the best excursion for your taste and budget. We did the akumal turtle snorkeling and cenote exploring which was an experience of a life time. Long trip but so worth it. If you are n\u2019t just wanting to see the see turtles I would recommend the other snorkeling trip which is about 50 USD. You will see more fish here than with the turtles and the trip is n\u2019t long. There are plenty of nice chairs and umbrellas. There are a few sales people trying to sell art and souvenirs but they come and go and do not pressure you. If you go to the market in Cancun that is another story. They chase you around trying to get you to buy stuff. The bus there was pretty fool proof. 20 pesos or one American dollar each. The bus takes you up the boulevard one way and if you cross the street it will take you right back to the hotel. Food this resort has the best food I have ever had a resort Hands down. Quality and variety is top notch here. I have gained 7 pounds \uf04c. Food for all kinds of eaters even the picky ones. The only restaurant you need reservations for is the San Telmo steak house which is also the only formal place you have to dress up for no shorts for guys collared shirt. Dinner The A La Cartes are amazing. The Italian is so good we went twice. I recommend the chicken parm or the beef tenderloin. The Asian was also so good we went twice get a double order of spring rolls you will need them. The shrimp is amazing here also get two orders to share and the chicken skewer appetizer. For a main dish the pork is very good and so is the Teriyaki dish. The deep fried ice cream for dessert was amazing. The Kalmia buffet was okay for dinner but the specialty restaurants are where to be for dinner here. They put a lot of effort into food here. The Mexican was good but mostly seafood to my surprise. San Telmo steakhouse had great food. Breakfast. the Kalmia buffet and the buffet by the beach are both amazing same food different views. Eggs omelettes made to order and French toast to die for. Lunch for someone who does not really like fish all that much the fish tacos by the pool at Cevichiera are addictive. I have had them everyday sometimes twice. The buffet at kalmia is also great for lunch. The chicken made on request at the grill with salt and chimichuri is so tasty. Room service 247. ordered the fajitas late at night and a brownie and it was great too. The homemade chicken fingers are even better. I really have no complaints food wise. I actually miss some of the food items. The coffee shop serves up tasty desserts ice cream and the best coffee \u2019s I have had since Cuba. Drinks the electric lemonade Miami Vice. strawberry and I think coconut frozen mojito and mudslide were our favourite drinks. All a must try. Bartenders will whip you up whatever you want. There are some premium liquors and the beer is Dos Equis Sol and Corona. There is also a sports bar but you have to ask directions because you would never know its there at a glance. There is a pool table in there and it is usually quiet but a fun place to have some drinks snacks and a game of pool. The pizza grill by the pool was good. They also serve up nice chicken burgers. There is also a smoothie bar by the pool restaurant which was a tasty treat. They served up ice cream at the pool one day and also a BQ which was very nice. I could go on an on about the food. Rooms. Sea tower facing ocean directly really nice and super clean. Beds are really comfy. Nice balconies although make sure you ask for a balcony at check in because not all rooms have one. Shower is a huge stand up with a waterfall shower head. The mini bar is stocked daily with 2 Cokes 2 diet 2 7up 4 beers and plenty of water. A nice touch that I found helpful was the USB charging ports built into the wall. We could charge multiple devices at once. Nice big screen tv. We did not watch it because we used the laptop for Netflix at night and most of the channels were in Spanish. Our room was cleaned twice sometimes. amazing and sometimes they would come by in evening to see if we needed anything like more water etc. Entertainment. Michael Jackson show was good. The retro show was better with the visual effects and variety of dancing and songs. We missed the fire show due to it being cancelled because a quick rain came in just before the show. The magic show and the circus show were both incredible. The performers are so talented. Their tricks and skills will blow you away and have you laughing pretty hard. The pool entertainment staff did a good job with involving guests in fun games. Massage. I have never gotten a massage down south simply because I get them covered in Canada. On our second last day a staff approached me and offered my partner and I a massage at a promotional rate. 50min Swedish full body massage for 42 USD. We had the massage in front of the ocean. best money I spent all trip Amazing. Then on our last day a worker came around and asked if we would like free 5 minute massage right there while we were sitting by the pool. Take him her up on this offer it was a nice treat. Construction. I only noticed it in the morning while sitting by the pool or beach. A few saws going on and a little banging in the building being renovated. But I only noticed this while outside before the pool music came on. The rest of the days the only way I knew it was there was because you can physically see that the building is being worked on. Do not let the construction be the deal breaker it is a non issue unles you sit on your balcony all day in Sea Tower and watch it. Wifi we had perfect wifi service in our rooms which was a surprise given that most reviewers reported otherwise. Around the resort it is spotty but it works 90 of the time with no issues. Gym has everything you need whether you want a cardio work out or strength workout. Smokers. if you hate smoke you will like this place. If you are a smoker you may feel a little out of place here. Accessibility. There are ramps throughout the resort to all the main outdoor areas and indoor areas restaurants etc. Elevators work fine and are fast in sea tower. Weather first 5 days were hot hot hot. Day 6 was cool 25C. of course this was the day we did our snorkeling excursion. day 7 was hot again. There was one little 5minute shower one evening before the fire show. The weather network said 40 chance of rain everyday which had us worried but as I said it only rained the once for 5minutes at night. I can honestly say I do not have any complaints about this place. I can go on and on about all the good things. This is the first time we have wished we booked a longer trip. So far we are not ones to return to a resort because we like experiencing something new but this place has blown us away. We will be back. The only thing that would have made my trip better in all honesty was if there were crepes at the buffet for breakfast and dessert like I have experienced at most resorts before.

If you like fresh seafood you can get it at the Cevicheria overlooking the amazing ocean views there are also sushi bar pastry ice cream shop daily room service and if you want something healthy there is plenty of options. The service was amazing the atmosphere and hospitality were excellent. The quality of food and presentation would have easily cost us 15020 in the states. They have a bar in the lobby and a few outside even one in the pool with top shelf selections depending on what you like. Very clean hotel every night I saw them scrubbing down and preparing for the next day. The spa was wonderful and offered a pre relaxation experience prior to a message. The location is close to the marina and downtown super convenient if you want to spend some time venturing on your own. They also offered some entertainment between 9pm10pm at the convention hall and for those that want nightlife there is a entertainment guide with nightly shuttle to different clubs Senior Frogs Coco Bongo.

Well I sit here in the hotel lobby all checked out and for the first time I can not wait to get on a plane and fly home as far away as possible from this Hotel. Please excuse any error in my grammar as I can not hear myself think over the construction. And there it starts Lets go over all the negative and positive points we have had with this Hotel. 1 Construction. Wow I understand that hotels have to improve over time and invest money however to have 6 different areas under construction is just beyond belief. 12 hours of drilling and banging is a disgrace. With what I assume is circa 60 of the lobby taken the beach bar taken an area at the top level pool taken a food bar at the lower level of the pool taken we even went to the indoor bar with the pool table there was also construction going on at the back of there. The constant ringing of drills and still saws will not be mised2. The Damp Smelling rooms. We walking into our first room and could not believe the damp fusty smell we were greeted with the hotel moved us but the second room was not much better. We spoke with the assistant manager about the fact the rooms were damp the bedding was damp our clothes smelling fusty the drawers to keep clothes in were gross. The answer was that is what it is like at this time of years my house is like it. If you want to move it may take upto 4 days. I am sorry but we travel to many places at least 3 different holidays a year and never ever have we come across this. The AC was shocking we could not keep it on at night due the loud bagging noise it gave off there was also a sensor light in the wardrobe when the AC was on this would set off the lights another reason not to have AC on at night to avoid the disco light coming from the wardrobe. not forgetting the dripping water from it There were three good memories about the room Room service is great the cleaning lady Bety did a solid job and the third memory leaving it and never having to go back. 3. The pool area. I can not believe a hotel in 2018 allowing people to lay towels on beds from 7 am taking all the best spots and these people not surfacing back to the pool until after midday. It is a disgrace upon chatting to a couple of these people in passing they are fequent visitors so I guess that answered that question. The amount of drunk people falling around in the pool where children are we even witnessed two men carry a sunbed across the pool above their heads with a little child laid asleep on it with staff watching on. Safety is Cleary not at the top of the list at this hotel. People having drink in the pool and leaving glasses all around the pool side. The good thing about the pool is the size and split level other than this I could take it or leave it. 4. Resorte Credit. What a con it is there to make you spend more money about the only thing we could get is beer with in the 50. We had a bottle of red wind and was charged a full 50Realy is a bottle vodka 70. I do not think so. On one day we had beer to the room when the guy came in and opened the fridge he had the cheek to ask why we wanted more you have plenty here. there were 4 30ml cans in there. 5. Staff and Service Now this was 5050 we found some of staff amazing and friendly Felix and Oscar in the lobby bar were fantastic Jonathan in Rosato was also amazing. other people were rude We only seemed to get service at our table if an American was sat talking with us Lead me to assume they do not like the Brits much here6. Food This is one of the few things the hotel has going for itself. I did not like the buffet area at all it was like a school dinning hall but there were plenty of options to eat elsewhere and the food was beautiful. 7 Proactive to bad weather Shocking on the first 3 days of our stay the weather was bad nothing can be done about this however when there is only a lobby bar open that is as I say about 60 closed due to construction we had 2 options sit in brick dust and that dreadful sound of still saws and drills May I add on sit on the floor steps due to lack of seating or sit in our room. 8 Management They are dreadful a total lack of communication and a total lack of ownership. We spoke to the assistant manager on the Saturday which was our 3rd day he was going to come back to us with some options Sunday came still nothing back from him on the Monday a lady at guest relations calls to follow up she arranged to meet us the following day at 11 am she was never there and no other member of staff new anything about it. From that point no one came back to us at all however we did get a call from our travel company to say the manager had told them everything was resolved they had moved us rooms again and we were every happy. now either we were asleep when all this happened and took a bang to head to forget or the hotel were talking garbage. Lets me put it this way we checked out the same room that we stayed in for the full 10 days and this trip has to go down as the worst holiday we have had. I look at reviews on here and can only draw on one assumption most people are not British I believe that we have been treated very different to our American Friends. Never again would I come here and would urge people to check out other Hotels in Cancun before booking.", "offset": [3603, 3752], "date": "2018-06-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "27646c58-cb03-4b4f-a838-a98ef3a88160", "sentence": "Wonderful resort but beware of construction. Before our vacation I spent hours scrolling through reviews to look for tips pros and cons etc. so I am going to include everything I can think of right here. To start off beware that a large part of this resort is going through construction. The construction is loud during the day but only can be heard in that section of the resort. The construction did take away from our experience and we would have loved this resort to the fullest if it were not going on. If we would have known of the construction we would have not gone there however I am still happy we went. The roms modern and beautiful. We stayed in the premium oceanfront room and asked for a balcony which we were easily given sometimes they are not available. Our room was PERFECT. Some people complain of humidity but it \u2019s the ocean so it was expected. The bathroom situation is definitely a con unles you are extremely comfortable with who you are traveling with. The fod ugh. My biggest disappointment. After staying at a different resort last year I had high hopes for the food but it was mostly just \u201c good \u201d at the buffet. That being said the food at the restaurants was outstanding. At the italian restaurant I recommend the chicken parm. It was delicious. At the steakhouse I got the salmon and it was amazing. The turnovers are so delicious as an appetizer. Our favorite thing was the nachos at the grill out by the pool. AMAZING. The service The activities staff was the absolute best. Uri Enrique and Rauel were so much fun and really made our experience. Take the zumba class everyday at 11 and you will not regret it. The service was not great at the buffet and decent at the restaurants VERY SLOW. Check in was smooth and fairly quick. The bar service was always great and room service was quick. Spa treatments were worth the investment and the staff there was great. Extra There are shows every night at the resort. The fire show was our favorite the rest were pretty good. The resort dies down a ton at night so go downtown to CoCo Bongo or Senor Frogs if you \u2019re looking to get out.

PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEW. I just returned from here staying June 27 through July 2 2018. I booked this trip through a travel agency who used Funjet Vacations as the marketer. I have special needs which is why I went the travel agent route. This resort is booked as one of the leading handicapped accessible resorts in Cancun Mexico. NOT. I use a walker to get around. There was only one ramp to one restaurant and only on one level at that. There was an extremely long circular walk to get to the kids pool and you could snake around that pool into a second eating area from the back if you chose. My granddaughter had to fold up my seated walker carry it down steps then come back and get me help me down the steps and there are no hand railings anywhere. There are not roll in showers in every room but walk in showers and they are fine but will not accommodate wheelchairs or walkers unles you book one of three such rooms. I went to the pool one time went to the far restaurant one time and that is it. In room majority of time. Elevators very small will accommodate a wheelchair and maybe two other persons maximum at one time. Steps everywhere steep steps. So if you are mobility limited this is not for you. The beach area was not as portrayed. At the edge of the sand where the Caribean Sea meets the edge is a domed wall of sand dirt etc topped by a ton of seaweed. They removed the seaweed the first morning we were there and never after My granddaughters watched very morning unfortunately. I could not traverse that hill and who wants to trudge through seaweed. I asked the hotel staff about it was basically ignored with a shrug. The food needs improvement the girls tried all the available spots and were not impressed. The times I dined the food was okay. Not worth the cost of the all inclusive trip. We were ready for McDonalds upon return to the states. Now some menu selections were better than others. We are not drinkers so I can not comment on the drinks. There are some good points to this resort also. The security was very good with guardhouses and checks made of all comings and goings. I was impressed with that. The rooms were humid but that is to be expected. They were very clean tastefully decorated overall good staff to maintain the mini fridges with water and drinks. If you had a need just call and it was taken care of. Unfortunately they could not create handicapped accessibility at the flick of a pen. Most of the staff was helpful and courteous. Antonio was my to go person and he was extremely concerned about my inability to navigate the resort and he helped my granddaughters find the least amount of steps required for me to try and maneuver. But these steps are steep and no handrails making extreme difficulty. I think my girls enjoyed the trip but it was misrepresented to me. Not sure whose fault that is. the travel agent is looking into the matter as we type so I am not laying blame with this resort. There is construction going on and unfortunately being room bound was horrible as I was very close to the areas. Awful noise jackhammers pounding 247 almost. I actually cried the second day I was there but soon realized I had no choice but to tough it out. If you are all healthy no physical limitations even with your children. this would be a very safe clean pools awesome teen area for you to try. do not plan on fantastic food but overall acceptable. This is not cheap but it is a beautiful resort beautiful gardens beautiful view. I will not go back myself neither will my girls because of the inability to get to the water safely and cleanly. This is an unbiased factual experience. I do not want someone mislead like I was because I will be making payments forever on a trip I could not partake of.", "offset": [1837, 1891], "date": "2018-07-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "e8997d05-d74b-42ff-b307-92861065d732", "sentence": "I have stayed at quite a few resorts but this one has been amazing.

The staff in the lobby were all helpful the waiters waitresses by the pool and in all the restaurants all made you feel like nothing was too much of an ask and you were never left without a drinkAl the entertainment staff were amazing by the pool in the day and jack in the evening.

This was my siblings and my sixth time staying at Fiesta Americana Condesa and to say this place is amazing is an understatement. Everything about it is perfect from check in to check out was the best week of my life. What sets this resort apart is the exceptional staff and service they give. They are truly like family to us but they will do anything for you always with the biggest smile on their faces. I would be doing a disservice to not mention some of the best people we came across because they deserve the recognition. First the entertainment staff of Uri Raul Enrique Adrian Jack and Itzel are amazing. They are so energetic and friendly. They take the time to get to know everybody and help to bring everybody together who wants to get involved in the activities. If you are heading to this resort I highly recommend introducing yourself to them especially Uri and Raul. I have never met two kinder more genuine people than those two. Next we spent a fair amount of time at the pool bar and the group there are exceptional bartenders hard workers and great people in general. Pedro Carlos Sandro and Carlos always made sure we had a drink in our hands and they always tasted great. Even during the busy times they work so hard to keep everybody happy and had drinks for everbody in no time. Pedro always makes our vacations so memorable and he is my favorite bartender I have ever come across he is so special to us. Also the servers around the pool are so happy and there smiles make me smile even more too. Jose Hercules Claudio and Angel are just a few that stand out to us for their positivity. Finally the servers at dinner are always so attentive and funny and they make our meals enjoyable. Jairo at the steakhouse Jonathon at Rosato and Orlando at Kambu were so good. Lastly Fernanda is such a sweetheart so caring and made sure everything went smoothly for us. Fiesta Americana is home to us. We have stayed at other resorts before this and nothing comes close to the people and service you will receive here. I would highly highly recommend this resort to anybody and everybody. We already can not wait to get back to our favorite place and to see our family down in Mexico.", "offset": [2123, 2218], "date": "2018-07-17", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 30, "uid": "60835c8f-6d06-4d27-8e8d-61ef15b3ce7c", "sentence": "Always a great time at Condesa. From the time you arrive until the time you leave it is a service. We have been to a number of locations in Cancun and none can compete with FA Condesa. It was me and my wife during our recent stay 114 118 but we have been with our kids as well an had a great time. Staff is always smiling and greeting. Upon arrival Fernanda made the check in a breeze. Quick and simple in order to get us into our room so we can start our vacation. Our room was great. Hotel did awesome recent renovations and we enjoyed the new d\u00e9cor. We grabbed a corona and a dos xx from the mini bar and headed down to the cevicheria. We enjoyed some ceviche while looking at the waves crashing on the beach. The grounds are impeccable. Honestly the pictures you find online are beautiful but do not do it justice. The restaurants are all good with plenty of options. Our favorites were Kalmia for breakfast Kambu for lunch and el Mexicano for dinner. Kambu Chef Josue Baas and Pedro are Truly amazing. I ca nt say enough nice things about these guys. Always felt at home with them. All of the bartenders and pool entertainment staff were always happy and kept the crowd going. There was never an issue with lounge chairs at the pool or at the beach. This was something I dreaded when staying at the other resorts where it seemed like people would get up at the crack of dawn put a towel on a chair and went back to their room. Not at Condesa no matter what time it was there was always a place available. May be due to the layout of the resort. Kids were not really an issue either. they seemed to have stayed in the kids section or in the provided day care. Nighttime was entertaining and fun. If you are looking for a MTV type dance hall you will not find it here. Nightly shows were in the Condesa Arena. Usually starts around 9 pm until around 10 or a little after. From there the lobby bar was our usual hangout. Live entertainment played crowd favorites where people sang along and danced. Edgar and his fellow bar tenders there made sure we never had an empty glass. the sushi corner sits close by and stays open late for some late night sushi. We also opted for a 4 hands couples massage at the Miluma Spa on the beach. It was a perfect addition to an already relaxing vacation. Fernanda and Fabrizio checked in with us through out our stay and was always asking if we needed anything and even caught us on the way out to say their goodbyes and invite us back. The only bad thing I can say about our experience at FA Condesa was having to leave. We will definitely be back again. Its good to know we have a home away from home there and do not have to worry about where we will be staying.", "offset": [1510, 1549], "date": "2018-11-26", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 31, "uid": "470b55dd-f89f-4938-84d2-7efd7d3a4fc9", "sentence": "A Great Experience. Let me start by saying that we had a wonderful trip and look forward to returning to the Fiesta Americana Condesa. When I do reviews I try to point out specifics that allow folks to determine whether a particular hotel resort will meet their needs. In this case the \u201c cons \u201d were not negatives that impacted our overall experience. Staff. Outstanding. The staff are the foundation of this resort. They were polite responsive and ALWAYS working. I noted some reviews mentioned staff could be stand offish. They were not intrusive but always helpful. This is how we like it. Did we occasionally have to wait a little for drinks around the pool or during peak times at restaurants yes. The wait times were no different from any other hotel in which we have stayed. House keeping did a great job cleaning wait staff were excellent front desk was very responsive. We had an issue with the battery for the safe in our room and maintenance came right away. We could not have asked for more. Tipping awkward. Some reviews noted feeling as though they were hounded for tips. Our experience was the opposite. Although we did not want to carry all day to tip we did want to recognize the excellent service. There really was no clear way to tip. We tried leaving for housekeeping each day no one picked it up so we left it the final day. We did not see folks tipping so perhaps this was not expected. Just an observation. Pool beach Wonderful. There were two large pools with distinct areas for different types of activities. The pool design made the area seem manageable during the busy holiday week we visited. Note. pool chairs do go quickly typically full by mid morning during our stay. There were additional chairs at the beach with some typically open. The beach and water were beautiful. On our last visit to the area we stayed in the Riviera Maya area. there was so much seaweed we could n\u2019t swim. The surf was on the rougher side during our visit but we are used to the Atlantic Ocean surf so this was no big deal. It might be something to consider with small children. Food Good Lord there was a lot of it. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. I think food often is one of the most disappointing aspects of all inclusive resorts. Overall I would rate it as good. some things were excellent ceviches fish tacos breakfast options while others were ok whole fried fish smoothies burgers. We rarely waited to be seated at restaurants and there were many options for quick bites really liked the Healthy Menu at the grill near the pool. The veggie wrap was delicious. The kids had crepes at the churo crepe and ice cream station every day. I stopped by the coffee place in the gift shop for cappuccino as the coffee in the restaurants was so so. We had good meals at Khombu and La Mexicana. We did eat at the steak house. grilled octopus appetizer and flank steak were the highlights but ca n\u2019t say that it was worth getting in line from 2 3 PM to get a reservation for the next day. We did not eat at the Italian restaurant or sushi station but did try the buffet theme the night when we were there was Asian food. The offerings were vast. some good items. Honestly if you ca n\u2019t find something to eat that you like at this resort I am not sure any resort will meet your needs. Beverages were plentiful and reasonably good. We did n\u2019t feel the need to buy top shelf alternatives but they were available. Accommodations This was probably the least impressive part of the resort. We had two rooms for our family of four. The rooms were sizable but as has been pointed out by others the bathroom setup was awkward. It was located right at the front of the room and essentially a partially glassed in enclosure. You look right in to the sink and toilet area when you enter the room. Also when one need to use the bathroom at night the lights are highly visible. The shower is awesomeThe room has a fridge that was stocked with water soda and beer daily nice. The furniture was a bit worn but the beds were comfortable 6 pillows per bed awesome. Our room had a faux balcony but it was nice to be able to open the door to get fresh air. The big issue there was the very noisy air conditioner for the hotel next door below our room. The rooms were a bit musty. The air worked well in our room but not as well in the kids \u2019 room they did n\u2019t say anything about it until we left otherwise we would have called maintenance. Every time the air conditioner started there was a rattling thud that shook our room and activated the motion sensor light in the closet kind of funny not too disruptive. Grounds and facilities There were multiple places to sit relax and enjoy the breeze. The fitness center was a small and there was a wait in the morning to use the cardio equipment. The staff offered classes by the pool that seemed to be well attended eg Zumba pool beach volleyball. The hotel zone was walkable although we did n\u2019t walk around much. We felt very safe at the hotel. I appreciated the degree to which the kids could be independent at the resort they are tenagersFinal thoughts We truly enjoyed our visit. For an all inclusive Fiesta Americana Condesa is an excellent choice. One note do ask questions. Although we were given good information when we arrived it was difficult to remember everything and the paper information was limited. The clientele during our stay was international which we enjoyed and the staff were excellent. As a side note we took two excursions both great. We booked the Jungle tour speed boat and snorkel through the hotel. The kids had a blast and we could walk to the site. We also booked on line the 4 cenote Oasis Maya tour. A great experience. FYI you generally save money booking on line. We have now visited the area twice. Our last visit was to the Fairmont Mayakoba. Both the Fiesta Americana Condesa and the Fairmont are terrific hotels. When I asked the kids their preference they said they would prefer to go back to Fiesta Americana. For the value and overall experience I am inclined to agree.", "offset": [1119, 1215], "date": "2019-01-05", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "99be8c16-25c9-4555-9917-04ac1beff2d9", "sentence": "Very nice hotel with clean installations all throughout.

Cons No balcony really facing the beach unles you get a suite I think. We did n\u2019t have any balcony in our moon tower room so we got moved to sun tower which had a small balcony with 2 chairs but could n\u2019t see the ocean just pool view Pool. No pool area can you actually overlook the beach. The infinity pool you overlook to the large pool bar and the other side of the pool to the restaurant. It was always clean. Quiet pool upstairs and entertainment pool down a level. The swim up bar was popular and great service. We never had an issue getting a chair by the pol there are several chairs. There is a kids pool with pirate ship. Beach beautiful waters. Not much sea weed. It really depends on the weather. We had days without any and days with a little. We have stayed at 4 different resorts on the hotel zone and the beach is about the same. Restaurants good food. Italian steak restaurant Mexican and the main buffet. The pool side seafood also has great fish tacos for lunch. Unfortunately the main large restaurant kambu was closed for renovation. The other pool restaurant next to it was also closed for renovation. There was a sushi place in the main entrance that was good too. We had sushi making lessons one day. They had great on the go food as well. The GRILL by the pool served hot dogs speciality hamburgers guacamole and chips Fries onion rings wraps etc daily. They also had a casual Italian place with wood fire pizza by the pool. My kids loved itThere were daily specials by the pol jambalaya tacos pulled chicken. The had an ice cream shop and crepe store that was awesome. Big hit for our family. We had Carmel or Nutela crepes daily. They have a coffee shop you can get any speciality coffee as well inside the store. Entertainment awesome magic show. The fire throwing dancing show was neat to see. The Mexican dancers were neat as well. The rest we did n\u2019t attend. Daily entertainment was ok. All day they had music at the main pool dance lessons contests water and beach volleyball water aerobics etcWe also enjoyed the bracelet making dream catcher making and reflexology class. Spa hot tub sauna steam room all very tiny but had a good massage. Service is great. This is what sets them apart from other resorts. You can barely get seated by the pool before someone comes to ask for your drink order and if you wanted food by the pool. They are very sweet and always thanking you for being there.

We could not have been more pleased with this FA property. We joined the vacation club FAVC 5 years ago and have been to the FA Puerto Valarta property and FA Cancun Villas several times already and loved them both. The Condesa Cancun is now on our love listThe property is only about 20 minutes from the Cancun airport so it is a quick and convenient trip. Upon arrival we rode up a long escalator through a giant palapa. For the holiday season it was beautifully decorated with giants ornaments and pinatas. It was so welcoming and really put us in the mood for celebrating. We were immediately received by our wonderful concierge Javier who took us to be checked in. Javier tended to us all week and truly made our visit one to remember. He checked on us every day and was kind enough to make special arrangements to Xcaret for us. The property is larger than the other FA properties we had been too but did not feel so big that we lost that coziness and intimacy that we enjoy at Fiesta Americana. The food was excellent. We ate at the cevicheria every day enjoying the aquachiles ceviche and fish tacos which were all so fresh and well seasoned. They have a new healthy option stand by the pool. The hummus there was tasty and we had a few sandwiches that were on wraps or multigrain pieces of bread. The Asian option was our least favorite option for dinner it just seemed to miss the mark on flavor and offerings. We had a coconut curry chicken dinner and chicken stir fry and they both lacked robust flavor. However we had the Dragon shrimp which was fresh and flavorful for an appetizer. The food there was not terrible but was outshined by the flavors at the other restaurants on the property. There are three pool options at this property including a kids pool. Every day there were activities at the pool they have a kids club and music polside. We could not hear the music at the upper pool as there seemed to be no speakers up there. Not a big deal but it was something noticeable compared to the other properties we had been too. All in all we would definitely go back to visit and look forward to seeing everyone there. Keep a lot of pesos on hand. You will certainly need them to tip the very attentive staff. Thank you FA Condesa.", "offset": [1999, 2095], "date": "2019-12-23", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}]}
