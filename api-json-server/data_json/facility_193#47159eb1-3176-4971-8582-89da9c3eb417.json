Hotel is under renovation. This was disclosed so no problem. As it happens I ended up in a newly renovated room. Issues The rooms have work stations located at round tables. All of the plugs at the table in my original room were non functional. The kitchen table style chairs provided at the work stations are uncomfortable and far too low to permit me to type comfortably on my laptop. I am 5 10. The television in my room did not function turned on but nothing elseSomeone had clearly been in the room and moved out prior to my arrival. After the technician was unable to fix the plugs I too was moved to a new room. While there was a safe in my original room the new room did not have a safe. I was told by the front desk that safes had not yet been delivered installed on the 23rd or 24th floors. The phone in my room could not hold a charge for more than five minutes. The food at the hotel is mediocre and currently is being served in what appears to be a hallway on the 4th floor. Again the construction was disclosed but I did not expect to be having dinner in a hallway. The Club is fine but breakfast food options are atypically limited. It is very small and currently housed in what appears to be a hotel suite. Again presumably due to the construction.

Breakfast was comical with electrical circuits being overloaded and napkins running out in the lounge. What was scary was a guest commented how much BETTER organized than the previous day.

First the lobby is under construction so the review might not be fully accurate in a few months but most of the review will not change.

Huge hotel with a large pickup drop off zone multiple elevator banks and grand conference room facilities on the 2nd floor round up the place. The 2nd floor has 1 conference room temporarily being used as the reception desk. A bit awkward but whatevs. However due to renovation there is no real bar except a small pool bar area which is tiny has limited drink selection and closes early. No bueno. I got upgraded to a suite yay which is very spacious but still a bit dated. Furniture was comfortable enough but the room was not the best lit and the bathroom was typical Sheraton bland. However noise isolation was good and wifi worked without an issue.

My only complaint was that there was not a dresser in the room but that is just because I do not like living out of a suitcase. The bathroom was nice and clean. Overall decor was updated and modern. There were plenty of power outlets and the room is well lit. The elevator banks are set to divide the hotel into halves which helps when it is full.
