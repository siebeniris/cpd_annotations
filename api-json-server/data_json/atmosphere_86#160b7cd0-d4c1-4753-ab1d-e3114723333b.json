After 40 years of living I felt like a treat for myself and the woman who gave me life was in order. This short 3day vacay was my first RC experience as well as my first St Thomas visit. St Thomas is lovely. The weather was amazing. After a short 20 min. taxi ride from the airport we were greeted by welcoming smiles and rum punch. Aside from the unexpected baggage charge by the taxi driver we were off to a great start. Check in did not take long as my mom and I sat in comfy chairs sipping our drinks until the front desk associate finished with a guest. I was a little surprised that when she finished she did not come right over to greet us. Perhaps she did not notice us but another associate reminded her and we checked in. I was also surprised that we were not given an overview of activities. Perhaps it was because we were not staying long. I was asked what we planned to do first. My answer take the ferry to St Johns. That might have signaled that there was not a need to offer more options. We were shown the club house where we learned of the club house schedule and restaurants. I am glad I opted for club house access. The associates saved us the hassle of making our dinner reservations and the club house was a posh place to enjoy complimentary cocktails and light snacks between meals. The view from the Eugenia building was breathtaking. We were in E542. The room was nicely appointed. The bathroom was gorgeous always a deal breaker for me. It was actually the bathroom that won me over as I considered RC vs the Mariot Frenchmans Reef. The complimentary Aubrey products generously sprinkled throughout the bathroom were a nice treat. The shower head was average. As for the bed it was amazingly soft. We melted into it every evening and had a tough time leaving it in the morning. So what could have have made this a 5star 3day experience for me. Better food. The meals were pretty expensive which elevated my expectations. We dined at Bleuwater the first night. The meal was decent. I enjoyed the mac and cheese appetizer. My moms braised ribs were a bit fatty. I wish they had not run out of the grouper and wahoo as I had the mahi mahi which was not the best I have had but not horrible. The cocktails were nice and they surprised me with chocolates for my bday. I left with a smile. We also had dinner at Coconut Cove one night. it was decent as well. I hoped to have more Caribbean local dishes as options. Coming from a Jamaican household I suppose I have higher expectation in terms of flavor and spice. We visited the Lime Inn on St Johns now they had a nicely spiced snapper that I had almost fly to the VI just for a taste. My last day was spent around the pool another lovely vantage point and on the patio of my room having breakfast with my mom. Breakfast was tasty. I had the lobster quesadilla. My keys were deactivated a half hour before checkout time while I was at the pool. Luckily my mom was in the room. We extended our checkout time an hour and discovered that the phone was deactivated when we called for a golf cart ride to the lobby. Fortunately one of the housekeepers called for us. My only other issue is with the taxis. I am glad they are easy to get but the inconsistency of the fares bothered me a bit. Totally not RCs fault. For example we were charged 28 for two with 2 bags from the airport and 36 for two with 2 bags to the airport. I am not one to fuss especially when trying to catch a flight home so I paid the 36. Perhaps the bell hops can confirm the pricing for the guests before the trip. Overall I had an wonderful time at RC. I wanted a luxurious Caribbean treat to mark a milestone bday. The ambiance at RC delivered that. I missed out on the spa which I am confident would have added to the experience. Perhaps I will check it out next time.", "offset": [138, 223], "date": "2015-01-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "33813c5e-bd61-4263-82ee-be358ca1359e", "sentence": "Most gracious and welcoming staff anywhere.

As far as the wedding it was amazing. The wedding planners specifically justin chesney really know what they are doing. They handled everything to perfection. The wedding went off without a hitch and I keep hearing it was the most beautiful wedding anyone has ever seen. That being said the hotel STAFF needs some work. They were quite rude at times and Many people got charged VERY large amounts on their bills for things they did not purchase. It seemed very shady. My brothers wife had a necklace stolen from their room. My husband got a massage at the spa which was supposed to be a 50 min massage that was finished in 37 minutes and was the worst massage he has ever had. It needs to be said that we are extremely laid back and friendly people who always find the good in things but after awhile these annoyances get old. They tried to kick us out of our suite and put us in a new room and when I told them I needed time to get ready they told me we needed to be out bc they had someone else waiting to check into the room. I got a call 10 min later that they messed something up and they were keeping us in the suite. I guess the other guests checking in never existed. My husband and I agree that if we had not had our wedding there we would have actually not had that great of a vacation. But the fact that we were surrounded by friends and family for such a special event made it not terrible. I would not stay here again though. I have to reiterate though that the wedding planners were absolutely amazing. We originally had holly and she had to attend a family event so justin got assigned our wedding 3 months prior to the event. I was very worried about that but the transition was seamless and he is one of the most efficient people I have ever dealt with.

We had a group of 15 rooms and our room was the only one to have the A C ant issues. All the rooms open to the outside rather than an interior hallway which probably contributes to the bug A C issues we experienced. Although turndown service is included after the first two evenings we learned it is best to request the service otherwise you may not get it. The restaurants were great the swimming pool was lovely and the free activities gear were top notch eg snorkel paddle boards kayaks. My wife enjoyed the spa and treatment and the fitness room was also adequate. Although we had room issues the property really is very nice and the service staff were truly world class.

To further explain the frequency of my stays I am charged with planning several board meetings for which I am involved and a group stay of over 300 attendants for the organization in which I am the Chief Executive Oficer all of which are planned at your properties. Personally I stay at your properties over a dozen times per year. I was extremely excited about this surprise anniversary trip for my wife but had to quickly switch gears when learning about a medical emergency for my mother. I called the St Thomas resort and inquired how I could cancel postpone or get a credit for our resort stay. I was greeted with nothing but rudeness no sympathy and no options. Your staff roboticaly repeated your cancelation policy to me and also noted they needed a doctors note for my mothers potentially life threatening emergency. These are not things you should have to go through at times like this. Because family always comes first for me I was forced to keep my reservations despite my ability to make the trip and lose my money. The airline company was willing to not only give me a voucher for a future trip but willing to completely reimburse me. I expected more from you. Thankfully we have had a fortunate turn of events and will be able to make the trip. What should be an amazing trip has turned into a disappointment and I am no longer excited but frustrated. Because of my multiple positive experiences at your properties I hope my relationship with Ritz Carlton Mariot will not come to an end after this trip as I have planned. I hope you will see this note and recognize that it comes from a very valued customer and hope you will make things right. I would be happy to further discuss this to see how you can improve your customer service relations.

When we got here they put us in a beautiful room with the view of my dreams Freesia 348. The setting is stunningly beautiful. We spent most of our time laying on the beach. The noise from the pool reno was minimal. I can honestly say The Ritz has the finest staff of any hotel we have stayed at. Pastry Chef Bri and Chef McPherson cooked extraordinary meals. Waitresses Janele Sheba Carolyn Kervin And Clarisa were attentive and friendly. And hostess Thamires was delightful. Also beach crew Margarita Shalom and Charles took great care of us. And Melanie at Esenza went out of her to make our dinner special. One mention we did not sign up for Club Lounge Service 250 a day which was a good call for us. We do not drink and prefer smaller breakfasts so we came out ahead. We did not miss the pool with the beautiful setting and the great staff. We will return.

This review is a little belated from February 2016 which was not a choice in the date options. We had a great family vacation here with two kids ages 4 and 6 at the time. Highlights for the kids were the pool the Ambassadors of the Environment we did not do any of the excursions but they do free classes the space is really nice and they feed the iguanas on the property and the fact that water sports are included in the resort fee. We took full advantage of kayaks paddle boards snorkeling. The resort itself is nice the room was spacious with a nice view of the ocean. We stuck to the pool at the resort but there is another one near the residences. Although the water is beautiful the beach is probably the biggest con. it is rocky very small and was covered with beach chairs. The beach in front of the residences seemed larger and nicer but we did not want to make the walk there when we were there you had to walk through a not very clean service area to get to the residences area and restaurant. and you are paying for the service and convenience of being at the resort. We did a day trip to St John which is worthwhile to experience more beautiful beaches. One caution for most of our time the resort was very quiet but the last day or so was getting into school winter vacation weeks. The pool became very crowded and if you were not there early to reserve a spot you were not going to get one. This year we did the Ritz Carlton Reserve at Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico and other than the water sports Ambassadors of the Environment the water was too rough in PR while we were there and sports and program were an extra cost other than snorkeling gear. we felt that Dorado Beach surpassed this property in pretty much every way.

This hotel is not ready to reopen. Welcome Home. That is what we are used to hearing when we check in at a Ritz Property. We book club level because they know I want unsweet ice tea my wife has a gluten sensitivity and they make sure to accommodate her without asking. My grandsons adore the Clubs chocolate chip cookies. We have stayed at many Ritz properties and the service is always a level above any competitor. The Ritz Carlton St Thomas however is not up to any civilized standard for a hotel let alone a Ritz property. This particular property was a victim over 2 years ago of Hurricane Irma and Maria. The property has been closed until recently to go through a 100 M renovation. When we heard they were re opening we booked a trip for us our kids and grandkids as a Christmas present to the family. We always stay on club level so we booked club level rooms. We arrived at the hotel on Tuesday Dec 3rd only to discover that club level is not ready and will not be open for month or more. We were very disappointed because club level is where we congregate as a family on our trips together. The Ritz should have notified us in advance so that we could have made other plans if desired. They did not do so. We also had to wait in line for nearly 20 minutes to check in because they had only 1 person handling check in. They then check us in and send us to our rooms on the 5th floor of E building. They had not bothered to tell us that the elevators in the building did not work. Climbing the hill from the beach to the rooms and then having to climb 5 flights of stairs in addition is not easy for an old fat guy like me. I called to talk to a manager and waited nearly an hour for a call back before I decided to go address my concerns in person. When I arrived at the lobby I found the elevators were not working there either. In fact we have had trouble walking the sidewalks around the resort because they are re tiling portions of them. Construction is going on all over the property and they expect their guests to tolerate the noise. They have hired someone to play music all day long at the old pool and beach to try to cover up the noise but they have to keep the volume too high for some of the guests comfort to accomplish that feat. We have found that the level of service at this Ritz property is not up to Ritz standards not even close. Ritz keeps a comprehensive database on their customers so they know how to attend to them. The concept they push is that if you have to ask it is not service. Currently at this property you have to ask multiple times. Our safe did not work. It had a battery issue. We called Wednesday morning asking they replace the battery. Nothing happened. We called Wednesday evening asking they replace the battery. 30 minutes later someone shows up and then has to leave to get a battery because he did not bring one even though we reported the error. At the same time they elected to fix a light in our hallway that was broken. When we returned from dinner the light was working and hanging from the ceiling. Nice touch. Today we left at 730 am to go on an all day boat charter. We returned this evening to find that neither our room nor our kids room had been cleaned. I called the concierge to get housekeeping but instead had the phone answered by in room dining. I ended up talking to the in room dining manager and he was simply no help. I called and requested to speak to a manager and then got fed up and walked to the lobby to see him in person. He was in a meeting. He did come to my room shortly afterwards and once again promised to make things right. I told him that I was not looking for any special treatment. I simply wanted the service I expect from a Ritz property. I explained that thus far I have received much better service at many Mariot Courtyards. I am not looking for freebies I am not looking for discounts I do not mind paying for service. that is why I have been a Ritz customer for years. However at this property that service is not remotely close to what we have become accustomed to at Ritz Properties. The staff is poorly trained. They do not have enough personnel working in some roles to handle guest volumes. The property is under construction so key facilities such as the elevators are not working. Ritz Carlton should have never opened this property in the condition it is in and they should have been much more extensive in the training of their staff. I can site a myriad of small examples as well but suffice it to say this property is not close to Ritz standards and every guest we have talked with agrees. They will lose business at this property and potentially lose long term Ritz customers like myself thanks to this experience. I plan these Christmas trips for my family and try to make them special. This year is a disappointment thanks to a sub standard hotel. Ritz promotes their properties by asking Let us stay with you.

I am currently staying at the Ritz St Thomas with my husband and two children. This is our fifth visit to this Ritz Carlton and we are loyal to the brand. We have stayed in many other Ritz Carlton locations over the past 20 years. Our last visit to this location was several years ago with about 12 family members for our annual \u201c family trip \u201d which is why we chose the Club Floor then and chose it for this trip as well. Regarding the staff they are extremely accommodating and always willing to help. Everyone is very pleasant and will go out of their way to assist with any request. Miss Olivia in Guest Relations has been particularly helpful. She communicated with me before our arrival and has stayed in touch during our stay to make sure everything was to our liking. She went out of her way to make a very special Valentine \u2019s for our daughter and niece. She is terrific. My only disappointment with the hotel is the Club Level amenities. The club staff is terrific \u2026 very friendly and very hard working. Breakfast is very good. The staff tries to keep everything well stocked. Breakfast food choices in The Club are good not excellent just good. When we stayed here with a group of 12 several years ago the breakfast was very abundant \u2026. Large warmers of scrambled egg piles of crispy bacon assorted baked goods delicious fruit. Everything looked full and abundant. The display was beautiful. Now the breakfast is good \u2026 They have a chef making omelettes but because there is only one person at that job if you are here with a family you must wait quite a while for all of the omelettes to be made so it \u2019s pretty difficult to all eat at one time or close together. The selections in the 5 PM to 8 PM and 8 PM to 10 PM hours are very meager. I have been to many Ritz Carlton Clubs before and this is definitely nothing like what I \u2019ve seen at the other clubs. This is in no way reflective of the wonderful staff in the Club they are doing the best they can with what they \u2019ve got to work with. In other clubs the presentations are all full and appetizing \u2026 They never look picked over. In the other clubs the famous Ritz Carlton cookies are beautifully displayed and all the different varieties are always available \u2026 chocolate chip oatmeal peanut butter sugar. In this club sometimes they have one or two varieties of cookies available in a glass jar. They clearly put a lot of money into the renovation of this club but it looks like they \u2019re putting very little into the food presentations of the club once breakfast is done. The dessert selection is fair but nothing special. Again it \u2019s never abundant or very appetizing looking. On Valentine \u2019s Day there were heart shaped cookies and some brownies along with chocolate covered strawberries which were gone very early in the evening and never replaced. If I had never experienced another Ritz Carlton Club before I would probably think this was OK but not worth the money. But because I have experienced so many different clubs \u2026 Naples Beach Resort Naples Golf Resort South Beach Key Biscayne New York City etc. I can see the downgrade in the quality and quantity of food offerings. The Ritz Carlton Naples Beach resort has a spectacular Club. I \u2019m not sure why such a down grade has occurred \u2026 If it has anything to do with the Ritz Carlton being acquired by Mariot but I can definitely say the Club is just not worth it in its current state. It \u2019s turned me off somewhat to Ritz Carlton overall because in the past it seems like they were concerned about giving the guest an exceptional experience and now they are just skating by with the bare minimum. Again this is not reflective of the staff in anyway this just pertains to the food and beverage presentations in the Club.
