Crap view of AC units cramped compared to a Mariot. Smelled like my UGA dorm room. And lacks in elevator capacity. No service elevator so you are always riding with cleaning equipment. Very poor property for the price. At 260 you are getting into theRitz Carlton rates. Should have stayed across the street at the Holiday Inn or called the Mariot direct. Not enough parking spaces where one must use the valet to see their cheesy hand out. I expected more from the famous Hilton. Two bad booking experiance in a row.
