Yes the television is ancient but who cares. The grounds are stunning and everything is so clean. The maintenance of this property is outstanding. Breakfast in The Tiffin Room was lovely. The buffet was of a high quality the staff helpful and charming. I celebrated my birthday there and Ancy our butler was just gorgeous. She made me a card and presented me with a birthday cake.

We stayed at Raffles before Christmas in 2016 and had a wonderful time. The service stood out as perhaps the best we have ever experienced. Friendly staff and nothing was too much trouble. Our butler Dusty saw to any and every request with a smile and efficiency. The hotel has grace and elegance and has been very well maintained. It would benefit from some updating particularly in terms of technology and some of the decor in the rooms but that will be addressed by a renovation programme starting next year. In the meantime it just adds to the sense of history that surrounds this place. Breakfast in the Tiffin Room was fabulous as was high tea in the same location definitely worth it even if not staying at Raffles although dinner in the Long Bar Steakhouse was overpriced and disappointing. The rooftop pool was a haven in the city and quiet while we were there. The gym was compact but adequate and barely used as far as we could see.

It has truly been our home in Singapore. We look forward to our visits so much. The service this time was just a tad off its usual excellent best. No welcome drink forgotten wake up call do not worry I woke a bar attendant at the pool whose manner was patronising and who did not seem to have the customary service oriented Raffles ethic. But there are lots of positives. The butlers and front of house staff are warm thoughtful and friendly. The amenity in the Palm Court suite was as usual wonderful and redolent of all the things that make Raffles a unique experience. The breakfast was as always a lovely start to the day. The magic of sitting out of the terrace in a Singapore night was just the same. We felt very melancholy when we left this is likely to be our last visit to Raffles as we know it given the substantial renovation. I have read about the careful and sensitive restoration programme on your website and gleaned what I could from the staff. This is probably a vain plea as your plans will be well advanced and I am probably preaching to the converted but PLEASE remember what makes Raffles great and sets it apart. We are loyal to Raffles and regard it as a unique home away from home precisely because it has an indelible connection to the past. Every time we settle into our suite or walk up the grand staircase or order a drink in the bar we feel as if we are walking in the shoes of Noel Coward Somerset Maugham Ernest Hemingway Rudyard Kipling. The wall mounted service buttons and metal door keys in their little leather pouches are part of the authenticity of the experience the fact that we can experience more modern equipment and amenity elsewhere is not a minus it is precisely what keeps us coming back. Raffles is an oasis an opportunity to retreat from the rest of the world a place where time stands still. The little Raffles stories that adorn our pillow after turndown resonate because we can picture Raffles in its glorious and not so glorious times past we feel like we are part of an unbroken continuum of travellers stretching back 130 years. We would be heartbroken if Raffles maintains its heritage connection in form but not in substance there are plenty of luxury hotels to stay in when we come to Singapore but only one Raffles.", "offset": [740, 871], "date": "2017-01-24 04:24:04", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "6a59b067-9b50-4ee4-824d-8cc56436bf09", "sentence": "Most beautiful building in Singapore.

Hotel has been beautifully refurbished but service is severely lacking in areas. I stayed here for 1 night in a State Room Suite to celebrate my birthday with my husband and 2 year old son. I generally had a pleasant stay and my suite was beautifully decorated spacious and quiet. To start off with the positives we were picked up on time by the Raffles limousine and brought to the hotel where we were greeted by one of the iconic Raffles Hotel Sikh doormen who was warm and welcoming and we also had a pleasant chat with him about his grandchildren before we left. After checking in at the desk in the lobby area our friendly butler Stanley showed us around our suite. A bowl of fruits and chocolates were given to us in our suite together with welcome Singapore Slings. We ordered some room service lunch and the butlers were kind enough to let us have afternoon tea in our suite instead of the Grand Lobby as I did not think my 2 year old son would be able to sit for long down there. We also had room service dinner and then breakfast in the Tiffin Room the next day. We used the hotel pool and gym the pool staff were friendly and attentive and the gym had a decent amount of equipment. The hotel has been beautifully refurbished but has managed to keep it is traditional charm together with modern amenities. On checkout the lady that checked us out was wonderfully polite friendly and hospitable mannerisms that all the staff in Raffles Hotel should strive to achieve. Unfortunately for a hotel that is renowned for it is legendary service this area has been somewhat lacking since it reopened. Firstly before we were due to stay my husband emailed Raffles hotel with some enquiries. However after 3 days without a reply only after forwarding the email again and cing the manager did he finally receive a reply. On arrival in our suite we waited for almost an hour for our one small bag to be brought to our room and had to chase them up about it. My husband had arranged with the butlers for a small birthday cake to be placed in our suite on arrival however this was not the case and he also had to chase them up about this. We requested for a bed rail to be placed on one of the beds so that our toddler would not fall out however Stanley said that they had not attached the bed rail because it is height is level with the top of the mattress and therefore would not prevent falls so he said that during turn down service he would arrange for cushions to be placed on the floor around the bed. If a bed rail makes no difference then I can not understand why they agreed in advance to attach one in the first place. Also no cushions were placed on the floor during turn down service and yet again we had to chase up the butlers about this. When I spoke to the butler on the phone regarding the cushions I also requested for some body lotion as there was none in the room so they said they would bring some when they brought the cushions. After waiting for more than half an hour the cushions turned up but no body lotion. They did not even bother to inform me that they had run out until my toddler accidentally called for a butler to come to the suite using the ipad in the room. Also is not body lotion one of the basic amenities you expect to find in a 5 star hotel room. In regards to turn down service our amenities were restocked and plates from the tables were cleared but they did not even bother to wipe the tables or clear the crumbs which is the least you would expect. The breakfast in the Tiffin Room was nice with a good selection of fruits pastries cold cuts etc. and you get to choose 1 main dish from the menu. I ordered the Crab Cakes as stated on the menu but what I got was one measly little crab cake note the singular. For 75 per adult you would at least expect more than one crab cake and also I would not even touch the raspberries or blueberries in the buffet area as they are not washed and are covered in dirt. A few of the staff in the Tiffin Room were quite friendly and also interacted with our son but I have to say that Raffles Hotel does not seem to be very child friendly because not once were we offered child plates or cutlery to use in the restaurant or during in suite dining. it is the little things that should count in a world class hotel like Raffles. Speaking of in suite dining my husband was given mayonnaise that had already expired and the price of his club sandwich on the bill was more than stated on the menu. You might think that I am nitpicking but for more than 1000 a night you would expect impeccable service from a hotel of this prestige.", "offset": [1231, 1353], "date": "2019-10-25 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "268176f8-cc15-4139-81b3-d40c02170688", "sentence": "Alter renovation great.", "offset": [0, 23], "date": "2019-12-14 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "fad751da-0cc1-41e7-85c5-6c53eee5f92c", "sentence": "Wonderful refurbishment maintain the elegant and magnificent hotel while improving the fasilities for the comfort of the Hotel Guess.", "offset": [0, 133], "date": "2019-12-22 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "70f352e4-d27d-4224-8bee-2d69603a5ab6", "sentence": "Astonishing renovation of this palace offering excellent Butler services.", "offset": [0, 73], "date": "2019-12-28 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "a77509c2-26a0-4681-a237-5eb290dca905", "sentence": "Great Hotel for a short stay in Singapore.

The iconic Raffles is it worth staying there. Quite honestly Yes it is. I do have a couple of improvements to share but let us start with where it excels. The refurbishment is first class. the craftsmen who laid those marble floors so perfectly the paintwork so precise the detail and care that the team put into the refurbishment is beyond words amazing. We stayed for two nights and wished we had stayed longer. Just to sit and take in the architecture the history. it was a wrench to leave. you are greeted with welcome home and it is not difficult to imagine why various celebrities of years past treated it as home. The highlights. the Best breakfast in the world. I have travelled for 30 years and the breakfast in the Tiffin Room was imaginative beautifully presented and all the staff were attentive. It was The Best. We also had an indian meal in the Tiffin Room the night before and omg it was Fantastic. Food service ambience first class. We had a perfect heritage tour with Rosle enchanting fun a definite must for residents. Raffles is steeped in history and Rosle delivered the whole tour keeping our full attention it was fascinating. If you are heading to Raffles do take the time to build this into your schedule. Our other highlight was of course learning how the Singapore Sling is made in the Long Bar. Hats off to the wonderful cocktail genuises that make these cocktails they clearly enjoy their jobs and it shows. The ambience is wonderful you find yourself thinking wow I am in the Long Bar it is one of lifes memorable moments. From there we moved to the residents only Writers Bar. Small and beautiful it has a completely different charm excellent staff and again the refurbishment team got this room just right. It stands on its own and if we had stayed longer I had have been happy to have spent another evening in there. Rooms. yes full of technology but not terribly difficult to get to grips with. The bathroom was top class that marble floor and art deco lighting. You can stream music from your mobile through the TV and it plays in the bathroom as well. The rooms have a small sitting room area bedroom and bathroom designed with care and excellence. Having oohed and ahed about Raffles I did have to knock 1 star off. This is primarily because the afternoon tea is well below par. it is a big tourist attraction in the Grand Lobby and being an afternoon teas of the world snob it failed to deliver. it is also very expensive on a par with 5 star London hotels. Main faults are lack of staff a major lack of staff. so they were continually distracted with new arrivals for tea than seeing if existing patrons needed anything. Teabags instead of loose tea I mean really who thought that was a good idea with a 5 star afternoon tea. The cakes were unimaginative and minimal in number the plates looked pretty empty somehow a bit of meringue with a couple of raspberries in between is far from imaginative. I would recommend that Raffles sends a representative to the Savoy in London to learn how a first class tea is given and totally re thinks what it does. I did make my thoughts know to Rosle Duty Manager and he was very receptive to my suggestions and I felt listened to. However as it stands without change I have to say that Raffles is relying on it is name and providing a poor quality tea. Fingers crossed that they up their game and make changes that will bring it up to the Savoys quality of afternoon tea. Two other observations that I would make are that we arrived at the lifts with two staff waiting for the lift. They got in first and we waited for the lift to return down. I am not sure this should happen in a 5 star hotel. Also the lady who came in to clean the ladies toilet in the public area came in with a packet of biscuits under her arm eating biscuits. I am not criticising her need to have a munch but again image is everything and it was not becoming of a 5 star hotel. These are small things apart from the tea which irked me to pay for sorted easily. We left Raffles with a big hope that we will return. Two nights was not enough it truly is an amazing place refurbished to perfection and with staff who care and love their jobs. Thank you everyone for making our stay so wonderful you are truly legends and we truly hope that we will be back.", "offset": [1637, 1767], "date": "2020-02-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "d54436b0-ec3d-41b3-a407-2643a1275ac8", "sentence": "Live like royalty.
