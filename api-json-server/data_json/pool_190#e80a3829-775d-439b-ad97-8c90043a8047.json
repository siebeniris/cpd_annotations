The hotel itself let me down. First thing that I did not like but looked past because of the location was there is no refrigerator in the room. Like I said this was mainly a location thing. Upon arrival valet said the parking cost would be for the stay for us it was a weekend but when we went down to get the car it turns out it is 17 a day. Not a big deal but that is not want we were told upon arrival. I called down to have a our car brought around and the front desk said they would not tell the valet to get the car that we would just have to go down and get it and there is a 10 15 minute wait. And I responded with that is why I am calling and was told just to come down and wait. did not rub me the right way. Called to ask if we could have an additional roll of toilet paper someone brought us some but reminded us that housekeeping would not clean the room if the do not disturb sign was out we just wanted toilet paper. Not sure if he was trying to be smart or what. The door stop was broke and the screw was laying on the floor next to it the swinging mirror hinge was broke and could not be used the roof top pool as on the seventh floor and had no sunshine after 4 pm the pool also did not have enough seating and no lightsdid not close until 10. there were about 30 people around the pool and even those folks did not have seating.

Housekeeping covered many many jobs that night and still gave us the attention we needed. another blanket and pillow. The valet well those poor boys ran their rears off that weekend. Garage under construction so they were placing cars ALL over the block. There were many many times I would go outside and 1 or 5 would run by me to get a guests car. Bellman were courteous and warm and smiling. Even saw the general manager helping out and picking up trash. No job to small for any of the employees.

Mrs C and I recently traveled to KC for a getaway weekend. We wanted a nice hotel that had an outdoor pool and selected the Crowne Plaza Downtown. We were not disappointed. The outdoor pool is on the 7th floor of the hotel it allows full sun from the east and south perfect for mornings and afternoons. It has a deep end 8 feet which is perfect for a Ron Burgundy cannonball. The high rise part of the hotel blocks the sun in the late afternoons and is a perfect spot to relax in the evenings without the brutal summer sun beating down on you. For being so close to the downtown business area we were surprised at how quiet everything was on Monday Tuesday. Not too much noise almost no traffic whatsoever. This hotel is located to the south and west of the main downtown business area. it is far enough away that you miss the daily rush. Three logistical items that we LOVED 1. Access to the Power Light district. you are walking down the hill two blocks and you are in the middle of the action. The PL district has a ton of fun bars restaurants. Access to the PL is incredible. 2. Access to Cosentinos Market. there is a tremendous full service market and grocery store within one block of the hotel. We stocked up on beverages snacks etc. at this store. They have hot and cold buffets going in the morning. sausages bacon eggs hashbrowns along with a full fruit line as well. We loved walking down to the market and returning to our room with our food in the morning. They sell alcohol at this location which was huge plus for us beer craft beer wine liquor and champagne. 3. Access to I35. Within a couple of blocks you can access I35 heading south. We visited lifelong friends in Lenexa KS side suburb and getting into the freeway was so easy. Uber rides to from. the Plaza were 80 to 90. easy peasy. Highly recommend this hotel we will be returning for the reasons mentioned above.

Great city view. Many restaurants and bars were within walking distance. As for the hotel it was only ok. Our room the first night was extremely small we upgraded to a suite the next night which was much better. But in both rooms the shower was so enclosed. There was such a low ceiling over the bath shower area. I \u2019m only 5\u20195 and I felt like my head was almost to the top. Both rooms had a dirty air vent which was in the shower. Gross.
