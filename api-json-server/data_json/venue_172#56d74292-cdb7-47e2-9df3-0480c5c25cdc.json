No longer the hip place it once was it has to rely on drawing customers in with low prices or unique events. there is nothing wrong with this hotel but there is also nothing special about it. it is not on the strip and it is not cool enough to be worth staying so far off the strip.

I did not at all enjoy this hotel. First of all there is security every where. Going to the pool. Show ID and room key please. Going back to your hotel room. Better have your room key with you or the elevators do not work this is a bother when you are a big party and especially kids do not always carry keys. Also is this Fort Knox or what. I have a hard time enjoying myself when everybody looks over my shoulder all the time. Secondly the prices are insane. Small fruit bowl. 15 dollars. Cliff bar. 5 dollars. do not go to this hotel unles you are loaded and do not care about spending quite a lot of money on things that are usually very cheap. Thirdly They brand themselves on having best pools in Vegas 2015 and so forth. What they do not tell you is that three out of their four pools are 21 only. Our party consisted of adults but some were below 21. Too bad no hot tub and relaxation for us as all the nice relaxation amenities were in the 21 area. And the pool closes around 6 or 7 pm at night fall. Most hotel pools are open a lot later as people enjoy for example sitting in the hot tub with a cold beer late in the evening to relax. can not be done here. Fourthly Rules and rules and rules. You are required to sign a waiver stating drinks and food from the outside is not allowed on the rooms. This is insane as you are then forced to buy the insanely expensive items from the hotel. On the last day of our stay I wanted to go to the gym. Everything was fine I signed the guest list as was required why I wonder but the clerk would not let me in cause I was wearing flip flops I always work out in flip flops. Apparently closed shoes are required for my own safety. Please leave my own safety up to me and keep your paternalism for yourself. There is no health hazard in lifting weights in flip flops but they of course did not care. So I had to walk back to the room which took 10 minutes as the hotel is huge get my regular shoes that I did not wana get all sweaty and walk 10 minutes back. This cut into my workout time. Fifth Poor service. We asked if they have fridges in the rooms they do not but it could be bought for a 20 dollar charge a night. This is usually included in every single hotel I have stayed at. We are guests at their hotel not customers they should rip off every chance they get. Sixth. The internet was slow and websites hardly opened up despite them claiming it was high speed. I was supposed to have a business meeting over Skype which was impossible to get working. Seventh It was really far away from the strip a lot further than you would expect when it states close to the strip. It was at least a 20 minute walk and the shuttle buses only go until 5 pm. Too bad if you want to go later. All in all a bad experience especially since it is a fairly expensive hotel to stay at. Furthermore expect to be woken up early since you can easily hear people talking. yelling in the hallway.", "offset": [2435, 2524], "date": "2015-09-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "8a3d6b83-0d11-4300-80bf-4fb2c7be2f5d", "sentence": "Hard rock hotel was one of the worst places I have ever stayed. The hospitality is horrible. They gave us the wrong room at check in our shower was broken and our bathroom had a huge hair ball it. did not have a fridge in our room and were told to take items out of the mini bar in order to use that fridge. Once speaking with another rude staff member we had over 100 in mini bar charges added to our tab for removing items out of the fridge that were never used. We sat at one of their restaurants for over 20 min waiting to order food and had 3 waiters walk by us completely ignoring us. Needless to say we left very frustrated and without dinner. The worst part about this place is that you get charged a hidden resort fee of 28 day to utilize their amenities. This includes a spa that is outrageously expensive with no discount offers a rehab pool that was closed and a night club that you could only book for private events. Will NEVER go back their again. Definitely do not recommend this hotel for anyone that actually wants to have fun and enjoy their trip to las vegas. This hotel made sure to frustrate and ruin our trip.

I have previously traveled to Vegas and stayed at two casino hotels that unlike this one were on the Strip. Overall this is a good place to stay if you are seeing a show at one of the casino venues or just want to experience the rock n roll hotel and casino. it is not so good for visiting the Strip Fremont Street or downtown Las Vegas due to its distance from the Strip and the tourist oriented buses and monorail that run up and down the Strip. I will break it down below1 Check in check out. Long lines at check in as expected even though I was trying to do an early check in at noon as were many other people. I have seen this before at casino hotels it always takes forever as people dicker over types of rooms they want and it holds up the line. I had booked a lowest price available room through Expedia and fully expected to get some room with a view of the parking garage. Was told by the clerk that my room was not yet ready and they would text me and tried to get me to upgrade to a suite which I declined as for one person planning to be out of the room a lot of the time that is way too much space. I gave him the fish eye as all around me people were getting rooms then he suddenly without me tipping him came up with a room ready right now on the 14th 13th actually as they skip the number 13 floor in Paradise Tower that had 2 beds rather than the 1 king I requested. Cost was 20 dollars more a night. I felt a little like I had been played but as I was in a hurry and I figured an upper floor would at least have a view i went for it. Had a very nice view of the Stratosphere part of the Strip and a mountain see pictures. so I felt a little better. 2 Room. My room was on the non pool side of Paradise Tower. Unlike the rooms over the pool it did not have a balcony but did have floor to ceiling windows and a view. It was also extremely quiet at all times and there was zero noise from the bands playing all weekend down at the Rehab pool below on the other side. Rooms are done in dark colors which shows the dust more but mine was pretty clean. Carpet looked old but then again you are going to be tracking sand from the beach pool on it so why have a fancy one. Shower could have used a hand held attachment or at least some way to turn it on and set temp before you are under the water also the shower and bathroom door bang together unles you close one before opening the other. Beds were very clean and comfortable. Floor to ceiling windows. Did not get a fridge as it is extra cost. Did not touch any of the overpriced stuff for sale on the dresser or in the minibar as they charge you if it is touched and there is a 24 hour CVS across the street where you can buy cheap bottled water sun lotion snacks Cokes beer and even a suitcase to haul your souvenirs home really everything you need greatest CVS ever. My one complaint was that housekeeping on two occasions set the room thermostat to 35 degrees F with the fan on high while I was out of the room causing the room to reach a temperature more suitable for penguins than humans by the time I returned. Nobody should be setting a thermostat below 60 degrees it is just insane to make a room so cold and it wastes the hotels money. I had to take a hot shower to stay warm while I was waiting for the room temp to get back up to normal after I reset the AC3. Getting around it is a long walk to the Strip from this hotel and I do not recommend it especially after dark as the area starts to look seedy after sundown. Some people I met did walk it and came back with tales of almost getting jumped. I was also warned that the area just north of the hotel east of the Strip and between Flamingo and Desert Inn roads is not great. There is a free shuttle from the Hard Rock to the Fashion Show mall on the Strip but it runs only during the day between 10 am and 5 pm. So take a cab to the Strip or you can pay 2 bucks to take the 108 bus north on Swenson one street away behind the CVS to the convention center and walk down Desert Inn to the Strip at the Wyn you can then buy a pass at the ticket machine to take the Deuce or SDX buses up and down the Strip to Fremont Street Experience or downtown to the Mob Museum or whatever. When you are ready to come back the SDX will drop you on Paradise southbound where you can catch a 108 back to the Hard Rock you can use your SDX pass on the 108 if it has not expired. You can also take the 108 from and to the airport and save yourself money on cab fare as the airport is very close to the Hard Rock Hotel. 4 Venues and pools The fest was in the Joint large venue Vinyl small venue and Rehab pool. Apart from some overzealous security who were searching peoples bags like it was the TSA on day 1 before you could go into the Joint and creating a long line all of these provided a good concert experience. The search seems to be not so much about security they are after all letting people wander around the casino un searched as it is about not bringing outside alcohol or food into their venues. Somehow this was straightened out or else they realized Psycho LV people are a peaceful bunch because by end of day 1 they were moving the lines faster and by day 3 it was like lightning. The less you try to take in the better. Also if you want to sit down in the Joint in the upper balcony the Loft which is quite comfy do bring a jacket or flannel shirt because although it is 100 degrees out you will be right under the AC outlets for the room and it is freezing up there. As for the pool experience it was all right despite there being almost no place to sit or set down your swim towel cover up due to every square inch being full of giant beach couches for rent or cabanas that seemed to be reserved and likely cost a large amount of money. Also there was one security guard whose job apparently was to walk up and down the pool all night in a tshirt and shorts patrolling which made sense when there were lots of folks in the pool but less sense on the night that there were 3 people including me in the pool and none of us were misbehaving or even having a drink in our hands and he just kept circling and looking at us like he expected a problem. Meanwhile there were 100 people standing on the edge of the pool watching the band and probably more likely to act up than the 3 of us middle aged folks paddling around. After the fifth inspection by this guard within about 20 minutes I felt creeped out enough to get out of the pool and leave. 5 Food. Mr Luckys serves good diner food 247. Had a good burger there and also a gigantic banana split we are talking enough for 3 people had to be a half gallon of ice cream and I could not even find the banana. after the friendly waiter talked me out of my first choice as being too small for the money. You can also place a to go order at Mr Luckys to take up to your room. The hotel also has a couple coffee bars two fancy sit downs steak and Asian food a pizza parlor a foodie bar and Pink Taco Mexican food. I had a room service steak that was excellent and Pink Taco street tacos which were good. Interestingly the Hard Rock Cafe is NOT in the casino hotel but outside across the parking lot in a separate building6 Casino. I do not gamble but there is a lot of cool rock memorabilia and photography on display in the casino and throughout the whole ground floor with a good cross section of bands from different eras that interest different age groups. Also at night they have pretty lady acrobats swinging from trapezes over the casino area it is better than the Olympics. 7 Shopping There are a few shops in the building but I got the impression they were revamping a lot of the shopping area as much of it was closed off so the shopping at this casino was kind of meh especially for women they seemed to have several shops selling mens clothes. So if you want to shop you should take the free shuttle to the mall unles you are a guy. They do have an on site tattoo parlor. Overall I would stay there again if they did another fest or a show I wanted to see because you can not beat the convenience. Otherwise I would stay on the Strip but might drop by this place for a visit.", "offset": [250, 400], "date": "2016-08-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "351b38d2-77f0-4498-99ee-e32873a5b78b", "sentence": "We went to The Joint I think that is the name music venue.

Everything was heavily overpriced and imposible to get lowcost food. But that is typical Las Vegas. the pool was good but the cabana cost a lot of money. We did nt rent it.

The only good thing about this hotel was the amazing valet parkers sad to say. It is obvious they have not put a penny into this place AND I stayed at the supposedly newer suites in the Hard Rock Suites tower. From the faded and non working buttons on the phones to the constant creaking and banging of the glass windows and air conditioning vents to the not giving a sht attitude of the concierge front desk and non existent management there is nothing positive to say about this hotel aside from the great doormen valets. My electric scooter broke on the second day and after asking concierge if I could rent one she organized one for me for 45 day good deal but none of the Ubers or Lyfts or taxis and yes I paid extra when ordering the largest ones possible would put it in their vans so I never got to use it. As a result I asked concierge to borrow one and she told me I was not allowed to bring it out of the hotel or casino. Being handicapped this would mean I could go nowhere. One of the fabulous valets allowed me to take it so I could go to the conference I was there for and also meet up with some friends who flew in from out of town to be with me. Also when I called Yellow Scooters from whom the scooter was rented they told me they had foldable travel scooters that I could have rented. it was too late at that point and I as very disappointed the concierge did not tell me this even though I told her I was returning it early since I could not take it anywherethere was nothing positive about this hotel it is off the strip and costs a fortune to get to the strip with uber and Lyft travel and I sure hope Richard Branson fires everyone except the doormen and valets and turns this place around. There is no coffee machine in suites m if you ship something to yourself they will charge you a hefty fee to receive it and will not deliver it to you either. there are too many other amazing hotels for you to even consider this place. I would not even stay there if the rooms were fre. I am hoping Mr Branson does his usual magic but imagine he can only do the if he tears the place down and rehires and trains staff and only keeps valet and doormen as I have said many times. Also pools close at 5 pm and they will nickel and dine your or everything. I have stayed at four other hotels in Vegas and this was the worst.
