I am almost at the end of a 14night stay and have loved this hotelWhat I have liked the location right near Times Square and the theatre district and the subway. the view of the Empire State Building and Freedom Tower and river from my room on the 40th floor the comfortable bed and pillows and good quality bed linen although I have bashed my shins on the wooden bed corners several times. the well appointed kitchenette and bathroom felt like a NY studio apartment windows that open so you can have fresh air and turn off the aircon desk with good light good in room safe iron and ironing board the friendly and helpful staff ask them anything and they will try and help although the counter staff were more helpful than the concierge the business area where you can print out your tickets and boarding passes complimentary breakfasts cereal bagels yoghurt waffles or pancakes ham and egg wraps tea coffee juice fruit complimentary week night evening receptions with decent snacks and beer and wine and soft drinks complimentary coffee and tea all day in the foyer laundry and gym in the basement option to trade daily room servicing for credit or hotel points free wi fi and cable internet use the cable if you need a reliable connection as the wi fi does drop in and out baggage storage before checkin and after checkout. Well you probably get the idea and the price was cheaper than other NY hotels I have stayed in with far fewer amenitiesHeres a few tips1. The laundry washers and dryers are 2 each in quarters you can get change from reception and washing liquid for 3 from the small store in the foyer. The wash cycle was 32 minutes so you can combine it nicely with the evening reception if you time it right or with a visit to the gym. My clothes needed 2 drying cycles so make sure you have enough change2. To avoid the breakfast crowds I went early and took it back to my room for later the microwave and refrig. came in handy here and I took my own travel mug3. The kitchen is well appointed but I used some extra plastic containers for the microwave and also some ziplock bags to help keep food fresh4. There are ice trays in the freezer but you need to fill them5. There is a good supermarket Brooklyn Fair in W37 St between 9 and 10 and a good 24hour diner just north of the corner of W39 and 8th on the eastern side and a liquor store on 39th near the corner of 9th. There are lots of restaurants in the area that do takeout and you can reheat in your room or cook your own as the kitchen has full cooking utensils and pots6. The weekly Metrocard is good value nothing to do with the hotel but a key part of my trip as it means you can get the wrong train and not lose out and you do not have to worry about buying tickets7. My shower took several minutes to warm up which was a bit disconcerting for someone from a location with water restrictions it hurt to see that water being wasted but I did not work out another way. In the end I just turned it on and did something else until it was hot8. I was warned about the elevator delays but timed my activities outside of peaks and had no problems. This has been the perfect base for my NYC trip. I am sorry to leave and will definitely stay here again.", "offset": [413, 1347], "date": "2015-04-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9f0b9493-1d7f-4c2e-8d84-fd8e60320010", "sentence": "An enjoyable stay At the Element Times square. This is the Element Times square the busiest area in NYC for tourists and business man so of course the hotel is very busy and there are lots of people. Customers in this hotel range from tourists to family to business men or retired people. On check in i was told there was no special check in for SPG platinum so i had to queue a very long queue. There was only one agent checking in and 2 others behind the desk but they were not proactive enough to help ease the queue. I was extremely surprised i must say. So first impression not so good and it is usually the one that matter the most. Despite this mistake the Staff are super friendly and charming. The hotel is clean nice fresh green and grey colour. Nice cosy lobby and nice lounge for complimentary breakfast and evening hors d oeuvres and free wine and beers. Quiete enjoyable actually but not as chic and refined as a sheraton club lounge. More low key. Again very helpful staff charming people4 complimentary computers in the lobby as well. Rom is very nice some of them with a kitchen very clean but bathroom is so tiny. However the shower is a decent size. The view from the 40 th floor is spectacular. There is a private terase. There are not enough control of who comes and go in the hotel area including breakfast 40 th floor tears free coffee etc the result is that you see some bag packers who obviously are not staying in the hotel coming inside for free food or coffee or to go up to look at the view. This is a serious security issue who needs to be addressed before something happens. Anyone can go up the lifts. I had a very pleasant stay and found the hotel rather charming and a good value because you save a lot of money with free breakfast wine snacks coffee gym wifi its all inclusive at the element time square.", "offset": [1634, 1839], "date": "2015-04-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "54479e3a-30e2-4595-8ed3-16185927c836", "sentence": "Pretty good hotel Received excellent service.

That was pretty noisy. I also had issues with the water on one morning but my problem was no cold waterOn balance if you can get it for a good price then the location and the comfy bed are worth it but be prepared to wrangle for a table at breakfast.

We stayed at Element from the the 9th until the 16th of August 2017. We are a family of 4 the kids are 15 11 years old. I had done a lot of research about the hotel and the location and read lots of reviews before we travelled. We arrived at about 730pm tired from a long haul flight the room was not quite ready but the lovely lady at reception gave us bottles of water while we waited the extra 10 minutes. The room was spotless big enough for us all two double beds. The kitchen facilities were very good every day it was replenished with tea coffee dish washer tablet. It was well equipped to throw together a meal which I like to do even when on holiday. The bathroom was terrific shower great all exactly as on the pictures on the website. The complimentary toiletries are good quality if you like to pack light. Compliments to housekeeping everything was really clean. Our view was of a building site but we did not mind because we often used the roof top terrace which had great views. The work on the building site started early but we were jet lagged and awake very early so any noise did not disturb us. Wifi was always good no issues even with kids using tablets. I had been dreading the lifts in the hotel because so many people on TripAdvisor had said they were problematic but we had no problems at all despite being in and out of the room multiple times though out the day. We were in room 609 between the lifts and we assumed that would mean noise from people. but it was quiet. So breakfast. We were normally early for breakfast it is busy but we always got a table. And you do have the option of using a tray from your room and taking away your brekie. There was plenty of choice a couple of types of muffins croissants danish type pastries maybe 5 different varieties of bagels peanut butter jams butter cream cheese fresh fruit cereals yogurt juices hot chocolate tea good choices and coffee. what is to complain about. You would definitely get set up for a day of sightseeing. The coffee and tea station is kept open all day with a large dispenser of iced water which was greatly appreciated when we came back each day from walking around the city. There is a happy hour from Monday to Thursday inclusive I think it was from 530 until 7. My kids loved it when we frequented happy hour it was run by Abdula the assistant general manager who is so friendly and helpful. There were complimentary snacks and drinks available for my fellow nerds. heres a list of what was on offer when we were there salads baby tomatoes baby carrots bread sticks salsa guacamole hummus tortilla chips olives cheese nuts red and white wine beer and sodas the kids had coke and sprite. It was lovely to relax for an hour there deciding what to do for the rest of the evening. The water in the kitchen in our room was drinkable so we refilled our bottles and chilled them in the fridge rather than buying lots of plastic bottles each day. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. I saw the gym in the basement but did not use it walking the city was enough exercise. The only negative was the air conditioning did not work well I complained about it and it was fixed and worked for a day but then died again. However I did not bother to mention it again so I guess that was our problem.

Do n\u2019t usually write reviews but after reading what I think are some unfair reviews about this place I thought I would give you my take on the Element. I stayed here for a week in January with two of my family the weather was record breaking cold but I wo n\u2019t blame the hotel for that. Check in and checkout was fast and our room was big clean comfortable and had all the amenities we needed including free wifi and the room was cleaned daily. The breakfast is free we ate in here every morning between 630 and 730 during that time there was plenty of space to sit but it did get busier the later it got there was a good selection of food and drink but if you are a fussy eater just head out to a restaurant of your choice pay your money and order exactly what you want problem solved. The gym was clean and had enough equipment for me to kid myself on that I was going to get lean again on at least two occasions I visited the roof top terrace once the views are nice but with the wind chill it felt like 25 so I did n\u2019t hang about. They have a happy hour Monday \u2013 Thursday which actually lasts an hour and a half and to be honest I do n\u2019t get any happier when the bar staff keep pouring me and my family drink and refuse to take my money this joy starts at 1730 they provide soft drinks beer wine and loads of snacks and to my amazement people were not fighting to get to the front of the queue and I do n\u2019t recall the queue being any bigger than 3 people in front of me. The Lifts. I read all the previous reviews so went expecting to wait a lot I used the lifts between four and ten times a day during our stay 3 or 4 times we did wait ten minutes or a little longer this usually happened in the morning between 8 9 the rest of the time the waiting time for a lift was ok. Staff Most of the staff were very friendly like most of the other hotels I \u2019ve stayed in but I would like to mention Bridget the FSD Iman and Elisa on the front desk you guys are a credit to the Element.
