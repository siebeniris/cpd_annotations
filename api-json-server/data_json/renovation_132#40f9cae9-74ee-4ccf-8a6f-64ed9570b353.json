The hotel and our room were clean but I was very disappointed with the check in and that there was no notification of the pool being closed for remodeling. We arrived a few hours earlier than the normal check in time and were given keys to the room. It was never mentioned that we were getting a double instead of the reserved king. Upon entering the room I called the front desk about changing and was told that because of the early check in we could only get a double. It would have been nice if they advised that at the time we were checking in because we would have waited for a king. Additionally I find it hard to believe that there was not a king room available at the time we did check in. Also at check in the staff never advised that the pool was closed for renovations. My husband handled the check in procedure so maybe he missed a sign but regardless the staff should have told him of the closure. It was unfortunate that we changed into swim suits and headed off to the pool only to find it closed. Other than this issue the hotel was average. We had little interaction with any of the staff other than Angelo in the lobby bar. He was very personable and engaging with a few good stories. Also the valet staff were very efficient except for the one who may have passed gas in the vehicle while retrieving. We got in to a horrible smell that dissipated by rolling down the windows and airing the vehicle out. The area has almost nothing happening but it looks as though the city is working on building it up for improvement. There are a few bar restaurants accessible by walking or the streetcar which has a station directly outside the hotel. We did walk the River Walk to the end where you will find some shops and dining. Walking back we took the streets and it was a ghost town. Lots of construction sites but nobody was there. The hotel restaurant was good with excellent service and tasty food. Overall if you have to stay in that specific area I would recommend the hotel. It is directly on the river and the hotel itself was clean.", "offset": [14, 169], "date": "2016-01-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "e3f9e6c3-06f6-42f2-b77a-a3f851c11585", "sentence": "Great location.

Great location in downtown Tampa. Right on the waterway. Great view of all the boats and the sunset. Close to restaurants. Great bed and a large TV. Unfortunately our TV had a wiring problem with their dish and could not repair it until they made an appointment with the dish company. Since we were already unpacked we decided to stay in our assigned room rather than move to another room. We used our I pad when we wanted to watch TV instead. We needed a refrigerator to store medicines and ice pack and Mariot brought us a small unit at no charge to use during our stay. They do have a cooling box in the room but did not get cold enough for the meds. Probably okay for fod40 50 degrees. Since we are Mariot Rewards Members they supplied us with bathrobes to use during our stay. Were glad to see there was a bar in the shower to hold for safe entry into the shower. Mariot supplies you with soap shampoo conditioner body wash and mouthwash. The bedroom was spotless as well as the bathroom however we did find that the threshold between the bathroom and bed room was quite dirty. It was made of marble and the dirt blended in with the gray color within the white marble. Parking is a bit pricey 28 night valet with unlimited come and go during your stay. There is a water taxi near the hotel and also a trolley service. They also have a wake up call service but I would set an alarm clock just to be sure since on our first night they missed waking us up at 7 AM causing us to be late for a morning meeting. The pool is on the 3rd floor and it is beautiful. Many beautiful lounge chairs with about 6 round bed chairs with pillows and a shade that can be raised to keep the sun out of your eyes. There were also about 6 bed type lounge chairs near the jacuzi. The pool is huge but the jacuzi is very small. There is a shower to rinse off but unfortunately the knob to make it work was missing.

We reached out to management on Saturday regarding the noise and were told about the construction and that it is ongoing every day from 8am5pm and that they should have told us at check in which they did not. I went on to ask her why is this ongoing renovation not listed on the hotel websites like other hotels do including other Mariots themselves so a possible guest can reach out to the hotel with questions prior to booking. Making a guest aware of it at check. in is not very fair when the guest is already past their penalty cancellation period. Hayley went on to tell me that this is how the management at this hotel is wishing to deal with and it is not something done at the corporate level. The only reason I believe they are not wanting to do put the construction on their website because they do not want to lose business to the Embassy Suites right across the street which is equally nice. I feel that is unfair to the guests.

First I want to say I have stayed at this property several times in the past and always given it top marks. When I learned that it was one of the two host hotels for the Gay World Series September 2 8 I was thrilled. The hotel went out of its way to make us feel welcome by among other things adding two bars in the lobby and adding a food station in the lobby since Champions is closed for remodeling. Additionally they gave us 25 off valet parking 21 vs 28 and took the unusual step of offering self parking usually valet only for 20 a night recognizing that a large number of participants would leave at the same time each morning. Anyone who is a Gold or Platinum member knows that the Concierge area at a Mariot can be hit or miss. This one is and has always been a total hit. The main reason is that the morning representative Carl Fuller has been there for over 18 years. He is a delight and remembers everyone and takes his job very seriously. Joyce Brown in the evening has been there about 15 years and is also sweet and wonderful at her job. The food day and night is plentiful and delicious. The Concierge level is closed after breakfast on Friday until Sunday night but if you are platinum they give you vouchers for a very extensive buffet in the restaurant and you can bring one guest per voucher. As to the rooms a total score. Very comfortable beds beautiful furnishings and an upscale bathroom. Safes and refrigerators in every room. Due to a situation beyond my control I ended up in four different rooms as the one I was promised in advance was accidentally given away prior to my arrival. But eventually I scored Room 2401 which has a balcony about five times the size of the room with sweeping views of the water and surrounding area. Besides Carl and Joyce I want to recognize Sabrina Bracken and Martin Watson who is a Guest Experience Supervisor. Sabrina went to great lengths to ensure I had a great time and Martin did everything he could to make my stay enjoyable. One quick tip. At booking request a room facing away from downtown. They are currently constructing a JW Mariot virtually across the street and my friends that had rooms even numbered said that it could be loud at times.

My wife and I stayed here for a few nights. The hotel is undergoing some renovations however it appears they are almost complete with them with the last part the lobby.

Room appeared new. My guess is they renovated the rooms first and are completing the interiors such as lobby etc. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the intercoastal and of course the entire bay. Beautiful view. The room itself had a very nice bed simple chair to relax a big screen attached to the wall and a glass enclosed shower. Wood floors. The pool area was good. It felt like not enough chairs and they were not checking the pools for empty bottles. We felt this was an issue on Saturday. The people serving the drinks appeared to look away. We in the pol would pick them out and place them on top of the tanning stones in the middle of the pool. Furthermore the pool itself appears to be under repairs. Not an issue except when the turned on their dry vac and the dust hit me in the face. Finally they have a nice bar and they were grilling outside probably for a cost but its smelled nice. Service appeared to be attentive to sell. At night the wife and I went outside with our own special bottle brought from home and relaxed on the patio outside of the lobby bar area. LAst but not least my wife and I had the Romance Package. We were with another couple who got the same thing as us. Their Chocolate Strawberries and Champagne arrived.
