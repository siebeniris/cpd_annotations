One of the best stays I have had in a hotel in quite some time considering the circumstances. Hotel staff at check in was very friendly and helpful. I arrived near the end of the evening social and the lady running the evening social was very helpful and pleasant and did not make us feel hurried at all even though the social was ending in 10 minutes. Room was very spacious and the beds very comfortable. My brother slept in the living area on the couch and slept very well. Room was very clean and quiet. The morning breakfast was pretty good and not crowded at all. Morning of departure front desk staff made me couple of pages of photocopies for no charge and were very polite about it. Overall a great stay. The hotel staff did say at some point the hotel was 20 years old though it was hard to tell for the most part as it had mostly a modern look and feel to it only way the hotel looked aged was the entry ways to the rooms looks like they need some updating. While I did stay on points I would definitely consider doing a paid stay here if the occasion arose to do so. A big thanks to the hotel staff for making my one night stay a great stay. I came away from my stay very impressed with this hotel.", "offset": [816, 1070], "date": "2015-02-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "eb488a00-8468-48c6-bec9-93108c26a28a", "sentence": "Rooms Could use an update.

The staff here is well trained friendly courteous and considerate. The hotel is currently undergoing a 100 makeover but there is minimal if any inconvenience. There is a very nice happy hour on weekdays where complimentary beer and wine and several snacks are served. A nice touch for the guests. Breakfast is also complimentary and it is a good onemuch better than the minimal continental breakfasts that many other hotels serve. Free shuttle service is provided within 2 miles of the hotel which is very convenient especially for those who have to make multiple trips to the medical facilities.
