Good location with proximity of sight seeing shopping and dinning. Great accessibility by any mean of transport. Generous size of room and memorable and helpful staff. Acor treatment wend definitely over and beyond with extra discount on FampB I have enjoyed buffet lunches in restaurant. Rooms are bit modest but very comfortable. There are detail which can definitely can be polished. Building show its age in public areas wooden paneling in restaurant and on corridors require some maintenance found soft spots on floor. Unexpected was to find plastic glasses in bathroom looks cheap. Also waiting staff was not real concentrated on job I saw quite lot of them but they were often hanging around and chatting not paying attention to guest. They set me up dirty cutlery on other occasion I had to wait good 10 minutes to bring me some. First day cook at station in restaurant look to be stressed and not really comfortable he could communicate better. Next day new one was just perfect and helpful. On welcome card left in room my Acor status was wrong I\u00b4m not particularly picky about it it\u00b4s how attention on details is Originally I booked room with two single beds expecting company so I was surprised automatically getting king size bed. As planes changed and I came alone I would be kind asking for it it would be good to get first booked room set up.

Although granted when I produced my confirmation and I did not even need a late checkout in the end it is a bit of an unpleasant way to start my stay that I have to go digging through my e mails for proof of what I had bought. The remodeling work is very obviously only partially done hopefully to be completed soon as the new style is much better overall and also fits the brand and the price point much better. I am glad we had a remodeled room it was very niceBreakfast room particularly could really use a fresh design and the waiting staff seemed a bit lost at times. When it got busy tables were not cleared of dirty dishes anymore. The coffee service execution was very strange even when it was not so busy. why bring me a single initial mug of black coffee when I have to then go fetch milk and refills myself.

First of all the location is fantastic and we could not have picked a better location. it is handy for everything Old Town has to offer and really easy to get to most other places from. However the overall service and state of the hotel during our visit really let it down. The hotel is impressive and the main reception seems to have been recently renovated. We arrived on Thursday evening and despite there being three check in desks only one member of staff was working. It took us around 30mins of waiting to actually get as far as checking in. The member of staff was however friendly and helpful giving us some ideas of local bars and restaurants to try plus noting down some places of interest on a map. We were given room 51 on the 5th floor a corner room quite cramped with a poor layout. There is a window with a view of a wall but the window did not open. The heat inside the room was stifling and made it impossible to sleep at all as the air con did not work. Next morning I asked to be moved to another room explaining that they could not expect us to sleep in a room with no opening window and no aircon. Initially I was told that the hotel was full but when I asked for a refund and to move hotels a room suddenly became available. This room was on the same floor and luckily had a window that opens. Turns out that none of the aircon in the hotel was working it is all turned off. It took them 3 hours to move us and a bit of an argument but it got sorted in the end. Quite poor customer service though and the staff attitude was not nice at times. There was renovation work going on throughout the hotel and the noise from builders started quite early each morning. Looks like we picked a bad time to stay here and perhaps we should have been warned in advance of the construction renovation works so we could have maybe looked elsewhereit is surely a basic standard to have working air con in the bedrooms as they do seem to be quite small and obviously some of them do not have windows that open. Why it is turned off never quite became clearA buffet style breakfast was included and there is a varied and plentiful choice of dishes on offer.
