The resort is classy elegant and the service is above all expectation. There was never a moment we felt stressed or needed anything. The pool is the perfect temperature and there was NEVER a problem getting a spot no matter what time of day. REALLY. Drinks were hand crafted with fruit and real juices and top shelf alcohol. Food was perfectly presented and satisfying. Our favorite was the Italian however the only one we did not really like was French. The third floor pizza was great. Room service was timely and accurate. Download the ap to ask your butler for aromatherapy baths and order room service. The Spa is delightful. DO not miss the hydrotherapy that is included even without a treatment. I did it daily. We had an 80 minute massage using out resort credits and it was one of the best I had ever had. Our housekeeper was spot on our room had twice daily attention and was perfect. We were on the 6th floor facing the ocean. Would have loved to have the doors open for ocean sounds but it became very humid and slippery in the room. We did not do any evening entertainment since we were exhausted from all the relaxation. We did enjoy the gym several times and did padleboard yoga. It was a true pleasure to experience this resort for the ultimate in relaxation.", "offset": [1095, 1183], "date": "2016-06-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2d76815b-2793-45df-8d2e-dcbda5b9e0c5", "sentence": "Excellent. Info and hints and tips to help you decide enjoy your stay. Just returned from 9 night Honeymoon here. We are a same sex couple. Generally Excellent hotel with just a couple of niggles. With almost 1 member of staff to each guest the service was the best I have experienced in a hotel. Rooms service food drink pool all excellent. I expect I will go back there. Room We had a Royal Governor Suite. It was lush. Huge and bright with lovely views all round. 2 SMART TVs with access to Apple and Netflix. Tip if you are used to high powered UK hairdryers bring your own. The free standing hotel one is not bad but not fast enough for me. The room has good straighteners. Room looked after throughout the day. Lovely turn down serviceService. Small touches are what makes this hotel stand out. My wife needed to have her false eyelashes removed. she had had them for our wedding and they turned out to be painful. Susane at Concierge was ace. Phoned round local salons on a Sunday and found us an appointment. It was not easy. Thanks Susanze. Butlers can not do enough for you so use them fully if you like. There is a proper butler menu to choose from. We probably did not use them enough. Food Breakfast. pretty much everything and many things cooked to orderLunch can have anywhere. Try the pizzeria on level 3. Most people did not seem to know this existed Dinner. No need to book except the French. All restaurants al la carte. All fab. Room service no charge remember. Do insist the food arrives hot and it shouldWe used resort credits to have romantic dinner on the beach on our last night. Very lovely. Not rushed. We changed the seafood starter and this was no issue. It could only have been improved by a wine list. The wine was good but I had have preferred a choice. Drink 4 x bottles of spirit in rooms free of charge and fridge stocked daily. Bar served most branded stuff in whatever strengths you asked for. House Merlot was good. Niggles 1. Entertainment lots of jet skis on beach and parasailing too so plenty to do. Swimming was warm and safe. lots of classes if you fancy yoga etc. cello violin and saxophone most nights in bar pool. Very posh. Light and Fire show on Thursdays is good. Disco is ok. Depends a lot on the crowd. Our first night was a right laugh as people wanted to dance and did not take themselves seriously. Other nights people were a bit too cool to dance and just wanted to look sexy at the bar. It was not helped by the DJ who had a preference for playing sexy music videos showing skinny skantley glad women. Ok for guys but did not exactly inspire people to dance as no way could we look that good after a 4 course dinner. Disappointing for us2. Transferred guests. This is my main gripe. It appears the Moon Palace hotel nearby is deliberately overboked because Le Blanc is underboked. A fair number of guests at Le Blanc had been transferred from Moon Palace and according to staff this was common. The guests were quite happy as I would be having paid less for Moon Palace. I was ok with this except I was declined a late check out partly because of transfers in from MP. I complained as late check out was part of my honeymoon package subject to availability I know. The butlers Alex and Santiago sorted it for me which was good but I was disappointed I had to make a bit of a fuss. Expect to have transferees at the hotel. Tip. if you picked Le Blanc for class and piece and quite do not venture out at least not right towards Old Town. You are hounded at every point to come into a shop or a bar or a restaurant. It smells and is heaving at night. I did not like it. Just tolerated it to go to Coco BongoTiping. ok. We did. 1 at breakfast 1 2 at lunch and 5 at dinner or for room service. Plus 1 for every 2 drinks at bars beach etc. We tipped our butler 5 a day if he did extra stuff for us. We tipped the cleaner 5 a day. Not everyone tipped. It did not seem to matter. You got great service whether you did or not. We wanted to just because everyone worked so hard. Laura the slim lady who worked tirelessly setting out sunbeds ice buckets and water especially. I watched her a few days. She was a workhorse. I tipped her. Coco Bongo see my other review for more info. we went VIP. Not worth the 125 a ticket unles you are a heavy drinker but a good show and quite a laugh. Tip 1 if you want to get in the mix and dance on the stage etc do not go VIP you may be bored. I was glad to be VIP as not one to be in the limelight. Tip 2 take in a couple of drinks into the actual show to begin with. Waiter service was non stop so no trouble getting drinks except the first round which took 30 mins so best to have some drinks already. Read mine and the other reviews on Coco Bongo and decide for yourself. Spa best massage ever. Used resort credits and had couples 4 hands massage. Ace. You can do the hydrotherapy at any time 8 am to 8 pm free. No need to book. Resort credits work like this. You get an allowance based on your length of stay. We got 200 dollars. Basically you pay 16 on whatever you spend so if you use the whole 200 you will pay 320 for the privilege. We used max of 650 at the spa and could have used max of 850 if we went to the timeshare presentation which we decided against. We used it all on a couples massage so it cost us 80 when we checked out. Well worth it. We used 450 on a beach dinner on our last night so it cost 72. We used 320 on the combined jungle tour. Aqua twister but had to cancel as one of us was poorly. You need to give 24 hrs notice so we had to pay the 40 tax which was fair enough. We used 250 to book a beach cabana one day between 9 and 5 which included a bottle of Mo\u00ebt. Other tips We did not need insect spray though took loads. But we did not venue outTake 1 and 5 bills for tips. The hotel can change higher value notes but not alwaysIf you plan to go on a trip involving the sea coral take some clearly labelled biodegradable sun creamAsk the hotel to call you about turtle labour or releases if you fancy.

I stayed here for the second time in November. It is simply perfect in every way. To take it point by point Room extremely comfortable spacious modern and beautiful. A great bed shower double jacuzi in every room. You can get a sea view or lagoon view slightly cheaper but just as interesting. Service incredible. All the staff here seem to enjoy their jobs and nothing is too much trouble. There are too many to list individually but all the serving staff from the beach to the room via the pools and the restaurants are wonderful. A special mention to the 8th floor butlers for whom nothing is too much trouble and Isabel who remains the best omelette maker on the planet. Food excellent. There are several restaurants the pick of which are the Italian and the International I recommend a porterhouse with your resort credit. The Asian and Pizza are great the breakfast and lunch buffets as good as I have ever seen. The weakest still very good is probably the Lumiere. Drink pretty much unlimited premium brands what is not to like. I recommend the Mocha Monkey by the pool. Pools three beachside lagoon side and a small one on the third floor. The important thing is they never feel crowded always space available. Spa truly outstanding. I recommend the four handed massage. Overall I would go as far as saying if you do not think Le Blanc is outstanding the problem is probably you. Obviously be sure you want a quiet luxury adults only sanctuary and do not expect booming disco music by the pool all day. I note one review on here was concerned about the screw heads on a hinge not matching. This may have been the case for my room but I decided to enjoy a cocktail by the pool rather than check.

The water was various shades of blue the waves were a little rough while we were there. We were able to body surf the lifeguard was very conscientious of those in the water. Few shells the sand was pretty and not hot as I learned it was made from coral. The wait staff was incredible. They would not let us lift a finger. They escorted us to the chairs polside or by the beach with towels that they spread out for us. They set up our umbrella brought us waters in an ice bucket and refilled without being asked. They came by often to ask if we wanted anything to drink and we also were able to order lunch on the beach. The vendors walked past us on the beach without bother. Antonio our butler was helpful in answering our questions and the nightly turn down service was very relaxing after a nice dinner out. We ate at each of the 5 restaurants. The presentation of the food at each was incredible very fancy. The portions were just right and delicious so that we sampled from appetizers to dessert without feeling stuffed. Long pants for the men and casual dressy was required for all except the 3rd floor outside Terrace restaurant by the pool which served delicious pizza sandwiches and aps. The Blanc Italia my favorite Blanc International shorts ok and Blanc Asia restaurants were all fantastic. Lumiere the French restaurant was the only one that required reservations not exactly sure why. We enjoyed that the least. There was 1 shop for souvenirs and the spa was located on the bottom floor.

So hard to eloquently write this review as I \u2019m terrified of leaving someone out. This being said from the time we were chauffeured off by Miguel the magnificent driver who remembered our favorite music to the time he dropped us off at the airport our trip was just perfectI hosted this vacation along with 3 other couples who have never been to Le Blanc before this always makes me excited as I ca n\u2019t wait to see their faces as they enter the lobby. As a Diamond Member I arranged all our dinner res spa special dinners etc and all were perfectly orchestrated thanks to Roger Eri Pame and Les. Thank you for always going beyond the call of duty for me you will always have a special place in my heart. 3Le Blanc would n\u2019t be 1 if it was n\u2019t for the dedicated staff and management that loves to pay attention to details. Our butlers Marco and Javier on the 9th floor were AWESOME. I do n\u2019t know how they perform their magic but they do and are very sneaky. Most impressive is having them unpack for you so you can get a jump start on your vacation. To describe Le Blanc is extremely difficult it is NOT a stuffy snooty resort but yet it \u2019s classy and elegant. I can honestly say it \u2019s a pure balance of simple elegance and warmthThe pool and beach are gorgeous with dedicated hard working servers such as Yesica Laura Lucinda Jeanete and Jorge. I just adore the afternoon cucumber and cooling washcloth over my eyes while basking in the rays. Breakfast and lunch at the International is ALWAYS a delight especially when David one of our favorite servers remembers you from years past and even arranged a special luncheon for our group thanks to Chef Servanano. You truly spoiled usNow the International is also superb at night. Omar the manager will be sure you \u2019re more than satisfied with the wines and menu selection. One night I requested fried calamari and ended up with 3 huge slate platters of fabulous fresh fish as an appetizer for our group. OMG my mouth is watering now. I also highly recommend the veal chop and cowboy steak well worth the RC. Thank you Jonathan Herunuir Ravero Armando and Yolanda Ramierez for making sure everyone was seated with smiles and served with love. Alfonso books amazing entertainment at Le Blanc. I LOVED Paul Ponce \u2019s juggling act truly amazing as well as his other super entertainment acts. Alfonso also MC \u2019s the Chef \u2019s Dinner which is one NOT to be missed. The food was amazing and loved meeting the Head Chef and his team including the fabulous new pastry chef. Unfortunately I do not remember his name but I gave him a standing ovation LOLNow for the Italian. Mangia. The food is amazing and they will also prepare it to your liking. We truly enjoyed our servers and attention by the lovely woman who assists the hostess. We were truly fortunate to be at Le Blanc during the full moon. They host a special dinner on the beach with romantic music a fabulous buffet and of course the main attraction was the orange moon rising from the sea. Unfortunately the photos were nothing like the actual colors. Don\u2019t forget to use your RC for the Romantic Dinner it \u2019s the BEST there is. You are served dinner in your own cabana that was artistically plated and extremely delicious AH the SPA. Words can not describe the solitude and pampering you will receive here. The ambiance is amazing and welcoming. I had the best facial ever the Diamond Facial. well worth the money along with the 4 hands massage that will you weak to your knees.

Our first evening we attended a Mexican buffet supper and wonderful circus show on the beach with great service from our waiter for the evening Angel Roderges. We enjoyed having al la carte breakfast and lunch on the upper terrace restaurant with attentive service from Jancito and Ferneli. In each of the reastaurants we felt the food and service was excellent but we were disappointed that some of the service lacked in flair that we had previously experienced with less table side preparation and performance. This trip we were most impressed with the Italian restaurant. We enjoyed the lobby entertainment which was refined and tasteful. One particularly enjoyable evening was at the Blanc Stage where the Wholiganz got everyone dancing with a wide repertoire of classic rock and excellent guitar solos. We preferred the lagoon side pool which was more quiet and relaxed than the main pool. Our room on the the 7th floor had a lovely lagoon view where we especially enjoyed watching the sunset. Our butlers Joel and Cesar checked with us regularly and assisted us with reservations and transportation.

If you \u2019re looking for a great ambience and unparalleled service LeBlanc Cancun still sets the standard in my opinion. There are always \u201c stand out performances by the staff of LeBlanc \u201d. Truth is all the staff is amazing but there are always a special few that you \u2019l find yourself wanting to hire and carry home with you. For this trip it would be a crime not to at least mention the exceptional service of the following Leonardo in the spa was amazing. He made chocolate covered strawberries just for my wife while she was in the spa. He really attends to details and every want and need of the customer. Manuel did a great job in the salon and was so personable for her mani pedi. The ocean front pool is the place to be. Laura Mauricio Sarahi and Lucinda please come home with me. In all of the world no finer or sweeter people exist. The guys at breakfast are always fabulous Candelaria Manuel Elias Juan Erick Jalisco and chef Isabel. It simply does n\u2019t get better than this crew of affable staff. Marco the manager at breakfast is amazing. He always greeted us with a warm smile and hug. Victor the food and beverage manager is constantly searching for ways to improve an already stellar service. No detail goes unnoticed. If you are lucky enough to get Israel as your butler you \u2019re in for a real treat. You will not find a more knowledgeable guy about the resort and if he can not satisfy your every want and need. well you \u2019re way too \u201c wanty needy \u201d. Seriously he is impeccable. I just referred to him as \u201c El Presidente \u201d. I will not go back without requesting to be on the floor in which he serves. Our favorite restaurant. even after all the renovations and menu changes NO DOUBT the Italian Restaurant. You \u2019l be greeted by the beautiful and delightful Samantha. She is the sister you \u2019ve always wanted. Why sister. Because she always makes you feel like family. Make sure to request Many or Jose to be your waiter. You ca n\u2019t go wrong in picking them. They both have big personalities and make the menu come alive with brilliant meal descriptions. Ricardo who manages the Italian restaurant is fantastic and ensures everyone has a great experience. Chef Rene was constantly wowing us with his culinary creations and specialties. We simply could not resist the temptation to eat there every other night. I could go on and on and on but the simple truth is LeBlanc can not be adequately described. It should be experienced. If you ca n\u2019t fall in love with resort life at LeBlanc you simply were n\u2019t meant to be pampered in this life.", "offset": [1237, 1305], "date": "2019-09-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "dc0e822e-2493-46ef-9f88-f2ff69fd9016", "sentence": "Adults Only. Le Blanc MUST become your destination at least once. Due to a promotion we found ourselves visiting LeBlanc twice this year within the past 5 months. We went two times prior and the biggest difference was the renovations remodeling they did in late 2018 \u2013 all great changes mind you. We did n\u2019t think it was possible but the resort looks even better than from our first trip in 208. If you are looking for an adults only destination in Cancun look no further. Everything at Le Blanc is top notch and all of their employees truly care about making sure you have the best vacation possible. Some even go above and beyond when necessary. Each guest is their priority and it shows. Here are a few of our thoughts and specific individuals in no particular order whom we feel made our stay this and even last time great. Please understand writing is not one of my strengths but I hope it is good enough to accurately reflect our opinions about Le BlancTeraza \u2013 We had half of our lunches and dinners here and breakfast twice. It is located on the 3rd floor has great views of the ocean and very peaceful. The waiters were great Bryan Carlos Fausto Rubicel Ulices all very attentive. At one point during our stay an individual named Isac stopped by and had a discussion regarding our stay and how everything was going. This is even more convincing everyone wants your experience to be the best. K\u2019akau \u2013 This is one of our daily and favorite places to visit at Le Blanc. They have a delicious assortment of macaroons bon bons and truffles. You can also get crepes made for you anytime which make a great breakfast or dessert item. Lastly it \u2019s a perfect place for coffee espresso cappuccinos and more. Dana Angelica Jorge and Chris were all greatBlanc \u2013. We had breakfast here almost every dayother times in Teraza. Isabel makes the best omelets. She has been there since our first trip about 11 years ago and is still doing some awesome cooking. Besides the made to order items there is a vast buffet of everything imaginable. They have great presentation with their food and if you ca n\u2019t find something to eat there must be something wrong. It is very similar to lunch with the large variety of choices and they do change things up daily so it does n\u2019t get boring. The waiters who made our morning and afternoon visits exceptional were Candelario Erick Juan Felipe and David. Yama \u2013. This is the Japanese restaurant and our personal favorite for dinner Teraza being a VERY close 2nd. All the food is awesome \u2013 get the Yakimeshi Mix add their house soy sauce \u2013 you will not regret. Jesica was a great host and we had GuilermoMemo as a waiter each time we had dinner 3 times. He knew a lot about the menu had a good memory and was very helpful in our decisions. I personally think he would be a great butler \u2013 he just had that sense and attitude about him as compared to what we \u2019ve seen from our butlers. some people just have that natural ability. Bela \u2013. As with all of the restaurants great food here as well and it is our 3rd favorite tied with Lumiere. We only went here once on this trip but our waiter Lorenzo made it a nice experience. I think this is where we first used the iPads to look over the wine list \u2013 this was the best change that happened during our stay. They had a lot of information listed on each wine which made it easy to choose. Aba Maria suggested we try the Mexican restaurant but we did n\u2019t get a chance to. The Mexican restaurant was changed a few years ago as it used to be International which we loved and miss. All in all a variety is good to have and it comes down to each individual \u2019s preference \u2013 they have something for everyone. Lumiere \u2013 We only ate here once and it is still exceptional. Our 3rd favorite alongside Bela. Alfonso was the manager on duty and came to apologize for a group who was having a lot of fun in a side room they were enjoying themselves and brought up the volume in this normally quiet laid back restaurant however we were fine with it. Personally that stuff does n\u2019t bother us as we enjoy the food and drink and like seeing other people having fun. To be honest we were close to joining them. Our waiter Osvaldo was very personable and we even shared in a few jokes as we did the last time with Baldemarwho had the fun table in the side room. Both are awesome waiters alikeLagon Bar \u2013 We have to give a shout out to Ignacio and Leonelhe was doing an internship as they were both wonderful bartenders and very personable. These guys have some great skilsLagon Pool \u2013 We spent a little time over here playing ping pong corn hole and black jack. In the mid afternoon they have a churo cart which makes for a nice afternoon treat assuming you have room. I was only successful twice. You will not go hungry hereMain Pool Area \u2013. The girls all work very hard in the hot sun and pouring rainhad a few hours \u2019 worth on our second visit to provide the best service and amenities possible \u2013 Lucinda Jeanete Laura and Marine were all very atentiveLoby Bar \u2013 We only stopped by here once to get a Mayan coffee and although it did n\u2019t appear to be going on at the time we thought Rafael stepped up and made us one and we are very thankful for it. Ca n\u2019t say it enough all of the staff goes above and beyond. Butlers \u2013 We interacted with a few butlers during this stay and although we hardly make any requests when we did Juan Luis and Saul made sure they were taken care of and always asked if there is anything they could do for us. Hugo also made us a nice display and set up the Jacuzi for us on the one night we asked for it. We also had the chance to run into our butler from our last trip Mario. He was one of the best for sure and even took care of a unique request from my mother in law. These guys certainly go above and beyondSpa Mani Pedi \u2013 Manuel and Cynthia deserve to be acknowledged for a job well done. 25 min massage \u2013. Merari and Iliana know provide a great massage and have a great sense for troubled areas and where to focus. We opted to do the three and a half hours long Passion package and although we ca n\u2019t remember their names due to be in a complete sense of relaxation both ladies did an amazing and out of this world jobThere is another individual who is very helpful and is a great person to talk to and his name is Mauricio. He mostly worked on the beach but we also saw him in the main pool area and 3rd floor infinity pool. He played volleyball with us on occasion which helps especially when we ca n\u2019t find players which he actually did \u2013 he once found enough for us to play a few gamesEntertainment \u2013 It is impossible to say enough positive things about Ana \u2013 she played ping pong and black jack with us taught a little Spanish the last time we were there and played both water and volleyball on numerous occasions. Superb personality and very friendly we certainly miss her \u2013 I have more on this towards the end. As far as nightly entertainment goes the Magic Show is certainly the best show we have ever experienced and fortunately with us being there for 10 days we were lucky enough to see it twice. Mario and his I thinkfour assistants put on one awesome show. He added in a laser light show and it was very cool. The number in a box trick completely blows my mind. If anything Le Blanc NEEDS to keep this show no matter what. The other shows both very close to being our 2nd favorite were the Circus and Michael Jackson tribute. Circus performers are simply amazing. no clue how they do what they do. The Michael Jackson look a like Luigi was spot on and along with his 6 back up dancers put on a great performance which we also got to see twice. Our only complaint or at least bit of confusion is with the Entertainment Activities team. In May there were two people on the team Alfonso and Ana. These individuals were responsible for coordinating and leading the beach pool and indoor activities and also introduced the nightly entertainment. Upon our arrival we happened to see Ana in passing and asked her about Alfonso. She said he left Le Blanc a few weeks prior to pursue his own business venture. Without a doubt this was very sad news but fortunately we still had Ana. However this would n\u2019t last long. A few days in she told us she had the next day off I think it was a Thursday but would be back to see us for Friday \u2019s activities and the Latin band on Saturday. While she was gone she said the individual who replaced Alfonso named Alfredo would be coordinating the events. Friday and Saturday came and went without any sign of Ana. I asked Alfredo and he said she left and went to another resort. It was very surprising to hear especially since she told us she would be back for the one show and also for more blackjack ping pong and volleyball which we did during the first few days. Deep inside I felt something else happened and she did n\u2019t leave on her own as we were led to believe. I say this because of her genuine excitement of returning after her day off and from the way Alfredo gave his response \u2013 it did n\u2019t sit well with me and it sounded out of place. Nonetheless we could n\u2019t ask Ana and there was nothing else we could doMy wife and I both just wish we had a chance to say goodbye \u2013 she was a great and such a personable person. Ultimately the whole concept of what Le Blanc did have with regards to their Entertainment Activities team has changed in a big way all in the matter of months. While this is n\u2019t going to affect anyone looking to come to Le Blanc for the first time it will be a big adjustment for those who knew Alfonso andor Ana. I do n\u2019t know how jobs and positions are filled in Mexico but in my opinion the management at Le Blanc should have promoted Ana when Alfonso left and maybe even given her an assistant. I did see Alfredo twice for beach volleyball and for the evening events but that was all his presence nor energy just was n\u2019t there as it was with Alfonso and Ana. I actually never thought Alfonso went home as you would always see him around interacting with people. Maybe Le Blanc wants to change the role for Alfredo but we did n\u2019t see him much outside of those occasions. In addition the activities schedule is n\u2019t like it used to be. Granted this is more of a relaxing and quiet resort but I personally look forward to having some activities to split up the day a bit. For instance in May I played beach volleyball at least 7 of our 9 days there this last time 2 out of 10. In all cases it comes down to asking around and rallying people to play. Alfonso seemed to have this natural skill and ability which if I had to guess he taught Ana to be the same so much that I thought she was the new person in charge until she told me different. Regardless Alfonso was gone and as stated previously we were happy to see at least Ana was still there. but then she was n\u2019t. I ca n\u2019t say I have anything against Alfredo as I have only seen and talked with him twice but from what I can see thus far he has a long way to go if theyLe Blanc management want him to have the same energizing presence as Alfonso and Ana once did \u2026. hopefuly maybe he took some good notes from them only time will tell.", "offset": [6909, 7098], "date": "2019-11-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}]}
