Everything including the stationary is well designed and super attractive. Everything or almost everything in the room is also for sale so be mindful of that we have never seen so many for sale items in a hotel before. The bed was dreamy shower glorious bath amenities ample the internet worked well and same for the tv. We also made use of the hotel car what a nice touch. The parking check in staff were particularly nice attentive. Our old hotel hangout in LA has changed hands so we are moving to the SLS for future visits.

My first visit to the SLS hotel in LA was during a dinner I had at the excellent Bazaar restaurant. I was so impressed with the inventive hip and very modern design of the entire restaurant. in conjunction with the really cool crowd that it attracted that I put SLS on my definite hotel stay list for my next visit in LA. And so a few months later when I decided to visit again LA I booked a room for 5 days in SLS without further hesitation. First of all a clarification regarding the area despite the fact that it \u2019s called SLS Beverly Hills the hotel is almost at the city limits of Beverly Hills and most GPS maps do not even consider the location as Beverly Hills. Not that the area is not convenient or central it is super central and situated at an almost equal distance from West Hollywood and Beverly Hills but do not be fooled if you want to stay at the center of Beverly Hills Rodeo Drive etc. and you choose SLS. Actually it \u2019s a half hour walk to Rodeo Drive from the hotel or just a 10 min drive. I arrived in the hotel around 20 in the evening and it was super busy as usual due to the restaurant and bar situated in the hotel. The entrance and in general all the areas of the hotel do not connect with the restaurant. And although the design is quite similar in both areas Philip Stark the designer of the entire establishment evidently showed greater creativity in the design and decoration of the restaurant and the bar area. Not that the rest of the hotel areas are not cool but they quite lack this extra wow factor that the restaurant has. Anyway when I arrived at the reception a young guy tried to assist me. Despite the fact I had booked a specific SLS package he did n\u2019t mention it at all to me since it was including various things that I needed more clarification ie daily 50 complimentary spa allowance neither did he told me about the basics of the hotel. breakfast hours etc. He just asked me for my ID my credit card and then he gave me the keys to my room. I do n\u2019t know if it was lack of experience from his part or he just wanted to finish with me quickly. In either case this was not a good starting point for the rest of my stay \u2026. The room I would say it was interesting as a design and concept but many elements clearly did n\u2019t work. The electrical switches first of all looked a bit out of place with the rest of the design. The bed is in the middle of the room and there are not any plugs nearby which is not at all convenient if you need to charge your electrical devices while you are in bed. The view of the room was not very pretty facing the street but the main problem is that the window was half the size of the wall and instead of curtains the room had silver venetian blinds in the windows so it sometimes gave the impression that you are staying in a hospital. With a few improvements the room could become much nicer. On the following day around 090 in the morning a very loud noise woke me up. Someone was hammering continuously. I furiously call the reception to see what is happening and they told me they will immediately look into the issue but the hammering went on for 20 more minutes. Apparently it took them that much time to find which technician was hammering. When I complained about this at the front desk they apologized and they gave me 100 lunch allowance at the main restaurant which was a nice gesture from one hand but from the other hand my first night \u2019s sleep was destroyed and taking into account that I was paying around 500 per night this is a true disaster. Another big issue I had with the service in SLS was the very superficial cleaning service they did in the rooms. The bathroom was full of dust every single day as apparently they did n\u2019t map the floor or they did it very hectic. The irony is that SLS has this eco friendly system that if you do not put the designated paper on the top of your bed they will not change your bed sheets. I usually applaud eco friendly hotels but a luxurious 5star hotel where they charge you a very hefty amount of money this eco approach feels hypocritical and just an excuse to save more money. When I mentioned about the poor room cleaning service at the front desk again they apologized and the removed from my final bill a 30 phone call bill I made. This shows that at least they actively listen to your complaints but once again this is not enough in such a type of 5star hotel. When I pay such a high amount of money for my stay I demand that those incidents wo n\u2019t even happen in the first place and that the entire service will be spotless. I have to say however that I was very satisfied with the level of service from the concierge team. They were all very nice and willing to help you even after their normal working hours. The Bazaar restaurant as I already mentioned was again the high point of the entire stay. One of the best food experiences I had during my visit in LA It is not strange that I ate there 3 times. The pool rooftop area was ok I suppose but nothing to get really excited the pool is really smalI think SLS in LA falls under the trap most hip and trendy hotels fall. They care more about their appearance and what cool crowd they will attract at their public areas restaurants pool clubs that at the end they fail to properly meet 100 the needs of their customers. If SLS charged for its rooms half of the amount it currently charges which I think is super crazy concerning the general service and amenities it offers. then I think it would be a really cool place for younger people to stay and hang out. But as it is it is really overpriced and for the same price you can opt to stay to much better hotels in the nearby area. Just do n\u2019t forget to dine at the Bazaar restaurant which is really worth a visit.", "offset": [1561, 1677], "date": "2015-09-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "05560c86-f2ed-4b16-87fb-ff1e1c3b400b", "sentence": "Great LA Hotel.

Love the long bench by the window. As others have mentioned I would have liked a little more storage options for clothes. Had food and drinks at Tres and it was all good.

We also went to the main restaurant for dessert the second nIght. The bar scene was vibrant but service was missing.

He suggested we do a private tour of the city which we did. I will be writing a separate review on the tour. After speaking to him we went for breakfast in the restaurant.
