We are currently staying at this hotel and have to say it has surpassed our expectations so far. The reviews and photos on website do not do it must justice. The hotel is beautiful with a great welcoming and very Hawaiian feel to it. Lots of attention to detail as far as decor goes and they did a great job creating a welcoming and relaxing environment. Lots of hammocks cozy seating for mingling around the pool day beds on the beach for star gazing etc. Beautiful. The staff have been very friendly and knowledgeable. Concierge is also very friendly helpful and knows her stuff. The rooms are huge and again beautiful. Bathrooms are small and it did not quite meet my cleanliness standards to be honest so I knocked a star off for that reason only. The breakfasts are expensive and we can not comment on how good they were and if it is worth the price but there are mini fridges in the rooms and lots of counter space so you can make breakfasts adorable. We bought a 7 toaster from Walmart and stocked the fridge with breakfast items to last us the week for the same price as a single breakfast. The location here is great if you have a rental car you are within an hour of anywhere on the island half hour or less from some popular beaches and within walking distance of a Safeway market shopping and great restaurants. The free Mai tais and coffee bar and the relaxed attitude about pool closing time are a few extra perks we have enjoyed.

This was our first trip to the Hawaiian Islands. We booked this hotel as part of a package and we were not disappointed. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The hotel is located on the beach where you can catch the sunrise. Our room had a comfortable bed and being on the top 4th floor a vaulted ceiling which made it seem even more spacious. As with many of the rooms here we also had a small balcony but we did not have a view of the water we did not request an ocean view. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The location in Kapa was good as you could be on the main highway to drive north or south in less than a minute. We had the breakfast buffet at the restaurant which offered a nice variety of food items and not too expensive if you plan to eat a lot before leaving for a full day of off premises activities. The food was good. It is an open air restaurant of sorts with pleasant breezes and morning sun facing the pool and main courtyard and the ocean beyond. There is the occasional wild chicken familiar to everyone on Kauai strolling through looking for a handout and maybe hopping onto an unoccupied table. This is not a luxury hotel but we were not expecting one since we were not paying luxury hotel prices. The rooms and decor are nothing fancy. The pool is nice but on the small side considering the number of guests newlyweds and other couples staying here. The beach is not very wide but still nice not crowded and stretches well beyond the hotel property if one wants to stroll. There is an additional daily resort fee of 20 which includes pool towel service complimentary mai tais and parking. Wi fi included too. I would warn guests that some of the tile floors in the open air areas can get slippery from dew or moisture.

The strap on my mask broke and my husband asked if we could get a piece of wire to fix it an engineer took us to his workroom in the basement and fixed it by drilling a hole and using a stainless screw and nut. He asked nothing in return and seemed pleased to assist us. Liane at the concierge desk went to lengths to book us onto a helicopter tour and followed up multiple times on changes in the weather. She genuinely cared about our experience. This hotel offers free coffee from 60 100AM and wifi in your room is also free. They have a nice bar and dining area with great food and drinks. Parking is 14 night. The hotel is situated close to restaurants coffee shops grocery stores and shopping. Unfortunately traffic is horrendous at certain times of the day.

The yoga class itself would cost around 20 state side in a big city and I was able to attend twice during this trip. The hotel is currently still being renovated so there was some construction noise going on which we only noticed on our last day as we were packing and getting ready to check out. Started around 9 am. We did n\u2019t spend any time during the day in our hotel since we were out and about in Kauai. But if you just wanted to lounge by the pool area the noise would probably be very annoying.
