My main reason for my title of this review is coursed by the apaling so called valet service. You can not park your own car at The Viceroy and are therefore at the mercy of the valet company. When pulling into the valet and reception area you are met by sheer pandemonium in a cramped area where hotel guests and recidents abandon their cars causing much frustration for people waiting for their cars. Make sure you call for your car 30 45 minutes before you need to leave the hotel. If you have an early flight and must be out of the valet area by say 6 am for heavens sake call your car the night before. You get the picture by now. The pool and the the pool lounge area is large and indeed impressive but during the winter months bear in mind that the 50 story south tower leaves the very large pool and most of the pool terrace in complete shade. I did not come to sunbathe but for the sun worshippers The Viceroy is not the ideal winter location. When I visited the restaurant I was met by nobody managed to locate a menu and when my presence still was not observed by any staff I left and never bothered to return as there are so many great restaurants in Brickel to choose from. The Philipe Starck Spa is indeed very Philipe Starck but grey soap rims around the sunken jacuzis under the huge yellow chandelier is a bit of a turn off. The steam bath broke down. The gym is very well equipped and the view from those boring running machines is fabulous. Staff in the spa is very friendly and helpful indeed unlike the borderline rude valet receptionist. For my four weeks visit in 2016 I will take my money somewhere else.", "offset": [1436, 1526], "date": "2015-02-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "01c39058-e90a-4e41-878e-2cf55cb0e428", "sentence": "High end hotel with a friendly atmosphere.

Individuals like Medin sp. at the front desk and BJ in the spa area went out of their way to make me and my wife feel welcome. The accommodations were plush and the amenities were top notch.

My fiance and I went yesterday for a massage at the Viceroy Spa. The massage was great but we had an uncomfortable situation happen to him. He has put his clothes in the locker after changing. We both went to the pool and other areas of the spa for about 2 hours. Right before our treatment at 530 my fiance went to the locker room. He tried to open his locker but the pin did not work. He called for assistance and one of the employees opened it for him. After we left the Viceroy he noticed he was missing cash and his AMEX was missing. Somebody opened his locker went through his pants since his wallet was in the pants and stole from him. This is ridiculous. At this moment we are not sure if it was an employee or another guest at the spa. BEWARE WHEN COMING TO THIS SPA. This was supposed to be a relaxing experience for us and was actually very stressful.

Went for spa month but made it an overnight visit. Reserved a 2 queen room as our teen will not sleep on a pull out sofa. None available at check in so they upgraded us to a 2 bdrm resident owned condo. The view from 36 was amazing and the 2 bdrms kitchen living dining rm appreciated but the interior was minimal dated and in poor repair broken lamps did not work or had to be propped up old ripped leather furn in the living dining rooms cracked counter tops in kitchen and baths huge stains on the stove jetted tub did not work crappy hard mattress in mbr etc. We stayed in a hotel room during our last Viceroy visit and the rooms were lux and so much nicer but other than size and view the condo was not even remotely in the same league. That said the spa was amazing awesome service great massage and a beautiful facility. The pool area also was awesome amazing pools tons of seating good service grt view and breezes. Food and drinks average and pricey but that is expected at a high end hotel pool. Also noticed that NOTHING changed was upgraded or redone since our last visit YEARS ago and wear and tear are showing throughout the property. Also even though I had a massage scheduled for early afternoon the hotel insisted that we either check out at noon or pay 50 of our daily rate to extend 2 or 3 hours which was ridiculous. After some back and forth they waived the fee but it was still a hassle having to shlep our luggage mid day to the spa. Because we had massages we were entitled to use the pool and spa facilities all day and did not want to leave at 3 pm which was right after my massage was done.

After reading some of the negative reviews i was especially surprised at how nice this hotel is and do not really have much bad to say. While I did not make many staff requests all of my interactions were very pleasant and helpful. The property was sold out both nights for the boat show but it was not noticeable in the facilities even in the small lobby. Had a room facing downtown so no water view and was not bothered by any traffic noise from the 10th floor. The room itself was sizable and could see that money was spent on quality finishes when it was built. There is a small pool on the 50th floor which was empty shortly after it opened in the morning. It was more clubby than relaxing but the view is pretty spectacular. The highlight for me was the icon spa facility which is nothing short of amazing. it is arguably the best hotel spa I have seen especially domestically and given that it is complimentary.

As a frequenter of W Hotels around the world this was a very bizarre place. it is a series of towers for the residential part of the hotel and the hotel is almost like an afterthought. The lobby it tiny. You literally walk into the check in desk just stepping into the lobby. The room though generous in size was very odd. For a new hotel that opened in June 2016 one would think that everything would be finely appointed and new. But one would be wrong. The pervasive scent throughout the hotel was mildewy. Just because Miami is a very humid place most hotels have taken this to task with dehumidifiers around to combat this issue. But the W has yet to take it on. The bathroom toilet paper holder was askew and literally felt like it was about to fall off. The TV is not proportional to the space and surrounding lamps that flanked the two sides. And there were only conveniently placed outlets on one side of the bed the room was essentially built for one person to sleep in a king sized bed. The restaurant is on the 15th floor. that is the top for the hotel. The rest is residential. But that is about it that is at the 15th floor. The restaurant does have a really neat patio with trees. You would not think you were in the middle of Miami. The meeting rooms are there too on the 15th floor. But be prepared for an olfactory onslaught of dusty old smell. Good grief. The workout facility is a weird journey. Go to the 15th floor exit through the back stairs and descend one floor and exit again into the garage. Follow a path painted to guide you through the garage to another building and then through a couple doors and arrive at a spa workout facility. After all this bread crumbing the workout facility is just odd. Half the machines are out of order. And if you want one it is gon na be a wait since it is supposed to service residents and hotel guests. Also the treadmills are poorly placed. There is this amazing view outside the windows that the treadmills face and instead of optimizing the view the treadmill is set so you are staring at a beam separating the window panes. It would be best if they just moved them all to the right one foot to take full advantage of this pleasant scene. If you get a good deal then it is worth the stay. If not keep shopping.

After staying at the Four Seasons Hotel Miami earlier in the week and comparing it to the W Miami you can clearly tell which establishment deserves a 5star rating. We traveled as a family with a baby in tow and immediately saw the difference right when we entered the front door. When you think of valet service you think of white glove service with your vehicle and your luggage that will be brought in by a bellhop to the front desk. This did not happen at all. My husband was carrying our infant and we had a couple of bags of luggage that he obviously could not carry with a baby in his arms. The valet staff just stood there with their hands in their pockets. after telling the front desk staff about the incident he did bring over another colleague to help us up to our room. We requested a crib to be sent up to our room which we were initially told would be up in 10 15 mins. We ended up having to wait almost 2hours and needed to proactively call down to follow up on the status. By the time the crib was delivered to our room the employee who set up the crib handed me a fitted sheet in a sealed package and said here you go. Folks. the next time you want to stay in a 5star hotel just remember that you have to put the sheets on the bed yourself. JEZ. Compared to the Four Seasons Miami Hotel the crib was provided with a padded mattress bumper Baby Kit full of shampoo lotions body wash diapers stuffed animal and even a door hanger to inform other guests staff that a baby is sleeping in your room in addition to a diaper pail. The room was clean but not as inviting and warm as the Four Seasons Hotel Miami. When you venture out onto the balcony the room lacks privacy since all of the balconies from the other side of the building face towards each other and are very close. All of the beverages food snacks were more expensive as well. We ventured upstairs to find the pool and got lost since there were signs leading in both directions to the Spa Fitness Pool. The amenities are shared with the residence building so you have to transfer on the 50th floor. The pool is on a rooftop deck which is nice. However there are no lights in the evening which makes the environment of the pool serenity dull and lacks 5star quality.
