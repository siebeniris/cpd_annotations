I recently spent 2 nights at the Mantra as I was in Sydney for work. Never in my life have I been in 3 different rooms over 2 nights. Let \u2019s start from the beginning. Late afternoon check in was quick efficient but was n\u2019t overly friendly nor was their any explanation on hotel facilities. I checked in to my room 710 and headed straight back to work. Initial impression was that the room size is good but over all very basic. I returned to my room at approximately 10 pm that night and started preparing for bed. I noticed what appeared to be really loud plumbing noises coming from the ceiling of my room. Imagine a shower running in the room above. It was so loud I asked a staff member to come and check it out. I was told that it \u201c should stop \u201d and was offered a room on the second floor. I did n\u2019t move rooms at this point as they could n\u2019t confirm that it was a quiet room on level 2 plus it was late and I was exhausted. Well the water noise did n\u2019t stop and continued ALL NIGHT LONG. On my second day after work I returned to the hotel at around 5 pm to organise a new room. I had to go out immediately for a work function so I packed up my bag and left it with the hotel to organise the room. It \u2019s now 9 pm and I \u2019m back at the hotel ready to check in to my new hopefully quiet room. Room 916 if I recall. I started unpacking my stuff get a movie happening etc when I realise it \u2019s really hot in the room. I check the aircon no air. I call the hotel and the Assistant Manager comes to check it out. \u201c I \u2019m sorry Sir the aircon is broken \u201d. Off to room 3 which was on the fourth floor. This time the aircon unit is noisy but I thankfully bought some ear plugs that day so managed to get some sleep. There \u2019s not much else I can really say about this property as I did n\u2019t really spend a lot of time there. The staff were friendly enough. My wake up calls took place as requested. My room service breakfast was pretty good but prices reflect those of a 5 star hotel and this place ai n\u2019t no 5 starWould I stay here again. No never again.

We go to Sydney for me to see a specialist every 4 months. The Mantra is located in an amazing spot restaurants and markets really close which is major for us and my disability which means walking is a big issue. The staff are so helpful and nice. Rooms recently renovated are superb spacious really clean and set up well. I also suffer from claustrophobia and am always given a room with a balcony upon request.

Your staff on arrival were lovely however I felt my room was lacking in a number of areas. Firstly the room had a dreadful smell probably due to overuse of the aircon. I opened the glass doors on a number of occasions to let in some fresh air. Secondly there was no guest book etc that actually told me when I had to check out or any of the other stuff I would expect about the facilities. No idea of how to use the TV. No washing machine dryer only no face washer one bin only in the bathroom. Not enough milk for 2 nights when there was no further room service.

We came for a long stay 38 days in Chatswod. I booked it for location and pool it was reasonably priced and reviews of upgrades were good. Great location 1 minute from station which itself has bottle shop grocery store sushi coffee dollar store post office and more. So close to the heart of Chatswod. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Long stayers get a welcome pack of oil spray milk eggs bread rice etc which was a great touch. On the flip side cleaning service was only once a week m which is n\u2019t adequate and on the day she came both kids were doing online classes and I was on a work call but she said she could n\u2019t come back later so we had to hover in various places to get out of her way and manage the vacuum. The vacuuming was n\u2019t very thorough and I \u2019m not sure if she mopped the bathroom or kitchen as walking around in socks got them filthy. The balcony was large but not touched. Fabulous black out curtains in both living room and bedroom and fairly quiet location. Our apartment was about 20 metres for an office building so no view. Secure floors card system for apartment and gym pool was good. Doors slam shut very loudly and the smell of garbage occasionally wafts in some places. Living room. Pullout couch was easy to work and comfy as those things go but we had to ask for bedding for it. TV was a smart TV but no internet so no Netflix nor could I get the screen mirroring to work to stream from our devices. This was a pretty big letdown. Wifi was good. Decent size 1 bd apartment but too sparse. I specifically had asked for a desk but there was n\u2019t one. No place for me to work with only the most uncomfortable stools at the kitchen bench. Balcony was big but filthy and no furniture to use the space. See pic. Bedroom. Comfortable king bed but awkward bedding Not quite big enough bottom sheet and comforter between two sheets that always came undone. I \u2019d asked for two singles but it came as a king. Bedroom had small TV no alarm clock bedside lamps with USB power which is handy. Closet was big enough with regular type hangers ironing board and iron and safe. No drawers for smalls and no artwork made it very sparse. Windows opened to a locked position for security. Wonderfully dark at night. Kitchen. Decent size but stocked with only bare basic dishes etc with no extras not even salt. Kitchen tap rushes out spraying everywhere and there was n\u2019t a dish drying rack. There \u2019s a dish washer that seemed to clean fine fine but racks in it were broken and only one sachet of detergent. Dish soap is provided in little sachets. There was no fry pan. I had to wash the light fan unit as it was sticky and gross to the touch. Bathroom. Despite having booked for three people only two towels were provided. Huge roach in bathroom but this is n\u2019t unusual in this part of Chatswod. Bathtub was big but missing a plug. Shower worked fine basics like soap shampoo etc were provided but no soap dish for the soap. Laundry. machines worked fine only one sachet of laundry detergent with no instructions. No laundry drying rack. Other pool sauna and gym were adequate and enjoyed. Hot tub was out of order. Had to ask for. Fry panToaster original one did n\u2019t workPlug for bathBeding for pullout couchTowelsTisuesToilet paperGarbage bagsLaundry detergentDish detergent Conclusion Not quite a hotel that has regular service and not quite an Airbnb with personality and more everyday stuff one needs. Seems to be targeted to short stays which would be fine because of the location and the staff. Pics are disgusting balcony decent pool out of order hot tub.", "offset": [1148, 1235], "date": "2020-03-20 00:00:00", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}]}
