Since the hotel was built in the 60s it is not the most modern hotel around. But the hotels facilities are well updated this making the old style of the hotel simply fascinating. 3. I went swimming a couple of times in the hotels swimming pool. Everything related to that activity was superb. To be highlighted is the restaurant connected to the swimming pool area and the fitness area. The young women working there are just outstanding. Arigato to them. 4. Parking is free and so is the perfect working wifi 5. The room I had was great in all ways. My only complaint is about the bed which I found too hard. 6. For me as a Norwegian I was really thrilled by the fact that the hotel has a bar in which it is possible to smoke cigars. 7. I will gladly return to this brilliant hotel.", "offset": [51, 86], "date": "2015-02-04 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "1a7fcea9-261d-4414-9930-cb7381dc9abf", "sentence": "A nice trip back in time. The Okura which is closing for re construction soon is a nice throwback to the 50s or 60s. The rooms are decent size shading to large the service good and most of the amenities were on site. You can avoid a daily gym charge by signing up for their rewards programs. They have a variety of restaurants on site most of which were pretty good. The hotel is also close to many government agencies and is right across the street from the US Embassy. My only complaint is that it was hard to control the room temperature. It was really hot when I got to the room and the thermostat did not seem to relate to the temperature. From the airport you can take one of two buses for 31 instead of a 300 taxi ride. One bus goes right to Okura. The other with schedule offset by 30 minutes goes to the ANA Intercontinental which is just a short walk away.", "offset": [117, 216], "date": "2015-02-20 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "1f7b9586-cb13-4bc6-9c76-e478ad6c7376", "sentence": "Nice hotel made very good by its staff.

I am a diehard Okura fan please see my 2013 review for more detail and am one of those lamenting the recent closure of the main building whose inimitable 1960s aesthetic will be replaced by a new version of the hotel slated to open in 2019. Until then the Okuras South Wing built in the 1970s remains open. We recently had a four night stay my first since the main building closed last fall. A note on transportation to the Okura from Narita airport. The limousine bus route to the Okura seems to have changed. Instead of going to the nearby ANA Intercontinental hotel and then to the Okura as in the past our bus went to Tokyo City Air Terminal TCAT and Tokyo Station before arriving at the Okura. The new route is less direct and more prone to traffic. Even late at night the ride from the airport took nearly two hours when it used to take about 90 minutes. If time is important you might want to see if there is a route that takes you relatively directly from Narita to the ANA where you could then take a 5minute taxi ride to the Okura. Even with the loss of the main building the Okura attributes of attentive service and comfortable Japanese hospitality remain intact. That said on this trip some things felt figuratively and literally frayed around the edges. When the bus arrived at the hotel there were no bellhops on hand to help with luggage something I have never experienced before. Service during breakfast at Camellia Corner was slow and confused. The rooms remain immaculate with superior bedding but the carpets and amenities like bathrobes are starting to look tired. The concierge service was excellent providing fast and detailed information on a trip out of town and graciously helping with a difficult last minute restaurant reservation. The hotels free WiFi worked very well. I had not stayed in the South Wing in over a decade and the rooms are very similar to what was on offer in the main building. The lobby and other public areas still have the original 1970s design but the rooms themselves are more generic and modern. We did not notice any construction noise from the area around the main building and our eleventh floor room was quiet. The Okura is in the Toranomon neighborhood and is about a 10minute walk to two subway stations. While Toranomon itself is a quiet place dominated by office buildings and the nearby US Embassy the area is within walking distance of Akasaka Ropongi and Kasumigaseki where many Japanese government ministries are located. Even with the loss of its iconic main building the Okura is soldiering on. As much as I miss the magnificent lobby and other public areas in the old building the hotel still offers a strong combination of comfort service and location at a competitive rate.", "offset": [2594, 2775], "date": "2016-01-24 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "36d06319-d2fd-4aa5-a381-757067908d4e", "sentence": "Grand tradition.
