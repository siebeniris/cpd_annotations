Was there in early March was about 77 degrees. So during midday it was nice using the pool but later in the day it got cold quick. They had a nice fire pit to keep the chill off. The place was nice and clean. This is classified as a resort but is geared to business travelers. Felt cold because there was just to much concrete everywhere. No staff member will go outside for orders or anything else. Bar was closed most of the day and after 60 no bartender. The staff was limited to the front desk.

My husband and I stayed 4 nights while in town for a family wedding. Our 1st impression was great. Very friendly staff that checked us in. Although we did not request ahead of time the staff made an effort to get us into our room as quickly as possible. Very appreciated. Our room was clean and very nice. I loved the lamps in our 6th floor room. We did not use the pool spa bar or restaurant so can not comment. Our room overlooked the pool and it looked very appealing. My major complaint with this Mariot other hotels is that they do not provide enough blankets. The thin sheet weight bedspread is nice because you know it has been laundered before your stay. However many couples have opposite desires for room temperatures. I called housekeeping and requested another blanket but never received it. The person I talked to said they had a very large volume of guests requesting extra blankets. That statement alone should make qthe blanket issue a high priority. My other complaint is the absence of towel bars in the bathroom. There was one in the shower and that was it. There was plenty of space to put a towel bar over the toilet but instead hung a huge piece of art taking up most of the space. I hope my positive comments are encouraging and my negative comments will help you better see the hotel experience from your guests viewpoint.

What once was pride of the showroom probaly ran on autopilot and became neglected over time. The hotel located off University road looked attractive from far away. The recently remodeled lobby and rooms looked nice but were not luxurious. That was where the buck stopped. The rest of the hotel was not remodeled. Did they run out of moneyThe outside aesthetics of the hotel were atrocious. The side entrance door had a key card but was left unlocked all day long. The red paint on the ground was beat up and needed repairingnear side entrance. If I had not entered thru the lobby first I would have driven off after seeing the condition of the side of the hotel. Being near a junky neighborhood I would not want to be on the first floor near the unlocked side entrance. The floor of the elevator had dirt and trash on the ground that looked like it had been there for some time. The elevators swayed side to side. The outside of the building needed to be repaired. If you sat in he the concierge lounge and looked out you would notice black blob all over the side of the building. The good were the nice rooms concierge floor was key carded nice employees and good food in the lounge. The employees at the front desk were cordial and helpful but looked very unprofessional wearng street clothes. There was no presence of management and hotel seemed it ran on a skeletal staff. The hotel has potential but needs some serious oversight. Parking was free. The beds were comfortable but sheets were small for a king bed.

I spoke with the front counter associate and asked if there was a way to be upgraded to a room with 2 Queens. She checked the computer and there were not any rooms available that night. She asked me to check in the morning and she would add the request to our file. When we awoke the next morning there was a message for us on our in room phone. She was able to switch us to a room with a King bed for the remainder of our stay3 additional nights. I was prepared to pay for the upgrade but they did not charge us.

I walked in to find a Fruit pit on my floor but the room smelled strongly of bleach so I am assuming it was clean otherwise. Like most old bathrooms it had a lot of caulking and dark lighting.

First time staying at a Mariot property. The hotel is modern and pleasant one of the restaurants is open immediately to the left when you enter from the main entrance. Free wifi network access though I can not comment how fast. Paid wifi access is 6 day and I got 1Mb s fast enough for 1080 Netflix and can support multiple computers for multiplayer gaming. The ATT tower nearby gave me faster speeds 18Mb s. when I did my testing so that is something to consider vs 6 day. Double beds are comfy pillows are excessive but it is nice to have more than needed instead of needing more than you have. Rooms and bathrooms are smaller than at competing national chains but still acceptable. HBO Go is free for the duration of your stay via the TV and YouTube Netflix and Showtime are also available subscription needed via TV. Bathroom has free shamo conditioner body wash body lotion but not very much for quantity per bottle so expect to request additional bottles for longer stays. Lots of wall outlets center lamp 4 on the desk plus a few on the walls themselves. USB power outlets also on center light center alarm clock and desk. Safe in closet fridge in desk cubbies. A C unit works well and is easy to operate just set temperature it will do the rest. Front restaurant is pricy 20 for a burger side item and a pitiful 8 oz Pepsi. The front desk store offers 20 oz Pepsi products 4 each better value still terrible but not as terrible. Staff is nice and helpful if a bit understaffed. Remember to be patient they are doing their best. Detatched meeting halls are nice with lots of space for different activities. My only complaints there is no ethernet available in the rooms the TV has additional source options but they appear to be disabled chromecast computer etc is a no go the housekeeping is a tad in a hurry I was walked in on while in the bathroom and the biggest thing I was on the ground floor and it appeared that whenever someone in a floor above not sure obviously flushed the toilet the water pressure would cause my toilet to demand a sacrifice and sing the song of its people. This strangely also happened with the shower drain but I could not correlate it with any likely activity or timeframe. The toilet was easily in the dozens of times the shower maybe a half dozen. Keep in mind I was not in my room from 10ish am to midnight except to eat and rest for a few minutes. So bear that in mind how often that occurs.
