Before we arrived I called to confirm we would have a roll away bed. I was told that I needed to arrange that when I arrived and there would be a 35 fee. On the Expedia website it said it was 20. I also wanted to confirm that I did not need to bring beach chairs and so I asked if they offered beach chairs and umbrellas. I was told it was a 30 fee but Expedia said it was included with the room. The person on the phone was rude in the way he answered my questions. Not a good first impression. The hotel itself is older like all of the South Beach hotels. It showed its age some. The furniture in the lobby was worn out looking. Some paint was peeling off the side of the building. The pool area and grounds were very clean. The entry way to the hotel from the pool has a weird smell as soon as you walk in. The carpet in the hallways of the hotel had stains. Our room had a pull out couch that had seen better days. The queen bed was ok but not exceptionally comfortable. The bathroom was a good size and clean although the shower door was glass and had a soap scum film that I would not allow in my own home. The only person who worked at the hotel who smiled was the woman who cleaned our room. The front desk employees answered our questions but lacked any kind of attempt to be welcoming. One warning. The room comes with 2 bottles of water on the counter. My teens thought they were complimentary. They are 5. Nice pool area one heated pool and one non heated. Great location if you want to be in South Beach but away from all the craziness. it is a block away from everything South Beach has to offer. We went to a restaurant that is 15 miles away but worth the walk. it is called Yardbird.

My family purchased day passes to have a base from which to change clothes cool off in the pool and have beach access during a day trip to Miami Beach. For 25 the day pass includes access to their pool gym bar and restaurant. It also includes lounge chairs beach towels and umbrellas for pool side. You have to pay to rent chairs umbrellas if you want to sit on the beach. I will start with the disappointing. I did not stay in a room so I can not comment on those but the building exterior common areas lobby walkways were clean but dated. The gym was a TOTAL joke. To classify it as a fitness center is a stretch of gargantuan proportions. Old stained carpet and only a handful of machines in a very tiny room. The part of it that was tiled had old dingy linoleum type flooring. The shower area in the womens changing room consisted of two old fashioned college dormitory type stalls. there is not even a restroom in the gym or womens changing area. You have to go into a totally different building to use the toilet. On a positive note the pool area was pristine and well maintained. There were six of us and they provided us with 3 mini gazebos each of which could fit two lounge chairs. This was a BIG plus because it allowed us to be on an upper deck like structure adjacent to the pool which directly faced the beach allowing us to lounge in the open breeze without sitting in direct sunlight. There was an attendant on duty to provide us with unlimited towels and they have large containers of ice water infused with oranges. There is a public parking lot directly across the street which made it very convenient to go to and from our car as needed. We paid 15 for the day. The hotel sits on Ocean Drive and there are a plethora of restaurants that line the street in immediate walking distance. If you go up one block you will be on Collins Ave which has a long line of retails shops and stores. The only other thing I would add is that the hotel is situated at what I can best describe as the younger hip party end of South Beach. I have been to South Beach before but at the opposite end and the people and environment at that part of South Beach seemed a lot tamer and more family friendly that the people environment and behavior we observed in the immediate vicinity of the Savoy. This is in NO way a reflection of the Savoy or it is guests I am speaking strictly of what we encountered in the immediately surrounding area. Overall despite being grossly disappointed by the workout area and shower facilities I think it was worth the 25. each. we spent to be able to have a base from which to spend the day between the ocean front and the shops restaurants in the area.", "offset": [1156, 1260], "date": "2015-07-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "15dc3b8a-a544-444f-8641-155d4ea88fbd", "sentence": "Avoid this hotel unles you like to be treated poorly. We reserved this hotel in August 2015 for a 1night stay on November 20 requesting a pool or ocean view. This reservation was 3 months in advance so that we could have a nice relaxing on the beach before our first cruise. It was booked through a business partner of ours called Vida Vacations. When we arrived a valet took our car to park it \u2026 we were charged 30 day for parking. Cost to park was never listed anywhere we could find and no alternatives for self parking were offered. Not the first surprise. At check in we were required to supply a credit card where 150 was to be charged and if we did not use any services then it would be removed in 2 3 business days. We asked why they needed to charge 150 now and remove it later if no services were used \u2013 we had never heard of that before they said \u201c all the hotels in Miami Beach did this \u201d. We have no problem with supplying a credit card to cover costs either as they arise or totaled up at check out but we balked at the charges being added upfront especially as we were checking in at 50pm and leaving for port of Miami at 80am. We also did not see anything in our paperwork about this charge and they could n\u2019t find it either. They would not relent. Not a big deal if they actually do remove the charge but certainly not the welcome we expected. We were also charged a 15 day Resort Fee which the earlier paperwork mentioned as a possibility but no amount was mentioned. We were taken to our room which was a nice room although the room and grounds had seen better days however when we opened the drapes we discovered we had a view of a parking lot building in the midst of heavy renovation. It was not only ugly especially given we paid 210 for the room plus 30 parking and 15 resort fee but dirt dust garbage work materials were all over the place. See photos of our view and the garbage right below our 1st floor balcony. We went back to the front desk to request another room and were told by both front desk staff and management there was nothing they could do. No moving us to another room no upgrade offers no refund for parking etc. They said we had paid only for a \u201c standard \u201d room with no guarantee of any view. We had wanted to stay at this hotel because it was on the beach and so therefore paid a lot more than we would have at a hotel near the airport. An airport view would have been much superior to what we gotAfter over an hour of arguing with them we just went back to the room frustrated and disappointed. We believe the Savoy Hotel should have given notice that renovations were in process that could affect our stay. If we had known that we would have booked a different hotel which is I \u2019m sure why they did n\u2019t warn us. Getting our car was an ordeal. It was parked right across the street but when we needed it to go out to dinner it took 5 10 minutes just to find the valet and another 10 15 minutes for the valet to bring it around. We were late for our dinner reservation. Again in the morning we waited for the valet to show up outside which he never did but had to go into the hotel to the front desk TWICE to ask for our car \u2026. about 30 minutes total. We were extremely disappointed in this hotel their attitude and any willingness to accommodate us as well as with their service in general. We would not stay there again or recommend it to anyone else. In fact we \u2019l make sure to tell Trip Advisor family and friends to stay away from The Savoy Hotel Miami Beach.

My husband and I stayed here at the start of August for 8 nights. It was the end of our honeymoon and we were really looking forward to our time in Miami. After visiting San Francisco and Las Vegas I describe this hotel as average. The location is excellent very close to the beach and bars and restaurants. The rooms were very small for two people with our cases there was not much space. Some rooms looked lovely with nice balconies on the website. We did not receive one of those rooms. We had no balcony. It was difficult to dry our swimwear. We did ask about changing rooms twice and the reception staff were very helpful but unfortunately it did not materialize due to it being busy season. This was disappointing for us as being on our honeymoon we envisioned relaxing out on the balcony with a cold beer. The lobby is really nice pool area is nice. All hotel staff were friendly and helpful except for the waiter in the restaurant where on our first morning we had breakfast he was chatty and did a great job but our tip was not enough for him so he handed it back to us. So rude money grabbing and obviously his niceness was fake. I had like to add that it was about 1 short of the suggested amount. We did not eat in the restaurant after that incident a pity because we would have eaten there every day if that incident had not occurred. Wi fi kept dropping worked best in the lobby but not in our room. Last thing the walls in the hotel are paper thin.

My girlfriend and I stayed 3 nights August 2nd4th at The Savoy in South Beach. I was looking for a hotel that was not right in the middle of the action in SB but close enough that we could walk there if we wanted. The Savoy fit the bill perfectly. This is a beautiful historic hotel that is on the incredible South Beach. The pools were clean and refreshing. The staff were very helpful upon check in. Our room was a mini suite with a small kitchen balcony and ocean and pool views. The breakfasts at the restaurant in the hotel were very good. There were only 2 issues that we had the first was that for some reason our room never got cleaned or made up. So we did not get new towels or coffee etc. There was one night that I even specifically asked for a room clean and they still did not clean it. We did not put the do not disturb sign out. HOWEVER when I mentioned this issue at checkout the pleasant person offered us a credit for our troubles. That was very kind and unexpected. We look at the room cleaning as a small hiccup and no big deal. This will absolutely NOT deter us from staying at The Savoy again. Everyone makes mistakes and they adequately fixed theirs. The other VERY small issue was there seemed to be some people on staff that said for your resort fee that we paid that we get a towel chair and umbrella. On another beach day a staff member said the resort fee covers towel and chair no umbrella and that we had to pay 19 for the umbrella. We did not pay this. This was only a VERY minor annoyance.
