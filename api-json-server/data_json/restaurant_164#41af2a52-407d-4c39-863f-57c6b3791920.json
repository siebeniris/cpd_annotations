Stayed here at the start of November for 7 nights with a friend on an All Inclusive basis having stayed at the resort 3 years ago. Last time we stayed Palm Tree Court was under a lot of renovation with the facilities not in use. We wanted to visit again to see the resort in full and just basically spend a week relaxing in the sun. Had another fantastic stay apart from a few minor niggles and would definitely recommend visiting and would stay here again if visiting Dubai. Rooms Rooms were average sized and nicely decorated with a small balcony and all necessary facilities. My only niggles were that wish the minibar was included in the AI package the shower could have been better the beds were a bit hard although big with the pillows too soft and the TV could have done with a few more English speaking channels. Bars RestaurantsThis is where the resort excels. It is also recommend to book restaurants prior to or as soon as you arrive. Every single restaurant was fantastic with standouts being the sports bar for lunch and shooters and Divaz some of the best seafood I have had in my life. for dinner although the Italian was also great the chocolate fondant was outstanding. The Buffet also offers a wide selection. All InclusiveFantastic all inclusive package with a lot included on it. Internationally branded drinks and alcohol served 11 2 canned soft drinks a big thumbs up. a la carte meals in a variety of restaurants for both lunch and dinner. However although some sites say that White Orchid is still included on the AI package it is not although there is 25 off food there for residents of the hotel. It would have been nice to have been informed of this before we went. Pool Beach Areadid not sit around the pool as preferred the slight breeze on the grassy area by the beach and the seats were more spaced out. No matter what time of day we went out we always managed to get a sun lounger. If you do not like birds or cats though it may be best to avoid this area as there is ducks peacocks crows and a few cats that frequent this area. There are also Shetland pony rides for children as well as free albeit very short. beach camel rides adults and children. most days around 5pm. StafStaf were generally very helpful friendly and efficient with Magie buffet and La Traviata and Sunil and the waitress sorry can not remember her name at the Mushref bar being fantastic members of staff as well as the guys who put the umbrellas up at the beach. However felt the staff at the bar near the beach as well as the sports bar were not overly friendly and they seemed to prefer chatting among themselves to serving. Facilities Wide array of facilities including water sports golf horse riding etc most payable as well as a large inflatable assault course out on the water for kids and big kids. did not take part in any of the activities on offer but did walk around the stables and animal corner. The horses are all in excellent condition although the pens that the goats tortoises turtles camels and Falcons are in at the animal corner could do with a bit of an upgrade. There is also a small shopping arcade at the resort jewellers souvenir shops and bizarely a shop selling fur coats. but found this to be very overpriced.", "offset": [1426, 1497], "date": "2015-12-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "6e15de1d-db03-4a6e-a1e2-1b03269523c3", "sentence": "Perfect Lunch at Anchor Bar.

It was also great to be able to use the buffet restaurant and pools st the Palm Tree Court hotel something we really appreciated.

The standard of the hotel is amazing. Had 2 large rooms overlooking the sea marina. The standards of the restaurants are wonderful and being all inc makes so much difference. Personally I did not mind having to sign for drinks meals as this means no band. It is all signed off at the end of holiday. Its very reassuring that all is included premium drinks as it is very expensive in Dubai to drink we stayed in Atlantis which is extortionately expensive to drink. They provide air con transport into Dubai which works really well but you will have to book. Top tip Email the hotel before travel and book your restaurants before you travel. OK now for the bad bit. The legal drinking age in Dubai is 21. This in itself is not such a problem but we had 2 girls 16 and 18. However they were not even allowed in the cocktail bar of the hotel where all the entertainment and live music was. The hotel manager did allow us when we complained to use the sister hotel which had a piano bar n bit boring for young people. So would I go again.

Firstly I would like to say that we had a lovely time whilst spending a week at the hotel. We certainly felt very relaxed and well rested as we are here as time together before the birth of our first child. We had booked based upon the recommendation of friends who return year on year who stated that the all inclusive was fantastic and the a la carte restaurants were excellent. Whilst I would agree with parts there are also other parts that I would very much disagree with. I would like to state that my wife and I when we book a holiday look for a nice resort all inclusive a nice variety of a la carte restaurants somewhere to relax. This will differ vastly from what a lot of readers may want from their holiday and what we will be looking to book in future so I felt it was important to understand our opinions based on what we like. I will start on hotel location. Our driver from the airport made a comment that we would be driving through \u2018 new Dubai \u2019 through \u2018 old Dubai \u2019 and into \u2018 empty Dubai \u2019. This was not an issue for us as we did n\u2019t plan on heading into the main attraction areas and would stay on the resort but you are looking at a 20 25 minute taxi from the hotel back to what the driver described as \u2018 old Dubai \u2019. We never looked into it but the hotel do put on shuttles to the malls etc. But at what frequency and how many stops they make I could not tell you. On arrival at the hotel the grounds looked fantastic. We drove past the equestrian centre and the golf course that both looked great. We also did n\u2019t take advantage of these facilities. The lobby was rather grand and on initial arrival check in was simple and staff very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately a room was not free for us when we arrived as we got here at 080 local time. Staff were good enough to provide us somewhere to leave our bags and left us with a mobile phone that reception would call us on when the room was ready. This was around 120 3 hours earlier than check in timeOnce we arrived at our double sea view room the best I could describe it as in all honesty is just above average. Whilst it is nicely decorated and furnished it \u2019s only big enough I would say for two adults and an infant. The balcony is even smaller. I \u2019m used to large rooms with plenty of facilities but this just was n\u2019t what I expect of a 5 star hotel. I have stayed in travel lodge rooms with similar decor furnishings and facilities. The air con whilst it worked certainly did n\u2019t go to the temperatures it stated. This would be more like a city hotel room rather than a resort for my previous experience. But none the less a room that was more than acceptable for us as we did not plan on spending too much time in there other than sleeping. BIG WARNING check with the provider you are booking with if you are looking at booking all inclusive to check wether you are being booked \u2018 Deluxe \u2019 or \u2018 Ultra \u2019 all inclusive. We booked via Travel republic who made absolutely no mention of two differing types of package and also stated that there were a la carte restaurants included. We were placed on Deluxe all inclusive and if I \u2019m honest it \u2019s pretty naf. Travel republic later told us that it is a standard package which pretty much just includes buffet \u2019s and a couple of smaller restaurants which are more like gastro pubs and bar food. The a la carte restaurants offer 50 off the bill for guests who do not have the a la carte restaurants included. I will attach copies of what is included on both packages via pictures. We were not happy with this as Travel republic had not advertised this correctly and after some back and forth they admitted that the information on their site was incorrect and we fought and got upgraded to the ultra all inclusive package which is what we expected of an all inclusive and thought we would be getting. The facilities at the hotel are great. There are plenty of pools plenty of places to eat lots of bars a nice beach area and from what I can tell lots of activities for families with kids. I would certainly recommend this hotel for people with young children as there are plenty here and all the families seem to be having fun. Sun loungers have really nice comfortable cushions on and towels are included. All of the areas are very clean and well maintained. It \u2019s clear a lot of effort goes into maintaining cleanliness standards here. One of the big issues I have with this hotel is that which ever board basis you are staying you have to sign the bill for each order. Even as all inclusive you can get large bills to sign although staff inform this is for record purposes I still felt like on check out I was going to receive a large bill. None of the restaurants or bars make it perfectly clear what is and what is n\u2019t included and we felt the need to reconfirm what was included in our package at each one before ordering. The need to sign for stuff that is all included seems pointless to me and in all honestly became annoying in the end. The service from staff was inconsistent to say the least. We found some incredibly helpful others not so. Some staff would run your bill for the whole days worth of drinks at the pool others would make you sign each order. Staff at the a la carte restaurants were excellent. Very attentive and polite and nothing was too much. At the buffets smaller restaurants and bars although food service was fairly quick you could be waiting an age for a drink even if you were the only person waiting. Quite often receiving 1 item off the order then waiting 10 minutes for the second whilst someone else was served. Saying this every staff member was incredibly polite and friendly. Staff at reception were also very polite and helpful I may add. Each and everyone one of the a la carte restaurants were excellent. I ca n\u2019t fault the food and service and this was one of the main reasons for booking this hotel and it did n\u2019t disappoint. Whilst the bars and restaurants vary in location between the three hotels here it was not much hassle using the resorts shuttle services to get to each one. I would make sure if you are booking all inclusive that you select the ultra package as you need to eat at the a la carte venues as they were so nice. You are paying for all inclusive so do n\u2019t make a mistake and have to cover half of your bills each night. The only a la carte experience not included is the tepanyaki dinner in the Asian restaurant. This will come at a 50 discount to guests. We took advantage of this and we had an incredible meal and enjoyed the show. The buffets certainly are n\u2019t amongst the largest I \u2019ve seen but they have a fair average selection and you would n\u2019t go hungry. Other facilities that were available such as golf water sports horse riding shooting range sports complex and paintball all looked great. We did not try any of these so would be unfair to comment but they are there to use. Overall I would say this was a nice hotel and would rate my experience here as three and a half stars out of five. As I mentioned earlier there are some really attractive points to this hotel but two differing all inclusive packages a basic room signing for each order and inconsistent service were enough to drop the score in my opinion. I \u2019m sure other people including our friends who return each year will have a different opinion to ours but this is an honest review as I can give based upon what we wanted from our holiday and what we thought we received. I hope this helpsGrant.", "offset": [3194, 3377], "date": "2020-02-29 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}]}
