I stayed at the Fiesta Americana Condesa with two close friends during our Spring Break with the intention of never leaving the hotel reading by the pool going swimming drinking a lot and having a fun and restful time after finishing our senior theses. The Fiesta Americana Condesa did not disappoint. The food was good given it is all inclusive the service was great and we were immediately upgraded to an ocean view room upon arriving. If you go in expecting a 5star resort you will be disappointed. But the staff do everything they can to make you comfortable keeping the drinks flowing and the free included food coming. As college students we were not looking for the traditional spring break spot. We did not want to go clubbing or meet other young people we just wanted to relax. This hotel was the perfect setting and most of the people staying there were older than us either 30somethings traveling with friends or retirees on an annual vacation. Perfect cohort for what we were looking for everyone was very low key and having a good time. I would suggest renting one of the cabanas for a day. It was only like 80USD for a shaded giant bed that overlooks the ocean a nice distance from the busy sounds of the pool and includes lobster cevice a bottle of champagne and two 30minute massages. A great deal. They even accommodated the three of us in one and we had ample space. If you are looking for a nice hotel to barely leave drink plenty eat a lot and just relax I can not recommend this place enough.

We arrived at the FACondesa on Wednesday around 3PM or so check in was pretty easy but what is up with some people getting coronas and some not. I feel like I read some reviews that got this lavish welcoming well we did not. We did get that sales pitch but honestly just say no they will leave you alone as soon as they mention free massage with a breakfast. that is the sales pitch so you are welcome. I was kind of shocked that nobody showed us to our room not to be spoiled but we had NO idea where we were and it does get confusing with all the towers that look alike. Anyway our room had 2 double beds was promised they would put them together but never did. so whatever we do not really care. But I agree most uncomfortable. beds. ever. wow. did not sleep very well the whole time. We decided to try Italian that night. and some people we were with were not dressed properly so they accommodated us in a different restaurant with the same menu the head chef even came and made us a special dish. it was really nice. So just a hint you can eat in any of the restaurants and ask for ANY menu and get it. Just be nice and tip well. After dinner we were exhausted as we had traveled from Boston and up since 230 AM. There was the loudest wedding ever right outside our room on the beach. Normally we would not care but we were SO SO tired and grumpy and just wanted to go to sleep. We begged for a new room was not easy but eventually it got done and we were put on the first floor beach front. let me tell you. that is prime real estate because you can sit and relax on the deck and someone will come offer you drinks again tip well and they will come back and come back and it is awesomeWe started off every morning at the beach amazing and great service. Everyone is so nice the entertainment staff will come introduce themselves so friendly and NOT pushy whatsoever. they say hey you are here to relax all you have to worry about it what to eat and what to drink and they are rightThe breakfast by the pool. not good go to the breakfast place inside. MUCH better. But I have to say we both really enjoyed the lunch by the pool. Pizza place was okay. not sure why people think it is the best ever but hey to each their own. My boyfriend said the hot dogs at the grill were amazing I did not have any but he had 2. I heard they had great wings too at the snack bar but we never made it. The swim up pool bar was great. Kids there early in the morning but when more adults party goers come in they slowly go away. Pedro what can I say. he is the best. He really made us feel special. Angel was great too can not remember the other bartenders but really all good. Pedro was our main man. We honestly had dinner at the Italian place every night because it was THAT good. The best chicken parm lasagna. so good. and if you like eggplant parm get it. They let you have as many dishes as you want just say you want to share a few things. The dessert they bring at the end is nice too on our last night our waiter made us a special strawberry jubilee tableside very nice touch. I did try the wine at some point and thought it was gross but that is most likely because I had rum all day. All in all it was a great trip we had a wonderful time met some nice people and felt attended to.

Let me start my review by stating that the rooms do not mean anything to me as long as the air conditioner works and it is clean. The air conditioner worked just great and the room was spotless every day. The bathrooms were not nearly as bad as everyone complained about. Do you have to step up. Yes. I am 48 and short and I had no problems. I have stayed at the Barceol Palace in the Riviera Maya and the air conditioning worked and the room was clean. You are in Mexico. get out of your romWe traveled as three families with kids 19 14. We had four rooms everyone said the same. One couple upgraded to ocean view and I guess it was nice. We were in room 683 and we had a view of the ocean to the left and the crappy resort next to us straight down. Again I chose to look left or go down to the big beautiful beach. Between us we have stayed at RIU Iberostar Barcelo Secrets etc. All very nice but everyone of us agreed that the service here was by far the best we had ever had. We had many different waiters bartenders etc. Every last one of them was polite and gave great service. We all agreed we would stay there again if we returned to Cancun. I saw many people not tip and it made me mad they deserve it. The restaurants were all good. We ate at the steak house italian restaurant mexican restaurant and hibachi as well as the buffet and Kambu for lunch. My favorite was the steak house and least favorite was the mexican. My fiance liked the mexican with his least favorite the steak house. We all had our favorites but agreed we did not have a bad meal. Was it the caliber of the Barcelo Palace. No. but you are going to pay for that and they require you to dress up for every meal. It was good. The only one you have to dress up for is the Italian but beach wear is not allowed in any of them. I saw many people trying to go in in swimsuit cover ups. only allowed in the buffet and Kambu for lunch. The fish tacos were to die for. Try a drink called the Riviera Maya. so good. I did not feel the drinks were too watered down. My fiance managed to get quite happy drinking long island teas one day and he is not a beginner. Who wants their drink burnt not me. Also try a Purple Rain. very good. We did have a one hour wait for the Italian restaurant but other than that we were always seated right away. The buffet had some really good choices including fresh fried fish one day. I have two very picky girls and they loved the snack bar where they could get chicken nuggets fries and mozarela sticks. If you get pizza order it well done and it is very good. We walked down the beach in both directions and I have to say this was the nicest stretch of beach by far. Plenty of chairs and we never had a hard time finding shade. Security was great and they would not allow any spring breakers who did not belong on the property. We saw them stop several people politely and tell them they needed to walk around the property. The life guards also did a great job with two near drownings while we were there. I think one of them might not have been from our resort but they responded anyway. It was extremely windy. We are all very good swimmers but you have to use your head. Waves are fun but you can not go out over your head. Two guys were so far our all four lifeguards had to go out. Not only are you risking your life you are risking their lives having to save you. Anyone who is been to the ocean knows this is not just Cancun. My sister witnessed a guy drown in Punta Cana. you have to use your head or be with someone who can use theirs.

The resort was under construction at the time which was a mixed blessing a little bit of noise but it meant that there were fewer people over all staying at the resort. Chairs were VERY easy to find or relocate to on a whim and it was easy to get a seat at a restaurant for dinner. The pool side beach drink service was excellent.

There was definitely a police presence in Cancun. We did not experience see or hear of any safety issues while there. Resort nicely updated and very clean.

We were supposed to go to Playa Maroma this summer but when all the reports of seaweed starting coming in I sought a resort north of Puerto Morelos. I scoured TA and FAC had consistently good reviews. Solid choice for families not sure I would visit for girls couples trip. Understated elegance.

Great communication will definitely use them again. Nicely appointed rooms recently updated.

I would agree one of the best AIs with respect to food quality. I am known to despise buffets but I was pleasantly surprised FAC has a good thing going. No reservations for a la carte dinners. Only steak house requires advance reservations and we did not try that one. Also loved casual attire. This is the first resort that I happily ate at the buffet for dinner. Theme nights Mexican Mediterranean Italian. Desserts were exceptional especially the chocolate selections. El Mexicano restaurant was excellent. Rosato restaurant was decent but did not try traditional Italian dishes upgraded to seafood platter. Worth noting lobster is Caribbean vs Maine. Very tasty large portions.

Not much in terms of nightly entertainment but we did enjoy the Mexican and Michael Jackson shows. Beach was filled with seaweed during our visit.

Since its not AI we had to pay for a day pass 90 pesos total for my daughter 13 and I. My 6 year old was free. That also included a 500 pesos food beverage credit. Very nice day beach a little rocky but very little seaweed. Beach food bar service and plenty of palapas. Money well spent. Toward the end of the trip kids and I ventured out in the beach. Seaweed started to dissipate somewhat. Smooth sand waves fantastic. Might be a little rough for little ones non experienced swimmers. Red flags were present the entire trip. The beach two resorts down Casa Magna Mariot had an awesome beach with very little seaweed and that location was a tad calmer with yellow flags. Too bad we discovered that on our last full day. We also took the Ultramar ferry over from Playa Tortugas to visit Isla Mujeres. We opted for the Mia day pass 55 per person which included all food drinks and activities. Girls tried snorkeling and kayaks. Calm beach some seaweed. Although we had a nice adventure could not wait to get back to FAC. My oldest did not get all the hype surrounding Isla.

Something as simple as an anniversary is not celebrated except you are asked at dinner if you are celebrating something. The room are okay. Nothing extra. I will say the I left a note for the mini bar person with a tip and it was stocked with what I requested. There are no snacks in the rooms. No towel animals. What I am getting at is there is nothing special about the resort for the price you pay. I love to be acknowledged and pampered. I paid for ocean front with a king bed and was given an ocean view that they tried to pass off as an ocean front with a queen bed. I knew this was wrong b c I had stayed in the room they tried to give me in a previous visit. Only then was I told the true ocean front only has two queens and I had requested a king so I told them that two queens were okay with me b c the view is more important but we then had to wait a day to move rooms. Just annoying. Food Buffet for lunch and dinner was terrible. Breakfast is breakfast but the service was great. Just a tip they do not keep bacon on the buffet but you can ask for it and they will give it to you. Ridiculous. Italian was very very good get the eggplant parm appetizer it is a bit different than what we are used to but oh so good. Steakhouse was good I asked for a baked pot and was told it was an extra charge. when I rolled my eyes waiter said he had get it for me. Mexican was similar to what you get in the States. Polside food was good and drink runner will get for you if you ask. They did a wonderful job and we tipped appropriately. The hidden gem is the shop in a side hall that has crepes churos and ice cream and another area has more desserts and sushi it is by the gift shop. Pools were clean and pool card is not needed that is a plus. We had no issues with getting a chair in the shade. What I did not like is that they have added Bali beds that almost block the entire view of the ocean. I like to be in the pool and have an ocean view. Entertainment not really the hotels fault but it is the exact same acts we saw a few years back but maybe they do not expect people to repeat their vacations. They did do a very nice job with the 4th of July celebration entertainment. What I wish is that they would communicate more about what is going on maybe on the TV screens or a daily flyer. Most things we found out about were hit or miss. I still felt safe enough to take the city bus to La Isla mall and do some shopping and enjoy the sites.

Just returned yesterday from Cancun This was my 8th trip to the Cancun area and first time staying at FAC first time visit to Cancun for my sisters that traveled with me. I will start with what I did n\u2019t like first. We booked an ocean front room with two double beds. I also requested a roll away and was assured this should be no problem. At check in we find out this was a problem because the rooms are too small. This would have been fine to know in advance because we would have made other arrangements but this was n\u2019t disclosed when I made the reservation. About three weeks before we arrived I emailed the resort via their \u201c contact us \u201d page to find out if there were upgrades available and if so at what cost. I did n\u2019t receive a response. Ultimately we paid for a room upgrade to a Junior Suite at a much greater cost plus we sacrificed the resort credit for the larger room. Essentially 900 additional later we had a room that met our needs but would have absolutely considered other options had we know this would be the case. Before arriving at our room but after check in the guide I do n\u2019t remember his name sat us down to show us the map of the resort I understand this is typical I knew this would ultimately lead to the attempt to have breakfast the next morning to learn additional information and how we could save on excursions timeshare presentation. I explained to him that I appreciated his efforts but we were n\u2019t interested in the breakfast or any other commitments as we had no plans to do much more than enjoy the resort. At this point and seemingly inconvenienced he pointed to the elevators and said \u201c your room is on the 7th floor \u201d. Never have I been to any resort in Cancun that I was n\u2019t escorted to our room my sisters did n\u2019t know any different but I was very disappointed in this lack of service and his dismissive attitude. All that said we arrived at the room and it was very nice with an incredible view. One other point of contention. why in the world would there only be one coffee pod and one coffee cup for three people in a room. To get extra you have to pay for them. what the heck. Yes there is construction going on but nothing that affected the service or the beauty of the resort. The pool bar service both at the bar and the servers were incredibly attentive. We tipped well because it was deserved. Same with our room it was maintained daily and of course we tipped the housekeepers. The food was probably some of the best I \u2019ve every had at an all inclusive. I was wowed by this. For those reading this all inclusive does not include tips. The servers work so hard and I promise you will get better service if you show your appreciation. I am returning to the Cancun area next May with my husband for our anniversary. Will I stay at FAC again or recommend it to others. I am not sure yet. There were many great things about the resort and the service but there were many things that I found very disappointing as well. Above all it felt clean and safe and other than the day of arrival most everything else was very good. We were unable to spend as much money as we would have liked while visiting because we spent so much more than expected upon arrival.", "offset": [231, 282], "date": "2018-10-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "33c84e69-a2d6-433e-b309-8aaa1e1a4dff", "sentence": "Resort is amazing but. First off the resort is amazing and great. Most of the staff were friendly some I wondered if it was the language barrier that made them seem not so friendly. Food was pretty good especially the shrimp tacos by the beach I had those 4 out of the 5 days if they could get rid of those darn birds it would be heaven but I realize that can not happen. We had breakfast everyday in our room ordered room service always prompt and courteous. We always stayed at the top pool so I can not say for the pool bar staff but the servers walking around were great always there to get you that next beverage. Rooms were kept very clean newly renovated rooms were nice and new showers were great. I was nervous about the water not being hot this time because our first visit the water was on the cold side in the shower. Overall I give the resort an A. Now for the but I understand that it is not the resorts fault about the seaweed but I think if each resort maybe designate a tiny portion of their staff every morning to help clean up their portion of the property it would make a world of difference. The beach was definitely not as clean looking this time around. The seaweed brings bugs around and the smell was not the greatest. There seemed to be more trash as well I do not know if that has anything to do with the seaweed bringing up more than usual I really do not know but it was not as beautiful. Secondly I was a bit more concerned coming down this year after hearing about the increase in violence in Cancun this past year. So I was a bit more on alert I guess you could say. The second day we were there we started to go back out to the beach for awhile in the afternoon we noticed a group of 5 7 males 1 was knelt down on the sand getting a beat down. No one approached them I kept looking for someone from the resort to tell them to move along or something but that did not happen. I was surprised that not a single soul did anything about it. Maybe that is how they deal with it in Mexico it might be too dangerous to confront them. Two separate times I seen what I assumed were locals coming off of the resorts property onto the beach. And when they would leave they would go back up the far right steps next to the wedding reception area and disappear. I noticed that they would gather around the lifeguard stand. Some might have been vendors but others did not have anything. I had went up to our room one afternoon while my husband stayed on the beach as I made it up the stairs off of the beach right at the restrooms. two males in street clothes no wrist bands past me. How are they allowed on the property. I understand all of the staff are locals but we do not see them as that when they are working. If they were off duty staff members they should not be allowed to wonder around the resort in there street clothes. It made me very uneasy. I understand that the beach is a public beach but why are they allowed on the property. If they are walking from the street and coming from the side of the property they are walking right past the ground floor rooms right. I think something should be done about this.", "offset": [182, 371], "date": "2018-10-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "ff5366a0-6a5b-4b6d-aabc-5584ef5b2f69", "sentence": "Amazing All Inclusive property.

The front room had several sofas for people to lounge on and a table with 4 chairs for the kids to enjoy room service and a balcony with seating for 2. The bedroom had another lounge and table and a door that led to a large outside terrace with a 2seater chaise lounge seating for 2 and an outdoor jetted tub. Our family and friends were outside as much as we were inside. We ate at every restaurant enjoyed the buffet for all meals and all the food was great. I recommend eating at San Telmo the only restaurant needing a reservation get in line at 2 pm the day before. Ceviches restaurant at the pool has awesome fish tacos. We were there for a wedding and everyone in our party enjoyed their stay and the beach wedding Fiesta put on was wonderful. We booked excursions with Aquaworld that is stationed at the pool. One of the options was doing the waveruner in the lagoon across the street and that was less wavey for us which we liked. My husband worked out in the gym once we ran up down Kukulcan Blvd twice and walked the beach. We came over Thanksgiving break.

This was my families first tip to Cancun and we enjoyed every bit of it. We traveled with our 3 year old and 12 year old sons. When we arrived to the hotel it was immaculate. The employees helped us right away with our bags and directing us upstairs to the concierge. Check in was at 3 pm and we arrived at 8 am we were given our hotel wrist bands so we could eat and enjoy while a room opened up. We got room keys at 1 pm. The room was modern and nice looking with good AC. The one thing that I did not like was that the bathroom was open concept and so to change you had to change in the small bathroom stall or in the stand up shower. The food at the buffet was delicious and everyday there was all types of variety of things. The fruit was amazing. There were a few restaurants to choose from and all tasted good except for the one outside that was an asian fusion. That food was too salty and meat overdone and inedible. MY VERY FAVORITE FOOD came form the outside bar the ceviche bar located right next to the port ship pool. OMG fish tacos shrimp tacos ceviche. Calamari was mind blowing. The service at that bar was on point and we were very well taken care of. I have to give a shout out to those bartenders. Ivan Carlos Eduard. Also a special thanks to the wonderful upstairs pool waiter Angel. The 2 biggest complaints I have is that the pools were relatively cold and were not heated when we arrived the hot tub was cold as well it was not heated at all. there were lots of complaints of the temp of the pool and hot tub and so on the third day we were there the pool started to feel warmer and much better. The kids pool where the pirate ship is is ice cold. secondly there are signs all around the hotel saying that people can not reserve beach chairs and before 10 am all the beach chairs were reserved all day and no one ever came back to sit on them so that was annoying. overall I would def come back.

My husband and I came here for our 20th anniversary. Beautiful resort and very clean. We booked an oceanfront room. The room had a nice balcony which was great for breakfast. The beach was nice and quiet. Only regret is that you have to get your drinks and food before you hit the beach. There \u2019s no food or drink service on the beach. Also for some reason we had to flag down a server whenever we sat around the pool area. The best drinks for us were at the Mexican restaurant. Everywhere else the drinks were sugary and watered down. Now the best food was at the sushi restaurant Mexican restaurant and the big restaurant near the pool the best fried fish I ever tasted. The buffet is decent we liked the breakfast food best especially the coffee fresh tacos. Then there \u2019s the small churos and ice cream shop behind the gift store. Omg I came back to NYC dreaming of warm churos. I wish I got the lady \u2019s name that made them. She was great. The homemade ice cream is delish. We used our 50 credit to book a dinner on the beach. It was nice and romantic. We were served lobster soup risotto and champagne. also a humongous cake. We were surprised to get to our room and see chocolate covered strawberries and wine. Really sweet. Oh and 24 hour room service is included in the all inclusive package which is awesome. A few issues some of the furniture looks outdated in the rooms. The lamp and sheets had stains. Also the room is damp as others have stated. I also did n\u2019t like that I had to ask for things like slippers and itineraries for the week. it seems some guests received and some did n\u2019t. I told a few people we met about the slippers and other things and they said they did n\u2019t have those things in their room either. Also there needs to be more to do at night. The pool and beach closes down early. There are shows but unfortunately if you do n\u2019t receive the right schedule for the week you miss out we did.

It was nice not to have think about it. The pool area did n\u2019t have as many chairs but that did n\u2019t bother me as much. The only thing that I could suggest is having more trash receptacles around the property and restrooms. There was only 1 restroom near the pol beach area and 1 in the lobby.

Breakfast outside at the palapa afforded fresh food and an oceanview table. Despite this being an all inclusive weight gain was not an issue as we were outside for 4 6 hours every day and enjoyed the healthy fresh food. After a swim and breakfast we had head for the beach and pool for some relaxation sunshine more swimming or walking the beach. The beach had red flags flying every day lots of breezy weather and the riptides are evident. A watchful lifeguard would tweet his whistle if he observed anyone who appeared to be struglng. The polside drink service was a pampering luxury the drinks were not overly strong and while I love a frozen margarita the gin an tonics proved to be more refreshing. A special recipe suggested by the waiter was a Pina Colada with Baileys. Wonderful. We tipped and did not mind tipping as we understand how hard the staff works on a small income. Everyone was friendly from the servers to the housekeeping staff to the guy who handed out the towels. Such a friendly and accommodating culture and people.

Bar top up service daily cleaning twice a day. Advice pay little bit more and upgrade to sea View room it worth it. View is absolutely fantastic day and night time. I would like to say HUGE THANKS to Jesus Night Reception Manager who have chosen for us fantastic room with fabulous view. We felt it was noisy in our original room for most people it would be ok but my husband is sleeping very sensitive so we have decided to change the room. Jesus showed us several rooms during the night until we found the room which satisfied us for 100. So special Thanks to Jesus for our sweet dreams in Fiesta Americana3. Spa Centre is absolutely fantastic I have done several massages and beauty treatment. Honestly you ca n\u2019t miss this experience no matter how long you are staying Swedish and Hot Stone Massages are absolutely fabulous and Collagen Facial is very effective.

Definitely will be back for amazing spa experience. If you have room credit SPA centre is the best place where to spend it believe me. Every morning we went to the Beach Gazebo for yoga sessions with Yoga Guru Pada Ras. I would recommend these sessions everyone who came to relax in rejuvenate in Cancun. Pada is extraordinary person and we really enjoyed our morning workouts with fantastic Caribbean view. Christmas Day was unforgettable. Santa came on Harley Davidson surrounded by funny elves and gave every child a hug and gift Hot Wheels for boys and Barbie for girls. Kids were so happy. It has been accompanied with good Christmas music premium tequila tasting for Mums and Dads by the adults pool lots of Christmas related activities cakes on the fantastic seaview background. It was Show in the evening with lots of fantastic food and music. Management we had a chance to meet Fabricio Guest Relationship Manager and Fernanda PR Manager. These are people totally dedicated to their work and striving to provide 100 experience to every individual guest in Fiesta Americana. You can feel that staff respect them as well. We would like to say special thanks to Fabricio and Fernanda for all that attention we have been surrounded during our visit. Especially thanks for your attention to us due us being not very fortunate and have to use the medical services due our stay. But it gave us great experience as well. we have met Doctor contracted by Fiesta Americana Management to provide medical service to the guests. Doctor Antonis came to our room with heavy case equipped with everything he might need apart of MRI machine possibly did proper observation and prescribed the medication to my husband. Very efficient and professional. Dr Antonis did several injections to my husband due muscle spasm and prescribed the medication. Medication has been immediately delivered by Hotel Staff. The insurance claim was also filled quickly without any issues.

The hotel facilities and pool area are very nice and modern and the whole hotel feels very personal and cozy. It also includes a pool bar which is great then you can receive drinks without leaving the pool. One improvement the hotel can do is to heat more the water in the pool because normally it feels a little bit cold. The beach outside the hotel is fantastic and the water is cristal clear blue when there is no seaweed. The first two times we visited the hotel it had also a beach bar but sadly this bar has been removed now. We loved the beach bar a lot and missed it last time. One thing we really like about this hotel is the Cevicher\u00eda restaurant located at the beach. The ceviche there is delicious. The restaurants and bars are high quality and the service is splendid. Our favorite restaurants are the Italian the Asian and the red meat one and also the Cevicher\u00eda during the dayThey also have a sushi station where you can stop for a fast meal. The jacuzi is a very nice place to sit and relax and to get to know new people they had 3 of them but last time there was only working 1 of them and the water had not been heated which affected our experience negatively. We were told that the whole pool area was under a renovation so we hope next time we visit they still provide a bobbling jacuzi with warm water inside. One cute thing is also the Wednesday parade all employees introduce themselves and serve different drinks and foods all around the pool. Very professional and inspiring. They also have a delicious coffee station that offers sweeties icecream churos and crepes. They count as well with a restaurant that offers the typical mexican tacos a pizza station a healthy food station and during the day in the pool they always bring a moving grill. One bad thing is that one time they cut our bracelet at 130 when we checked out so we could n\u2019t consume any alcohol during the last hours of our stay before heading to the airport. But other times it has been possible to keep the bracelet. I think it should be possible to use the all inclusive concept on the final day even after the check out.

First off I want to say that saying this place is paradise is an understatement. This place is heaven on earth. The moment you arrive into the hotel premises you are welcomed by a staff that is like no other in this world. They are knowledgeable and their hospitality is one of a kind. Service in this place is empyrean and the options to choose from is extra mundane. You can have anything and everything your soul craves from angel cake in the morning to devils cake at night. Let me tell you that drinks are also included from buckets of beer to fountains of champagne. Food is never scarce in this kingdom they give you options that will satisfy any craving you ever desired. Pizza in the morning. They got it. Pancakes for dinner. They serve it. My divinely experience started at the Kalmia Restaurante where hostess Lupita greeted us with a delightful smile and with an energy that was radiant and amiable. Lupita assigned us a table where we were welcome by Daniel a spectacular table server waiter that is nothing but the life of the party the person that brings light to your life when a little black cloud lingers around. Helpful and courteous are basic words to describe this fine gentleman he is not just a member of staff but a professional. He truly knows how to make. you feel like family. The food was that of the gods chefs Axel and Leiber are five star chefs with a talent that will make you say this am not just food but art a masterpiece like no other. I want to thank chef and culinary artist Axel personally for he is a genius at his craft and the taste of his creation will leave your taste buds wanting more. He created a seafood platter that had you feeling like Poseidon with the variety of seafood it offered. For dessert chef Lieber created a a fancy serving of peach buns strawberries and an ice cream concoction of mixed berries and cake served atop a plate with a personalized message that read Vuelvan pronto Fiesta Americana Condesa. If you ever wonder how royalty get treated then you MUST visit this hotel and fully experience the wonders it holds. The sea side views are literally heavens gates to say spectacular is to say the least these views are literally glorious. In the morning when you wake up your are welcomed by the sun shining through your balcony window and the sound of the ocean slowly humming in the background. The ocean vibrates this shade of blue that makes you feel your on top of the world looking down at the wonderful sight of the sea. I can say many things about this place none of them negative only positive and if I choose to travel back to Cancun I am definitely staying here again without a doubt.

This resort has always been in my top 3 in cancun hotel zone we have traveled here 20 times. I am sad to say The construction was just to muchTIMESHARE Not to pushy just shut her down right off the bat and did not have any problems. POLThe construction is so loud at the pool and they try to cover it up with even louder music. I understand they have to upgrade hotel but if you like the pool not your place until construction is done. Pool area is so packed that u can only get in a chair by the end of it. The chairs are side by side touching. Pic to follow. This could be different depending on capacity obviously. If the beach was kept nicer I believe more people would have used it. BEACHWe are beach people. They have no beach service. We were told for environmental reason. This made us laugh because the beach is filthy. Picture to follow. Also we had to walk 14 milemeasured by our phonesto the bathroom because we are the type of people that were taught to never go in the waterunlike a lot of folks. Seaweed is an issue everywhere but when we stay at the Royal Resorts the keep on top of it. Here not as much so sometimes the beach is smelly. FODReservations to the Steak house can only be acquired by standing in a line between 2 3pm. This is in a stagnant hallway in about 100 degree temperatures. Why not over the phone you ask I ask the same. Thank goodness for PAMELA at the podium in front of the restaurant and a patient husband. I ordered grilled provolone and there was nothing grilled about it. Was a slab of room temp cheese with grill marks so you know the waiter let it set to long before he brought it. Instead of getting me another order he took it away and said \u201c ok \u201d. steak was tough and my husband had to send his back it was cold my steak was warm but my fries were cold. When they brought his steak back they had microwaved the whole plate so the sides were overcooked and ruined. Remember this is a restaurant my hubby stood in line for a half an hour to get a table in. The waiter was rude and unapologetic. Asian restaurant at the bottom of the buffet area at night was yummy. This was our favorite experience as we had J for our waiter and he entertained us with several magic tricks and just a lively personality. Ask for Js or Juan Jose section if you visit. Italian was very good with great service. Leonardo was a great waiter. Chef came out to inquire about our meals. ABufet breakfast and lunch just average. Lots of cold food. Pizza at upper pool was good. The cook was pleasant and quick. Golberth waiter at the lobby bar was another great asset he took great care of us. One of our favorites for sureROMSVery nice but if you have a teen that wants privacy they will not get it. As the shower and bathroom door are just frosted glass in the middle with no locks. The showers was Half ass warm whichWas ok because it was 100 degrees out. For a couple the room is fine. We had a small balcony with a couple chairs. Not all rooms have a balcony. WIFIPrety much non existent except in lobby restaurant and rooms. In closing I would wait until construction is completed.

This was our 3rd visit to the FAC. We are return visitors due to the overall quality level of service that we received during previous visits also we have become accustomed to when staying at the FAC. However this visit has given us reason to think about retuning for a 4th stay1 We booked an premium Ocean FRONT room King as we splurge for our anniversary celebration. We have had this type room in the past the rooms are on the end of the Luna Sol towers directly face the ocean and enjoy this type of room. When we went to check in the person checking us in said there was no room with a king that they could push the beds together. Then there was a problem with finding a room with a balcony. When we did get to the room on the 7th floor in the Mar tower we were disappointed. The room was more like a premium Ocean View was not what we wanted nor what we had paid for. My husband went back down to the desk armed with a cell phone picture of our previous roms told the desk clerk that this was what we paid for what we expected. We were moved to the Sol Tower room 182. I am not sure why the whole room fiasco had to happen the hotel was no where near capacity during our whole stay. Give people what room they pay for especially when they are loyal repeat visitors2 My husband went to book at San Telmo the day before was second in line early at 150pm. He was told that there were no open times available when we wanted 80 or 830. The only times available were 730 or 90. He was also asked if we were celebrating an special occasion he said Yes our anniversary. We ate at 730. no one else came in at 80 or 830 and the restaurant was empty by the time we finished. So where were the 80 830 reservations. No mention was made of our anniversary. At least the food was excellent though3 When we arrived right after check in we were handed over to the concierge where the Vacation Club was highly suggested to us. This was a waste of our vacation time. I really wanted to go to our room as I had a headache from being up since 430am sitting in front of 3 children under the age of 5 on the plane all the way to Cancun. The hotel would have had better luck with revenue by suggesting spa services or just letting us go up to our room even though it was not the correct room. When we did get to the final room around 40 I took a 3 hour nap to get rid of the headache stres4 Since our previous visits there is no beach service. I am not sure of the reason but there should be someway to come up with a package where you could purchase service for the beach. If there is one no one told us about it. We live 200 miles from the Cancun beach like to spend a majority of time on the beach so this was a big disappointment for us5 Please consider fabric softener for the room towels. SunburnRom Towels Ouch6 The room refrigerator was not restocked everyday and one day the person restocking us asked if it needed to be stocked. Housekeeping was completed but at odd hours. We were out of the room all mornings but would return to the room sometimes around 30pm and the room still had not been cleaned. We try to stay out of the housekeepers way as so not to disturb them. We had to leave notes about what we needed to stock the bar. In my previous reviews I had ranked FAC with a 5 but this time there were too many disappointments to merit that ranking. My husband I know the level of service that this property can provide we were so looking forward to spending our 8th future anniversaries there. We are not pretentious people and are very down to earth. We believe in tipping all staff that we come in to contact with as we realise it is hard work to take care of people on vacation. We did not see much tipping going on with other guests. I will say that the staff that we dealt with were cordial friendly. All of the remodeling looks nice has been a nice upgrade for FAC. We did not have one bad meal the whole time. The restaurants are all exceptional. For these reasons we will consider the FAC for future visits but with apprehension.", "offset": [385, 524], "date": "2019-10-19", "cpt": "3", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 40, "uid": "8740ff12-5aec-4713-a715-d2dfc57aa334", "sentence": "Thank you Fiesta Americana Condesa.

My fiance and I had a wonderful stay back in the beginning of December to celebrate both of our birthdays. Fiesta Americana always goes above and beyond to make sure their guests have the best time and we definitely did. Each time staying at Fiesta it gets better and better. Our trip started great with a smooth check in where we were quickly taken to our room to get our vacation started. We had a garden view room with a balcony which was perfect for us considering we do not spend a lot of time in our room. We spent lots of time by the pool especially the upper pool which is nice and warm. Rodrigo was working hard making sure we never needed a drink during our time in the pool. At the lower pool we had excellent service from Oliver Nemias Elias Rodolpho and Pedro who also never let our cup go empty. The pool entertainment and music was very fun with a nice variety. It seemed to be a little slower atmosphere during the early hours but around 2 pm the action picked up and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We always love the cevicheria during lunch for some shrimp tacos and ceviche however there are plenty of other options to enjoy. You can have burgers hot dogs or nachos at the burger stand. There is also a healthy corner that offers healthier lighter lunch options such as deli sandwiches chips and hummus veggie pitas and more. Dinner was definitely our favorite and we enjoyed so many great meals at fiesta. We ate a few dinners at San Telmo the steakhouse and had J and Jairo as our waiters who were both amazing and are both great at their jobs. Pamela was our host and it was always fun to see her smiling face when we would check in. The sirloin is fantastic and they have many great appetizers to try. We also had a wonderful dinner at Rosato that Chef Adrian prepared for our birthdays. Daniel was our waiter and they both made this one of the best dinners of our lives. do not miss out on Rosato and ask for Daniel as your waiter. Miguel the manager at Rosato made sure to check in on us during our dinners he keeps the restaurant running smoothly. At the sushi stand we had so many good rolls Chef Javier prepared us a few specialty rolls which were super good and spicy. At the outdoor pizza hut we enjoyed many pizzas. The pizza chefs were both amazing always remembering our order when we stopped by. I ca nt remember the daytime pizza chefs name but the evening one Wilbert was great. During the night we would stop by the lobby bar for the nightly entertainment and drinks which was really fun. We met a lot of fun people during this time in the bar. The bartenders Felix Sandro and Richard made sure we were all having a great time and even suggested special drinks for us. One of our favorite times at Fiesta this trip was our early breakfasts at Kambu. It would always be less busy than the main buffet Kalmia and you can see and hear the ocean waves which was super peaceful. Kambu offers all the same options as Kalmia as well which was nice. We had Daniel as our waiter and he was excellent. One of the first days there he brought us special biscuits with jelly and cream cheese that he had prepared for us. After that day he had us hooked and every time he saw us he would bring us a plate. YumChef Josue also prepared us a special lunch at Kambu which was excellent. If we ever ran into him during the day he would always stop to say hi which was really nice. Our trip would not have been as amazing if we did not interact with Fernanda who is an experience maker. She was always checking in on us and making sure our room our birthdays and overall the entire stay was amazing which it was. This was my sixth stay at Fiesta and although I can never imagine the next stay being better than the last it always is.

I am not kidding when I say it was Cirque de Soleil quality on a smaller scale Athletic and amazing. The magic show was great. My 11 year old nephew was in his glory.

Good selection of vodka. Wine ok. Decent basic beer. But I am used to resorts that have a lot of specialty liquors and liquors to the region Mescal for example. This was lacking. Still again it was average. I just would not compare it to top shelf. And what was lost there was made up for by the staff in the bars lounge. They worked the tails off and made good drinks. The restaurants Really all I can say here is that there were not enough of them. There are in my opinion just three specialty restaurants Italian Mexican and Steak and then a buffet and some smaller grab shops. The food and service at the specialty restaurants was good.
