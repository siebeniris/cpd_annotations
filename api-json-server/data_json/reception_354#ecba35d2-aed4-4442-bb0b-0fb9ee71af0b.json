We really enjoyed our time at the Rio Douro hotel and Spa. The location is very remote but is perfect if you meant for a relaxing spa vacation. We went with two small children and were very pleased to have them enjoy the expansive lobby and childrens area within it. The staff were very helpful the room was huge modern and clean. The grounds surrounding the hotel are beautiful we were hoping to be able to enjoy a hike or small nature walk around the property but there was none. It was not a big deal because our days were filled with touring vineyards and enjoying the surrounding roman ruins.", "offset": [343, 406], "date": "2017-05-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "0f7fc181-7096-44be-be01-164c61b347ca", "sentence": "Great hotel to relax and unwind in comfort. It is without doubt a great hotel. We recommend it to those wanting to escape the city and unwind. We came without a car by taxi from Porto which meant we were constrained mostly to the hotel but they have great facilities to keep you occupied gym indoor and outdoor pool spa etc and there are a number of fun and interesting day trips activities that can be arranged at fairly decent prices. The reception staff are extremely helpful and attentive and the food for the most part is good if you have a sweet tooth the desserts are really fantastic. There is also a great wine selection as you might expect in this regionThe rooms are super comfy. Ours had a fantastic panoramic view of the river. All in all we happily spent 3 days here doing nothing but relaxingAlthough the hotel was very clean our room was not cleaned one day. it seems the cleaners come around at a fixed time each day and if you happen to be in your room at the time they do not come back again later. The food in the restaurant is decent but quite pricey for Portuguese standards and given the lack of any other restaurants shops within easy reach it would be nice to have more choice and variety or daily specials after 3 days we ran out of things we wanted to eat. Lunchtime food service was also very slow as it seems they have very few staff on hand during the day.", "offset": [437, 592], "date": "2017-08-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9e380444-b733-4fce-9b37-6f7ccd095fb0", "sentence": "Excellent.

The hotel is set in a truly beautiful location overlooking the Douro valley. The hotel is brand new therefore is clean and has great facilities namely the indoor pool and spa area. The views from the room are wonderful but unfortunately that \u2019s where the good stopsThe service in the hotel was unfortunately well below the standards of a 4 star hotel. Extremely long waits for a drinks up to an hour and very junior staff managing the hotel. When we initially checked in we were urged to book a reservation at the hotel as it was so busy. Much to our surprise we arrived at an almost empty restaurant that night. It was n\u2019t until we were served the food that we really understood why it was empty. It was possibly some of the worst food I have eaten at a hotel let alone a 4 star hotel. Undercoked and completely flavorless we were forced to return to our room and order room service. We spent the rest of our stay eating at the reception cafe which was mainly pizzas and burgers but much better than the restaurant. The spa was also equally underwhelming. We paid for a 1 hour massage that felt rushed and once again conducted by under qualified staff. As with a standard massage they did n\u2019t enquire about pressure or ask if there were any areas we would like them to focus on it was more of a vigorous rub down an expensive one at that. Finally checking out was also an issue when they insisted I did n\u2019t pay for my stay despite having an invoice from the hotel that had told me I had paid. It took me showing my credit card statements before I was \u201c free to go \u201d. It could truly be a wonderful stay if they just improved service and got some more experienced staff.", "offset": [812, 909], "date": "2019-09-11", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "845c062d-5c63-41a4-b4b0-70d3b44e5fde", "sentence": "Exceptional. Everything was perfect or nearly there. The staff were all very helpful and joyous from the front desk to the restaurant bars spa and cleaning staff. Having whatsap concierge service was a highlight requesting support in our room ordering room service and booking the restaurant everything was easy and seamless. The facilities are both clean and beautiful the architect has done a specially good job given the elevation changes across the hotel. Many photo opportunities throughout our stay. Having 24 hour open pools 2 outside and 1 inside and gym was great we took full advantage of that as well. We stayed in a room with both balcony and terrace which was simply amazing very comfortable and functional. There are a few details in the room that will surprise you. Ah the grill service at the rooftop bar was delicious. The lady there was both an excellent cook and a fantastic host. She made sure we had everything prefect. One of the highlights of the stay as well. A very well managed and staffed hotel that makes a priority out of delighting their guests. we will definitely be back. CongratulationsThese are really small details but we feel we should mention anyway to improve the experience even more. During breakfast we feel that they may be understaffed a little as we noticed delays in replenishing scrambled eggs and in serving espressos.
