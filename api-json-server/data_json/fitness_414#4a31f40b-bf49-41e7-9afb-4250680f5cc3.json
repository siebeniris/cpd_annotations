The pool areas are the best I have ever seen. And these pools are huge. There are 3 separate pools. All were warm enough to jump right in. One of the pools has a swim up bar. The resort also does a great job of having pool activities for people to participate in and best of all the staff is not pushy in trying to get people to participate. They have plenty of pool side chairs and lounge areas. My only disappointment with the pool area is that they do not have enough servers offering drinks in the pool areas. Most of the time we just walked to one of the many outdoor bars to get our own drinks. Not a big deal but one reason why I did not give an excellent rating. The food at this resort was good but we did not have anything we would call great. Another reason for the very good rating. We tried most of the different restaurants. The resort has a wide variety of restaurants to choose from though the menus at each restaurant are fairly small. No reservations needed which is a plus. Check the daily activity schedule they put in your room as not every restaurant is open every night. They have a nice small nature are with beautiful plants and animals to view. It has a short walking jogging track which is nice. The workout facility is very nice. Plenty of machines and room to workout however you like. The ocean front beach is beautiful. Plenty of chairs and room to spread out there too. The water is very rough however so if swimming in the ocean is a priority you may not be happy here. The grounds of the hotel are well kept and beautiful. They also have a nice selection of free activities like tennis ping pong pool tables nightly entertainment bars horseback riding in addition to the off resort tours that you can purchase. The rooms are nice. The toilet shower has a clear glass window looking into the bedroom. That is the only room complaint that I have. Even with my spouse a little bathroom privacy is needed from time to time. The minibar in the room was restocked daily. Overall this is a very good resort. do not expect to be wowed by the food or service but you will not be disappointed either.

Just returned from a 7 night stay at Excellence over Easter vacation and had an amazing time. I am not a traveler who returns to places. I enjoy trying new locations but this is a resort I will return too. First I was in Building 10 room 10209. This was an Excellence Club Room. Room Was spotless. House keeping was wonderful. It was nice to have the bed turned down at night. The jacuzi was great. For 35 they came one evening and made a special bubble bath with rose petals and lit candles. I recommend this. The bar in the room was always restocked and there were no problems calling and making requests. The bar was great just for the large amount of bottled water that was left each day and evening for us. We had a balcony that we enjoyed. We did not have an ocean view but I did not miss it. Restaurants. I enjoyed the food. I have celiacs and must eat gluten free. Some menus indicated these items. Some of the waiters were good but there were some communication difficulties. The Excellence Club printed out a Spanish card for me to give the waiter but it was not detailed enough. I did get sick one night. I would recommend making your own translation card and bringing it with you if you have any sort of allergy. I usually do this and did not this time and regretted it. We ate 3 of the 7 nights at the French restaurant out in the courtyard. Loved it. The Grill room was our pick for lunch if you are not in a rush. We also enjoyed their breakfast at the Lobster House. I enjoyed my meal at the Lobster House for dinner. There are a lot of negative reviews but mine was quit yummy. The lunch spot on the beach has a menu that changes daily. The taco day was good. I made a taco salad. Entertainment. We loved everyone that did the entertainment by the main pool. Whirley was so much fun. You must take his water aerobics class everyday. Luz who did the pool game was so funny. Cassandra at bingo was a doll. Yes Bingo play it. A lot of the days you can win certificates to the spa. Best part is you can play in the pool. We liked the night time Michael Jackson show. Tours. we did noneSpa. The 100 minute couples massage was great and it also included the hour long hydro therapy. Nice experience. Cigar Tasting We had a discount from our travel agent so we did that. You can negotiate prices if you buy cigars \u2026 do it. do not pay full price. Gym Clean and beautiful. Pool Never at a loss for a drink. Tip and you will always have what you want. Next time I would bring more tip money. Beach. Water was too rough to go in for me but boy was it beautiful. They clean the seaweed off the beach every morning was a truck which is nice. Age group 35 60. Mostly late 30s while we were there. No kids best partBugs. I brought so much bug spray and did not touch it. The combination of the breeze and every evening the fog the place made it bug free. Now for the negative that would have made this just shy of 5 stars if I had to pick things apart \u2026. Pool chairs. It was very inconsistent. We were at the pool from 7 am until 530pm each day. We left for a brief time and walked back on our stuff being taken away. Meanwhile the chairs around us were empty for hours. it is not right to reserve chairs and leave them empty for hours but that was not the case with us. So just be careful. We were also disappointed because we were told how great the circus show was. When we arrived it was listed for our last night Friday. When Thursday came it was moved to Sunday. I was disappointed that it was canceled and we did not get to see it. Hope all this helps. The day after we returned I called my travel agent and priced Excellence for a return trip. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.", "offset": [1817, 1865], "date": "2015-04-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "e93555d4-f3ed-4a45-aa88-45e07994646b", "sentence": "Great customer service rooms need updating. The staff at the resort are very friendly and provide great customer service. When I arrived the room they gave me had horrible internet access. I needed to wi fi access for work and Even though they were sold out they switched rooms for me and even gave me an upgraded room without having to ask. When leaving My flight was not scheduled to leave until 1 am in the morning and because it was the high season I could not extend my room as they were sold out. But they allowed me to store my bags continue to use the property all afternoon and evening and when I wanted to change or shower they provided me a room to do so. Very hospitable staff. The rooms are a little outdated. Actually The decor does not seem to match. The decor appears to be a mixture of the white washed Nantucket beach look and a modern style. The headboard and dresser are made out of a white washed birch wood. But the chaise lounge looks like it should be at the hard rock down the street. The bathroom tiles and fixtures are modern and nice. But again they do not go with the decor. it is confusing. Not enough outlets in the room to plug in phones or iPads etc. A Cs need upgrading. Rooms are always humid and either freezing or too hot. TV picture was not clear in both rooms I was in. As other reviews have said the beds are hard but still ok. The grounds are nicely kept. For an all inclusive resort The restaurants are pretty good. The Michael Jackson show is the best show and not to be missed. A good variety of ages from late 20s to senior citizens. By midnight there is not much activity anywhere except the casino. Because the resort is way up north the main nightlife area outside of a resort is at least 30 minutes away. You could probably take a cab to the Hard Rock that is about 15 minutes away if you did not rent a car. Btw I rented a car and had absolutely no problems with the roads or Dominican drivers. The new highway makes driving super easy.

The most distinguishing factor of EPC is the remote Atlantic beach setting. This location provides many distinct advantages for exercise and activities. Here is a quick summary if you are active and want to work in a little fun and exercise during your stay. I \u2019l provide a helpful comparison with the other two Excellence resorts in Mexico and the new Excellence El Carmen EEC to be located a short distance from EPC. Excellence resorts have very similar activities and facilities and EPC is no different. It is the oldest of the Excellence facilities and an evolution to architecturally modernize and create new smaller intimate settings will continue with EEC due to open in late 2016. Because it is older EPC offers the best value because of the brand competition anticipated with EEC. Fun and Fitness. It \u2019s all here. AM yoga. Modernized Fitness Center w cardio free weights circuits. The fitness center is not in the main building but is located adjacent to the three 3 tennis courts the Sports Bar mini golf and game areas. Unfortunately like the other Excellence resorts the center does not offer a water view while working out. Unlike the others this resort has a full size basketball court but it is difficult to get a game of 2 on 2 never mind a full court game. Swim the long circuitous pool or the upper cascade pool. Note that the new EEC will have fifteen 15 swimming pools. There is a \u201c secluded \u201d Jacuzi location. Lively water aerobics volleyball beach bocce and archery are offered. Take a pleasant AM bike tour. There are competitive poker billiards table tennis and chess matches. Professional games are shown in a nice Sports Bar with table service and snacks. Beach and Spa. The Mile Spa is located near the Fitness Center but it does not have an ocean view either. One can elect to have beach view massages in a palapa. Best Value Hydrotherapy Session has 10 water treatment stations in a garden setting included w every massage. Use discounts in the daily newsletter. A Water Sports Hut is located at the far southern end of the complex. Sea kayaks surf and boogie boards and a sail boat are available. The beach is located away from a protected coral reef so the waves can be potentially breathtakingly beautiful as well as being rougher than in Mexico. The water is absolutely wonderful. EPC has clear warm ocean water and far less seaweed than in Mexico in the winter months. Be cautiously aware of rip currents. Best of all one take easily walk for miles in either direction as there are few resorts along the way and no barriers or reef outcroppings like in Mexico. Even when EEC opens on a southern beach a few miles away it will not have the tranquil walks that EPC features. Simply spectacular. EPC Differentiators. Besides being the only Excellence with a CASINO. Those comfortable leaving the running machines at the Fitness Center can enjoy a 5k run north along a country road to the Zoetry report. The road features mountain views and the potential for beautiful birds a few chickens and the return of the horseback riders \u2013 especially at sunset. Be aware of a few buses heading to the Playa Sivory and Zoetry Agua resorts. If you \u2019d rather stay on on site EPC has a 10 hectare park the walking trails and fitness stations. Best of all are the flamingos parrots geese and ducks on the various natural pools. The resort provides a few snacks to feed them up close for pictures. The rooms are older colonial style and in room Jacuzis are small here but that all changes at the new modern and amenity filled 500 room Excellence El Carmen EEC. Tennis If you are a player all Excellence resorts feature tennis. EPC has one hard court that the Pro can reserve for lessons and there are also two clay courts. Jonathon provides very good guidance and instruction. His rates for lessons are more than reasonable and he is a terrific instructor. Equipment cold water and towels are available in the tennis hut. Dietary. Health Conscious menus. Every restaurant offers gluten free and vegan options along with fresh seafood local vegetables and exotic fruit selections. Toscana \u2019s breakfast has an all natural selection bar with fresh juice concoctions. Local sustainable lunch options are featured at the beach pavilion. Not on the menu. \u2013 just ask with smile the chef prepared me a surf and turf dinner one night. And finally just like its Mexican counterparts the primary evening activity is romantic dancing. Pre and post show music bookend the nightly entertainment. Those who wish to extend their day can dance until 2 am at the disco Alegria. Action seeking Excellence guests can find friendly competition enjoyable activities and healthy lifestyle options offered at EPC the oldest and original Excellence resort. So until EEC opens I highly recommend those headed to EPC to relax or partake to excess. Make some friends be kind smile and tip often. Helpful. I hope so.

I really can not come up with anything negative to say about the entire stay. Outstanding service staff and grounds. I felt the food was better than at some of the finer restaurant in my hometown. The Flavor Market was probably my favorite. Every night there we had a more than pleasing experience. Full of laughter and drinks with friends and staff staff that used the term family a lot and by the end of your stay you surly feel that way. If I had to say one negative thing it would be I wish the beds were more comfortable. Otherwise we loved our room for what little time we spent in it. LOVED my hammock outside my garden room. Never had an issue getting a chair under an umbrella on the beach and plenty of room polside. The swim up bar was the place to be and my favorite gathering spot to meet new faces and many repeats every day. Which always led to a late day pool volleyball game. I met several return vacationers to the resort. One of which came on the trip with us. Met another couple who was on their 6th stay.

My wife and I stayed 8 days 7 nights at the Punta Cana Excellence couples resort in late June 2016. It was the most wonderful resort or hotel experience we have ever had and we have travelled widely. let us begin with establishing what Excellence per force is as a 450 room resort it is an establishment which can not survive without a significant volume of business. However for Punta Cana that makes it one of the smaller resorts and you will be the beneficiaries of that comparatively smaller scale. The amount of personal attention and friendliness is not merely notable it is unique. And for a fairly small extra fee you can upgrade your experience to the Excellence Club membership. This gives you a reasonable boost in amenities a private north end of the beach with much better service and comfort and additional customer service. But the real advantage is the Excellence Club itself a well staffed air conditioned wood paneled oasis of calm luxury and competence where the wi fi always works premium drinks are always available superior food is served in a non stop flow of bite sized and entree items in a tasteful buffet and the environment is serene. But the most extraordinary feature of the Club is its staff. They are courteous professional always ready to go the extra mile and speak extraordinarily good English. The Concierge in Charge of the club Edwin deserves special mention as the real guarantor and caretaker of the Clubs claim to true Excellence. When we went on a journey in our rental car to Boca de Yuma Edwin not only helped us plan the route and told us what to expect he gave us his direct number at the Excellence Club as well as his personal mobile text number so we could contact him to be our intermediary andor counselor in the event that we encountered any unexpected challenges on our ride. I do not cite this because it was unusual I cite this because it was simply the best single exemplar of the degree of care and concern we invariably experienced when at the Excellence Club. So as should be obvious if you can afford a little more than the standard basic room we recomed you do not upgrade your accommodations but instead select your stay to be as part of the Excellence Club. I can foresee no reason why anyone would regret that choice everyone in the Club was delighted with its service its food its staff its comfort its ambiencethere is also a practical reason to get the Excellence Club membership food. There are quite an array of restaurants on the property. Some of them Mexican Grill Tapas were consistently good particularly so if you stayed with dishes that in large measure were inspired by or had equivalents in the local cuisine. The one repeated unfortunate surprise in this regard was seafood maybe it was just bad luck but I had to go off site for good fish or shellfish. So let us say dinner or lunch was mediocre and you elected not to finish it but find yourself hungry an hour later. You can go to the Excellence Club whenever you want and get some of their invariably good occasionally excellent good. do not have the time to finish is at the Club. No problem take away containers and utensils are there for your convenience. You can not overestimate the freedom of scheduling and ease of mind this produces. We went riding twice did Hydrotherapy once and never had to worry about the scheduling conflicting with meal hours. And we knew that we had get as good or better. a meal at the Club anyhow. In closing all the stuff you have read about the friendly staff the extraordinary beach the fun activities they are all true. If you are more of a pool sports swim up bar kind of vacationer have no fear. Excellence Punta Cana has plenty for you to do and an extremely congenial clientele as well as staff. If I could give it a sixth star I would. Because although no 450 room resort can match the kind of experience you get at the 40rom luxe resorts habituated by celebrities and Fortune 500 CEOs.

Stayed with my husband for 10 nights from 3rd October for our anniversary. My first And most important point may sound a little unfair but for anyone who has previously stayed at Excellence Playa Mujeres may be considering EPC \u2026. Do n\u2019t. Unfortunately you will be very disappointed. I do n\u2019t think it \u2019s fair for me to talk about EPM on this review but if you do want any further information regarding how they compared then I \u2019m happy to elaborate directly with you. Now for EPC As plenty of other reviewers have mentioned we were also greeted with a drink cool flannel on arrival. Yes this was nice. although not really individual special treatment because they actually have a specific front desk for this outside the hotel \u2013 everybody that arrives will get one. Check in was pretty straight forward our bags were taken to our room for us within minutes of us opening the door. We were in room 9207 which is a little further than we \u2019d have liked but really not that far from anything once you figure out the quickest way. This room faced a pond which looks like it could do with a bit of neatening up really. The room itself was large with the whirlpool bath in the middle like you see in the photos. All the usual amenities as advertised. Two lamps a plug socket did n\u2019t work I did n\u2019t report it because it really did n\u2019t bother us at the time \u2013 plenty of other lights. Maid service was daily with new linens towels each day. Two days we had \u201c towel art \u201d which was nice. The mini bar service was replenished daily and they also swapped some top shelf beverages for us after our second request. The turn down service was each night although we only got chocolates 7 of the 10 nights. Overall we were happy with the room staff what they provided. Restaurants. We tried Spice The Grill Flavour Market Toscana Oregano in the evenings. They were all of equal quality in our opinion which was to say they were all very edible hot service was quick but the food was n\u2019t exactly fantastic. Although we did n\u2019t expect it to be gourmet. The choice could \u2019ve been wider in each venue too. We had room service a couple of evenings because there was a much better range to choose from. And nicer wine delivered with the fodBreakfast was at The Lobster House most mornings which we originally preferred because it \u2019s A la carte but we did go into Toscana for the last 2 mornings found that the choice quality was actually so much better with the buffet. Shame we did n\u2019t realise this to start with so I \u2019d definitely recommend you try both early on to see what you prefer. Lunchtime we did Las Olas each day. We enjoyed the themes each day like \u201c Taco fest \u201d \u201c Rock burgers \u201d. food was good enough for lunch as were the takeaway pizzas from there. I did expect to see some live music there but unfortunately they play music through the speakers instead. The beach was lovely sand very soft. Seaweed cleared early on each day. The grounds around the hotel seem to be regularly maintained ie grass cut most days leaves cleared up. The d\u00e9cor though around the place outdoors corridors building pool area does n\u2019t reflect 5 at all. It does look lovely on photos but when you see it in person you will also notice this. The bars were plentiful lots of cocktail choice but I did n\u2019t notice until the day we were leaving that the Martini Bar actually has \u201c Proper \u201d cocktails not just the colourful holiday ones that are on offer in the other bars. Polside waiter service was a bit inconsistent a couple of days we hardly saw a waiter that was available to take our order offer us replenishments. Tips We tipped each service regardless of standard. This is purely because we figured that it \u2019s a small cost to us but a nice tip for the staff who apparently do n\u2019t earn that much. Mainly 2 breakfast 1 per drinks round 5 evening meal 2 maid service alternating with the turn down service. We wanted to tip the mini bar man but as he comes 2nd in a line of 3 we do n\u2019t know if he ever received them. Entertainment staff If you want a hotel where the staff encourage you to take part in all the activities then you will be fine here. If like us though you prefer taking your time relaxing spectating on the fun then you may find that you get the cold shoulder from the animation team. Shame really because we ended up moving to the quieter end of the pool just so we did n\u2019t feel unwelcome. look like stick in the muds. We are young in our 30s enjoy a good time but we just like to pick choose what we want to do some activities there were so many over powering groups so we did n\u2019t want to do them. that \u2019s all. We also watched one of the games a dancing contest to shaky shaky shaky \u2026 it \u2019s in my nightmares now. one woman did n\u2019t really have much rhythm but was giving it a good go but the staff said some snidey remarks about her which her husband did n\u2019t like. I really felt for them actually it put us off doing any more activities after seeing that. They are meant to make you feel welcome not feel bad about yourself. Evening entertainment. We started our evenings a Caf\u00e9 kafe for a couple of drinks before our meal. After the meal we came back to the plaza where there would usually be an act before the main show then the act afterwards too. The service here was pretty inconsistent did n\u2019t always get fast service or nuts. I also got asked to remove my leg from resting on a chair because their manager said I looked bad. I had awful mozy bites on the back which I was trying not to sit on. Bear in mind that this was me sat there quietly with my husband enjoying the show \u2026 not. might I add as part of a loud drunken overpowering group like most. I was wearing a shorts dress too so my modesty was n\u2019t a problem. I was pretty embarrassed as you can imagine. It was an unnecessary comment from her really. Each show in the evening seemed rather rushed fraught. There was no relaxing time where you could just watch a singer chill it was n\u2019t romantic apart from the sax player before the show some nights but even then it tended to go straight from one act to another seemed a bit desperate. Not relaxing. There were some power outages in the night and a couple in the day. No bigie really but worth mentioning. The Wi Fi for us was fine considering it \u2019s a resort hotel we were happy with it. Obviously if you want to stream movies you may have a problem but general surfing uploading was ok. Mosquitos Absolutely terrible at this time of year. Especially after a downfall. They do not care if you are wearing det or any protection \u2013 they still bite. No respite from them at all. Not really the hotel \u2019s fault. and they did spray extra pesticides after the rain but if you \u2019re travelling to Punta Cana you might want to consider the mozys. Tips. Do n\u2019t look at weather reports before hand \u2013 they will show cloud rain but it is actually really lovely each day give or take the odd downpour which moves quick enough. Shops on the beach on the left if you need swimwear etc. Do n\u2019t get ripped off \u2013 I paid a 3rd of what they quoted price wise. Fave drinks. Mud Slide cocktail mojitos. Fave food Phily cheese steak from room service. Choc cake also from room service. Fave daytime location Hot tub at the far end. Overall \u2013 I ca n\u2019t say we had a bad time but we did n\u2019t have an amazing time either. Not sure if our expectations may have been too high and without the odd little niggle things may have been that bit nicer who knows \u2026. The one thing I know for certain is that the star rating means nothing because it varies so much from country to country. On checkout they do say \u201c See you next week \u201d \u2026 to everyone \u2026 unfortunately I can say that they wo n\u2019t be seeing us again think we will either be back to Mexico or try a different type of holiday for a change.", "offset": [4417, 4596], "date": "2016-10-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "e6142989-f0c4-4d65-bf4c-041c555e775b", "sentence": "We just returned from a 7 day stay.

King size bed hot tub. yes in a bit of a strange place minibar with four cans of beer soft drinks nuts biscuits and crackers all replenished daily also full bottles of whisky rum and vodka. Also there was a coffee maker rain shower double wash basins and separate toilet. The main buffet restaurant was open for breakfast and lunch and very good. You could also use the Lobster House for a la carte breakfast and the Oregano for fabulous a la carte lunch over the pool or the Las Olas for lunch on the beach. The other a la cartes for dinner did not need any reservations only Spice the Asian if you want the Tepanyaki which is highly recommended. As we stayed 14 nights we used them all can not fault any but our two favourites were Chez Isabele the French restaurant and The Grill where the stand out was the Beef Rib. The pool meanders all the way from the activity part through to the swim up bar and down to the quiet part near the Sol Bar no deep end as the height remains around five feet all the way. No problems with sunbeds all well spaced out and a lot of doubles available no shortage of towels no card needed and the same on the beach. You can walk for more than a mile either way on the hard sand by the sea which is a bit choppy and has quite a strong current but is a must there is also a boardwalk along the length of the hotel. The temperature of the water in both the pool and sea was warm. No vendors come around pestering you and there are shops. either end of the hotel as well as in the front driveway. Also out front is a lovely park with Flamingos that will eat out of your hand ducks birds egret and fishes also there is an IguanaThe evening entertainment was ok we really enjoyed the Circus as well as Michael Jackson. We did not take part in any daytime activity or excursion as we just wanted to chill completely. There is a majority of Americans in the hotel. mostly ok but some especially groups can get rather loud. The overall service throughout the hotel was very good and we would like a special mention to. Gorj the tepanyaki chef in Spice and his able assistant Gustavo. Eliziqua first class service in Chez Isabele. Braindon from Sol Bar Jose who was in Spice and Oregano whose baby is due very soon our best wishes and the friendly wine waiter Thomas who delivered a chilled bottle of Rose wine to our room every evening. Lastly Vanessa from Concierge great job you and Junior with the deep deep voice and remembered our names. The hotel has been modernised and changed quite a bit since our last visit but is worthy of our 5 star rating the only negative would be the boring background music in the Kitchen Table the buffet restaurant.

As I \u2019m arriving back from the debacle that was the hair and make up trying not to have a melt down my husband informs me the pants to his suit are missing. Multiple attempts were made with the resort to find these pants. They kept saying \u201c Laundry says no \u201d they kept saying WE did n\u2019t bring the pants they even asked to check our room which we let them. It was not until one of our guests went into the Excellence club lounge full of newcomers were the pants magically found. 10 minutes AFTER our cocktail hour had begun. This took over an hour and I was only able to redo parts of my makeup. I went to put on my dress it fell off the hanger normally not an issue but the plastic they applied after they steamed was stapled to my dress and ripped a hole the size of a half dollar coin in the tulle in the front of my dress. I made sure to email right away so it was time stamped. To try and make things better they suggested moving things back and hour. Allow us some time to get ready since we now had pants and I was redoing hair and makeup. We accepted. Had we known we were sacrificing photos and light we would NOT have accepted. So now I have half fixed makeup half fixed hair and a hole in the front of my dress I \u2019m hoping is n\u2019t noticeable in photos but at least my husband can wear his suit. The Wedding Cocktail Reception Our friends say it was good. By the time we arrived the food had been out for an hour. Explained aboveThe Wedding Ceremony Music We very clearly filled out their form that said no ring exchange and we have our own vows to read we very clearly had our specific music verified before the ceremony. Not only did they try and do a ring exchange to which we were standing there going um \u2026. okay bop here \u2019s the ring already on your finger because we said NO ring exchange but had we not had a fun a participating crowd he would have pronounced us man and wife without us being able to read our vows I was able to interrupt the minister to tell him we have vows. The music was very specific and meant to be a surprise for our guests. They even had an extra hour to test it. But they chose to test it while we were all walking towards the venue ruining the screech surprise into star wars that was meant to be my husbands walk out music. The Wedding Reception. We were told we could not have dinner on the beach as someone else had that. We never did see them. There was zero breeze at las olas. The food was delicious service was great. We had a couple friends need to show up late as they sat down our wedding planner tried to tell us we would have to pay for them we had already paid for them outside of everyone wearing individual name tags to match with nameplates we had paid for the 21 full course meals. A piece of our cake topper was lost but quickly found. The Wedding Photography. After ceremony before the photographer even took a photo he told us there was not good lighting because we pushed back an hour and might need to try new photos ANOTHER DAY. We had 1 shot at this there is no try again option for us. He was awful every photo he took he would shake his head disapprovingly. We kept saying we wanted photos on the beach but he spent all the time in the garden area with the birds. I kept saying we do n\u2019t like birds I do n\u2019t like birds we want the beach. 25 minutes of photos he took with us saying please beach photos. Then I look and my husbands flower had been upside down in almost all of the photos. This was verified when we went to review the photos and out of the 25 minutes of photos there were maybe 4 from the entire garden shoot. He told us to come back in 2 days to review the photos at 1 pm. We did and the front desk acted as if they did n\u2019t even know who were were. We wasted another hour while the photos rendered. Everyone looked like a flood lamp was on us. They were awful. What seemed to be the manager she accused me of meeting with her saying she explained this would happen I have never met that person before in my life nor had anyone reviewed photos packages or anything with me other than the verified emails I had with my wedding planner there. There was no option to redo the photos our friends were all leaving the dress had been trashed they offered us 6 non ceremony photos and the RAW files of all 24 chosen to try and save at least something I am a designer and I had 2 photographer friends with me. These photos even after trying to salvage them have pictures of my awful hair awful makeup and awful lighting. And they acted as if we should be thankful. Activities If they happen they happen late only last about 30 minutes and you really have to know to look for the people in green shirts. One of the reasons we specifically picked this resort was they advertised volleyball we did n\u2019t get to play sand even once one time because we were waiting on trying to talk to manager. we were told \u201c no \u201d when we asked for volleyball to play on the beach and they only allowed pool volleyball for a short time. And they would take the balls and leave you with a regular volleyball in the pool but would eventually take that too. I would say only half of the activities on the sheet provided actually happened. THE POOLS CLOSE AT 7PM. Period. All the activities last no more than an hour that includes night time activities like karaoke about 45 minutes. Beach. Don\u2019t let people sugar coat this for you. The seaweed is everywhere all the time. The resort does their best but its pouring in. You can avoid it in photos because there is a 5 ft drop off. The beach was dangerous while we were there and we witnessed 2 rescues from undertow. Kudos to beach maintenance staff for being on it there was not a lifeguard on duty. They use huge machinery to clear off seaweed and the drop off was much worse on Excellence Club side when we were there right up to the beach beds. Beach Service The beach service is hit or miss best to plan on getting your own drinks I had n\u2019t been offered a drink on the beach until my 5th day there on excellence side. I went to beach everyday. Bar Service Generally people were friendly and helpful. Our group all brought a few hundred dollars to tip as well. The excellence club bars and service seemed bothered if you came to them for a drink nor did they want to serve you elsewhere so it was definitely disappointing to travel farther for a drink when you thought you were paying for the private bar. We heard this from multiple people in and out of our group. Restaurants. Also one of the main reasons for choosing this resort and in my opinion one of only two saving graces. The food was delicious everywhere for the most part and the staff was great. The best service and food by far was Chez Isabele. shout out to Gustavo best server we had there although the consistency of the food was different from day to day. Make time for the hibachi. Magna or kitchen for breakfast is great. The coconut shrimp is what to have at Lobster House and the lobster there was better than the one at Magna which was mash potato consistency. Room Service Unles you \u2019re getting a pizza at 3 am do n\u2019t bother. Our food went to waste a couple of times as it took over an hour and we had scheduled multiple meetings with management of resort. We once ordered room service then 20 minutes later our friends ordered pool side pizza. 20 more minutes our friends had their pizzas and it would be another 30 minutes before our room service. Our \u201c breakfast in bed \u201d had eggshells in the over cooked eggs and hair in the waffles. We got up and went to Magna instead. Special Amenities. Anniversary Honeymoon We had this along with a few of our guests and it seems about half of us got what we were supposed to get half of the time. I think people are still waiting on their strawberries. The time of everything was inconsistent as well \u2026. yes you \u2019l get your pastries but at a very strange hour. The romantic dinner is also not one you really get to choose by the time of your arrival there \u2019s usually only one or two options for you none of which are available for the beach which is also misleading. Entertainment Staff The second saving grace. Granted it \u2019s the ONLY thing open todo and it \u2019s what you make of it but their entertainment staff goes all out. Circus was incredible. Same with their staff that sets up all of the \u201c days \u201d and sets etc. awesome job. Cleaning They tell you they close the pools at 7 to chemically treat them. I watched them chemically treat them in the mornings including taking a squeegee to the pool floors wiping down all the beds and pool beds. In general with exception of the bar staff which we found to be lazy everyone on that resort is moving. Management of Resort. Because of the management instead of just being able to move on from our experience this dragged on for every single day the rest of our trip. We felt the target on our backs. We were supposed to meet at 2 pm we would show up they cancelled come back at 530 cancelled. We came back the manager was in a meeting try again tomorrow morning. This went on for 4 more meetings until our last day. On our last day 2 hours before our shuttle arrived a completely random woman whom we \u2019d never met offered us a complimentary 2 night stay for myself and my husband and my sister and brother in law and a 450 refund which is n\u2019t even a fraction of what we paid for any of it. It was one of the most stressful vacations I \u2019ve ever had. I am trying to edit our wedding photos upset each time looking at them. And I got to pay for this. While my sister and brother in law may use their 2 nights I \u2019m afraid I \u2019m still so upset by how stressful it all was and that I re live it with these photos \u2026 I just ca n\u2019t imagine giving them one more penny quite the opposite I truly implore people NOT to spend their money here. After I have shared parts of my experience I have received messages letting people know I \u2019m not the only one. I \u2019m sorry to hear this. I hope my experience allows EPC to do better for future bride although I STRONGLY encourage you not to get married here.", "offset": [6814, 6894], "date": "2018-09-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "44e3ad0f-1162-4e1f-9f6f-ce68ed3e622f", "sentence": "First all inclusive at a beautiful resort with amazing staff. I went to Excellence Punta Cana during December 2018 for 6 days with my boyfriend both in our mid 20s. It was our first all inclusive experience so our expectations were high based on reviews I have read on Trip Advisor. I highly suggest booking through Trip Central or a travel agency as they provide you the full package including support and shuttle service to and from the airport. Upon arrival at the PUJ airport we got on a shuttle and EPC was the last stop so it took about 45 minutes to get to there from the airport. Once we got to EPC hotel we were greeted with a glass of champagne and a debrief on our stay and some hotel policies with a little tour of the resort and then final stop at our suite. We stayed at the Excellence Club Jr Suite Swim Up View. Some highlights of the resort WiFi across the resort even in the beach area Service was amazing all staff was approachable friendly and accommodating Some good options for food we enjoyed The Grill and Magna for dinner. We were always left filling full and never hungry Private beach felt exclusive and relaxing We wanted an hour later check out which went smoothly with an Excellence Club perk Full bottle top shelf liquors was amazing again with Excellence Club perk Room service was fast and easySome not so great Our room AC was terrible so it made our clothes and sheets damped and humid Entertainment the shows felt repetitive after a few nights Activity options were limited there was a nice gym basketball court and tennis court but the bikes were only available during a certain period of time and the pool activities were also repetitiveOveral an amazing trip and highly recommended for first timers.

Excellence Punta Cana is a beautiful property along the Macao beach shoreline. The hotel property is absolutely beautiful and the landscaping team does an amazing job working tirelessly to maintain it and keeping the beach free of seaweed. We stayed in the non club section of the hotel for the New Years Eve and beginning of January holiday. The hotel did an outstanding job with the New Years celebration and we LOVED the fireworks. it is evident to see how much pride the staff has in presenting the high standards of the Excellence hotel brand. My Husband I had an oceanview room which was kept beautifully by the housekeeping staff and of course we love the robe slippers at Excellence to enjoy during our stay. it is a great property and family friendly for those with adult children looking for a family trip not in a kid environment. What made the stay exceptional was the team members. Francel a member of the entertainment team was simply outstanding. I do not think i spoke to a single person who had not met him during their stay. He goes above beyond to ensure the guests love their time at Excellence. He is a treasure and sets a high standard for hospitality others should be trained to follow his example. I also want to recognize Will Front Desk reception. I was simply amazed how he remembered my name every day as I passed by on my way to the gym. He meets hundreds of guests weekly and yet remembers all of us. Again this is the standard all team members should folowI also wanted to recognize Dino Sports bar for his great service and jokes. He made my husbands day every day with his smile and laughs. Kudos to Dioniso Lobster House also for his prompt service warmth. SO why a 4 star and not a 5. This will sound petty but. the dress code of the other guests. My husband I follow dress code guidelines for the hotel. Dress pants for dinner for gentlemen and casual elegance for women. Dress code was completely ignored by countless guests and was overloked permitted by the hotel team members. Men in jeans sneakers for dinner jeans are NOT pant. they are jeans. Baseball caps worn indoors for dinner. Women in jeans and cut off shorts for dinner as well. Even at Las Olas outdoor grill on the beach. dress code states beach cover ups for women and men with t shirts for lunch. Yet bare chested men and women with beach towels wrapped around them were permitted without question. Why have a dress code if you are not going to enforce it. Is the hotel staff so scared of offending those who are inappropriately dressed. I can tell you this is not permitted at either of the Excellence properties in Mexico. Sad to say it is a huge reason we will not return to EPC. I will not spend 60 a night to be seated next to a man in jeans sneakers t shirt for dinner. it is a shame. the staff is outstanding and the property is lovely. Now if this is not a big deal to you then enjoy and say hello to these great people.

My latest advice to all my friends getting ready to turn 50 is to do it on the beach. My husband surprised me w this trip and I \u2019l have to say it was amazing from start to finish. We stayed at the Excellence Punta Cana El Carmean resort and it met every expectation and beyond. Highly recommend paying extra doing the excellence club option includes a hydra spa visit premium beach area set up exceptional service private restaurant bar area special check in. Plus access to premium lodgings roof top terrace options. The other reason I feel this trip set itself apart from others was the service. Honestly hands down the Best we have ever experienced. Why. The people that the Excellence resort have hired. Everywhere we would go on the resort there was someone that was Exceptional. We spent most of our time the beach b c of our love for the ocean and the experience there was made so much more enjoyable by our new friends which waited on our every need sincerely wanted to make our trip special. Our beach attendants Wilkins Montila Adriano made my 50th birthday one I \u2019l never forget. Wilkins the man in charge organized a surprise cake champagne toast as we were leaving for the day. This was done wo request from my husband. Wilkins as he would everyday ask about us and our plans for the day upon arrival to the beach. They sang to me in English Spanish and then each said a special sentiment to me in there best English. Truly a gift of pure kindness I \u2019l never forget. Thank you As I sit here and reflect on our trip and experience. What sets this resort apart was the people. Oscar who worked as a server always cheerful and fun. Some of of our other favorites were. Melvi security Dorka Ana Driselda spa and Felix bar. The Michael Jackson show was very entertaining. And truly believe that MJ is not dead and lives in Punta Cana. Do n\u2019t miss this show. Also Loved that they had what we called \u201c professional partiers \u201c to get people dancing loosen up. But watch out for the one who dances like an aerobics instructor b c he is and will put your dancing abilities to a test. My other piece of advice would be to brush up on your Spanish before you go.

The ride up to the main lobby is very beautiful and passes the Spa and some small shops that gave us a very \u201c Caribbean \u201d feel also there is a lovely landscaped botanical garden and lake off to the side which is a great walk to take during your stay with many tropical animals that beg to be fed. The lobby is \u201c small \u201d yet extremely beautiful and functional and the property is well laid out and gives the feeling of a smaller resort yet it has over 400 romsAs you reach the Main Lobby you are greeted by the smiling bellmen \u2013 Erick thank you for the ride from El Carmen. Victor Abraham and others ready to help and remember your nameWe also were met by the new GM Manuela Fahringer such a lovely and friendly person and so proud of her staff and the \u201c paradise \u201d. she calls work. Also on hand were her Assistant GM Gagandep Singh always around the property wanting to help Marlon the Chief Concierge friendly and a gentle giant with such a great smile and Senor Ramos the Reservations Manager who smiles and likes to dance. Thanks also to Santa Marcos \u2013. Excellence Club ConciergesThe Wait and Bar Staff were fantastic and just to name a few \u2013 Eliezer who seemed to be everywhere Edgar at the Martini Bar Carolina at The Club Solomon the baseball pitcher Richard Eddy Laedrikis at The Kitchen Juan Carlos Rosana Rincon and Yazmine at the Club Pool JC Melvin Ines at the Club Beach Ruth the Hostess who seemed to work every shift and so many more as always it is impossible to name everyone who were so friendly and helpful but we \u2019l do better next timeThe Entertainment Staff were everywhere and getting guests involved in activities or not and the shows \u2013 although they were similar at other Excellence resorts \u2013 were great. Thanks to Luz Jose and the rest of the Entertainment Team. Special thanks to Rosel the Tennis Pro can not wait to get back and hit with you again. Johnathan a great jovial guy with a big smile was on bike tour duty but seemed to miss his tennis teaching days. Thanks for the new tennis balls from Manuela and her assistant hope they continue to be part of the program. The food was great and XPC offers a wide variety the Kitchen breakfast and lunch buffets were delicious and let the Chefs make you anything you desire. The only meal \u201c issue \u201d we had was at Spice \u2013 good but not \u201c excelente \u201d. Magna \u2013 exclusively for Club guests was fantastic you can dine al fresco and it has a nice usually EMPTY bar as well. We had great meals at Agave Flavor Market and Chez Isabele. The Aroma Caf\u00e9 was a good spot for early morning and late night coffees ice cream and snacks. Las Olas has some great lunch selections and their fish sandwich was delicious. We did not try The Grill but many guests said it was very good nor Oregano or the Lobster House we will try them when we return in November. The Beach and Pool areas lots of pools were beautiful and the resort grounds magnificent and well cared for make sure to take the time and walk the entire property not only the gardens. Thanks to the Landscape Crew for keeping XPC so beautifulThe Housekeeping Team is great and many times we find extra nice \u201c touches \u201d in our room the rooms are small see comments below but clean and the staff keep on top of things but do not interfere in your private times. The Fitness Center is very nicely equipped and the staff friendly and keep the facility spotless. The Spa is smaller than at other Excellence resorts but functional and service is good. Overall the Excellence Punta Cana is \u201c excelente \u201d. However as we compare versus other resorts it does have some \u201c issues \u201d. There are two 2 that stood out to us 1 the rooms are lacking storage for clothing although the closet is sufficient to hang clothes drawers to put away clothes are non existent. The bathroom is OK but the shower lacks the \u201c Excellence pizzazz \u201d like at other Excellence resorts it is NOT tiled and the shower heads are just OK but need \u201c help \u201d and. 2 the biggest issue for us is the Excellence Club. As Club guests and used to the great Club setting at Riviera Cancun the Club at Punta Cana needs a lot of help. While we were there Manuela looked at the reception Club area and I think she agrees it needs a more friendly atmosphere there are three 3 separated \u201c rooms \u201d only two for guest seating so guests can not \u201c mingle \u201d also the bar and food \u201c area \u201d is NOT \u201c excelente \u201d. The Magna reserved for Club guests only has a cozy bar and seating areas for Club guests but it also needs to be upgraded to make it a CASUAL spot for Club guests to meet and \u201c mingle \u201d and enjoy a cocktail and snacks however it is a short walk from the Club rooms but it may work. We will leave the logistics to the experts but it makes you wonder why ownership does not get ideas from their guests \u2013 especially if you are frequent repeat guests at other Excellence resorts or use concepts that have worked so well at other Excellence resortsThese \u201c issues \u201d aside we thoroughly enjoyed our new \u201c home at Excellence Punta Cana. The Management Team the Staff the food and the ambiance was terrific. In short we loved Excellence Punta Cana.

My husband and I went to Excellence Punta Cana at the end of May This was our first time at this resort but we have previously been at some of the other Excellence resorts Playa Mujeres and Riviera Cancun. We really loved our stay in Punta Cana and we will come back. The resort is beautiful and the layout is one of the best that we have seen as from most terraces restaurants and pools you get a gorgeous view of the beach and the sea. Best of all the service was exceptional. The staff at the pool and at the evening theater kept making many rounds and asking if we want drinks. They were all happy and polite. We were very impressed with Aleksandra the waiter at the evening theater. She worked tirelessly was so effective and so professional. We loved her. We have to also thank Reynaldo at the Excellence pool for always bringing a smile on our faces as well as Rosy at the Excellence beach who was so professional and effective. A big thank you to Dino at the sports bar. He was attentive professional and had a great sense of humor. Also a very big thank you to Ramona the hostess at The Grill restaurant. We absolutely loved her. She always took such good care of us. When the Grill was closed she worked at the French restaurant and again it was such a great pleasure seeing her and being welcomed by her. Also we thank Miguel our waiter at The Grill. He seemed to anticipate every need and was very professional. The only slow service at this resort was when we had lunch at the Oregano restaurant. The gym at this resort is the best that we have seen when comparing other Excellence and Sandals resorts. It is large and it is very well equipped. We loved going there in the morning and once even before dinner. We also liked the cafeteria called Aroma. It was so convenient to stop by in the morning for a nice coffee and during the day for ice cream. The evening entertainment is what you usually expect from these resorts. However we both felt that this was one of the best resort entertainment that we saw. The men dancers were excellent and we really liked the Michael Jackson show and the Burlesque show. The beach is really wonderful. The resort is located in a bay and the views of the palm trees are simply wonderful. Also the sand is soft and clean and the walking through the water was a pleasure as there were no rocks. Best of all there were always umbrellas available at the pool or on the beach with shade. This was very important for us. The rooms are smaller than at other Excellence resorts but they are OK. We had an excellence room with private plunge pool. One minus is that there is so shade at the private patio in front of the room. On the ground level there are nice beds in front of each room but these do not have shade so you need to go and find an umbrella at the pool or on the beach for shade. This is no fault of the resort but the weather was not good. It rained every day and this was not just a one hour or two hours of rain followed by sun. It was constant rain for the entire day and the sun would show up maybe for 30 minutes or an hour and only on some of the days. The other slightly strange thing is that there is some smoke during the day and evenings as garbage is burned close to the resort.
