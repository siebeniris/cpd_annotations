Chateau Elan was a great relaxing girls getaway for my Birthday weekend. The rooms were beautiful and clean the beds very comfortable. We booked a double very spacious and nice bathroom. Our room had a view of the pool. We did the Wine Tour tasting very nice. The tour guide spoke very fast seemed knowledgeable but a fast talker ready to get tour over with. Our wine tasting person Chris was fun very engaging and informative. We sampled 5 wines and do not forget to take your glass its in the 20 cost. Purchased a bottle of wine 50 off with wine tour card. For dinner we ate at the Pub food was okay. After dinner we enjoyed the fire pit outside of Caf\u00e9 \u00c9lan one of the staff was kind enough to open our bottle and we enjoyed an evening by the fire drinking wine. To make note the room service for dinner selections looks appetizing great choices. If we would have viewed before that would have been a great choice. On the plus side we wanted to experience the grounds so eating at the Pub was an experience itself. The hotel staff was nice front desk some Bellman appeared to be young in age. My perception was they were at a summer job. did not feel as thought they took their job seriously while welcoming guest. I said hello first before I was greeted. We passed by 3 bellman before one asked to help with our luggage. Take note Two women travelers. The following morning for breakfast we did the buffet at Versailles. The wait staff and buffet was great. The weather was sunny made the experience much more enjoyable with the roof skylight windows. After brunch we rented bikes for 20 each and rode for about 3 miles around the property. One of the best parts of the weekend.

My family enjoyed the Mothers Day Brunch this last Sunday. It was not an inexpensive Brunch but we decided for the special day we were celebrating lets go for it. As we entered the property at Chateau Elan we felt like we were now in France approaching a magnificent resort in reality we were approaching a magnificent resort just outside Atlanta. Vineyards a winery multiple golf courses a European Spa a 5 star hotel and the most picturesque setting for a restaurant on the east coast. It is a restaurant located on the ground floor with a 3 story glass enclosed atrium accessed by a grand staircase. BreathtakingThe Buffet showcased the talents of a great Chef and his staff. We were greeted as was everyone who came in while we were there by the General Manager of Chateau Elan. What a warm and nice welcome on a special day for everyone. There were carving stations with multiple roasts fresh seafood with King Crab huge prawns varieties of mussels and more smoked fish to taste. There was a charcuterie station with various meats cheese olives breads crackers and savory garnishes. The sushi station was tremendous There was a salad station and a fair selection of vegetarian selections for any vegans to enjoy. The pasta station was just as tasty as ever with many selections for anyone to enjoy. The children in our party had food prepared in mind for the young ones ours are 4 and 7 years old and they loved the selections for themselves. The desert selections were so numerous that there was a small banquet room with tables full of cakes pies treats fruit and prepared to order liquor and fruit garnishes for those who wanted them. The staff on the food stations and those who waited on the tables were attentive and willing to make our visit special in every way. We had a leisurely meal while we listened to the pianist playing great tunes in the background. There was bar with various drinks but we did not partake in any of them on this visit.

We had an exceptional couple of nights at the resort. The room was well appointed with a nice king size bed overlooking the par three golf course.

Everything about the room was great which made it a comfortable and relaxing stay. The on site restaurants were wonderful and all of the food provided during the stay from breakfast to lunch to snacks and dinner was very tasty with lots of options. There is a spa that I did not have a chance to utilize but would bet that it is quite nice. They have two full golf courses and a par three executive nine hole course. The Elan course is very good having played it one time before. The par three was well designed with holes from basically 65 yards to 165 at most with last hole with average being 80 10The winery is quite cool and we did enjoy three of the five tried in the Cabernet Velvet and the Pinot Grigio. We really enjoyed the winery. The family story of the owners is awesome and the Panoz Auto museum was outstanding. Who knew such existed in the great state of Georgia.

Every room public space hallway was so well decorated with peaceful relaxing music and decor a roaring fireplace and cozy seating areas with soft blankets. There are not many rooms in the Spa building and the atmosphere is relaxed peaceful and warm. The service and friendliness of the staff was the best I have experience anywhere. Every single staff member was more friendly than you can imagine there to help serve bring you coffee or anything else smiley and helpful. The Spa services we did massage and mud wrap were top. There are beautiful waiting areas in the spa that look out onto a lake and trees and rolling hills. There is a dimly lit quiet room with comfortable seating. The food was really good. For dinner we went to the Inn building. That is a much larger and more commercial feeling building mostly used for conferences. Totally different vibe than the small intimate spa building.

When I asked for dinner recommendations from guest relations the person said she did not know of any places in the area and did not even recommend the restaurants in the hotel.

Our conclusion was the same on both occasions. Sunday brunch at Chateau Elan is but a shell of its former self. The dishes are unimaginative sparse and inadequately performed. The selection is simply gone and the coffee is now a notch or two above Waffle House whereas before I am certain they used Douwe Egberts cold brew to make coffee which was absolutely phenomenal. Previously the selection was such that one had to be choosy where they wanted to spend their calories as everything was outstanding and there were a massive number of choices.
