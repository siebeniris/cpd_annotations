We stayed at the Vintage Inn for 2 nights as part of our Napa vacation. I looked at so many reviews before making the decision to stay here. I am SO happy we did. The inn is perfect. So quaint and clean and lovely. From the moment we walked in the door we were pleased. The front desk staff was so welcoming and helpful. We had booked a downstairs patio room and were recommended and upgraded to an upstairs room with a large balcony. Usually we like down stairs but the view of the gardens from the top floor was perfect. The rooms are so nice with a fireplace cozy bed cute little touches. Jacuzi bathtub robes. I could go on and on. A beautiful breakfast is included and it is lovey with an omelet bar and mimosas lots to choose from. There is a pretty pool area also. We did not have the time to relax there but it was inviting. We were there during the week but I think on the weekends they also serve wine an d snacks in the evening. It is in the PERFECT location to walk to many great restaurants and an awesome shopping area next door with quaint shops. DO NOT miss checking out the market NAPA STYLE next door. I was sad we did this after checking out. otherwise we would have bought a picnic there to have on our balcony. great store. I wish we could have stayed longer and I can not wait to go back. There is SO much to do and see and eat drink. 3 days was not nearly enough. A couple of recommendation close by. BELL winery right down the road. WOW. personal service and wonderful wines.

My fianc\u00e9e and I spent two nights at the Vintage Inn on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and we could not have been any happier with our hotel selection. We found the Vintage Inn and the town of Yountvile to be the perfect places to stay as a home base for our trip. The inn was just so cute and quaint \u2013 small enough to feel cozy large enough to operate as a well run hotel. Everything at the Vintage Inn from the room to the breakfast to the staff to the location was top notch and exceeded expectationsChosing the Hotel. This was our first trip to the Napa Valley so before arriving we really did n\u2019t have a good sense of the geography of the area. We identified pretty quickly that Napa Yountvile or St Helena would be the main towns to choose from for accommodations. My initial thought was to stay in the town of Napa simply because it was a familiar name which we assumed would be the center of the Napa Valley. However that \u2019s not really the case and after visiting I \u2019m glad we chose to stay in Yountvile instead. Napa is basically the first major town you encounter when driving into the valley from the San Francisco area and it \u2019s nice enough but it \u2019s more built up and more busy than we were looking for with many chain hotels restaurants and stores around. It is a larger town with more permanent residents and activity whereas Yountvile feels like a sleepy little village seemingly there almost solely for the benefit of tourists. Fine dining cute boutiques and wine shops are all within walking distance and everything looks perfect at all times in Yountvile. Beyond liking the quaint feel of Yountvile we found Yountvile to be much more convenient than Napa for visiting wineries St Helena would also be quite convenient. When driving up either the Silverado Trail or Route 29 the main concentration of wineries does n\u2019t really begin until you hit Yountvile and the towns going north. By staying at the Vintage Inn we were always close to the wineries we wanted to visit and could easily stop back at the hotel any time if we wanted or needed to. After identifying Yountvile as our ideal location for our accommodations we looked into the various hotel options in the town. The Vintage Inn and Vilago its very similar sister hotel right down the street both quickly came up quickly as options to consider. We also looked at several other hotels in Yountvile all of which looked great. However even though we were going to be staying during the shoulder season in November and we would be there on Sunday and Monday nights the prices still managed to be pretty high at every hotel in Yountvile. While exploring our options I noticed that Hotwire was offering one of its Hot Rate deals for a 4star hotel in Yountvile at a rate that was 50 less than the cheapest rate we were finding for any hotel in Yountvile at the time. The only catch was that the name of the hotel would n\u2019t be revealed until after we had booked and paid and it could n\u2019t be cancelled. Since every possible hotel option in Yountvile was appealing to us we were willing to take the risk. I was pretty sure we \u2019d get either the Vintage Inn or Vilago anyway and it turns out we got the Vintage Inn. The one and only somewhat frustrating experience with the Vintage Inn came right after we made our reservation. Hotwire specified that we were n\u2019t able to choose our room type and that the hotel would choose the room type for us based upon availability. Although we preferred a room with a king bed we were willing to take the risk that we \u2019d get a room with two beds to save money. I decided to call the hotel after we made our reservation in order to put in a request for a king bed. When I called the staff member I spoke with in the reservations department indicated that we had been blocked into a standard room with two queen beds. I had already done my research online and knew that the hotel still had standard rooms with a king bed available for our dates which sell for the same price as the standard rooms with two queens. I explained that we had booked on Hotwire and knew the hotel had discretion to choose our room type but that we would prefer to be blocked into an equivalent room with a king bed if possible. Her response was that our Hotwire reservation specified that we had to have a room with two beds so they could not change that in their system. She did note our request for a king bed which she said would be handled upon arrival. However I just found it odd that she acted as if the hotel had no control over its own reservations. The staff member I spoke with was n\u2019t necessarily rude but it seemed like it would be a really easy switch to block us into a king room. On the flip side since Hotwire specified that the hotel had full discretion to choose our room type I reminded myself that it was ultimately up to the hotel to choose to our room. During our stay we ended up with a perfect room with a king bed that we wanted so everything turned out fine. Arrival Experience. As soon as we drove up to the Vintage Inn I was pretty sure we had chosen the right hotel. The minute you turn off of Highway 29 into Yountvile you are transported into an idyllic little village and the Vintage Inn just fits into it perfectly with its well manicured grounds pretty flowers and rooms set up in various buildings that each look slightly different all with the feeling of French provincial cottages. We arrived on a Sunday morning around 930 am just to see the property and get the basic check in mechanics handled before departing for a day of wine tasting. The man who was working at the front desk at the time was extremely nice and personable. He gave the feeling that the staff was genuinely delighted that we had arrived and would be staying there for the next two nights. The front desk staff at most hotels is significantly more cold and business like. He was extremely apologetic about the fact that our room was n\u2019t yet ready at 930 am I never would have expected it to be ready anyway and offered to expedite room cleaning for us. Without me even mentioning it he also noted our request for a king bed and confirmed that a king room was available for us. He also encouraged us to take advantage of the hotel \u2019s complimentary breakfast which was set up in the lobby and outside on the patio at the time. We received a call about 90 minutes later to let us know that our room was ready for check in but we did n\u2019t have a chance to go back until around 60 pm. The staff member working at that time was also very nice and I was impressed that after simply mentioning that we had already checked in and that I was there to pick up our room keys she knew who I was and immediately greeted me by name giving the feeling that she had been expecting us. Room. After initially being worried that we were n\u2019t going to get a good room we ended up feeling like we had one of the best rooms at the hotel. We were given a king room on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to the main lobby building overlooking the pool Room 805. We had a great view but also appreciated that we were so close to the lobby for breakfast and afternoon tea although no room is overly far from it. The room itself was just lovely. It was spacious but felt so cozy which was great on the chilly fall evenings that we were there. I highly recommend requesting a room on the second floor since it allowed us to have great vaulted ceilings in the room which contributed even more to the feeling of spaciousness. The only negative to the second floor is that there are no elevators so you \u2019l have to carry luggage up the stairs to get to the room. However that \u2019s a small price to pay. It was obvious that the rooms and bathrooms here are recently renovated and they \u2019ve done a great job of making the updates that really matter like installing new bathroom fixtures and bedding while retaining the classic features that make this hotel unique such as the stone fireplaces in every room comfortable armchairs to sink into and nice area rugs and accessories. The bed was extremely comfortable and nice for sleeping off a day of wine drinking. It was so nice that a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room with glasses and a wine opener ours was a cabernet sauvignon from Sonoma and the wood burning fireplace was also easy to operate with a Duraflame log and matches ready to go. I also appreciated the twice daily room cleaning with turndown service as well as some other little things like the nicely sized mini fridge and the separate wifi network for each room with complimentary Internet access. The bathroom was one of my favorite parts of the room. It was very spacious featuring a large vanity with double sinks and plenty of storage for toiletries underneath or on the counter. The L\u2019Ocitane toiletries are a nice treat as well. The floors and all fixtures were clearly recently re done but the piece de resistance of the bathroom was the enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family. There were separate showerheads at either end of the shower which was beautifully finished with white subway tiles all around and very pretty iridescent tiles on the bottom. Overall it was clear that bathrooms had been a focus of the hotel \u2019s renovations and I think it was definitely money well spent. Although the room was very spacious and comfortable it was really nice to also have a separate covered balcony. Our balcony was quite pleasant and large with a nice outdoor couch and chair and a good pool view to one side. Since the hotel is right off of Highway 29 others have commented that the rooms can be loud with traffic noise. We could not hear any traffic noise at all from our room but we could hear it from our balcony. However this noise was n\u2019t significant enough to be much of a bother. I really do n\u2019t have enough good things to say about our room at the Vintage Inn. Our room felt like a really comfortable guest room in someone \u2019s home not a generic hotel room. The only thing I would note is to be aware of leaving windows open in your room. The hotel is designed with all exterior corridors with each room having windows on multiple sides which is really nice for getting plenty of natural light. However it also means you might find something like a big window in your bathroom directly overlooking an exterior corridor. We had this and our housekeeper would always leave it open which was n\u2019t a big deal but we had to make sure to be cognizant to close the window and shutters to avoid being on display to passers by. Grounds Amenities Location As I \u2019ve already mentioned the grounds at the Vintage Inn are wonderfully park like and pretty. There is essentially one main courtyard in the middle that most rooms open out onto which features well manicured landscaping and fountains. It \u2019s a small enough property that you can walk from one end to the other in about two or three minutes and all rooms are relatively convenient to the main parking lot that runs behind the property on the Highway 29 side. I think the Vintage Inn really does have a prime location for touring the Napa Valley. It \u2019s in Yountvile which is both well located and perfectly cute with great restaurants shops and tasting rooms within walking distance. The Vintage Inn is right in the center with world renowned restaurants like the French Laundry less than a block away. The V Marketplace is right across the parking lot and we even went hot air ballooning one morning with a company based there Aloft Napa Valley which was an excellent memorable experience just a couple minutes \u2019 walk away from our room. As far as amenities there is the outdoor pool and hot tub which our room overlooked. The pool area was attractive and would be quite pleasant for swimming during a warmer time of year. I suspect that the pool must be heated since it was open when we were there in November and I saw other guests using it on a couple occasions. I know there is also a fitness center which I believe is located slightly ofsite somewhere between the Vintage Inn and Vilagio. I never ventured over to see it. The dedicated spa for the hotel the Spa Vilagio is over at the Vilago hotel which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t its own restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are several highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. We tried Thomas Keller \u2019s Bouchon and had a very pleasant dinner there as well as RD Kitchen for something a bit more casual. Both were quite nice but I thought Bouchon was the better of the two. However the dining that is offered at the Vintage Inn is great. A complimentary hot breakfast is offered to all guests each morning in addition to tea each afternoon. The breakfast is offered in the lobby where the food is attractively displayed right when you walk in with a bunch of tables available to one side. There is also a very attractive outdoor patio right off of the lobby with more seating. We chose to take our breakfast outside each morning since the weather was nice and there was more space outside. It was just lovely sitting out on the patio to start each morning. The food offered on the buffet is really high quality which also impressed me. In addition to Chandon champagne and various juices to make mimosas the breakfast included a large selection of pastries that were quite tasty as well fresh fruit a nice selection of Clover Farms yogurt delicious biscuits with sausage gravy and breakfast potatoes. Outside on the patio a chef was making omelets to order with various toppings and the omelets I had were some of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel breakfast buffet. As a whole the breakfast here was one of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel anywhere so it seemed like such a value that it was included in the room rate. The only thing that was disappointing about breakfast was that the made to order waffle station was n\u2019t available everyday. When we stopped in briefly on our check in day a Sunday we did n\u2019t eat too much from the buffet but I noticed that there was a waffle station outside in addition to the omelet station. I was really looking forward to trying a waffle the next two mornings we \u2019d be there but found that the waffles must only be offered on weekends since they were n\u2019t available on Monday or Tuesday. I \u2019m not sure why this would be a weekend only item since the hotel felt no less crowded on Monday or Tuesday when we were there. Regardless the breakfast was just lovely and delicious and I could n\u2019t think of a better way to start our mornings at the Vintage Inn than to enjoy a mimosa and tasty hot breakfast on the patio. We also stopped into the lobby one afternoon to check out the afternoon tea offerings. There is n\u2019t as much offered for afternoon tea but it \u2019s still nice. Lemonade tea cookies and scones are available which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. The afternoon tea felt a little bit sparse in comparison to breakfast but it was a nice feature too. Overall Overall I really have nothing but positive things to say about the Vintage Inn. It \u2019s a small hotel that is well run and well maintained. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. We could not have felt happier with our decision to stay here as it contributed in a positive way to a couple of wonderful days in the Napa Valley. We enjoyed starting each day with breakfast at the hotel and ending each day walking to dinners in quaint Yountvile. I really did n\u2019t want to leave when our two night stay was over. Definitely do not hesitate to stay here \u2013 you wo n\u2019t be disappointed.", "offset": [9377, 9488], "date": "2017-01-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "241d6186-bd63-4dd0-a2f7-0f1b0d66ad10", "sentence": "A Lovely Place to Stay in the Napa Valley.

The V Marketplace is right across the parking lot and we even went hot air ballooning one morning with a company based there Aloft Napa Valley which was an excellent memorable experience just a couple minutes \u2019 walk away from our room. As far as amenities there is the outdoor pool and hot tub which our room overlooked. The pool area was attractive and would be quite pleasant for swimming during a warmer time of year. I suspect that the pool must be heated since it was open when we were there in November and I saw other guests using it on a couple occasions. I know there is also a fitness center which I believe is located slightly ofsite somewhere between the Vintage Inn and Vilagio. I never ventured over to see it. The dedicated spa for the hotel the Spa Vilagio is over at the Vilago hotel which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t its own restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are several highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. We tried Thomas Keller \u2019s Bouchon and had a very pleasant dinner there as well as RD Kitchen for something a bit more casual. Both were quite nice but I thought Bouchon was the better of the two. However the dining that is offered at the Vintage Inn is great. A complimentary hot breakfast is offered to all guests each morning in addition to tea each afternoon. The breakfast is offered in the lobby where the food is attractively displayed right when you walk in with a bunch of tables available to one side. There is also a very attractive outdoor patio right off of the lobby with more seating. We chose to take our breakfast outside each morning since the weather was nice and there was more space outside. It was just lovely sitting out on the patio to start each morning. The food offered on the buffet is really high quality which also impressed me. In addition to Chandon champagne and various juices to make mimosas the breakfast included a large selection of pastries that were quite tasty as well fresh fruit a nice selection of Clover Farms yogurt delicious biscuits with sausage gravy and breakfast potatoes. Outside on the patio a chef was making omelets to order with various toppings and the omelets I had were some of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel breakfast buffet. As a whole the breakfast here was one of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel anywhere so it seemed like such a value that it was included in the room rate. The only thing that was disappointing about breakfast was that the made to order waffle station was n\u2019t available everyday. When we stopped in briefly on our check in day a Sunday we did n\u2019t eat too much from the buffet but I noticed that there was a waffle station outside in addition to the omelet station. I was really looking forward to trying a waffle the next two mornings we \u2019d be there but found that the waffles must only be offered on weekends since they were n\u2019t available on Monday or Tuesday. I \u2019m not sure why this would be a weekend only item since the hotel felt no less crowded on Monday or Tuesday when we were there. Regardless the breakfast was just lovely and delicious and I could n\u2019t think of a better way to start our mornings at the Vintage Inn than to enjoy a mimosa and tasty hot breakfast on the patio. We also stopped into the lobby one afternoon to check out the afternoon tea offerings. There is n\u2019t as much offered for afternoon tea but it \u2019s still nice. Lemonade tea cookies and scones are available which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. The afternoon tea felt a little bit sparse in comparison to breakfast but it was a nice feature too. Overall Overall I really have nothing but positive things to say about the Vintage Inn. It \u2019s a small hotel that is well run and well maintained. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. We could not have felt happier with our decision to stay here as it contributed in a positive way to a couple of wonderful days in the Napa Valley. We enjoyed starting each day with breakfast at the hotel and ending each day walking to dinners in quaint Yountvile. I really did n\u2019t want to leave when our two night stay was over. Definitely do not hesitate to stay here \u2013 you wo n\u2019t be disappointed.", "offset": [6523, 6810], "date": "2017-01-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "a040829e-f309-4406-b901-b010cbbe4014", "sentence": "Cozy hotel.

We booked our reservation 8 months ago and at the time had no idea what to expect and were not aware of the construction. As the trip got closer we noticed several reviews commenting on the construction taking place at the property. We had difficulty finding the hotel entrance since it was not clearly marked from the main road. Once we checked in we were very pleased with the interior of our room. It was spacious lovely and very comfortable. After just a few minutes in the room we noticed you could hear the nearby highway and the traffic noise. We tried to ignore it but after an hour I knew I was not going to spend four nights listening to road noise. We went to the front desk and requested to be moved to a quieter location. The manager was very helpful and moved us to the same type of room but on the interior of the grounds. It was much quieter and we enjoyed the next four days without any highway noise. As far as the construction it was an obvious inconvenience but did not take away from the lovely experience at the Vintage House. The breakfast was good plenty of options and the food was flavorful. There are two pools available to use. One is the larger pool at the Vilagio Hotel sister property. it is a 4block walk to this pool. There is bar service available and it is a nice space. The other option is a much smaller pool with no bar service. This is about a 5minute walk from the Vintage Inn. We opted for the larger pool and enjoyed an afternoon with friends by the pool. The housekeeping service was top notch. They magically arrived every morning while we were at breakfast and we returned to a freshly cleaned room. We also had a complimentary bottle of wine in our room when we arrived. Assuming this was from the hotel management as a gesture for the construction taking place.

We were booked for two nights at the Vintage House. When we got to the hotel one hour prior to the official 4 PM check in time our room was n\u2019t ready so the valet took our luggage and bags and placed them into a closet in the lobby area with several other bags and suitcases. At 4 PM we were advised our room was ready and that our luggage and bags would be brought to the room shortly. When I got to the room which was located next to the rear parking lot as well as Highway 29 I was impressed with the interior upgrades to the room. Good job. The wooden stairs leading up to the room however looked like the original stairs from when the hotel was originally built. The wood was splintering and nails screws were coming out of the wood in different places. While waiting in the room for our luggage to be delivered I could hear the vehicular traffic noise from Highway 29 which was close to the back of the hotel. After waiting 20 minutes for our luggage my wife called the clerk at the front desk to see where our luggage was located. She was advised the luggage was on its way. After waiting 35 minutes for our luggage I walked down the stairs and encountered the luggage valet with only a portion of our luggage. I told him that he did not have all of our luggage. He said that is what was given to him. I helped him take the luggage up to the room and then we went back together to the luggage closet to look for the rest of our luggage. After looking in the closet for my bags I could understand why items could be left behind. After we turned off the TV around 11 PM on the first night of our stay we could still hear the traffic noise from Highway 29. There was n\u2019t that much traffic at that time of night but the vehicles that were on the highway were noisy enough to make sleeping difficult. I did not bring any earplugs thinking I would n\u2019t need them for a room that cost 500 per night. When we left the room in the morning around 9 AM I noticed a tray with some dishes drinking glasses and cloth napkins sitting on the ground outside of the room just below our room. I really did n\u2019t think much about it until I saw the same tray of dishes sitting there in the evening hours of our second night stay. We had their included breakfast which had a nice selection of items and tasted very good. The room was cleaned in a timely manner and the maid did a great job cleaning it. Our second and final night in our room was n\u2019t any better traffic noise wise than the first night. We tried to fall asleep but the traffic noise was just too much for us. We checked out of the room around midnight and when I returned the plastic rooms keys to check out the man behind the front desk never asked me if we enjoyed our stay or anything else for that matter. My suggestion would be if traffic noise helps you sleep you would n\u2019t have any issues with the rooms in the back of the hotel.

My wife and I spent two nights at Vintage House on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and it was our second time at this hotel. Although we had a good trip we were disappointed that our stay was not nearly as good as last time when the hotel was still Vintage Inn. We concluded that the renovations and re branding from Vintage Inn to Vintage House do n\u2019t really add much to the experience and we were disappointed to find that several amenities have been cheapened or completely removed since our stay two years ago. Despite this since the property is nice and the location in Yountvile is perfect it may still be worth considering. Arrival Experience Since we had such an exceptional stay when the hotel was still the Vintage Inn and we fell in love with the town of Yountvile almost instantly on that previous trip we did n\u2019t even think twice about booking the property again this time especially since we received an email offer with a very good discounted rate for repeat guests. We were excited to arrive at the hotel and see what changes had been made to transform the French country Vintage Inn into the more modern Vintage House. The main lobby building looked totally different from before with a newly whitewashed brick exterior a sleeker and more modern feel and now even valet parking and a doorman features that were n\u2019t present last time we were there. The interior of the lobby was all new now larger and more open with a modern aesthetic in white gray and purple tones. My wife and I were both impressed when we saw the new lobby since it definitely had a more substantial feel than the previous one. Although the old lobby was cozier it was too small so we liked the new expanded space. The friendly staff stood out to us on our last stay and they still seemed nice this time. We had less interaction with staff on this trip but the doorman was really friendly every time we entered or exited the lobby and the front desk staff member who checked us in was nice welcoming us back to the hotel and offering lots of information including a discount card for certain local wineries. I think it would be helpful to let guests know about the wineries where they can obtain discounts in advance as it would be good information to know at the earlier planning stages of a trip. We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around noon and were excited to find out that our room was ready early so that we could get settled in before an afternoon of wine tastings. Room On our last stay we booked a basic Deluxe King room and had an excellent room in one of the closest buildings to the lobby overlooking the pool. We were hoping for something similar this time especially because we were staying midweek when the hotel did n\u2019t seem overly crowded. We booked the same Deluxe King room again and we were given a room on the second floor of one of the buildings further from the lobby overlooking the parking lot and busy Route 29 Room 605. We ended up being very disappointed with our room location. The way the buildings are set up they are scattered on the hotel \u2019s property between the main street of Yountvile Washington Street and busy Route 29 which serve as the boundaries of the property on either side. Parking is all along the back of the property on the Route 29 side which is what our room faced. It was disappointing to have a bad view of the parking lot and also to be so close to Route 29 which made our room quite noisy at all times of day and night. Even though we booked a basic Deluxe Room which are billed as being on the edges of the property we thought there had to have been a better room in that category especially at a time when the hotel was n\u2019t full. In fact when we \u2019d walk around the hotel at night or early in the morning it was particularly obvious that many rooms were empty because the housekeeping staff would leave rooms fully lit with TVs on overnight basically prepared for new guests at all times. This seemed odd and wasteful and we saw rooms remain empty our entire stay but always with lights and the TV on. We were excited to see what the newly renovated rooms looked like especially since we felt that the rooms were in great condition two years ago before any renovation. The rooms do have a lot of nice features like hardwood floors a very large balcony a wood burning fireplace and lots of windows on all sides for natural light. However we were a little surprised at how little the room d\u00e9cor had changed for a hotel that has supposedly undergone renovations and re branding. From what we could tell all they had done since our last stay was very cosmetic. They replaced the area rug on the floor swapped in a new armchair and settee and added some new lighting and artwork along with painting the natural wood paneling on the ceiling white. None of this really made much difference aside for removing some of the original character and going for a more streamlined and modern look. However since the exterior of the buildings and grounds still have such a classic and cozy look and the rooms still have warmer colored wood floors and an older stone fireplace the room just ended up looking mismatched even though it was nice. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you \u2019l probably find the rooms to be nice but for those who have it was a little bit of a letdown. We liked it before and do n\u2019t think anything has improved. If anything some of the charm was actually removed and there \u2019s a bit of an identity crisis. It \u2019s unclear what theme or feel they \u2019re going for even though the previous d\u00e9cor was very clearly meant to be a cozy French country feel throughout. The bathroom was one of our favorite parts of the room last time. During that stay we had a huge bathroom with an enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family with two separate showerheads at either end of the shower. Disappointingly instead of having the same type of shower our room this time had a deep jetted jacuzi tub which we did n\u2019t have much interest in using and which also doubled as the shower. It was such an odd shower setup since it was so deep to get into and it was so open with shower water getting all over the bathroom while showering. It was also clear that the tub was n\u2019t meant to double as a shower since the way the showerhead was placed you would have to stand right on the tub drain in order to be under the water. It made for an awkward shower experience and all we really wanted was the shower back from last time. Beyond the shower the bathroom featured a large vanity with double sinks and plenty of storage for toiletries underneath or on the counter. The previous L\u2019Ocitane toiletries that we liked were replaced with new ones that were uninteresting. The bathrooms generally do have a nice look with white subway tile and natural stone floors that feel updated but this was already in place before the renovation. Some other features of the room are great such as the wood burning fireplace that is easy to operate with a log and matches ready to go. We also appreciated the twice daily room cleaning with turndown service with delicious Kolar chocolates. It was also nice that a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room when we returned from dinner on the first night a nice bottle from Hill Family Estate along with a note thanking us for returning for another stay. All rooms used to contain a free bottle of wine upon check in so I \u2019m not sure if we only received one this time because we were return guests. Despite having a bad view and highway noise our balcony was pleasant and large with new outdoor furniture to go with the modern theme which included a modern swing and daybed. I would recommend requesting a room on the second floor since it gets you vaulted ceilings which contribute to a feeling of spaciousness. The only negative to the second floor is that there are no elevators so you \u2019l have to carry all luggage up the exterior stairs to get to the room. Another thing I would note is to be aware of which blinds are open in your room. The hotel is designed with all exterior corridors as well as each room having windows on multiple sides which is really nice for getting plenty of natural light. However it also means you might find something like a big window in your bathroom directly overlooking an exterior corridor where others could walk by. Despite being a little disappointed with our room I do appreciate that the rooms here feel more like a comfortable guest room in someone \u2019s home not a generic hotel room. The buildings have character and the rooms clearly are not all the same since we had totally different room shapes and sizes between our two stays. If we returned I would be more specific in requesting the room features we prefer. Grounds Amenities Location. The grounds at Vintage House are wonderfully park like and pretty. There is essentially one main courtyard in the middle that most rooms open onto which features well manicured landscaping and fountains. It \u2019s a small enough property that you can walk from one end to the other in about two or three minutes and all rooms are relatively convenient to the main parking lot that runs behind the property on the Highway 29 side. Being in Yountvile is a huge bonus of this hotel. Yountvile is perfectly cute with great restaurants shops and tasting rooms within walking distance. Vintage House is right in the center with world renowned restaurants like the French Laundry less than a block away. Other Thomas Keller restaurants that we enjoy such as Bouchon and Ad Hoc are also in very easy walking distance. The hotel is technically part of something called the \u201c The Estate \u201d which is essentially just Vintage House its sister hotel Vilagio that \u2019s down the street and the V Marketplace shopping area that is between them. In addition to liking the quaint feel of Yountvile we find Yountvile to be particularly convenient for visiting wineries. When driving up either the Silverado Trail or Route 29 the main concentration of wineries does n\u2019t really begin until you hit Yountvile and the towns going north. As far as amenities there is an outdoor pool and hot tub. The pool area is attractive but we did n\u2019t have time to use it. It \u2019s located right outside of the lobby and appears to have been renovated with new seating in keeping with the modern aesthetic. There were also fire pits by the pool at night that looked nice. The spa for the hotel is over by the Vilagio which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. It looks very nice from walking by but we have n\u2019t had a chance to try it. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t have a restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are so many highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. However a complimentary breakfast is offered to all guests each morning. This was another area where we were very disappointed in changes that have been made since our last stay. The breakfast used to be offered in the lobby but when we were there it was in the Groezinger Estate House building on the end of the property by the lobby which appears to normally be some sort of event space. We were told they were having the breakfast there because Vilagio guests were coming to Vintage House for breakfast while their lobby is under construction. I thought the space itself was nice for breakfast still decorated in the old French country look we preferred and offering lots of tables in a couple of different rooms as well as outdoor seating. A huge thing we loved about the hotel last time was that there were multiple hot options at breakfast each day including really good biscuits and gravy as well as a made to order omelet and waffle station and local champagne and various juices to make your own mimosas. It used to be a very sumptuous buffet for one that was included in the room rate. This time we found that the buffet selections had gone downhill significantly. The omelet waffle station is gone and the number of hot items offered is down to one each day it was some sort of quiche our first day that was cold and then scrambled eggs our second day. The make your own mimosas are gone and they \u2019re now instead selling them for 12 each along with coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos for a fee. Other than one hot item per day the breakfast now basically just includes a selection of pastries as well fresh fruit yogurt and charcuterie a relatively simple continental breakfast. Maybe I was just annoyed about the changes but I thought the pastries even went downhill from last time. I recalled them being very high quality but found them to be relatively basic and unremarkable this time. It \u2019s nice that breakfast is included but it \u2019s become the style of one you \u2019d find in a very basic hotel not one of this class. It may be presented nicely in a nice space but it \u2019s nothing special beyond that. We were also disappointed to find that the hotel no longer offers afternoon tea. Last time we enjoyed stopping in the lobby in the afternoon for some lemonade tea cookies and scones which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. There was no mention of this feature this time and we saw no evidence of it so I assume it \u2019s been yet another fatality of the \u201c upgrade \u201d from Vintage Inn to Vintage House. Overall I know we had a bunch of complaints but overall we did have a nice enough stay at Vintage House and a great trip to the Napa Valley. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you will probably like this small hotel that is well maintained and in a great location. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. However as past guests we were expecting to come back to find the same level of quality if not better knowing that the hotel had been renovated since our last stay. Instead we found a hotel that has definitely not decreased its rates but has definitely decreased what it offers guests. While I left last time ready to recommend this hotel to anyone going to the area I would be more hesitant this time. The rates are far from cheap for a hotel that seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis with very few of its unique extras left. Next time we will probably try somewhere new. Changes have taken an exceptional property and made it much less remarkable. To earn loyalty in a town with so many great options Vintage House needs to up their game or very simply restore some of the services they had in the past.", "offset": [5652, 5717], "date": "2018-11-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "6c4c7214-eb49-44ed-939f-61b66df5f635", "sentence": "Still Nice Used to be Better.

We had less interaction with staff on this trip but the doorman was really friendly every time we entered or exited the lobby and the front desk staff member who checked us in was nice welcoming us back to the hotel and offering lots of information including a discount card for certain local wineries. I think it would be helpful to let guests know about the wineries where they can obtain discounts in advance as it would be good information to know at the earlier planning stages of a trip. We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around noon and were excited to find out that our room was ready early so that we could get settled in before an afternoon of wine tastings. Room On our last stay we booked a basic Deluxe King room and had an excellent room in one of the closest buildings to the lobby overlooking the pool. We were hoping for something similar this time especially because we were staying midweek when the hotel did n\u2019t seem overly crowded. We booked the same Deluxe King room again and we were given a room on the second floor of one of the buildings further from the lobby overlooking the parking lot and busy Route 29 Room 605. We ended up being very disappointed with our room location. The way the buildings are set up they are scattered on the hotel \u2019s property between the main street of Yountvile Washington Street and busy Route 29 which serve as the boundaries of the property on either side. Parking is all along the back of the property on the Route 29 side which is what our room faced. It was disappointing to have a bad view of the parking lot and also to be so close to Route 29 which made our room quite noisy at all times of day and night. Even though we booked a basic Deluxe Room which are billed as being on the edges of the property we thought there had to have been a better room in that category especially at a time when the hotel was n\u2019t full. In fact when we \u2019d walk around the hotel at night or early in the morning it was particularly obvious that many rooms were empty because the housekeeping staff would leave rooms fully lit with TVs on overnight basically prepared for new guests at all times. This seemed odd and wasteful and we saw rooms remain empty our entire stay but always with lights and the TV on. We were excited to see what the newly renovated rooms looked like especially since we felt that the rooms were in great condition two years ago before any renovation. The rooms do have a lot of nice features like hardwood floors a very large balcony a wood burning fireplace and lots of windows on all sides for natural light. However we were a little surprised at how little the room d\u00e9cor had changed for a hotel that has supposedly undergone renovations and re branding. From what we could tell all they had done since our last stay was very cosmetic. They replaced the area rug on the floor swapped in a new armchair and settee and added some new lighting and artwork along with painting the natural wood paneling on the ceiling white. None of this really made much difference aside for removing some of the original character and going for a more streamlined and modern look. However since the exterior of the buildings and grounds still have such a classic and cozy look and the rooms still have warmer colored wood floors and an older stone fireplace the room just ended up looking mismatched even though it was nice. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you \u2019l probably find the rooms to be nice but for those who have it was a little bit of a letdown. We liked it before and do n\u2019t think anything has improved. If anything some of the charm was actually removed and there \u2019s a bit of an identity crisis. It \u2019s unclear what theme or feel they \u2019re going for even though the previous d\u00e9cor was very clearly meant to be a cozy French country feel throughout. The bathroom was one of our favorite parts of the room last time. During that stay we had a huge bathroom with an enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family with two separate showerheads at either end of the shower. Disappointingly instead of having the same type of shower our room this time had a deep jetted jacuzi tub which we did n\u2019t have much interest in using and which also doubled as the shower. It was such an odd shower setup since it was so deep to get into and it was so open with shower water getting all over the bathroom while showering. It was also clear that the tub was n\u2019t meant to double as a shower since the way the showerhead was placed you would have to stand right on the tub drain in order to be under the water. It made for an awkward shower experience and all we really wanted was the shower back from last time. Beyond the shower the bathroom featured a large vanity with double sinks and plenty of storage for toiletries underneath or on the counter. The previous L\u2019Ocitane toiletries that we liked were replaced with new ones that were uninteresting. The bathrooms generally do have a nice look with white subway tile and natural stone floors that feel updated but this was already in place before the renovation. Some other features of the room are great such as the wood burning fireplace that is easy to operate with a log and matches ready to go. We also appreciated the twice daily room cleaning with turndown service with delicious Kolar chocolates. It was also nice that a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room when we returned from dinner on the first night a nice bottle from Hill Family Estate along with a note thanking us for returning for another stay. All rooms used to contain a free bottle of wine upon check in so I \u2019m not sure if we only received one this time because we were return guests. Despite having a bad view and highway noise our balcony was pleasant and large with new outdoor furniture to go with the modern theme which included a modern swing and daybed. I would recommend requesting a room on the second floor since it gets you vaulted ceilings which contribute to a feeling of spaciousness. The only negative to the second floor is that there are no elevators so you \u2019l have to carry all luggage up the exterior stairs to get to the room. Another thing I would note is to be aware of which blinds are open in your room. The hotel is designed with all exterior corridors as well as each room having windows on multiple sides which is really nice for getting plenty of natural light. However it also means you might find something like a big window in your bathroom directly overlooking an exterior corridor where others could walk by. Despite being a little disappointed with our room I do appreciate that the rooms here feel more like a comfortable guest room in someone \u2019s home not a generic hotel room. The buildings have character and the rooms clearly are not all the same since we had totally different room shapes and sizes between our two stays. If we returned I would be more specific in requesting the room features we prefer. Grounds Amenities Location. The grounds at Vintage House are wonderfully park like and pretty. There is essentially one main courtyard in the middle that most rooms open onto which features well manicured landscaping and fountains. It \u2019s a small enough property that you can walk from one end to the other in about two or three minutes and all rooms are relatively convenient to the main parking lot that runs behind the property on the Highway 29 side. Being in Yountvile is a huge bonus of this hotel. Yountvile is perfectly cute with great restaurants shops and tasting rooms within walking distance. Vintage House is right in the center with world renowned restaurants like the French Laundry less than a block away. Other Thomas Keller restaurants that we enjoy such as Bouchon and Ad Hoc are also in very easy walking distance. The hotel is technically part of something called the \u201c The Estate \u201d which is essentially just Vintage House its sister hotel Vilagio that \u2019s down the street and the V Marketplace shopping area that is between them. In addition to liking the quaint feel of Yountvile we find Yountvile to be particularly convenient for visiting wineries. When driving up either the Silverado Trail or Route 29 the main concentration of wineries does n\u2019t really begin until you hit Yountvile and the towns going north. As far as amenities there is an outdoor pool and hot tub. The pool area is attractive but we did n\u2019t have time to use it. It \u2019s located right outside of the lobby and appears to have been renovated with new seating in keeping with the modern aesthetic. There were also fire pits by the pool at night that looked nice. The spa for the hotel is over by the Vilagio which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. It looks very nice from walking by but we have n\u2019t had a chance to try it. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t have a restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are so many highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. However a complimentary breakfast is offered to all guests each morning. This was another area where we were very disappointed in changes that have been made since our last stay. The breakfast used to be offered in the lobby but when we were there it was in the Groezinger Estate House building on the end of the property by the lobby which appears to normally be some sort of event space. We were told they were having the breakfast there because Vilagio guests were coming to Vintage House for breakfast while their lobby is under construction. I thought the space itself was nice for breakfast still decorated in the old French country look we preferred and offering lots of tables in a couple of different rooms as well as outdoor seating. A huge thing we loved about the hotel last time was that there were multiple hot options at breakfast each day including really good biscuits and gravy as well as a made to order omelet and waffle station and local champagne and various juices to make your own mimosas. It used to be a very sumptuous buffet for one that was included in the room rate. This time we found that the buffet selections had gone downhill significantly. The omelet waffle station is gone and the number of hot items offered is down to one each day it was some sort of quiche our first day that was cold and then scrambled eggs our second day. The make your own mimosas are gone and they \u2019re now instead selling them for 12 each along with coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos for a fee. Other than one hot item per day the breakfast now basically just includes a selection of pastries as well fresh fruit yogurt and charcuterie a relatively simple continental breakfast. Maybe I was just annoyed about the changes but I thought the pastries even went downhill from last time. I recalled them being very high quality but found them to be relatively basic and unremarkable this time. It \u2019s nice that breakfast is included but it \u2019s become the style of one you \u2019d find in a very basic hotel not one of this class. It may be presented nicely in a nice space but it \u2019s nothing special beyond that. We were also disappointed to find that the hotel no longer offers afternoon tea. Last time we enjoyed stopping in the lobby in the afternoon for some lemonade tea cookies and scones which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. There was no mention of this feature this time and we saw no evidence of it so I assume it \u2019s been yet another fatality of the \u201c upgrade \u201d from Vintage Inn to Vintage House. Overall I know we had a bunch of complaints but overall we did have a nice enough stay at Vintage House and a great trip to the Napa Valley. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you will probably like this small hotel that is well maintained and in a great location. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. However as past guests we were expecting to come back to find the same level of quality if not better knowing that the hotel had been renovated since our last stay. Instead we found a hotel that has definitely not decreased its rates but has definitely decreased what it offers guests. While I left last time ready to recommend this hotel to anyone going to the area I would be more hesitant this time. The rates are far from cheap for a hotel that seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis with very few of its unique extras left. Next time we will probably try somewhere new. Changes have taken an exceptional property and made it much less remarkable. To earn loyalty in a town with so many great options Vintage House needs to up their game or very simply restore some of the services they had in the past.", "offset": [2328, 2504], "date": "2018-11-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "9b143ad4-208a-4018-a056-518a9ecc7533", "sentence": "Nice facility excellent location and great breakfast but we had some issues revised review. Scroll down to see my original review. Since the only way to edit a TripAdvisor review is to delete it and re post it a short time later that is what I did. Shortly after posting my review I was contacted by Vintage House as they were understandably concerned about my one star assessment. As a result of that conversation I realize that one of my criticisms was due to my misunderstanding. In addition Vintage House has refunded the charges that I thought were erroneous and unfair. Finally I was so ticked off when writing my original review that I left out some ameliorating facts related to their response to the several in room problems we encountered. Due to all of the preceding I have upgraded my assessment to three stars. The inflated charge was a misunderstanding because what I saw on my credit card was the hold amount which was larger than the actual charge. What was and still is confusing is that the \u201c hold \u201d amount was not posted on my day of arrival but appeared to have been posted on the checkout date. In any case the amount now charged is the correct lower amount. The separate additional charge for a small amount was according to Vintage House based on items taken from the mini bar. When I said that we had not taken anything from the mini bar that amount was refunded. However that does get to a basic issue that I have with mini bars. We do n\u2019t use them yet frequently we find that we get charged post checkout. I think that is due to two reasons \u2013 the employees who clean the rooms are not very meticulous about replenishment so that items used by the prior occupants frequently get charged to the next occupant and there are employees who frequently pilfer from the mini bars precisely because of the lack of precise control. We were also refunded 75 for the three \u201c Resort Fee \u201d charges at 25 per day. When we discussed this in our conversation the Vintage House representative stated that the amount was included in our reservation confirmation. Upon reexamination of the reservation confirmation that statement is technically correct but the way that this fee was disclosed on the reservation appears to have been done in a misleading way. On the reservation the daily room rate is stated explicitly as \u201c Nightly rate 42515 \u201d. Below that is another line reading \u201c Total charges including taxes and fees 148964 \u201d. The 25 Resort Fee is included in the latter amount but note the absence of the sign on that number whereas the rate amount does have a sign a combination which sort of hides it. In addition the entire fee is bundled in with tax amounts which in California are notoriously high. All in all it looks like an intentional effort to hide or disguise this tack on amount. In our conversation the \u201c Resort Fee \u201d was described as having been for the \u201c free \u201d breakfast \u201c free \u201d bicycles and \u201c free \u201d weekend wine tastings that the hotel provides. To that my response is \u2013 if all of those are \u201c free \u201d do n\u2019t charge separately and additionally for them. Furthermore we were not there on a weekend nor did we use the bicycles so why should we have to pay for them. In any case I found all of that to be entirely misleading. The hotel also provides \u201c free \u201d linens. Are we soon going to see a \u201c Housekeeping Fee \u201d on the bill that is separate and additional to the quoted rateFinaly I should add now that I am no longer as upset with them as I was when I wrote the original review that staff personnel responded almost immediately to the in room problems we encountered. Original review A short walk to many of Napa \u2019s most sought after restaurants is the primary attraction and the breakfast buffet is extremely well done. That \u2019s the positives. Now the negatives. A number of defects in the room the safe failed and required a visit from the engineer. Then the thermostat failed requiring another visit from the engineer. The first easy light \u201c fire in a bag \u201d did n\u2019t light easily and then also did not burn very well. A second bag the next day burnt too well and collapsed so that a large piece of burning wood fell against the fireplace door. Since the hotel had not provided any fireplace tools we had to call for help lest the glass in the fireplace door would crack. There are no towel bars nor hooks in the bathroom something I \u2019ve never encountered. Where do they expect you to hang your clothes while bathing. What is one supposed to do with wet towelsThe biggest negative leaving me with a sour taste and a problem yet to be resolved is in the bill. There was a daily add on resort fee that was not disclosed when we made our reservation. Then I noticed the day after we checked out that the amount charged to my credit card was more than 200 more than on my bill and that there was an additional second charge for a small amount. Right now I do n\u2019t know what is going on because the hotel has not responded 12 hours later to the call that I made nor the follow up email that I sent asking for clarification and correction. That \u2019s no way to run an enterprise at the level this one aspires to.", "offset": [1532, 1847], "date": "2018-12-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "8d3dd13c-24b9-41d3-a550-78b70bf2d477", "sentence": "Awesome stay.
