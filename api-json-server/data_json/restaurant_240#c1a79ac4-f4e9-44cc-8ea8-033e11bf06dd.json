After our first night there we actually cancelled the last part of our stay due to being so underwhelmed by the property. Staff were unwelcoming rude during check in. I had 2 reservations asked could we stay in the same room for both. This completely ticked the front desk agent off he proceeded to slam things around walk off with no explanation except that his manager would have to help me. Not sure why this was received so poorly as it is a completely ordinary request. After regrouping we moved on to the room. As we are on our way up to the Hilton Honors Tower This title is a complete joke. It was by far the worst Hilton room I have ever stayed in. we hear other guests saying. good luck the air is out in this whole tower. Awesome. We continue on open the doors for ventilation check out the room. Outlets in the lamps are so loose nothing charges carpet is old coming up in places sinks are old. The shower was the only part that sort of renovated but the glass doors had large gaps that allowed for water to come out during your shower. We were supposed to have ocean front instead it was ocean view. The pool area was pretty but extremely over crowded. They put chairs in every inch of available space. So be prepared to get close to your neighbors. The food was mediocre at many of the restaurants on the property overpriced for what it was. I am a Diamond member in a Hilton at some point every week. I can say it was definitely my worst Hilton experience. I would recommend staying at another property. If you want to stay in the Hilton family there are plenty of other options. I am amazed that this hotel is still ranked as high as it is.", "offset": [1334, 1426], "date": "2015-02-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "244059ae-a44a-487c-a9d1-1dbd16101151", "sentence": "Wonderful 45 star resort that is perfect for families. The Caribe Hilton is a really lovely resort. The rooms are well appointed and beds comfortable. Nice bathroom and the rooms we saw had balconies. The overall layout of the facility is excellent although rather large and so the distance from some rooms to the pool can be quite long. The recreational facilities are really good. The pool area is very large with several different size pools for adults and children. The pool area is adjacent to a very lovely private beach One of which is very protected and safe for little children. And unlike many other resorts there is no loud background music the primary sound is of people having a great time. We were particularly impressed by the quality of the staff. Everyone went out of their way to be kind and helpful. The only complaint I could have is that the room cleaning service was very random in what it would do. For example at times the cleaning staff would empty trash cans and other times they would not. And they did not always replace used amenities such as shampoo. But the rooms were kept clean. Room rates were more than reasonable and we had a lovely suite that could sleep four. The suite also had a refrigerator and sink and a microwave. However be forewarned that taxes are very high and may be on the order of 30 of the room rate. I would recommend getting the room rate with breakfast. The buffet breakfast is quite good with a wide variety of food and freshly prepared eggs. The waitstaf in the breakfast area could not have been nicer or more helpful. They went out of their way to do everything they could to help the patrons. One thing is that the buffet is down about six steps and so someone with handicap can not easily get at the food without help. At the same time there are other breakfast options including a Starbucks and for less expensive meals there is a Quiznos off the lobby area. Although our room only had a bathtub with the shower in this we were very pleased to see a strong and properly placed grab bar. This is in contrast to many hotels I have been in recently including other Hiltons where the grab bar is positioned in places that are effectively useless. The hotel has several restaurants which a bit high priced. Drinks at the bar and at the pool area are higher in price then they should be in my view. The Italian restaurant is pretty awful and I had recommend avoiding it. Food is mediocre and high priced. Perhaps the biggest annoyance was the parking which is expensive and not very convenient. It is located across the street from the hotel and one has to pay or get a card stamped each time one goes in and out. Valet parking is available but even more expensive. This distance means that one has to allow 15 20 minutes to get ones car if in the hotel wing closest to the garage. And handicap parking was in the garage and so someone needing such parking still has to go a great distance to get their car. In summary the Caribe Hilton is a wonderful resort and I had not hesitate to return for a moment. I would prefer a more central location for the room and I will not rent a car and have to park it.", "offset": [1353, 1408], "date": "2015-02-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "2e524d14-e342-4bc9-ad43-a36c066d9ed4", "sentence": "Fabulous. can not say enough good things about this hotel.

We stayed here the night before our cruise on Royal Caribbean. The rooms are dated and not great. The food is extremely expensive for the quality. The night prior to our cruise we ordered two pizzas and a chef salad and we paid 1070. Then on our trip back we ordered a burger and two hot dogs and a couple drinks and paid 100 bucks again. This is a very busy hotel. There was a convention being held here both times we were there. The lobby is always crowded and you will wait a bit to get checked in and get your luggage. They do allow you to use the pool and facilities while you wait for your room if you arrive early. The pool area and beach area are great for families. If I was here only with my husband I think I would be disappointed it is not very romantic with kids running around playing everywhere. It was a very close cab ride to the pier 25 for 6 people with 12 bags. It took about 5 10 min. We did not wait at all to catch a cab. It was the same returning to the hotel after the cruise. Very easy. For that alone I would do this hotel again. The complementary breakfast had good fruit that is about all I can say. If you upgrade to the hot breakfast it is worth it. The pool bar staff are friendly and very attentive. We did not use any other facilities so I can not comment. There is a lot of security walking around. I did see them escort a couple out that was involved in something sketchy it was nice to see the extra security. Overall good for a stop on the way to a cruise.

We booked this family trip very last minute and were lucky to book the last 1BR suite with 15 baths and kitchenette. We considered the trip to be perfect for us largely due in part to this resort and would stay here again. Pros. Amazing protected calm warm in Feb clear beach awesome for our toddlers. Very much caters to families and kids. Embarrassed to say that we never went off site in 3 days but do not regret it. multiple good restaurants on site including full service Starbucks in the lobby kids eat for free under 5 at multiple restaurants garden view room still had a view of the ocean being on the 7th floor. Lobby seems recently renovated very clean contemporary furniture and 2 chatty parrots that our kids adored We found the staff to be very friendly and patient with our kids at all times. Cons. As noted by others rooms showed some age and sloppy renovation work. Tho it was always clean and did not hinder our good time. We checked in at 30pm and our room was not ready until after 430p. We managed to change clothes to maximize time on the beach but wish we had planned for that. kids menus are limited kitchenette really added to our comfort with kids however there were no utensils or dishes there we had to ask for them. There is a very odd policy of saving chaises at the beach without anyone needing to present. 3 days in a row our family was one of the first on the beach at 830am only to be advised by the beach staff that all the empty chaises were in fact saved for people who did not show up until after 1030am. some not until we went to lunch at noon. While I am all for saving seats when you have a large party this seems ridiculous to entertain an empty beach without requiring at least ONE person to present. And unfortunately it seemed to also cause a cycle of guests participating in this policy in order to stake a claim on the beach.

No apple juice no flour to make the chicharon the polo a dessert menu item that left our youngest very disappointed when it was not available and I ordered the island beer Medala and they did not have that either. It was very frustrating to say the least. Then we went to the Italian restaurant and they actually charged us for bread. Also my wife and I went to the Caribar for a drink and it took 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and 10 minutes for us to actually get our drinks. AND THE BAR WAS EMPTY. We did not return to the bar for the rest of the trip. Overall the hotel and staff are great but the restaurants are not. Also everything is very pricey. Which is why many people bought pizza not the best pizza from a local pizza shop. Unfortunately there are not a lot of stores or restaurants in the area so unles you are willing to cab it somewhere you are pretty much stuck with the hotel and its very VERY limit amount of food options surrounding the area. And quickly about the pool. Not sure why but the pool had a very murky look to it. I must admit I am not sure if it was the lighting of the pool at night but it was not very appealing.

We were excited to stay at the Caribe based on reviews and pictures and we also wanted to support a hotel that was hit hard by Hurricane Maria but recovered. Overall we were disappointed for several reasons and we will definitely not return. First the positives. The hotel itself is clean the pools were nice the beach is lovely etc. The rooms were fine average hotel rooms certainly not luxurious. But you hardly go to PR to hang out in your room so it was fine. The view from the room was beautiful and it was nice to have a balcony. The front desk staff were very kind and when a piece of the bathroom cabinet fell on my sons foot they were very responsive and also gave us a free breakfast. The room has a small empty mini fridge which is nice because I feel like so many hotels have moved towards mini fridges that are stocked and you can not use them for your own stuff. The shops on the property were also nice. Now the negatives. Perhaps we were spoiled by staying at the Condado Vanderbilt last year but the service at Caribe was terrible. By terrible I mean mostly non existent. When you did get service it was fine the staff were very pleasant and kind and did a good job. But they are just terribly understaffed to offer any real service. If you were able to catch a waiter once during the day to get a drink at your chair you were lucky. In contrast at the Vanderbilt where we paid the same price btw we had someone tending to us all day long. At the Vanderbilt they set up your chairs for you which are more comfortable chairs bring you towels bring you food and drink all day etc. That does not happen at Caribe. It is fend for yourself and then dirty towels are thrown on the ground and lay there all day. In that regard we felt like we were staying in a hotel with a community pool attached to it not a resort. Again if there was a significant price difference perhaps I would understand why the Vanderbilt was so much better but there is not. The community pool feeling was also created by the fact that they 1 made you wear wristbands and 2. checked your bags every time you came to the pool. We asked what they were checking for and they said guns and knives. WHAT. I have never once had someone check my bags for guns and knives at a hotel especially not one one that I am paying so much money to stay in. And the wristband thing made no sense since they would ask your room number but never confirm that it was indeed you. Dining. The restaurants were over priced for the quality. Rustica was good but we were disappointed in the others. The ice cream shop is delicious however and they make fresh waffle cones every time you order one. We went there daily and the staff were all so nice. We ended up primarily eating off property. If you want a good cup of coffee and a cheap breakfast go to El Mercado at the Paseo Caribe across the street through the parking garage. We also ate dinner there once it is like a NYC style food hall ie upscale food court with about 10 food options and a nice bar. Drinks. Perhaps this was my biggest disappointment. I was looking forward to laying around the pool with a buzz for a few days to de stress from life but the drinks were SO WEAK. I had to order an extra shot just to feel like I was getting any alcohol whatsoever. I ended up sticking to beer which stinks b c I prefer cocktails. Again El Mercado across the street has a good bar with good drinks if you are looking for a stiff oneOther cons they did not have the private cabanas like the website states they did not do activities like the website states except there was water aerobics the last day in general I would not say much info on the website is correct They will not let Uber into the driveway which is a pain in the ass. Why force guests to pay 2x3x more for a cab when an Uber is easier to use and cheaper. Let your guests choose the service they want some things are still under construction ie we could not enjoy the gardens b c they were working on them.", "offset": [2929, 3056], "date": "2019-07-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "4f5bd97e-1fad-46b1-91bc-5ebc410f818f", "sentence": "Prime location and great amenities.
