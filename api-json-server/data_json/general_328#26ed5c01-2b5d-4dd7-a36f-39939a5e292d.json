It was comfortable however due to the extended stay any small annoyances we had at the start were magnified by the endPrice I am not sure as my company paid but the confirmation had 265 per night for 20 nightsBreakfast Dining Bar The full buffet breakfast at Feast was great. From continental to hot foods to fruit and even ice cream if you wished. On some days they had asian breakfasts such as congee or beef noodle pho. There is a chef right there so you can ask for an omelette or eggs how you like it. I found the pre made eggs Benedict soggy as the muffin bread it was sitting on was not toasted but it was fine. Did not eat there or use the bar at any other time except for breakfast so can not comment. Location. Just off Hyde Park within 10 minutes walk where I needed to go on George street. The mall was convenient and we walked to Oxford Street for dinner a few times. Noise etc EXTREMELY NOISYWe were on the 14th floor and we wished we had asked to be moved right at the beginning of our stay as it absolutely did our heads in by the end which was too late to move as we had have to pack all our things and unpack again. The walls were paper thin and we could hear EVERY SINGLE WORD from people in rooms in the vicinity but what is worse. On Saturday morning housekeeping mini bar people and who knows who else that use the service door do not have the decency to close the door when they enter but let it SLAM behind them. All we could hear is SLAM SLAM SLAM. We could hear when another room would use their bathrooms and the fing doorbell that all the rooms had cool feature though you could not differentiate between the neighbours doorbell or your own so we had either ignore it or open the door every few minutes. Other Travellers Mostly older or tour groups. Very polite. A lot of people looked surprised that a bunch of youngins were staying at such a fancy hotel Rooms We had a twin room. The beds were comfortable double size but there was only about 20 cm between the beds. My new friend and I got to know each other extremely well by the second day. Bathroom was spacious and gorgeous. Walk in robe was great too. Wi fi was terrible and expensive. We had to keep reregistering our devices it was supposed to be every 3 days but it was at random. View. We had a city view room so looked into a boring looking building and hence had our shutters closed most of the time. Actually the shutters were electronic which was pretty colCheck In Out Everything went well. When we went line up to check out a reception staff member just filled in a form with some details and made it very speedy. I guess they already had a hold on our credit cards for any incidentals which was provided during check in. Cabs Parking. Concierge was always outside ready to hail a cab for us. We would have preferred to order our own Uber Black vehicles though Not sure about parkingSecurity Lifts did not work without swipe cards. Other Gym was reasonable for a hotel gym. There was a gorgeous pool spa steam and sauna. Wish I had used them more. You could also book for spa services but we did not use them. Overall Experience Overall it was nice but I think staying anywhere for an extended period would get annoying. Seriously ask for a quieter room if you have been given one on 14th floor or lower. Our friends stayed on the 15th floor and the rooms on that floor were not used as much so it was much quieter.", "offset": [1367, 1551], "date": "2015-08-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "6069afce-8a8e-4000-815a-249252e666b9", "sentence": "A great hotel that could be even better. I have wanted to stay at Sheraton on the Park for many years now. I had the opportunity to stay while in SYD last week and stayed for three nights. Overall a good experience. The lobby is grand and has an amazing feeling about it. Love itThe rooms are comfortable but a little tired and generally in need of a little bit of a revamp. I paid for a Hyde park view and this was well worth it. The best thing in the room is the bed. Amazingly comfortable and I would stay here just for the bed alone. The staff were pretty good and mostly friendly. The restaurant for breakfast was okay but the staff seemed like they were a little tired or not into it on two of the three days. On the last day I had a waiter that must have walked past or checked on my table every 2 minutes and it was not a relaxing experience. I had high tea with friends in the the lounge and this was great. The location of this hotel is great. St James Station is just across the road and you are in the heart of Sydneys shopping district. My main frustration of which would actually influence me returning was the constant slamming of doors by staff. The housekeeping staff room service and min bar staff all let doors slam behind them meaning you have constant banging from the hall. I was sometimes woken up by this.

With the prospect of being stuck in Sydney for the night I made a last minute booking at Sheraton on the Park in Sydney. I was fortunate to get a great discount through bokingcom for the City Side Room. Upon my arrival there were no queues for check in and I was offered an upgrade to the Executive Suite overlooking Hyde Park for an extra 50 which I took. The room was substantial 70sqm in size with a large L shaped lounge separate bedroom and a walk in wardrobe that led to the bath. Whilst the room was nice that was all I received for my money. A late night swim was not on the cards as the pool level was inaccessible after 10 pm. With a bottle of water costing 9 in the room I decided stopping at a convenience store after dinner was a necessity. The staff were very helpful in pointing me in the direction of restaurants however as most kitchens had already closed by 9 pm I found myself at the hotel restaurant. Although the meal was adequate it was what I would expect of a moderately priced family restaurant with a 20 price tag not the 42 I was stung with. Not only did my meal take an exorbitant amount of time to prepare despite me being the only person in the restaurant. the gluten free meal that they produced was in no way free of gluten and lead to a rather horrid night. The bed was incredibly comfortable the climate control somewhat simple to operate and the check out a breeze. However I was again disappointed when I was informed that breakfast was by no means free or even discounted. So off I trundled down the street to pay 22 for a measly 3 egg omelette. As there are numerous high end hotels in Sydney to experience I would not stay here again in a hurry.

AS a VIP member I have the option of requesting a 24 hour check in so I had requested a 9 AM checkin that was not granted which was okay. We showed up at the hotel at 930 AM after a 24 hour flight and were told that our suites were not ready but the guest in that room had checked out and the rooms were in queue for getting cleaned and I assumed that would not be more than 30 minutes. The front desk asked us to go the lounge and freshen up by which time our rooms should be ready. We got to the lounge at about 958 AM and went to gran something to eat we had our plates in hand and the lounge attendants walked to the food and picked up everything not giving us any opportunity to get anything to eat. The food trays were half full yet were taken away while 4 of us were waiting with plates in our hands. We finally got a couple of pieces of fruit and yogurt. After spending 45 minutes in the lounge we went down and were told the rooms were not yet ready. I waited for another 45 minutes and went up to the front desk manager and enquired about the status of our rooms. He did not even look at the reservation but were abruptly told us that they wo nt be ready for another couple of hours. I was incredulous and told him that about 90 minutes ago his front desk had told me that the rooms were being cleaned and now he was saying it would another couple hours. how long does it take to clean a suite. I then went on to explain to him the behavior of the lounge attendants and instead of being apologetic he says. oh they close at 10 AM. So I said this is how Starwod treats its VIP members and he says the suites are big and they take more time to clean. At this point I was fed up and requested him to keep our bags and move them to the rooms when they were ready and we would step out. He promised to call us when the rooms were ready.

My husband and I have stayed at Sheraton on the Park numerous times previously as it is in such a great location but this is the last time I will ever stay there. I had booked two nights two TWIN rooms for a girls weekend away to visit several exhibitions. I booked via Wotif although I am a Sheraton member. On arrival we were told that there were no twin rooms available as we did not book directly through them and that they treat the Wotif bookings as requests only and they are not guaranteed. This was news to me but the manner in which it was delivered was not good customer service next time you should book through us direct. Madam there will not be a next time. Although my friends and I are very close we did not wish to share a bed. We then asked to speak to a Manager who also was most curt and unfriendly. He would not refund our money as we had paid through a third party and there were rooms available just not twin ones. He suggested that we take it up with Wotif. When a member of our party pointed out that she has a broken arm and needs to spread out he offered us a complimentary roll away bed but if the others wanted one for their room then they would have to pay for it. It was only after we expressed our unhappiness at this did he relent and make the other roll away complimentary also. Reluctantly we accepted the beds as the only other option was to pay for two additional king rooms. I was most embarrassed in front of my friends as I had organised the entire weekend. At least the evening Manager had had lessons in good customer service and followed up with us later and offered us some complimentary fruit and wine as an apology. Then to my horror I noticed a red blob of something I did not get closer to find out what on the wall next to the mini bar. When I showed a photo to the same night manager he was most apologetic and offered to send up cleaners immediately. Then he offered us two. complimentary breakfasts. Overall just two much complimentary happening for our liking and having to sleep on roll away beds was not what we had wished for.
