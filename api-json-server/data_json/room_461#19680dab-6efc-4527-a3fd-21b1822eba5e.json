In the same trip I have also been at the Four Seasons at Landa Giravaru Landa and there is a clear difference in terms of the hotel condition. The key for my rating were the hotel staff services my room and because the resort is located in a beautiful island. I got there by sea plane from Landa and was very well impressed again by the efficient and organized logistic. I was very well welcomed and the checkin process and hotel overview was very fast. I have stayed at a Sunrise Beach Bungalow 207 which had a beautiful beach just steps from the nice but small pool different from Landa where my room did not have a beach in front even it was also a Beach Bungalow. The room was excellent but not very big and with a very good maintenance. The two main negative points were the noisy air conditioning and the old and noisy mattress. Also the room lack of some privacy some of the windows were facing a public passage and are too close to one another. Before my checkout date the management offered me a complimentary late checkout I was leaving at 930pm but I needed to move to a smaller room Beach Pavilion 106 at that day at 11 am. That was a very nice gesture mainly because I did not ask for. The room was ok not at the same standards of other rooms The room did not have sea view had big privacy problems had a very mold smell and it was clear that the wood of the balcony and ceiling had termite problems I also noticed some termites in other parts of the resort. I think it would be better to finish with this room category and construct other common areas or more Beach Bungalows there is not reason to have such kind of inferior room there. The hotel is compact and you can easily walk to all the places. Surrounded by a gorgeous beach you can stay in both sides with no reasons to complain. sunrise side the one I was has the best spots for snorkeling and the sunset side have a calmer sea very shallow during low tide but the beach is busier. There are two pools. The Main Pool is easily reached by the sunset beach and is located besides the main restaurant. It is very nice but has an old style floor and some of the tables were lacking of a good maintenance. Service was great thank you Mr Amu. The other pool only for Adults is located besides the Blue Reef restaurant same style as in Landa and is GORGEOUS. If you are traveling without kids do not waste your time and head to the serenity pool. There is also a jacuzi facing the ocean great for the sunset. The service at the serenity pool was very good but not great. At the beach you normally stay at the chairs in front of your room but they also offer spare ones. Even though the beach service is very good and efficient thank you Mr Blue also there is energy plug in case you need to charge your phone something missing at Landas beach. BTW wifi works perfectly everywhere but they charge for a premium package unnecessary for a 18k daily rate. The diving center is much smaller than the one in Lada but the dives I did were much better. even with strong current I was able to see big fished including lots of sharks and rays turtles but also beautiful and healthy coral formations with an exuberant life. I would like to highlight that I was the only one diving at all occasions and the resort had honored my appointment. I would like to thank Mr Mazin for the excellent job.

Ordering room service for lunch to enjoy our pool it was fantastic until noisy neighbors let their kids scream all day. Luckily they provide a speaker system which helped cover this noise with our music. Tobias Emmer always was checking to see how we were doing and I made a comment how we had noisy kids next door.

Warning this is a long review but there \u2019s just so much to say. We stayed at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura for 7 days as we wanted a luxury family vacation where we could just unwind yet still have fun. We hit the jackpot. A member of staff greets you as soon as you clear Immigration and get your bags. You \u2019re taken to the Four Seasons private waiting lounge where you can relax with a cold towel and drink while your bags are taken to the waiting boat. And if you ca n\u2019t yet unplug from life they have free wifi. A short boat ride takes you to the island. They say it \u2019s about 30 minutes but I think it \u2019s less than that. We stayed during monsoon and arrived just after a big storm so the boat ride was n\u2019t exactly pleasant me being squeamish in rough waters. However the crew made us feel welcome and safe and the captain handled the waves expertly. Before long the island comes into view. It \u2019s just far enough away to make you feel like you \u2019re really away yet not fair enough that takes you hours to get there. And you \u2019re far enough away so you ca n\u2019t see or hear Male. As the boat pulls up to the dock you are welcomed by a traditional drum and welcome committee. You are greeted by name and they continue this for the remainder of your trip \u2013 which is impressive. They took us for a quick tour of the island via golf buggy and then took us to our room. We had a beach bungalow on the sunrise side we definitely made the right choice. If you have small children I do n\u2019t recommend the water villas as there \u2019s no walls separating your little ones from the water. You may want to check with the hotel prior to booking to see what side is catching the wind as it does change. We were lucky in that we were on the calm side of the island which meant we were able to be outside in our pool and on the beach without facing strong winds. Also the water was much calmer so you could actually snorkel or even just see the fish by standing still. The beach bungalow was brilliant. We purposely chose it instead of the pavilion as we knew to expect rain and wanted to have enough space inside in case we could n\u2019t go outside. We have a toddler so having this extra room worked perfectly. Now where the Four Seasons really earned extra points was in their preparation and treatment of our daughter. Everyone knew her name and in the room they thought of EVERYTHING. There was a crib with beautiful beach themed bedding and blanket as well as a small box with diapers swim diapers wipes and baby body wash. There was even a diaper genie in the bathroom. There was also a bottle warmer and fresh milk in the fridge. They had an infant menu as well as some fresh fruit puree in case she was hungry when we arrived. Amazing. It \u2019s the small things which mean the most. Now for the restaurants they \u2019re all amazing. However we spent most nights at the Kuda Grill as the staff there were wonderful. They made us feel special and their friendly treatment of our daughter kept us coming back. Special mention to Osy Jinan Melody Baha Dian Shawn and Husain. Ashamedly I never got the name of the FB Manager despite his regular visits and attention \u2013 he was also wonderful. For the food we enjoyed everything we ate but I would recommend going with a fresh fish which was caught that day and have it on the grill. The Sunset Lounge is also incredible as the view for the sunset is beautiful. You ca n\u2019t help but take incredible postcard like pictures. It cements that you \u2019re in paradise each and every day. We also took a tour of the Marine Center where they are housing rehabilitated turtles. They are doing great work and if you sponsor a reef frame the proceeds go directly to Kuda Hura to help them provide continuous care to these animals. Thanks to Tobias for the tour and explanation of each of the turtles. We bought a coral frame which they use to regrow the reef. They already sent us pictures of it and it is located outside the water villas. I ca n\u2019t wait to go back and visit it. As if relaxing on the beach was n\u2019t enough I also experienced the spa twice. There \u2019s a cute little boat that takes you across the small bay to the other island where the spa is located. They focus on the healing elements of the ocean and this is clear in all their products and treatment names. Both my treatments were excellent with the treatment rooms opening up with a beautiful view of the crystal blue water. For those with kids the Kids Club is highly recommended. It is well designed and well planned with many activities throughout the day. All in all it was an incredible holiday and the hotel was amazing. They found the right balance of relaxation with activities. You can be as lazy or as adventurous as you want and they seem to know how to cater to your desire. They took care of us and made us feel welcome from the moment we stepped foot on the island to the moment we got off the boat back at Male Airport.

Fantastic staff accommodation and food. We could not have asked for a more amazing place to stay. We had a beach bungalow for four nights and a water villa for two both were amazing. Comfortable clean everything you can think of in the room. They both had pools which were beautifully clean. The island is small so the rooms are almost on the beach. The service and food is truly 5 star. The boat trips with the marine savers team were excellent. We were very lucky seeing sharks turtles dolphin rays and mantas. So many water sports too. We did an early morning kayak. There are opportunities for diving and surfing too with lessons. The island spa is awesome with views of the fish swimming underneath the treatment rooms. We are a couple travelling on holiday and meeting up with our son. We stayed in November.

When the team met us at the airport and picked us up in a wifi enabled car we knew we were in for another level of service and were not disappointed. The Sunset pool water villa was a pretty amazing layout. Beautiful room overlooking the villa inifinity pool with sliding doors to go right to the pool. Deck layout is huge and really well done. The food was amazing Reef Club and Indian restaurant Mahi Mahi curry was one of my favorite meals of the trip and the service was outstanding. It was great to talk with the staff and hear where they are from as well. We went there specifically for the surfing and had an awesome time with the Tropic Surf team. Archie Angela and Josh were super helpful in explaining the set up and making sure we would have a good experience. It is a truly luxury surfing experience as you take a large boat with room for 10 surfboards to a famous break where they have surf competitions and get to surf everything from beginner to expert waves in a beautiful setting. Highly recommend going on the surf trip even if a beginner as you can paddle safely to the side of the waves and the staff makes you feel safe at all times second time surfer was with us. Housekeeping staff was great and efficient. The onsite sea turtle conservatory was great to see as well over 30 sea turtles being nursed back to health with a very knowledgable and friendly staff. The boat ride there was a lot of fun too be but for those not into speedboats and 3 4 ft seas might be a little less fun.

Our 9 day holiday at Four Seasons Kuda Hura was quite simply THE BEST. Having stayed at Four Seasons villa resorts in Bali Koh Samui we knew it would be something special but nothing prepared us for Four Seasons Kuda Hura in the beautiful Maldives. This was hands down the best holiday we have ever had. The resort built to blend into the natural beauty of this small island surrounded by the most beautiful sea in the world was a total delight for the senses. Kuda Hura \u2019s commitment to the environment is quite impressive from the complete elimination of plastic bottles from the resort to it \u2019s sanctuary for the rehabilitation of injured turtles. Our beach villa was beautiful and only steps from the sea. The villa \u2019s private outdoor pool garden was so lovely you could be tempted to forego the beach. The beautiful setting is a bonus but it is actually the people of Kuda Hura who turned our holiday into something way beyond special. They take such pleasure in doing all things large small to make your stay absolutely perfect. Nothing is too much trouble and any request is met with a smile. In fact very few requests were necessary because the staff seems to anticipate and offer before you can even ask. Housekeeping was amazing. They are at your service at all times and for the smallest request. Our housekeeper Shamem took amazing care of us. He is a charming talented man who brought smiles beautiful floral art to our villa each day. The resort \u2019s talented Executive Chef Vincent Tan is from Malaysia. When Vincent found out that we had lived in KL for 7 years he surprised us with our favorite Malaysian breakfast which he personally prepared. He oversees all of the restaurants in Kuda Hura and they are fabulous. You are really spoiled for choice when it comes to dining at Kuda Hura. Kandu Grill serves the freshest locally caught fish cooked over an open fire surrounding the pool in the beautiful Maldivian evening. The totally authentic Indian restaurant rivals some of the best in the world and definitely has the most delicious naan. The superb Italian restaurant has a fantastic menu of classic dishes including locally caught seafood. And finally Caf\u00e9 Hura the resort \u2019s main restaurant has a wide variety of ethnic western foods. This is also the place where you start your day with an amazing buffet breakfast. We can not leave out Sunset Lounge the perfect spot to enjoy a drink experience stunningly beautiful Maldivian sunsets. The staff management in these restaurants are world class and could not be more accommodating courteous efficient. In fact the management of this resort must be doing everything right. It is the staff who set the tone for any resort and at Kuda Hura it is quite obvious that these are very happy people. We had the pleasure to meet get to know Shamakh Yan two outstanding young Maldivian men who work in several of the restaurants. They are absolutely delightful. We will never forget the very special dinner they organized served for us at Kandu Grill on our last evening. We have run out of space to mention everyone by name but we want to say a big thank you to all the management staff at Kuda Hura for making our holiday one in a million. We look forward to seeing you all again at Kuda Hura in the coming months.

We spent our Easter holiday at FS KH. This is our 4th visit to this beautiful resort. Everything remain flawless since our last stay in Oct 2018. Despite Easter holiday is peak season we never feel crowd or hard to book our activities. The resort arranged different special activities for family and kids during this festive season. We enjoyed family sand castle making competition special activities at the kids club and the Easter themed dinner impressed us the most. We found that the menus for both a la carte and themed dinner at the restaurants have been changed with much more varieties both appetizers main courses and even dessert are available to choose from and all new dishes are scrumptious and very nicely presented. An excellent job by Executive Chef Vincent and his team. To get the excellent rating from so many travellers in particular a lot of revisiting travellers is not without reason. The villas facilities and food at FS KH are stunning is a key factor but to our family the services offered by the staff in this resort is the most important factor.

We recently returned from a fabulous stay at Four Seasons Kuda Hura. We had just come from Landa Giravaru. Both islands are beautiful but very different. The one similarity is the staff. At both resorts they go above and beyond to take care of you and do things you never would have expected \u2026. always with the biggest smiles. At Kuda Hura we were treated like royalty. They upgraded our two Over Water Bungalows to a 3 bedroom Over water Suite. The housekeeping staff did beautiful job keeping the suite immaculate and the pool crystal clear. Maximilon the Director of Rooms was there from the moment we got off the boat until we departed. Always making sure we were happy and even sending each family member off with a special Maldivian keepsake. I should also mention that unrequested they gave us a late check out of 9 pm so we could enjoy every minute of our stay. The chefs and waiters in all the restaurants were amazing. Ralesh and Wasiu took amazing care of us. Shape was so attentive and gave us great advise on things to do and entertained us with the pancake messages he had made we are still laughing. One night at dinner I mentioned to Anant how I love one of the Madivian food items. Five minutes later he returns to the table with the chef Rajendra who presented me with a bag of the special item to take home. Also Chef Rajendra was there at every meal to help my husband navigate his gluten allergy. Always willing to make anything special for him. We also highly recommend the heart of the house tour which gives you an inside look into how the island runs from generating power sanitizing water receiving the food shipments dealing with the local fishermen for the days fresh catch seeing where the staff eats \u2026. They take great pride in everything they do and really enjoyed sharing. Next time I would want to do the local island tour as well. Leaving the Maldives and the two Four Seasons properties was the first time my family has ever been sad to go home. It was n\u2019t just hard to leave the beautiful sun and water that is like nothing else in this world but it was hard to leave everyone that treated us like family a royal family.", "offset": [481, 578], "date": "2019-07-31", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "6564d485-eceb-47f5-a3e2-63330fb3fad4", "sentence": "Stunning property and genuine staff. We spent 7 full days at this resort as part of our family vacation. The staff there are so accommodating and cared about us. Special kudos to the In Bungalow dining staff and chef who assist us in making special menu to our special needs son. This is so memorable and made us so happy. We stayed in the beach villa and it comes with a private pool and can have access to the beach. Perfect room for family with kids in my opinion. Breakfast buffet is great as daily they have new items offer so you will not feel bored eating there daily. My elder son just loves the strawberry milk with cereal. Another must try is their daily flavor of coconut rasbery strawberry protein shake and mango lasi. Also love the theme nights buffet and we tried the Kuda grill and the Asian theme. Joseph Ashley Kiki are great and always engaging with us. For sure Giovani is running and leading a good show there. Front office Ahmed and Suzu cared about us and gave us great tips and ensure we have a flawless stay. Max the Director of Rooms is very kind and humble and always ensure and ask if our stay is fine. Lisa and her staff in the kids club are great and cared about my son and just allow him to run around and played with all the toys. Thank you so much. My wife did a SPA treatment and she said it was a wonderful experience as welWe enjoyed the dolphin cruise the tour of the Maldivian village and also the recreation activities at the resort. Impressed with the funny crab race and the feeding of the shark. Learned about taking care of turtles at the resort too. Lastly special gratitude to the general manager Mr Randy and the most helpful Ms Chanet who ensure we are well taken care of and introduced us what we can do at the resort.

We feel very blessed to have spent four nights at Four Seasons Kuda Hura in celebration of my husband \u2019s 50th Birthday and our 24th Wedding Anniversary. From the moment we arrived we were so awestruck by the outstanding service and the postcard perfect scenery. The villa music that was playing upon our entry combined with our chilled bottle of champagne and celebratory fruit and chocolates were a true amusement. Our first day began with a luxurious and plentiful buffet breakfast the variety was exceptional and if there were ever an additional request it was most certainly granted. We enjoyed our days by the beach paddle boarding our professional photographer photoshot and were always thrilled to return to our gorgeous villa. Our special dinner was at the Indian restaurant where Chef Raj greeted and spent time to get to know us. The meal was exquisite and we thoroughly enjoyed our water view as well as the live music. Chef Raj was so kind to send us our requested fish pakoras and hot chai to our villa on a rainy afternoon. He also made us fresh Dosas for breakfast upon our request. They were delicious. Additionally we were able to indulge in two massages at the spa some time at the gym as well as a yoga class with views of the water that are beyond words. Without a doubt this place is magical. However one person of grand hospitality polite demeanour and exceptional kindness that we had the pleasure of meeting is Mr Santosh. He met us at dinner one evening and took the time and effort to get to know us. We let him know of our previous four nights at Four Seasons Tented Camp in Chiang Rai and he was happy to know that we chose Kuda Hura for the next leg of our commemorative trip. Mr Santosh went out of his way to make sure that we had all our needs met and then some. He noted specifics from our discussions such as our love for the cookies in the room and made sure the replenishment was always made. He also invited us for sunset drink prior to dinner on our last night and what a sunset it was. By far the most striking sunset view I have ever seen. It was a gracious gesture that was greatly cherished. So too was the heart shaped balloon placed in our villa for our anniversary celebration. The send off with goodbyes to the staff when we left brought tears to my eyes. As were whisked away on boat back to the airport I turned around to see the staff surprisingly waving and holding up a sign that said See You Soon. Surely we and hopefully our extended family and friends will enjoy this picturesque resort again with wonderful service and memories to last a lifetime. Mr Santosh all I can say is that they are truly lucky to have you at Four Seasons Kuda Hura.

My wife and I spent a restful week at the Kuda Hura resort in November. Before we woke up each morning the grounds crew was out picking up fallen leaves and other debris and raking the sandy pathways so that when you went to breakfast the surroundings were beautiful. The rooms and common facilities were spotless. The white beaches ran down to the aquamarine water which was calm and inviting during our stay. The islet us reef is healthy and well populated by a colorful assortment of tropical fish including many parrot fish puffer fish needle fish more than one species of rays and even some small black tip sharks. Every day we got our steps in when we walked my wife ran out to the end of the kilometer long walkway that ended on the small island where the chef was growing herbs in his small greenhouse. Speaking of chefs I will never forget some of the wonderful meals that I ate at the resort. In particular there was this red snapper that had been smoked over an open fire which sticks in my mind. One day I also sampled a century egg which I can now remove from my bucket list of things I wanted to try. We had great weather while we were there so every single meal was eaten al fresco and served by not just friendly staff but by very special people that made you feel like family. At meals all the resort managers would come by to say hello and make sure everything was perfect. We got to know several of the staff on a personal level and it seems the Four Seasons hiring practices are bang on. Everyone takes the time to treat every guest the same way. Kudos to General Manager Randy Shimabaku his assistant Chanate Khukhan and the wonderful guest services manager Ahmed Nazim. Thanks to Maximilian Schilick Director of Rooms and Maxime Lureau Director of Spa who not only kept the resort sparkling but were warm and welcoming. Thank you to Giovani DAlesandro Director of Food and Beverage Restaurant Managers Joseph Daniel and Branka Novakovic and Rajendra Meravi the Sous Chef. Also warm regards to Das the best bartender in Asia. Special mention to the resident marine biologists that were caring for a large number of injured sea turtles at the resort. The poor turtles had been injured in fishermans nets and got the same TLC that the guests did. We have stayed at many Four Seasons resorts now including the ones in Lanai Bali the Seychelles and Mauritius.
