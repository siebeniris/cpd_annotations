We stayed at the Renaissance Dallas Hotel from April 10th \u2013 12 in room 2015 with my husband and 7 yr. old son while our older son attended a school event in Dallas staying at a different hotel. We travel frequently staying at various hotels but I have to say I have never before experienced customer service like at the RenaisanceAl the staff front desk restaurant housekeeping etc. was super courteous helpful attentive offering assistance just because they paid attention to the needs of the guests holding the elevator door helping carry the extra cup of coffee to the room and doing it all with a smile. But to top it off it was the assistance after our checkout that surprised me even more. Traveling with kids it is inevitable that you either loose or leave something at a hotel and 99 of the time with no chance of ever seeing it again. Not so at the Renaissance. Two hours after our checkout well into our trip back home my son realized that he left his beloved stuffed animal at the hotel. While I thought it was going to be a lost cause trying to call the hotel to see if anyone might have returned the toy but my son was really upset over it so I called. Gwen at the Loss Prevention office picked up the phone and was very understanding of the situation but unfortunately the toy was not turned in at that time yet. She offered though to go up to our room and see if she could find it and call me back with the answer. Obviously from previous experiences I did not think that I would ever hear from Gwen again \u2026. but sure enough to my surprise 10 minutes later my phone rang with the good news she found that the beloved stuffed animal and right away Gwen started to arrange for getting the toy back to my son and inquiring what my preference for shipment would be. On Monday morning I received another call from Bety at Shipping and Loss prevention to verify my credit card information. And sure enough Wednesday evening only 2 days later. the package arrived to my son \u2019s delight with a very nice note from Bety thanking us for our stay and hoping for the opportunity to be able to serve us again. I should be the one thanking you all for going above and beyond making our weekend visit so comfortable and more than anything making a little boy very happy by getting his stuffed animal back to him.

I was a little surprised with this property. The reviews were pretty good so I was expecting way more during my stay. For starters upon check in I was told all rooms have connecting doors because the property used to be a hospital and they had patient and family rooms connecting. I guess you can not do much about the building history but to be told this when checking just set an odd vibe for the stay. Plus i was coming from a hospital and this was the last thing I ever wanted to hear at the point of check in. The room was ok. Nothing special. Bed was ok. Decor was nice and looked like a recent renovation but it still needed some updating. The desk chair was ripped and my TV did not work. After spending an hour with Angelo great guy by the way who handles maintenance it was finally working after he had to replace the TV. So after checking in and sitting for an hour I was finally able to go about my day. When I returned in the evening I was kept up until 3 am with 20 somethings partying in the room next door. They were not even that loud but the walls must have been paper thin. The staff is friendly and do their best. I just feel the hotel itself just has an odd feeling about it. I walked over to the Hilton down the street and it looked very nice. I was not aware of their pricing though. I will say if priced the same i would check out hilton next time.", "offset": [301, 424], "date": "2015-05-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "ca1b4fee-5b81-48e0-a34a-5864ad0332e9", "sentence": "Tries to be trendy noisy and out of place. Visited the Renaissance with my wife in June. The hotel chain seems to be having an identity problem. it is trying to pass as a trendy and young hotel instead of old luxury but it is neither today.

Housekeeping did not give me any new washcloths after cleaning the room one day. And finally after calling ahead and informing them that I was nursing and would need to store my milk in the freezer I was assured that it was no problem. Each time I turned in milk at the front desk I specified to place in the freezer and was told ok. When I attempted to retrieve the milk when checking out it was an arduous process. I packed and labeled all bags to make it easy yet no one could easily find it. It took 3 separate trips to get back all of the milk I had turned in and none of it was frozen.

I stayed at this hotel from Nov 30 Dec 3. I am a Platinum member so as usual I asked for an upgrade upon arrival. I was told that none were available as the hotel was booked solid. I had no reason to doubt this and was quite satisfied with the check in process. My room was on the 22nd floor. I was a little surprised and disappointed that the room had a connecting door to the adjacent room. Luckily the occupants of that room were quiet and I could barely hear them or the TV. The bed was typically Mariot outstanding. The bathroom was functional but nothing more than that. The shower was average. I was awakened in the night by a rattling noise in the vent in the ceiling in the sink area. I called for maintenance to diagnose the problem. The maintenance man arrived and was quite courteous and fixed the problem while I was away for the day. The Concierge Room is average among all the Mariots that I have been to. I can not remember what was served in the evenings but it was nothing special and the variety was just not there. The breakfasts were better. Unlike many other Mariots this hotel offered two different types of eggs traditional and egg whites mixed with vegetables. The service in the Concierge room is outstanding. The employees can not do enough for you. They give you a big greeting along with a have a nice day when you leave. The gym at this hotel is a bit above average. There are about 6 Life Fitness Machines free weights up to 50 pounds and a separate Life Fitness machine where you can exercise many body parts. The fruit bowl was empty 2 days and the holder containing the wipes to clean the machine after use was empty one day. The gym has about 10 cardio machines. I could not decide whether to give this hotel a 3 or 4 rating. I decided that it merits a 4 rating because I am convinced that management at the hotel really cares to make it better. One day I was about to get on the elevator when the Assistant GM Chandana introduced himself to me. We chatted for about 5 minutes. He said that he was sorry that I experienced some problems at the hotel. He also said that he would make sure there is a notation in my record that I should not be assigned a room that connects to another room. I got a courteous thank you email from him the following day. I also got a nice email from the Engineering Manager who apologized for the problem with the vent. He also said that he would deposit 500 points in my Mariot Rewards account. I thanked him for the nice customer service. I will return to this hotel next September and hope to be able to give it a rating of 5 next time.", "offset": [2056, 2128], "date": "2015-12-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "fff49315-8858-4db2-a045-f1c42bafb8c2", "sentence": "Had a great stay here for a national owners meeting.

On a very recent trip to Dallas my family and I decided to stay at the Renaissance Dallas Hotel. The overall quality of the hotel is fine. The restaurant staff are very helpful the rooms are neat and tidy the location is okay and overall the experience is fine. Unfortunately the experience takes a quick downturn if you ask the front desk for recommendations on local tourist sites general things to do or offering suggestions for dining. We were looking for things to do in the local area. Sadly the front desk staff could not tell us much other than a small city garden with food trucks. Some guidance on local attractions would have been very much appreciated. We were also looking for different places to dine ranging from Italian to Asian cuisine. Once again very little input from the staff other than to drive to Trinity Groves. We ended up doing an Open Table search and found a wonderful restaurant close by. Too bad the hotel could not do the same and make a suggestion. it is a pity that the Renaissance staffs the front desk with people who are unable to showcase and sell their own city. There are plenty of things to do and places to eat in Dallas. Perhaps they need to review their training program. If you are familiar with the area this is a great hotel.

Not enough space to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to the management and staff at this amazing property. Aesthetics aside it is always the staff and quality service one receives that makes a hotel experience worth sharing. Front Desk Supervisor Joe Zambouni is the quintessential gentleman and professional. He went beyond the extra mile to make our unique stay as pleasant and stress free as possible. This was n\u2019t a vacation or work related stay. This was strictly a long distance medical trip. The king rooms were clean luxurious and spacious. Just like home. Our 1st night stay turned into 2 when we learned my husband had to have an emergency surgery the following day. From the moment we arrived until we checked out on day 3 we were treated not like guests. But rather more like old friends. From the moment we shared our story with Joe and others our experience at The Renaissance was unlike any we have ever had. And trust me we are all well traveled. But when your trip is medically related it is n\u2019t quite like a vacation or work related venture. Having worked in the business as a Sales Marketing Director I do n\u2019t know many in the hospitality industry that are trained to deal with unexpected medical guests. But then I also do n\u2019t know anyone who has n\u2019t been touched or affected by cancer in their lifetime either. Whether it \u2019s a family member or a close friend. When the news hits it literally rocks your world. And when it hits you a 2nd and then a 3rd time you can hardly breathe because the universe just swallowed you up whole. It \u2019s never easy. Especially if you have to travel long distances to receive specialized medical care. Front Desk Supervisor Joe Zambouni set the bar high. He could n\u2019t have have been more compassionate authentic and understanding when we arrived. It was evident upon our arrival that things were n\u2019t well. It was written more clearly on our faces after we returned from my husband \u2019s medical appointment. We learned he had to have emergency surgery the next day. When my best friend husband and I returned to our rooms we discovered a wonderful surprise. There was a thoughtful card signed by Mr Zambouni and his staff inside a gift bag filled with sweet yummy treats any guest would enjoy and appreciate. It brought tears to my best friend and I. While my husband recovered from his surgery and was kept overnight at the hospital. my best friend and I made our way to the hotel. We were famished. So we headed straight to the restaurant to have dinner. We looked like zombies. The past 48 hours had taxed us to the point of sheer exhaustion. All we wanted was a decent meal hot shower and a good night \u2019s rest. The restaurant manager Paul proved to be another exemplary Renaissance Hotel team member. The quality service and kindness shown to us was most memorable. We had a small issue at first however Paul took charge and handled things like a seasoned pro. Our new server Ephraim was courteous attentive and made sure our meal met our ideal satisfaction. Those appetizer French fries with Ranch dressing were the absolute best we \u2019d ever had. No lie. I do n\u2019t think my best friend and I shared more than 5 words over our entire delicious dinner. We were extremely exhausted and emotionally spent. Just when we were getting ready to pay our dinner tab a beautiful platter of every scrumptious elegant dessert on the menu was brought to our table. Compliments of the house. With eyes wide open we just sat there in utter shock. We looked at each other. Looked at the elegant desserts. Looked at our server Ephraim. Then back to the fresh fruit decorated dessert platter in awe. Like a scene right out of \u201c Friends \u201d my girlfriend and I looked at each other coquettishly grinned thanked Ephraim then quickly grabbed our dessert forks and dove into the closest decadent treat near us like starving orphaned children. If you want a girl to temporarily forget about her troubles give her a sweet surprise treat. We could n\u2019t thank the restaurant manager Paul enough for helping us to end our very long stressful day with a wonderful superbly made dinner and delicious desserts we could not finish. It warranted a warm hug and genuine thanks from this wearied and worried wife. In closing whether your trip to Dallas is for work pleasure or the unexpected medical appointment I highly recommend you consider The Renaissance Hotel for your next stay. I promise you wo n\u2019t be disappointed. And I certainly do n\u2019t think you \u2019l find a more refined friendly classy professional caring establishment anywhere in the Dallas area. In my humblest opinion of course. But then again you wo n\u2019t know for sure until you experience it for yourself.", "offset": [3698, 3934], "date": "2018-09-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "94fdc9ec-2ff8-4085-a73a-e7eeb17cb53c", "sentence": "Staying there was a great experience.

The rooms are spacious clean and smartly designed. The large nearly ceiling to floor windows offer much light and stunning downtown views of the city. The oversized waterfall showerhead was extremely relaxing after traveling. We requested feather pillows and downfiled comforters which were an amazing soft and homey touch to the room and the sleep experience. Room temperatures were pleasant. Rooms were odorless and quiet. The hotel is equipped with smart elevators. This is my first time to experience this. With having 30 floors 514 guest rooms a convention in the hotel with all the guests staying there I was amazed how efficient the elevators were to getting everyone where they wanted to go quickly. I found that I might wait a tad longer for the elevator doors avg 20 seconds usually 10 secs once it was 40 secs to open but nearly each time I was jettisoned joking. but it was VERY QUICK to the floor that I initially had keyed in. Pros very efficient no waiting no lines or full elevators Cons you can not change your mind which floor you want once you get into the elevator. But you can fix that once you get out on the initially chosen floor and then repress the newly desired floor in the keypad. I was most impressed with them and would LOVE to see more hotels install them. The conference was located in the attached ballrooms and were easy to find visit and leave to stop by the hotel rooms for breaks. The open vernada is just stunning with the white arbors with the white touile complemented well with the large bar open standing seating areas and full sized ceiling to wall windows inside for windy or rainy days. The in house restaurant was a bit pricy but convenient fun open atmosphere friendly staff large sitting bar as well as small and large tables to accommodate each party size. Local or popular sports games were shown on the large TV above the bar. The menu selections did have some gluten free options such as GF pancakes and GF blueberry muffins. The food portions are large sized which allowed us to take leftovers to our room and keep them fresh for the next morning by placing them in our medium sized larger than dorm sized fridge. All the food was very tasty and cooked to your liking. They offer a breakfast bar in addition to menu selections. I found it was cheaper to order off the menu 15 than the bar 20. but it meant that we sat ordered and waited for our food. Whereas the bar would be much faster if we were in a hurry. The top floor of the hotel is where the gym and pool are located. Nice large workout room equipped with stairmasters treadmills bicycles weighted exercise equipment as well as a washer dryer hot cold water dispenser sweat towels wet wipes pool towels and most workout accessories such as mats foam blocks jump ropes and PT equipment. They have one decent sized wall with full length mirrors for yoga loose weights for bench press and PT exercises. The pool is outside with a hot tub. The view would have been phenomenal since the pool is located on the roof of this skyscraper. But the day I visited it it was stormy and therefore locked. I do know some of my friends went up to enjoy a pool party one evening but I was too tired to go. Once again I am sure it would be amazing up there. This hotel does have a parking garage as well as a few outdoor parking spots. I believe they charge a daily parking fee. We flew in and therefore did not need that service. All in all I had be happy to stay again. It was very comfortable relaxing and very accommodating to our every request. It is certainly not a budget happy Fairfield or Holiday Inn where you stay in a clean no frills but friendly hotel for 80 120 night with a free continental breakfast. But the convenience of staying in the same hotel as the conference coupled along with the MANY upgrades to make what could be a stressful 5 days turned this dear Mommas stay into a plush relaxing and down right amazing get away from reality.
