I stayed two nights attending a series of business meetings in the hotels meeting rooms. I have stayed at several Ritz Carlton properties and this one does not disappoint. The location is as close to perfect as you can get it is a few steps from the beachfront with a private beach club and the hotel is at the oceanside end of the Lincoln Road shopping street. There are plenty of restaurants and clubs within walking distance. The property feels like it is from a bit older functionalist architecture era like many buildings on South Beach. This is not a bad thing as the hotel was in top shape but room was a bit small there was very little room to walk around the bed. The bathroom was quite big with double sink setup. The gym was functional and good sized with lots of cardio equipment of the main types and a separate room for weight training. There was hardly anyone at the gym the three times I used it and I never had to wait to use the machines. There is a big pool area with a huge main pool and lots of lounge chairs. Again I could take my pick of the loungers and the servers were very quick to bring me a drink and had even closed the tab for me anticipating my needs. The service was friendly and professional throughout. The meeting rooms were a bit too cold due to a technical problem but the hotel team was very attentive and apologetic of the issue.

The service at this hotel does not in any way live up to the reputation established by the Ritz Carlton name. I have stayed in Ritz Carlton hotels on both coasts and in between. Never have I seen such lackadaisical service. Upon leaving Key West I used the highly touted mobile ap to check into the hotel. We arrived four hours later and waited in line to get to the desk to speak to one of the hotel associates. Despite having used the mobile check in function on the ap the process to actually receive a key to the room from an associate was a lengthy and tedious process. There is no separate check in location for mobile check in at this Ritz. After finally wading through the check in process the young lady at the desk informed us she would need to walk us to the room to show us how to get there. With two suitcases two carry on bags and hanging clothes we trudged across the lobby. After traversing the lobby being led by the Ritz associate we arrived at a short flight of stairs where we were forced to carry unassisted our belongings up the flight to a further walk to an elevator. We boarded the elevator and went up two floors where we carried our belongings past the spa and through a hallway of meeting rooms and guest rooms to another elevator which we boarded and descended one floor. We then exited the hallway and walked down another hallway of guestrooms before finally arriving at our room. Upon opening the door one could not help but noticed the frayed carpet in the entry portion of the room. We quickly changed clothes and headed to the beach. The beach attendant very quickly arranged our chairs and towels doing a wonderful job. We mentioned to him we would like to order food and beverage and he assured us he would send someone to take our order. 30 minutes passed and we had yet to see anyone with whom we could place an order. I finally walked back to the area where the towels were and found someone to take our snack order. We then left the beach and stopped in the downstairs restaurant for a meal. After giving our name and room number we were seated where we waited for service. The waiter finally approached our table and begrudgingly took our order not once during the entire meal did he address us by our name which I know to be something Ritz Carlton instills in their employees. After eating we asked for a glass of water. You would have thought we had asked the waiter to consume the contents of the Atlantic Ocean using a straw. As I write this I anticipate a canned reply from management copied and pasted word for word as seems to be their practice at this hotel. Even the responses from management lack the personal attention to detail Ritz Carlton has provided me and millions of other guests at the numerous locations in which I have stayed. In short it is borderline fraud for the name Ritz Carlton to be attached to this chain. It is sad that customers come to this location to stay thinking they are truly staying at a Ritz. They will be missing out on what makes the brand so well loved the wonderful service and attention to detail. Anyone who has come to trust the Ritz brand as I have will be sorely disappointed.

I had the best facial and outdoor massage ever. The massage would have been incredibly awesome inside too. Mabel is quite talented and ever so efficient. I saw they did outdoor massages on the website so I was eager to partake. After a great thorough facial I schleped in bathrobe and slippers down corridors and through the pool area to the very end close to the beach. It turns out my suite was just above but I had not checked in yet. There was disco Caribbean music surrounding us from a neighbouring property and delicious mouthwatering scents wafting through the music. Welcome to Miami. The massage was great. I totally de stressed as Mabel found places that needed attention that I was not aware. Then she topped it with a chilling yet very appreciated cool spray of a high SPF lotion and massaged it in to my warming epidermis. Elegant and naughty. Let me emphasise that this was the best massage I have ever had and if you read my other reviews I have had many. Alonso at the spa desk was quite helpful in arranging everything and the staff sent up a lovely gift to welcome me to the suite. Posh touch. ThanksA la carte breakfast at the pool both mornings was great. Sitting on the beach in the late afternoon was also lovely with bar service expensive but hey it is the Ritz and it is South Beach. I had emailed the concierge desk about renting a sailboat with Captain and they never replied so I finally called and they gave me prices upwards of 4 grand for a day. I looked on trip advisor and found a great private boat with captain for around 400. Check my reviews for that. do not miss it. I ordered a room service burger and Parmesan fries. Burger was great.

This has been my favorite birthday ever. The big 4 0. I spent my birthday at the Ritz. I was first at this property when it opened in 204. I was like 25 years old and I always said that I wanted to come back. like it literally beckoned me. I had been fantasizing about returning there since 204. There is definitely something fairy tale ish. I do not know why I have been so drawn to the property. It was like a beacon or a siren singing to me. I knew that is where I needed to be for my birthday. I planned it for over a year. From the room I would just look out the window at the ocean thinking of how much has changed since 204 in my life. and also in the hotel. When I was there in 204 there was more of a nautical feel blue stripes and royal blue cushions on the pool chairs. Now the rooms are more subdued. The designers did an excellent job to capture the essence of south beach with the light bone walls light blue accents on the tan sand ish color textured carpets. Apparently the owner curated all of the art work in the hotel. I love it. So tasteful stylish and elegant not some sort of replica of boring French impressionists or cliche anonymous photos of the beach or somethingThe Ritz is more classic luxury rather than the transitory design of the Edition or the One Hotel. Those hotels are so overly stylized. I feel like I am in an Ele Decor story from 3 years ago. I can digress. Waffle robes gorgeous and clean rooms and property. The service is impeccable. The staff seems to really enjoy their work here. The staff at the Ritz phenomenal. They seem like that they all love their jobs. They are so genuinely thoughtful and intentional without any arrogance or pretension. such amazing service. The weather was so miserable outside rained for practically our entire staybut inside the Ritz SoBe it is a perfect sunshiney day and some rainbows. The trip was flawless because of the team and elegant property. I always reach out to the hotel properties before we arrive. I just wanted to make sure to inoculate with our demands vegan ritz kids defeathering etc since we had such a horrific experience at a hotel last summer. We were miserable. I tried to analyze what my part responsibility was in that disaster. I realized that I should have called ahead and maybe some of the annoyances could have been avoided. So now I call or email with hotel properties so things are all arranged for when we get there eg Where to watch the UFC fights or dinner reservations. so when we arrive on the vacation we can just lay back and enjoy our stay and not complain etc. Well everything was perfect. The hotel exceeded every expectation with many big surprises. I am beyond a satisfied customer. From the bottom of my heart. This was such an unforgettable vacation. This will always be a highlight in our blessed lives. We are fortunate to have the privilege to even be able to stay at a place like the Ritz. We savored every second. Everyone that I interacted with from the concierge front desk restaurant spa pool beach house cleaning door people were so pleasant and cheerful. So lovely. Management did a great job at hiring and retaining staff. There is obviously some ethos there that really works. Scott Brian Juan Jose Juan Richmond have gone above and beyond to accommodate us. I am stunned. We were literally showered us with personalized custom luxuries. Couture. Bespoke. Beyond fairy tale. The experience was beyond my wildest dreams. I felt like I was Anie and I showed up to Daddy War bucks home. I mentioned that to a staff member. and then I received a copy of the DVD with a note from the manager in our room. I enjoyed watching the movie. I will cherish this memory of receiving the thoughtful gesture and then watching the film with my family while eating the amazing coconut sorbet from room service. They make the sorbet in the hotel. So delicious. One of the best things is staying in hotels with kids going to the pool ordering room service watching movies. The property is the best resort hotel in south beach for families. This trip exceeded my expectations. Our son went to Ritz Kids for the day times. The staff provided several wholesome activities and he is bringing home a bunch of arts and crafts and memories. My husband and I got to spend quality time together. The beach is gorgeous and accessible. Great chairs. Umbrella. Virgin pina coladas served right to me on the beach. Cool ice buckets for water bottles The hotel manager Scott is always around on campus. It is apparent that he has hands on ethos that is so laudable. it is no surprise that the staff reflect the same enthusiasm and philosophy. Everyone is alert approachable and intentional in their service. Such a pleasant group of people. Everyone from the housekeeping eg Milagros room service Ruben I think that is his name Consuelo the bell service Miguel and the pool beach staff the restaurants staff Nezo JP francis and the lovely hostess Brian the managerJP is the greatest I want to be friends with him the spa staff Jenifer Celia and Martha the front desk Richmond and all the staff. I can not remember the womans name from Rwanda she is the best. the store staff the woman on Monday afternoon gave my son a lion AJ the driver is like an uncle to us. The chefs and cooks anthony and Xavier particularly. In fact Anthony reached out to me before we arrived about our vegan diets. Boris we encountered him at Ritz Kids and with the cafecito hour is such a sweetheart. Everyone literally said please let us know if we can do anything for youAnd staff said please do not leave. We want you to stay. I am not sure if they really meant it but it felt heartfelt. We did not want to leave. We felt like we were leaving family. It sounds so cliche and cheesy we really felt like everyone was family Oh and Vegan Pancakes. Juan warmly greeted us when we arrived. I really enjoyed our conversation. He took time and showed us around the campus. The spa is gorgeous. Recently renovated. I do not even really like saunas. the RC sauna is so inviting. I loved it. Martha the spa attendant keeps the locker room and area so clean. she is also such a sweetie. She has been with the RC since they opened in south beach the staff longevity is amazing. The staff are very loyal to the property. For instance Kristen at the concierge has also been there since the opened. I love my girl Kristen. she is so much fun. I got the salt scrub and massage couples from Celia she was great. Very intuitive. I should have gone every day. my husband felt like his masseuse was not very good. He was very sore but not in a good sore way. Of course he did not tell me until we were checking out. On Tuesday night Noel concierge sent up balloons to the room for my birthday. How sweet. I love balloons. We called the front desk for blankets because we were cold. We received blankets and then a tray of warm cookies and tea showed up with a card. I think her name begins with an I. Well I called and she said that she sent them up because I had asked for blankets she thought that I might be cold could use some warm tea. Class act. Juan Jose the guest relations manager is incredible. he is a trouble shooter problem solver genie. he is intuitive and patient. He is responsive and responsible. He was on top of everything that we needed from Vegan food spa treatments pool ritz kids etc. he probably hates us because we were so annoying but he never showed it. Thank you Juan Jose. Juan Jose made us feel like we were the only guests there or that we were VIPs. and he had an entire orchestra of staff who made us feel the same way. Our family felt very special. We dream of returning one day. maybe we will get a windfall of cash some day and we will go back and live life to the fullest at the RC south beach. One note for renovations ditch the martini glass rugs on the mezzanine lounge And a note to travelers be extra kind to staff. I saw some difficult guests and I was horrified by their treatment to the staff. The staff have thick skins and they dealt with the guests with professional attentiveness. I was left feeling so down after witnessing the torture. The staff are wonderful and hardworking. They can not yell back at people or show that they are juggling a bunch of other things I admire their endurance. Also please leave tips even on top of the service charge. This industry lives off of tips. Carry cash around and be sure to tip the pool attendants spa attendants bell staff door people valet and beach attendants etc and enjoy every second of it.

Not sure if that happens a lot or not the way the staff acted it seemed like maybe it happens more often than not.", "offset": [593, 710], "date": "2017-08-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "0659bb53-da63-4b7a-8648-ff9eb5afd535", "sentence": "Girls Trip. The weather was not good but we still had a great time at the spa and enjoyed hanging out at the pool area and the hours that we are able to get.

The Ritz Carlton SoBe is finally reopenedI literally walked by in horror about 20 times during it \u2019s 2 12 year repair and renovation. I made certain to plan my return stay asap after reopening. Emily in guest relations made certain I had the perfect room. THANK YOU. My lanai room had a blissful pool partial ocean view on the 4th floor. Beautifully appointed with plenty of seating including three chairs and two bedside ottomans. Redecorated flawlessly with lovely white paneled walls and soft touches including area rugs in the bedding area. The lanai was refurnished with a lounge chair table and two patio chairs. The spa was also beautifully refurbished. But I did n\u2019t see another guest in there 6 days in a row. Dining was very pleasant as well. The new lobby bar is very inviting and the resort fee includes two house punch drinks per day. Great place to take in the historic lobby. Also Josh rooms controller was very helpful with club access. I just had to check out the newly remodeled club. It was very quite and the club manager was clearly one of the handful of the leadership team that came from another Ritz Carlton property. The fitness center which I used everyday was about the same. It could definitely use more equipment. One gentlemen truly stood out. Emanuel at the pool had my chair set up in my favorite spot 30 minutes before I arrived at the pool each day. This is exactly what Ritz Carlton service is about. Perfect example of anticipation of guest needs. Top talent is hard to find in Miami and especially Ritz Carlton level of service. This is something you just understand or you don\u2019t. There were a few bumps with housekeeping and inexperienced front desk staff but this is perfectly understandable as they just opened and the previous staff mostly did not return. Also the pool manager was very welcoming as he has greeted me by name for at least ten years. I have stayed here well over 100 nights and I am titanium. I felt very appreciated and recognized as a return guest. My only questionable take away is that the hotel was kind of slow especially the spa. There did n\u2019t seem to be any grand reopening spa or dining promos. I thought that was odd. This study was magical and I already have three return reservation before summer. This is my favorite Ritz Carlton in the USThank you to the gracious stafGregory S.", "offset": [2114, 2180], "date": "2020-03-13", "cpt": "2", "category": "fitness"}]}
