We just visited this piece of heaven on earth during the holidays the week of New Year and were pleasantly surprised. Words can not do justice to the experience but I will try. The room was superior in decor amenities and the best part was the ocean view and the Jacuzi. The Jacuzi was on the terrace which was perfect. Our room had rose petals from the entrance to the bed where the staff made a heart out red rose petals. This was a great detail since it was our anniversary. Thanks Valeria. The place was clean and the staff made sure our room was cleaned and kept dust free and sand free. Make sure you communicate all of your choices to your concierge as soon as you get there. This will assure you get into all the restaurants you want to visit for dinner and the concierge will help you book tours if you want as well. Our concierge Valeria Galvez was EXCELLENT. She was professional and knowledgeable. She made all our reservations to the various restaurants and we did not have to worry about anything. If you are a member of Club Melia which we are there was an opportunity to upgrade. Usually my wife and I are put off by this sale pitch and shy away from them when we travel. However Valeria was respectful and not pushy. She provided the right amount of information and backed up when we said \u201c no \u201d. Thank you for that Valeria. However because of all the information she offered we found out additional information about our membership and will be upgrading eventually. The food was INCREDIBLE and there was a great variety. We had many choices and the restaurants were great. We missed out on Vento but will go next time. This is extra but worht the money. The service was above and beyond at all the restaurants and bars. The staff was attentive but not over bearing. They were friendly and always responsive. Carlos one of the bartenders at the Avenue Bar was fantastic. They make great drinks. We had a choice as members to get the all inclusive which we did. Believe me it was the right choice you will not regret it. At the buffet there was never a line and we had many choices. If you do not make reservations for the restaurants check with them around dinner time and they may be able to get you in. If you do not have a concierge make sure to go to guest services by 9 am to make reservations. I think that works best. We did many of the tourist stuff on our own and it was very inexpensive to do. We saved hundreds of dollars. We took the camion bus which stops right in front of the hotel to Isla Mujeres and then the ferry. We spent the day there. Highly recommend this outing. It was easy to get to and safe. We did snorkeling. We went to Playa del Carmen again took the camion and the ADO bus we spent the day and it was beautiful. We went to the ciudad city Mercado 28 and felt safe. This was our way to be with the locals. We visited La Isla a huge shopping mall if you are into that with great prices. If you want to rent a car there is car rental not to far from the hotel. If you want to just do nothing you can do that as well at the hotel because you will not be bored. The property offered a number of activities free of charge. Check out the non motorize aquatic activities offered by the hotel. they are right across the street at AquaWorld.

We have just spent an excellent 12 days staying in the Paradisus in Cancun. We booked the Royal Service and it was well worth the additional costs having your own butler and access to the adults only section and pool was great.

Our butler Hervik was excellent nothing was ever too much trouble he even arranged for champagne chocolate and rose petals for a romantic evening. The pool concierge team of Alexander and Bernardo worked hard to ensure we had cabanas and chairs everyday. The hotel has plenty of restaurants which we were able to book tables most evenings but a couple more bars would be an improvement. We were all inclusive with all the drinks being premium brands and a great selection of food.

Hotel facilities The hotel decor was very nice. The lobby was clean and nice. The hotel is in the shape of a pyramid but the floor plan is circular. The restaurants are centralized. The food was okay. I ate at all the restaurants except for Tempo. My favorite place to eat was Blue Agave but was only open for dinner. Not enough sea Room Cleanines My room was clean neat. The bathroom would have an unpleasant odor from the drain underneath the sink at times. During my stay I did notice some stains on the floor tiles and the walls one of my sheets had a stain it was changed immediately. I did not like that some of the repairs were low quality such as the door handle looked like it was previously super glued and it was loose and other similar repairs. Room Comfort The room location was perfect. I had an oceanview. The wi fi was not always reliable and slow. The mini bar was stocked with Sprite Coke oreos potato chips 4 bottled waters and 4 beers Dos eqis tecate or Sol if you wanted something else a surcharge occurred. Room service was limited in options. Overall I had a good time at this hotel. The location and view were priceless. I probably will not come back I have had an Amazing experience at The Secrets The Vine Cancun. I really liked the ocean view the pools were clean I liked that there was professional nightly entertainment not enough seats were provided. I think more flexiblity with the all inclusive package.

Good nice looking resort Bad extremely cold pools nobody even uses them. some of the restaurants taste so bad it is better off skipping dinner than eating at them especially fuego. when we first arrived everyone was willing to help us make dinner reservations and extremely helpful but they had always end the conversation with asking if we had attended the timeshare presentation. Whenever I would tell them I am not interested they had immediately change their attitude. I eventually ended up saying yes to get a discount on an excursion and to receive a free four night stay proly will not be easy to get this after being promised it would take 90 minutes max. I spent three full hours refusing the timeshare to the sales Rep that could not take no for an answer. After the presentation I asked the staff to help me make a dinner reservation and all I got was someone pointing at a phone telling me to do it myself. They basically make you feel like you are here on some sort of free vacation because I am supposed to buy a timeshare. I paid 400 for this vacation and I do not owe them anything but I guess the staff were trained otherwise. The resort is nice looking and clean but if I were you I had avoid ANY melia properties.

First I should state that I have been vacationing at this place about 12 years \u2026 when it was the Grand Melia. A couple of years ago it changed its name to Paradisus. I like the property because of its awesome location and it backs up to a great beach with white sands crystal water and plenty of palapas for shade. The people at the resort have always been great but this year they were outstanding and felt I needed to tell others. I purchased the Royal Service all inclusive package and they lived up to their name. I am an early riser so every morning they provided an awesome continental breakfast spread for those in the Royal Service and if you wanted a full breakfast they also have two restaurants available La Palapa and Naos. The continental breakfast area had great WIFI so I could read my home paper online on my Ipad and enjoyed my coffee and lattes. \u2026. In the afternoon they provide a spread of fruits cheeses cake and appetizers too many to list. Full bar as well. The servers working the area were totally awesome. Valerie and Francisco and others working the continental breakfast area made sure that my coffee cup was always full and were at the ready to make sure that my needs were supplied. The servers at the pool area were awesome as well and made sure that if I needed anything they were there to supply our needs. Edier Wilberth Katrina Javier were great hosts servers and made sure that we were having a great time. We had lunch at our balinesa cabana. several days and the lunch was fantastic. A couple of times we walk to the Market Grill for lunch which was also great. If you go to the Market Grill look for Jesus. Jesus was a great host server providing great recommendations for drinks and dishes. We tried most of the restaurants on the property and we were happy with all the servers and all the meals. Our favorite restaurants were Fuego and Mole but they were all good restaurants. Sergio was our butler and he check in on us daily to make we had anything we needed and that we were happy with the service being provided. Sergio also made all of our dinner reservations and was generally very attentive to our needs. Thanks Paradisus for making our vacation GREAT. We love the place and the people.

My husband and I just recently returned from a one week stay at the Paradisus Feb 8 152015. We had the most wonderful experience at this hotel right from the moment we stepped inside the lobby. We were greeted by the very friendly and informative staff. Our flight arrived extremely early in the morning and so we were at the hotel by 7 am. The check in staff were so welcoming and helpful and we were told that we could use all of the hotel amenities and have breakfast etc. and that if they could have a couple of hours they would have a room ready early for us. We went for breakfast to the buffet and it was amazing. anything you could possibly want for breakfast is there. fresh healthy and delicious choices. We enjoyed our breakfast overlooking the pool and with a view of the beach also. Then we strolled the grounds and the inside of the hotel and went back to see if our room was ready. Just as they had promised we were given an early check in. The inside of the hotel is absolutely beautiful it smells so fresh and floral it is a tropical garden inside and so peaceful and clean. Our room was also very clean and we had our own hot tub out on our private patio. The housekeeping service is very thorough and our room was cleaned everyday as well as a turn down service at night. And because it was our anniversary and my husbands birthday the staff had some special surprises for us. There were rose petals on our bed in the shape of a heart balloons and streamers hanging some special desserts and a bottle of sparkling champagne. I must also say that the staff were very quick to come and address any problems. For example our safe was not working and my husband called down to inform them about it and within about 10 minutes someone was up to fix it for us. Anytime extra towels were needed or a different pillow they were prompt to bring what we needed and they also followed up with a courtesy phone call to make sure we got what we asked for. The beach at The Paradisus Hotel is so beautiful. Very long stretch of beach lots of chairs and excellent service. Laura and also Luis were our servers on the beach and I can not say enough good things about them. They were so friendly and they continually came around to ask if we needed anything else. they brought us waters and drinks non stop and they were so much fun. We were also by the pool a couple of times and received the same service. Also I give a shout out to the entertainment staff by the pool especially Angel who did the zumba by the pool and volleyball on the beach and to DJ Fredy. There are 9 restaurants in the hotel and they are all very good. Our favourite restaurants were the Brazilian one called Market Grill and also the Japanese one called Bano and the Latin American Fuego. Delicious food great ambiance and fast service. A very big thanks to my most favourite restaurant mangager waiter Abraham Gonzalez. he made our stay so memorable and we will never forget his kindness and attentiveness to our needs and to our special celebrations. Another thing the hotel has is entertainment every night and the shows were very fun and well done. Just can not say enough good things about the Paradisus Cancun.

A must stay. I am going to start with the only negative aspect of this hotel. If you do not book your dinner reservations at least a day in advance you will not get to eat at the many restaurants. We were able to eat at most of them after tipping to make reservations but that should not be necessary. The resort is huge and I think the only drawback is that they can not successfully handle that many people. We also had the royal service package which did not seem to help with reservations. Nonetheless throughout this process the staff could not have been more accommodating in assisting us with getting a table. The food was absolutely outstanding which is why I stress making sure you take full advantage of the restaurants. The buffet is so so. As previously mentioned we had the royal service. Outstanding room in separate quarters of the hotel. There were Procter entrances and pool beach areas. You can most definitely tell a difference in class with people who stay here. Mainly couples and people on business. It is also adults only which is wonderful. Ask your royal service concierge about the benefits you get with royal service because at check in they were too busy and were not clear. Two most important things you should know you are guaranteed cabanas for at least two days of your stay. Make sure you take advantage of those. There is also private polside breakfast for royal service and the menu is excellent. I have never been to a resort where the staff looked happy. It would be my guess that their management treats them well. They are the most accommodating nice hardworking people. Octavio by the pool was excellent. They never make you feel obligated to tip but please do. They will go the extra mile and truly deserve it.

We read many reviews before we travelled and we are very laid back normal people giving an honest review of our visit. We decided to upgrade to Royal Service based on the reviews and we are so glad we did it certainly would not have got a 4 review without itlet us start with the positives the hotel itself is amazing check in was a breeze we were whisked to Royal Service with champagne over check in and straight up to our room with luggage arriving within 10 minutes. The RS reception staff were fantastic and talked us through everything and introduced us to our butler Galdino and gave us a mobile to get hold of him. Hotel areas very clean but smell of incense sticks is overpowering and unecesary. Main reception staff nowhere near as good as RS reception when we dealt with them. The private RS pool area is amazing the only thing its lacking is a swim up bar but the efficiency of the waiting staff around the pool and the beach from La Palapa staff was faultless they could seriously not do enough especially Eddy Victor and Ricardo never seen guys work so hardFod around the pool was great too. Beach area is beautiful never had any problems getting loungers at all only negative was the vast amounts of seaweed constantly. Other hotels employ people to clear this away not sure why a hotel of this size does not do this as standard it was pretty off putting having to wade through 6 ft of the stuff pile up some days no joke. Food was hit and miss. There are many restaurants so will give a brief review of all NAOS breakfast buffet. Great selection busy but always seated immediately very much what you expect from a large multi cultural breakfast buffet 35Market Grill. All you can eat meat great food great service 55Fuego. Our favourite meal by far taste wise portions very small but was fantastic 55Vento. Great tapas idea dishes hit and miss 45La Perla. Pasta and Salad buffet starter with steak main huge portions what is not to love 55Evening BQ by pool. No reservation needed this bailed us out time and again food was amazing and so were the staff. 55Mole. Awful rude service in half empty restaurant with small overcooked awful food. Made to wait 45mins past reservation time with tables empty all over the place. Avoid. 05Rom Service Took forever to get anything even 45 mins for nachos for goodness sake. Everything that turned up was basically inedible soggy mush whether it was a club sandwich or the famous nachos it had all been left out too long and looked woeful and tasted the same. Tried on 3 occasions was the same standard every time. Use as a last resort. 15let us get on to the stafingCertain people were simply amazing yet key people let this place down. Our butler Galdino was supposed to take care of everything for us from booking bali beds at the pool to making reservations. We barely heard from him or saw him. You are guaranteed 2 Bali beds around the pool in royal service we asked every day and in some cases gave 48 hours and heard nothing. We had to resort to texting him demanding them for the last two days of our holiday after having none for 8 days despite seeing others have them four or five times because their butlers sorted for them. We had no confirmation and had to go to check on the morning that they were indeed booked. We managed to sample many different restaurants no thanks to his reservations with pretty much 10 eateries to choose from the first 4 days reservations put under our door with no consultation were Market Grill Mole Mole Market Grill then Mole again. Absolute joke clear laziness. Made friends with another couple their butler came to see them at the pool or beach every day to make sure they were ok and could not do enough for them seems like we just got unlucky. Rooms were cleaned well but robes and slippers taken after day 1 and never replaced despite repeated requests. Weird. Royal Service is 18 and over which we loved venturing to the main pool was an experience rammed and full of screaming kids this place should focus on being an adults paradise not trying to cater for families it just is not the right sort of place and confuses its message.

We were told that nothing could be guaranteed and the info would be placed in our reservation notes. We got the beds but the rooms did not adjourn. There was a room that separated us. Of course we assumed that room was booked. We find out later that a couple checked in on Sunday. That was disappointing. Not the hotels fault at all but it rained for 25 days of our trip. The rain non stop and so was the wind. The hotel had towels all over because in most areas of the hotel rain was seeping in very quickly. As you can imagine resources were used to address the rain and maintain the property. The Excellent Our butler Hervik. If you opt to stay at this property and I do recommend it just not during rainy season you must get Royal Service. Hervik was amazing and did everything he could to make our stay enjoyable. Even though it rained he put the sunshine back into our trip. Also the people who played music hosted games and kept kids and adults entertained during the rain and wind storm deserve so much credit. The Good Average The food. The food is plentiful and there is good variety. You will not go hungry and you will not be bored. I do think their is an opportunity to keep the food at a higher temperature. I also thought the salad in the Brazilian steak house was incredibly unimaginative. I \u2019m not kidding a 5 year old chef could do better. This may seem petty but when the focal point is meat and its good you want the sides to stand up to the meat not by wimpy and die. The sides are below average. However the Mexican restaurant is truly WONDERFUL. Everything all four of us ordered was mouth watering delicious and the service was beautiful. Our rooms were spacious. Jr Suite Ocean View and they were always cleaned on time and we were provided with turndown service and in Royal Service you have ulimited access to premium alchohol wonderful selections of coffees and teas and really good espresso \u2019s. We also had pillow service and the lavender on the pillow is unreal. I slept like a baby. The major kinks are trying to secure finer details with Melia and how that translates to the property staff. The food can be at times boring and unimaginative and not very hot. There was nothing BAD about my experience except the weather and that is no ones fault. Once it stopped raining we enjoyed the Bali beds we walked along the ocean and we got in the pool. This is an awesome place. Again I have to recommend the Royal Service.

Our room was exactly as last year only facing the lagoon instead of the ocean but that is what we paid for. The room itself is okay nothing special not like the Paradisus in Playa Del Carmen. The maid did a fairly decent job but never left us enough towels. Every day we had to call and request another towel. The washcloths were left periodically. The ice machines rarely had ice so we had to call for ice. Everything we needed we called to get and they did respond fairly quick. We ate at every restaurant except Mole. La Palapa. the steakhouse. the steaks are not good they are very tough and fatty. Bana we did not care for it at all but we are not real fond of Asian food anyway. Market Grill the Brazilian meat place it was a lot of meat coming at you real fast. Some cuts were better than others but they did not even bring vegetables and other sides until we had all the meats. It would have been nice if they would have brought the meat and then came with the sides then the rest of the meat. During the day we liked the Market Grill for lunch as you can order from a menu which has several different items to choose from. We had Ricardo several times as our server and were very pleased with his service. Love the shrimp skewers and the arugula salad. The taco place was fairly decent. Vento was okay. I was disappointed in Fuego this year I thought it was not so great. The buffet well it is a buffet by the end of the stay I really did not care to go in there any longer especially for breakfast. We did order room service for breakfast a few times it was not bad. They also have a place near the pool that serves some hamburgers hot dogs wings sandwiches and salads. It was alright but you have all the guests getting out of the pool no hand washing and touching the utensils etc. That stuff bothers me probably why I do not like the buffet. The main pool has the pool bar and of course by mid afternoon it is packed with people that are there for hours never leaving. The pool got very warm toward the end of the day. Plus people were getting food and getting in the pool to eat I am not sure why one would do this. it is pretty gross. We had a hard time getting service at the pool bar the few times we went over there. We are good tippers so it was kind of discouraging as they seemed to ignore us. The beach is very nice even though we were there with the seaweed it was still nice. There were a few days we were able to get in the ocean as the seaweed seemed to have cleared out for a bit. The service at the beach was not as great as last year. After a few days we did seem to build a relationship with Laticia and she ended up taking care of us. the better we tipped the better the serviceCocos Bar we went to several nights mainly to get a drink to take down to the beach where we waited for the sea turtles to come in and lay eggs. Again we felt a little ignored by a few of the bar tenders down here. Toward the end of the trip though it did improve. The Avenue Bar is okay for an evening drink but nothing for the kids here. They do have the show but we were there for 9 nights and could never begin to see the show at all. The night club we went in got a drink and left. They have a fog machine going I guess were too old for that. Entertainment in the evenings is not great. it is very hard for kids in the evening as they really have nothing to offer unles you upgrade which we did not. We asked to use the pool table and nobody was in the family concierge where it is located and of course we could not use it. There is no ping pong tables no games nothing for the kids at night. This is a huge reason why we will not return.", "offset": [1835, 1937], "date": "2015-07-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "59051933-f502-4713-9b8c-839a383adea7", "sentence": "Outstanding in nearly every way. A perfect vacation. This was our third and best Paridisus. When searching a vacation for our family we poured over Trip Advisor Oyster Expedia you name it because we wanted this vacation to be spectacular. After hours of exhausting research we chose Paradisus Cancun and seems our system paid off. Someone at a very high level there gets it and does things right. This will be long but is also the type of review I was looking for when making our decision. Hope it helps youARIVAL CHECK IN. The transfers by Otium arranged for free when booking went very smoothly for all travelers in our group of 6 some who arrived departed different days and different flights. Our plane was 90 minutes late but other than that so far so good. I was a little disappointed not to receive a refreshing welcome drink upon arrival. Though when we were clearly searching for this someone actually took a drink order for us and brought us what we wanted. The check in lobby was cool and fragrant though not annoyingly so but just right. Ironically our first encounter at Paradisus was not a good one. We had requested long in advance. two rooms near each other same floor same building each room for three people. One room was perfect and the type of suites we are used to at Paradisus. The second was a regular king room. No suite part no place for the third person. We went down to the lobby and were offered two doubles offered different buildings different floors none of which is what we wanted for our 7 days. Not giving up a room was to open the next night king suite same floor and same building as the other room. We would have to switch rooms after one night. It was not the end of the world and for us the preferable option and they threw in an ocean view. What could have really started the vacation off on the wrong foot ended up proving to be foreshadow of the superior level of service we would find throughout the trip. Never relenting the staff at check in led by Alberto persevered until we were happy. On Day 2 we were told to check back frequently as soon as the other guests left they would rush the cleaning of the new room so we could move as early as possible. There was no default come back at 3 they actually worked with us to accommodate our preference. Sure enough we were in the new room before 12 and they helped us move. ROOMS. The girls had a lagoon view and we had been given ocean view all on the 4th floor in building 4. I do not think you can go wrong in any buildings but we liked 4 as it was the other side of the small kids area and still close to the main building 3. Everything was convenient yet quiet. The bed was comfortable as were the pillows. No complaints and slept well. Shower has the option of overhead rain or handheld. No Jacuzi as in some other Paradisus. We did not miss it. Bathroom a good size and separate private toilet area with bidet. The A C worked great and was not intrusively noisy. I am a light sleeper and found it to be a lulling white noise. We had a nice balcony as did the kids and both rooms had nice views. No complaints about Lagoon view rooms. For the first time of any stay the mini bar was actually fully restocked every day. Room cleaned twice a day and very well. Could it use an update sure. However we found enough outlets and it was so well cleaned and appointed we were very comfortable. The TV does not get loud for the one hour I watched before falling asleep. My guess is so maybe others will not hear it as I have heard neighboring rooms tvs in other places. I was happy for it. Bathrobes and slippers were there to use and plenty of amenities. Very content with every aspect of the rooms. As others have said the wifi is hit and miss. But we did not come to Cancun to be plugged in so for our needs ocasionaly check of email or facebok I guess it was suficientbut texting and games and Pandora did not work. RESTAURANTS. POOL. ENTERAINMENTYou have to reserve restaurants a day in advance so the first night we hit the buffet. It was hit and miss. Some things were very tasty and others not so much. However there was enough variety and enough hits to keep us all happy. Again. the service was gracious and efficient. We plotted our restaurants for the next 6 days La Perla Bana Fuego one night out Senor Frogs Vento and Mole. We had no issues getting the reservation we wanted for the six of us though I recommend calling before noon once called at 230 and had to take 630 instead of our usual 7 pm. We are early risers so we had no issues getting chairs by the pool. It is pretty much were I became anchored for the week. Kids 262521 and 17 but still kids to us volleyed between pool beach and grill. Once again outstanding service. I never felt so inclined to tip not because it seemed that was the only way to get good service but because it was NOT the only way to get good service. Sergio and Luis were our polside servers who checked on us frequently and always made sure we had a bucket of ice cold water. So yes I chose to reward that and I felt like it was my choice not obligation which made it more enjoyable. The pool water was not very cold but refreshing when it got too hot. The staff d an excellent job of cleaning up there were NO BUGS. No bees by the garbage bins. We bought bug spray did not use it except the kids kept the balcony door open one night which was not too bright. We did not reserve the cabanas for 50 though many did. With 6 of us one would not be enough anyway and the umbrellas by the chairs gave us enough shade. Had we not been early risers I doubt we would have gotten 6 chairs next to each other. I think you can always get a chair and I saw staff pulling them out of somewhere and placing them on the grass or other places. so you can just ask if you need help. Every one of us enjoyed La Perla immensely. My husband is a vegan and I had the feeling Luis our server would have traveled the strip to make sure my husband received the broccoli he hoped forand was so happy to have. We felt like royalty and the food was really delicious though one daughter did not love her flank steak. Thing is it is very easy and possible to get something else if you are not happy. I have to say ALL the restaurants were a stark contrast to ALL the ones at Paradisus Playa Del Carmen where the service was almost non existent the wait for food unreal. I never even received a meal once and the quality so so. We even said this time we better go when we are not that hungry yet because last trip it took over an hour to get served. Not so here. We capped off the night at Avenue bar where Carlos Francisco and Ernesto will be your best friends for your trip. Ariba Abajo. and you can find out the rest when you get there. The drinks are not watered down you can get Belvedere and Bombay Sapphire and you will have fun if that is what you came there to do. When Avenue closed we went to club that is open to 2 and danced. Each morning we got up very early first to work out in the gym. There seemed to be enough equipment since it was not too crowded but definitely some in disrepair. Yet it was sufficient to get an elliptical workout and feel a little less guilty about what lied ahead. My husband went to swim in the pool before it opened officially and had no issues. He likes to lap swim when not crowded so a 7 am swim worked great. At 10 am I discovered Zumba and the Experience Entertainment team Hugo Uzie Angel and Fredie. I ve never done Zumba. Is is always this fun. I never missed a 10 am Zumba the rest of the trip. At 120 we also did the water aerobics. Again great fun and a decent workout believe it or not. did i overdo the exercise. I do not think so as i ate and drank to my hearts content and did not put on any weightWe also really enjoyed all the activities around the pool and our family won the song challenge. Having grown up kids this was our first vacation all together in 12 years and it was amazing. They also loved the paintball competition and gave a good run. The grill was hit and miss. In Punta Cana the burgers were inedible. In Playa del Carmen they were delicious. Here they were in the middle. So we skipped the burgers though my husband appreciated the veggie burgers and we went with the delicious chicken wrap and decent pizza. We really enjoyed Bana with Daniel and Jose. We are big sushi lovers and were impressed with the service and food. After not really loving Vento so much we came back here later in the night to see if they could serve us. Angela the hostess was not too happy about it and said no one of the rare rebuffs in service but the manager said come back in 30 minutes and accommodated us. He did not have to but he did and it made us all really happy. We went one night into town to Senor Frogs. It is an easy bus ride with the stop across from the hotel. The concierge was very helpful in telling us how to do it and making reservations for us. We had a blast. At Fuego the food was again delicious and everyone was very happy with their filet steaks. There is an opportunity to pay for different cuts but we chose the filet on the menu and did not regret it. As with the other restaurants the chefs were very accommodating to my husbands vegan diet and concocted something special for him. Vento is tapas and we found them to be hit and miss and our server who was clearly trying seemed a bit inexperienced. We had been so spoiled by the outstanding service thus far it was a little bit of a let down and while not terrible jsut paled in comparison to the bar that had been set. We ended up in the buffet and Bana afterwards. Mole was once again great service with Angel. He had the chef come to speak to my husband about how the refried beans are prepared no lard. and it was so nice on both their parts to do that. Once again one daughter tried the flank steak Fuego gave us hope and once again this was a miss. Angel was concerned and offered to get her anything else. She filled up on so many yummy appetizers that she really did not need another dish plus there is always desert yum. YHI SPAWe booked massages using a coupon we got when booking online. The spa is in terrible disrepair. One shower did not work we could not remove our keys from the lockers. not all the jets in the giant jacuzi pool worked. Of the four girls getting massages three said they were outstanding or best they have had. I was the fourth with the disappointing massage. She never asked how the pressure was and after telling her my real sore areas she never focused on either. What was the point of asking. I could have asked to go deeper but I kept thinking she would work up to it from the light swedish strokes. did not happen. The other girls said their therapists asked and exchanged information to give them what they had hoped for. The use of the spa facilities came with the massages. If I had paid for those separately I would have been disappointed. The steam rooms was pretty good but the sauna not hot probably because of the broken door. BEACH. I was always at the pool usually swimming to and from the swim up bar which was busy and lively but you did not have to wait too long to be served. The kids and husband would also go to beach and they really liked it. No problem getting chairs. Water a little choppy and yes there is seaweed. I checked out zillions of hotels in Cancun on the strip where we wanted to go so it was not unique to this hotel. Just is. At night we did sometimes go into a cabana on the beach or by the pool and hang out and play a game Heads up on our phones and it was really nice and fun. I went to the Red Lounge a couple nights for the late night dancing though usually I was pretty worn out by then. I am pretty sure the kids were there more often. There were nightly shows at Avenue they got crowded. Some better than others. It was a nice change of pace though we did not go to all of them. DEPARTUREWe had complicated reservations because some kids arrived left on different days. The staff was very much aware and made sure there were not issues with the kids room continuity and getting check out tickets for those that were leaving. There were no issues or surprises with the bill and OTIUM was there on time to take us back to the quick ride to the airport. I have given many reviews on Trip Advisor and this was my first five. Was it perfect in every way. No. But it was SO GOOD in SO MANY ways and just what were were looking for. Every staff regardless of position were so friendly and helpful and pleasant. There have always been the grumpy the chips on the shoulder the desperate for tips. I did not see that here. I saw bartenders notice little kids who do not tip as much as adults. I appreciated that. The hospitality all around was genuine and impressive. we have never been to the same place twice but I definitely definitely go back to this one if given the chance.", "offset": [7214, 7296], "date": "2015-08-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "49139eb7-e9ff-4fe0-8161-65331046cd49", "sentence": "Beautiful hotel. We stayed here for 2 weeks in August. The place is amazing with direct access to the beach and opposite aqua land on the lagoon. Right outside is s bus stop with regular buses into cancun centre for aprox 1. The room we had overlooked the lagoon and although nice could have been bigger with more storage space for clothes. As a family of four we felt a little disappointed but by no means did it spoil our holiday. The restaurants in the hotel cater for all tastes and appetites. From buffet self service to a Michelin style restaurant. The staff were wonderful and could not do enough for you. You will not go hungry in this hotel. The pools were nice but I do think one of the major let downs is the fact they are all deep with none less than 5 ft 4 except the infants pool. For non confident swimmers this was a disappointment. The pool side staff are excellent and keep you hydrated. The dj at cocos bar throughout the day is fantastic and plays chilled house music you can listen to on the beach. We never struggled for a sun bed on the beach but we were up early to reserve one by the pool. You can pay a small fee to reserve a cabana which are very comfortable. The sea was covered in seaweed but we expected this and were told it is natures way of cleaning the ocean. It prevented us from really going in the sea but again did not spoil our holiday. The mini bar is stocked daily and includes beer water and soft drinks. You also get a packet of crisps and Oreos daily. There are plenty of daily activities from yoga to fun pool side stuff. Night time entertainment was difficult to view as it was situated in a small area of a bar which did not make great viewing. For this reason we opted out. Our room was in the main pyramid and we could hear the noise from the entertainment at nights. If you are a light sleeper I would avoid pyramid number 3.

The room was very large with a very large deck. We were truly treated like royalty with a Nespreso machine in the room bottles of hard liquor beer soft drinks etc. Our butler which is included with Royal Service was Juan who was just the best. He was always there for anything we needed and always offered his services to us. We could not have asked for a better butler. The service within the hotel and especially in the Royal Service area was impeccable. The workers within the Royal Service area were so nice and extremely courteous. The waiters brought us anything we asked for and very quickly. They were fun to talk to and brought us fun drinks and shots occasionally. Edie Victor and Cesar were great to us. The Royal Service pool and portion of the beach was where we mainly spent our time. The pool was great with bali beds which were great for eating and drinking. The food was delicious with many options but we went back to a few favorites because it was so good. One extra restaurant was included with Royal Service which was one of our favorites.

I can not say enough great things about our servers Jesus Sofonia and Armando. They made sure we had everything we needed. We reserved a cabana each day which was a great way for the kids to take a break if needed. The entertainment staff was awesome.

He was wonderful and after the first day always had coffee and mimosas ready for us. He was always cheerful and happy to help in any way. Since we were only there for 4 days we just lounged by the pool everyday. We splurged and rented a Bahli bed by the pool everyday. It was totally worth it. The service you get is next to none. We had excellent people helping us there Jesus Victor Jorge and Sofina. These guys worked SO hard to ensure you had the best day possible at the pool. We were never thirsty or hungry and they never let the ice melt in the bucket. Thank you to all of you guys for all the hard work and attention you gave us. I strongly encourage everyone to rent a Bahli bed one day during your visit you will not regret it. The pool and ocean were just steps away from us. Please remember to tip the people that work so hard at the resort to ensure you have a good time. The service we were given by everyone was extremely impressive.

If you are going for your first time to an all inclusive resort then this hotel will probably knock your socks off. If you are a more experienced traveler then you might want to know some of the short comings. First and foremost or my husband will kill me is the lack of good AC in the common area restaurants. I was okay mostly while my hubby continuously had to ask staff to point a fan in his direction. Nice thing is that all the restaurants allows shorts to be worn. While I am on the topic of the restaurants not all of them are open every day. So while you may think when you get there that your choices are limitless that really is not the case. We upgraded to Royal Service I will explain more later. so reservations was not an issue for us. The food was for us Vegans was best at Mole and believe it or not the Market Grill steak restaurant if you do not mind slabs of meat being brought to your table since we were vacationing with carnivores. The food at Mole was just yummy yummy and Market Grill had a lot of grilled veggies to choose from. In general though our special meal restrictions as they referred to them were often lost in translation between the server and the kitchen. The server would repeat exactly what we wanted but then would come out with something else. This happened several times at different restaurants on the property. Also the coffee and gelato bars were RARELY open. None of us could figure out the hours or days and the coffee bar was really bad. No blender or any specialty drinks really. No almond milk or other choices basically if you could find it open you could get the same cup of coffee you could get in the buffet. The design of the hotel itself was also lacking function. It was difficult to get places not all floors connect to other wings and to go to the pool we would first have to pass by it then go down a floor and then we could go back in the direction of it. The rooms in Pyramid 4 were nice but kind of standard Pyramid 1 was old and dingy. The step up into the bathtub shower combination was a dozie and we are both tall. I can not imagine how difficult it would have been for my mother. And the housekeeping service would not take dishes away from your room that was for a different staff member I guess. And the smoke detector over the bed was like Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Blinking a secret message to you while you try to sleep. The upgrade to Royal Service was worth every penny. We wanted a more Adults Only experience and got this with the upgrade. Plus our butler Mari Maria was the best thing about our trip. She was on top of everything and a real pleasant person. But even the Royal treatment lacked in areas. In the Royal Service section on the beach they would let beach vendors come and take a siesta right there under a palapa. Some smoked weed there and 2 got in a full on fists out fight over a potential customer. While I realize these folks have a hard job walking the beach all day it did not feel very royal having them share your restricted area. And while I am on the subject of vendors they even have an onsite tour company polside. So every time you walk by that area which is hard to avoid. you get the same unwanted attention you would walking down the street or in a shopping mall except you are in the supposed safe space of your hotel. HEY AMIGOS WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TODAYAnother not so Royal thing that happened at the Adults Royal Service pool is that they let one of the guests play music loud on his speakers. There was already resort music playing. While the guest is just as much at fault for this any one of the staff could have asked him nicely to use headphones. We had also called a week before we arrived for restaurant and spa reservations. We were given the restaurant reservation for the first night since we arrived on my birthday. The spa they told us no need for reservations and confirmed they had both male and female massage therapist. However there were no male therapists when we got there.

My first trip to Cancun from Los Angeles and traveled with a friend everything was amazing relaxing and the best service. From beginning to end the service was 5 stars. We had a lagoon view room with a balcony which was great the pool overlooking ocean is a perfect hang out spot loved the Market Grill Brazilian steakhouse restaurant and the Tapas Restaurant as well. The pool grill by the pool was just okay as well as the Enso Asian cuisine. The resort itself is large and beautiful people are hard working and smile all the time. Such polite workers here. The pictures of the resort beach are misleading it \u2019s pretty but not clear water it \u2019s full of seaweed which means no swimming here. It does n\u2019t matter though since the ocean is across the street and book excursions through Aqua World. Do the Jungle tour for a fun speed boat that takes you out to snorkel in clear water and we saw so many fish. We also took jet skis on the water which was so much fun and absolutely loved the the day trip to Isla Mujeres we snorkeled in the ocean and loved the taco lunch on the island. We loved every part of the visit thank you. Ca n\u2019t wait to try the Paradisus coming to Costa Rica.", "offset": [404, 479], "date": "2018-08-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "ac0057e4-7b9d-4336-92d2-a58fced4d0b2", "sentence": "Great place for families. We just returned from Cancun and we were very happy with the Paradisus for our family 2 kids 7 and 4. We booked the Deluxe Ocean View Suite with Family Concierge service. Hotel Close to airport in hotel district. Beautiful inside with a dramatic center atrium that goes from floor to ceiling with hanging vines and tons of natural light. It \u2019s a bit of a maze 4 connected buildings and has many sets of stairs there are also elevators but still lots of walking. Room. We requested a quiet room and were assigned Tower 4 above the spa. We were on the main floor which I normally do not like but were set back from central areas. Never heard any noise. From 830 930 you could occasionally hear the shows if they were out by the main pool but even then not loudly. We had a Deluxe Ocean View Room with Family Concierge Service. It had a large bedroom and living room with pull out couch. No door on either bedroom just a doorway so we could n\u2019t see the kids but did n\u2019t have full privacy. Each room had its own bathroom. We also had a large balcony with ocean view. Room was clean and in nice condition. Food it is an all inclusive and we were with kids so we did not need anything too fancy. We tried all the restaurants that required reservations and they were mostly good. The Japanese restaurant was probably my favorite. It \u2019s located at the base of that beautiful atrium I described earlier and has a koi pond set into the floor. Food was good sashimi was buttery and fresh and delicious and they even had gluten free soy sauce. All restaurants were accommodating of my food restrictions and I did not get sick the entire time I was there including at the buffet which can sometimes be like Russian roulette. Meats were excellent in all restaurants everything else was either fine or good. No restaurant I would n\u2019t recommend although I thought the Tapas place was only so so. Polside grill was the place to be if you did not want to leave the pool. We picked chairs that were right in front of it hubby went down by 7 am with towels \u2013 a must which made it a snap to grab food. Has burgers pizza chicken wings hot dogs guac chips some sandwiches etc. The pool waiters are great and work really hard. We found a guy we liked named Sofonia and he took really good care of us I \u2019m sure our small tip did n\u2019t hurt but he was genuinely nice and always in motion to make sure we had whatever we wantedKids Club. Separated by age. We were disappointed the kids could n\u2019t be together but makes sense based on the activities. My daughter 7 loved it. Among things she did Pirate scavenger hunt foam party tile painting dream catcher cupcake decorating pool activities etc. My son 4 was in the \u201c Baby club \u201d for ages 1 4. They did not leave the room unlike kid \u2019s club who went around the resort and every time we went there were hardly any kids there so we only used it for breaks for us like when we got massages. One warning note for kids club If you have concierge service put down the names of your butlers when it asks where you will be if they need you. Otherwise they just call your room or try to find you at the very busy pool etc. The first day our daughter got a little nervous and asked for us and they were unable to locate us which I found very upsetting because I had even provided my phone number and let them know I had whatsap the preferred coms for the butlers. We talked it out though after and they were very apologetic and we had no problems the rest of the time. Violeta and Nicole at kids club were lovely and very helpful. Pool. Pools were great. We were there during spring break so it was competitive for chairs. My husband went down every day by 7 to ensure we got seats where we wanted by the polside grill and close to a bathroom and kids club. They have large straw umbrella over a lot of the recliners which provided a ton of shade. You can rent palapas by the pool for 150 a day includes a lobster and moet. You can get 1 day free with the family concierge but it \u2019s by the baby pool which my daughter did n\u2019t like because it was too shallow and we needed to have eyes on her at the big pool. Spa. Gorgeous great massages awesome giant jet pool thing and a kid \u2019s spa room where my daughter got her hair braided. Sonia the spa concierge hooked us up with great prices and was so sweet to talk to we \u2019d end up chatting when we saw her around the pool. Family Concierge. Worth it if you can afford \u2013 separate check in area with stuff for the kids to do and eat while waiting backpacks for the kids filled with beach and pool toys kid sized bathrobes toys left almost every day for them on the beds cookies every night bath products for kids and the use of the concierge butlers for dinner reservations and anything else you could think of. Violeta and Jose were terrific. Excursions. We signed up at the resort to go play with Dolphins at Dolphinaris. Could n\u2019t do the swimming package because my son was too young but playing with them was awesome. Negotiate with the photographers for prints because they will try and charge you a million dollars. The place is attached to a little water park but I had read mixed reviews so we just went for the Dolphins. Having never done it before I thought it was really fun the pictures came out awesome and the trainer was clearly incredibly passionate about dolphin conservationism and taught us a lot. The only true negative at Paradisus was our checkout experience with Samuel. I never once dealt with anyone the entire trip who was anything less than lovely until him. When he showed me the incidentals from the spa the charges were broken out weirdly and in pesos and looked like we had paid for an extra massage. He seemed incredibly annoyed that I was asking questions and then told me I had to go to the spa to figure it out would n\u2019t even call them. Meanwhile my car was waiting to take me to the airport. When I returned after straightening it out I told him that I had n\u2019t appreciated the way he treated me and that it was so counter to every experience I had on the trip. Even if he thought I was being difficult or rude which I am pretty sure I was n\u2019t he \u2019s in a service industry and he should have at least apologized at that point but instead chose to be rude again and defensive. Not what I expected at the tail end of my trip. But overall big thumbs up for Paradisus. Even during peak season did n\u2019t feel crowded other than pool chairs and lots to do for kids and adults.", "offset": [2180, 2228], "date": "2019-04-21", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}]}
