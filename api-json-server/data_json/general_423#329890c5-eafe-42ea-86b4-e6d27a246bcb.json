Breakfast was good but a bit pricey. Rooms were priced about right for the area and such proximity to the beach. This hotel has long outlived it is usefulness.

The gentleman at the front desk was VERY prepared to tell me NO. To blow off steam I decided to go for a swim. Finished a couple laps in the 4 foot pool very old building and when I took a break I noticed a homeless person sleeping on the bench in the corner. Now my safety was an issue. The elevator took FOREVER to get there meanwhile I am hoping the homeless person just needs a place to sleep and hopefully is not dangerous. Called the reservation hotline who called the front desk. Bradley still said NO lied to the reservation guy telling him the elevator WAS broken but is now fixed. Gave me breakfast coupons thanks Bradley but would not budge on the rate.

We arrived late at night due to a late flight and the only person we were greeted by was a very obviously high security guard who had no idea what was going on. We had to wait a solid 20 minutes before a front desk attendant arrived in order to check us in. One of the reasons we decided to stay at this hotel was because of the highly advertised roof top pool they boasted on having. Upon check. in we learned that the pool was actually not in service and was currently undergoing construction. This was not mentioned at all on their website or told to us prior to us booking our stay. It only gets better from here on out. We arrived at our room which in their defense was a pretty nice set up except for the fact that the windows would not fully close lock and had no screen on the ground level. The next day we were gone all day at the beach shopping etc. When we got back we found our room had been left opened with the door propped open for who knows how long. Anyone could have gone in and taken any of our belongings. This to me is fully unacceptable when you are paying for a secure room that will not be left open to anyone. When we tried to bring these issues to attention during our stay the staff there really did not seem to care. I am usually not one to leave bad reviews or get this annoyed with a company so I decided to reach out via email to the main corporate office once we got back from our trip before leaving any bad review on any platform. The final straw for me was that except for a brief email saying that the hotel will get back to me within 5 business days no one cared to contact me at all and I waited much longer than 5 business days.

I asked why was it not on their website and he stated that it was and it WAS NOT. The policy is you secure the room with a credit card and you can either use that credit card or another card or pay cash. Their position is if you cancel they already have the 1 night deposit which if I cancel you would get anyway AFTER the check in date has past. 2nd I do an mobile check in for an early check in and get to the hotel at 1 pm and no rooms available.

Was nt really an issue since it I was going to grab lunch so luckily my sister had checked in the night before and had her room because if I wanted to leave my luggage with the Bell Hop or front desk all the luggage was sitting by the front desk and not secured by any means. It was nt like the front desk always had someone there watching the guests bags. So after 4 hrs of waiting I had to call and see if the room was ready and their excuse was they forgot to call me and let me know it was ready3rd I finally get to the room which was a 1 berm suite and the room was nice but the 1st thing I saw that pissed me off and grossed me out all at the same time was the couch had massive stains on them. Not 1 not 2 MANY so needless to say we never sat on that couch because could not take the chance of the suspicious fluids on it. Continue to the bedroom and it was nice but again noticed that the bed sheets was on backwards so that tells me that housekeeping is not doing their job and the supervisors are not checking inspecting the rooms. Even after they cleaned the room they never took the ironing board down hung the iron up emptied the garbage. I asked Patrice at the front desk could she call and find out why and she called housekeeping and their response was they do nt touch anything in the room because that is Luis and Robert policy. Patrice was the only bright spot other than having a pool on the roof. She was very attentive and after the 1st encounter with her she knew my name on sight and always greeted us with a smile. This hotel needs more Patrices. 4th the hotel is in a nice location but it is right next door to a club which goes to 5 am and if you staying in the front do nt think about getting any sleep until the club let out and everyone leaves. Walking through the lobby you thought you were in the club. Literally had the walls knocking in the loby5th while sitting outside on their little patio front entrances I run upstairs to plug my phone up and a homeless guy decides he going to take a seat on the patio where my wife and sister sitting so they felt uncomfortable and called me back downstairs so I say something to Leo which I do nt know if he a manager supervisor front desk or what but he did nt want to go out there and tell the homeless guy he could not sit there because it was for guests only. 6th and lastly I go to check out and that brings me back to my 1st issue. I tell them I was paying cash and they bill me for the 2nd night and I say I am paying cash for the entire stay and they say they ca nt charge my card back because I do nt have the physical card with me. So Leo again says to me I can pay cash for the stay and he will tell the general manager Robert Burton to charge my card back like I am going to pay cash for the room fly home and wait til they decide to if they even do charge my card back. Needless to say this hotel has some bad business practices. So being conflicted I gave them 3 stars because of the location and pool. Other than that I would have given this hotel a 2 star rating. Also I would have never realized this hotel was a Category 5 which I was shocked because I can only see them being a Cat 3 max.", "offset": [2663, 2722], "date": "2019-08-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "bcc16654-de3f-4005-8173-c7489ef4d0a4", "sentence": "Run by morons. it is hard to imagine a more badly run hotel property.
