We have stayed at the Flamingo 45 times and have always enjoyed our stay. We check in the VIP section and the folks there are always tops. This trip we had a friend traveling with us and they put us up in a 2 bedroom suite with a floor to ceiling window view of the Linq. There were 6 TVs in the room including one in each of the bathroom mirrors so if you were watching a game you would not miss a minute. The room was very clean with a 60s70s vibe to it. The hotel is located right on the strip across the street from Caesars and the Forum shops as well as the new Linq area. The Casino is not huge and if you have ever been to the Indian Casinos in Connecticut you would call it small. But there is a good mix of slots as well as table games with a small sports book. Plenty of poker machines scattered about. Just do not play them at the bar as the pay out schedule is awful. Beverage service was spotty at best. Depending on what area you were playing you could have a drink as soon as when you had a third left in your glass or you could go a half hour before you would see someone again. We would sit near the food court at night and there was a waitress with tattoos on her arms that was great. She was always around and quick to return with your beverage. Make sure you give them a couple of bucks per round and you will always be refreshed. If I had to come up with a negative about the Flamingo there would be two things1. The people haunting you to buy time shares. Every time you walk by them How long are you in town. Do you want to see a show for free. it is not free. My time on vacation in Vegas is valuable to me and you would think the casino would want me to spend my free time in the casino and not sitting in a room listening to some sales pitch for a time share that is going to cost me far more than paying for a room when I vacation. If you gamble any length of time the casino will most likely comp. your room. I have not paid for a room in Las Vegas since 1962. The elevators in the hotel could use an overhaul.

We arrived at the hotel around 1 am. The room they gave me when we walked in was 67 degrees when we walked in. We soon discovered that the heater did not work. I called downstairs to have a blanket and refrig. brought up. Rm 14040 I think. We turned on the shower on hot to try to steam up the room to make it warmer.

In the morning 945 am I went to the Diamond check in where I again had a hassle trying to get a room of the size I booked. They wanted me to move back to the original tower and I flat refused. The Exec host said she would put me in the same tower I was currently in but that the room was n\u2019t ready yet and she would call me but it would only be held until 4 pm. I was clear at the other end of Vegas and busted my ass to get back by 4 and since she NEVER called I figured I \u2019d better be there. When I arrived I found out that the room was still not ready. After 30 minutes of them trying to find me a room they finally said that they had one I The same tower rm 15170. I told them they were nuts. Mind you I am handicapped and there was no way I was going to walk all these hallways to the end to get my stuff then move to the end of another hallway. 30 minutes later they said rm 6151 was ready. By now I was completely upset. Now it is Saturday 60 by the time I get moved into a new room. Who the hell feels like gambling or having a good time after all this. I cancelled Sunday because now I was in no mood to be socialable. Then to top it all off that night I kicked the bottom rail of the couch and broke my toe.
