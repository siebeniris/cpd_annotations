First of all let me state that the customer service was great but unfortunatly this is all the greatness. The air was very stale and could use upgrading. I doubt the hotel has any preventative maintenance cleaning the ducts or replacing air filters at regular intervals. Because we booked through Expedia there were no upgrades available we got the room for 265 CDN or something and the AC was not great we were placed in a 3rd floor room with a view of the parking garage. Would have preferred a view of the cruise port but was not an option because we booked through Expedia. Our post cruise Hotel Sheraton Miami Airport was almost 100 CDN cheaper and quality is much better AC is great undated furnishings close to car rentals. Customer service is the only thing this location has going for it the staff are great. No complaints there.
