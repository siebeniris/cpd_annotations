Having stayed at other Mr Mrs Smith hotels I had fairly high expectations which the hotel came nowhere close to achieving. I am at a complete loss as to how many people have given this hotel such a high ratingThe main aim of my holiday was to enjoy the sun and pool however that turned out impossible. The pool temperature is ridiculously cold so much so that it is always empty people have a quick dip then need to get out before hypothermia sets in. Even the children were complaining that it was too cold and not staying in the pool. The indoor pool is at a slightly warmer temp and only around the corner from the outdoor pool so I figured I \u2019d just go cool down in there instead but you can only use it up to 1 pm after that you need to book it. Why. And only one 30min slot per romThe pool bar does n\u2019t open till 12 pm even though people start arriving around 9 am so nowhere to get a drink. I ended up going to the cafe across the road soft drinks were icy cold and just over a euro. There is nowhere near enough capacity around the pool for the size of the hotel. On many of the days I was there the mattresses were not laid out on the sun loungers until gone 10 so you have to go get them yourself and carry them over. The pool towels are at reception which is not close to the pool so every time you want to change the towels you have to go all the way to reception to do this. WhyThe WIFI only seems to be good in the rooms and in the main restaurant it is was non existent around the pool and breakfast area. That brings me onto breakfast I \u2019ve seen a few reviews raving about breakfast \u2026. There are 5 hot dishes some cold meats pastries and bread and its exactly the same options every day no variation what so ever. No wait one day they changed the apple juice to peach juice Oh the excitementWe got a sea view room and it was worth it the views over the pool and bay are wonderful. However we booked a double room but they gave two twins pushed together when I asked about this at reception they arranged for a cover to hold the beds together this resolved the issue but why not do this in the first place. I did book a double after all. The TV is tiny and there are only 2 English channels one is BC news. There is no vanity mirror in the bathroom and the main lights are fairly dim so ladies good luck trying to do your make up. But my biggest gripe with the room is that there are no tea and coffee making facilities even the most basic of basic hotels have this. And apart from the breakfast area there is nowhere to get a coffee until around 11 am if you ask for one in the bar coffee area they just tell you the machine is n\u2019t switched on \u2026. This brings me on to the waiting staff where to begin. Totally not interested in providing a service at breakfast they just ask for your room number. no good morning no seeing you to a table. in the evening NO chance of getting a drink on the balcony. We ate dinner in the hotel one night and again it took ages to get the menus and then a good 15mins before they came to take the order. Then the drinks took almost as long as the food. Just do n\u2019t bother head to any of the restaurants nearby good service with lots of local dishes and lovely fresh fish not to mention good service. I could go on ashtrays not emptied hand towels in the pool toilets empty for days \u2026. If you \u2019re after a holiday by the pool this is not the place to come. I certainly wo n\u2019t be returning.", "offset": [1247, 1406], "date": "2015-06-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f05ca330-4c3f-486d-83c0-3d7a1d0c8180", "sentence": "Great place. We stayed in the hotel for a week at the start of June. The location of the hotel can not be better standing on the main street just above the beach overlooking the fishing harbour. The view was breathtaking give it a go with a glass of Porto that just takes it to a new level. Now on the hotel. The interior is chic and minimalistic. Very clean. The WiFi reception could be better I could connect from our room but I kept losing the connection. The inside pool is way too small for swimming actually it is way too small for anything. The outside pool is big enough so one can enjoy a good swimming session. I went for a 45 60 minute swimming session every morning around 7 am. I would never call thewater warm but I would not call it cold either. The room we were staying in was on level 2. It was kept very clean and was quite comfortable. We did experience a very disturbing issue with the safety box. Out of theblue it stopped accepting the PIN that I had set which meant that we had to wait 30 minutes so the someone from the staff could reset it. No bigie in our case because it happened mid week. Had it happened just before we left it would have been a huge problem for us. Fortunately the staff were all young smiling people very friendly and helpful. At least this is the impression that we got from the few encounters with them. We prefer to spend as much time as possible outenjoying ourselves. No complaints top notch service.

I liked the hotel. It feels fresh and modern. The design is very boutique and unique and its position in Sagres is simply wonderful with amazing views of the sea. The hotel is simply lovely but it could be amazing with just small attention to more detail because I am sure this is easy to achieve and at minimal cost as I will describe here. So. The room itself. Well this was very clean and beds comfy. It was minimal with decoration which was again lovely and fresh. Air con worked very well indeed and the balcony was great despite the ants not hotels fault. As a guest what I would have really liked in the room is a kettle with some teabags just to make the occasional warm drink most hotels in the world offer this kind of thing nowadays. To my disappointment The basin had a crack in it the bidet had a big crack in it and mould stains on the ceiling around the shower were clearly visible obviously due to lack of ventilation issues. I do not expect to stay in a hotel where I have to see things like this and not particularly of the standard of this hotel. Outside the pool itself was fine but the area around it needs improving. The mattresses were dirty the beds look tired the umbrellas also appear tired and then there were glass panels which have rust all on the metal fittings. Again someone just needs to go out there and put a bit of money into it to get it up to standard. The bar area was very nice and the restaurant again it was beautifully decorated inside with a very minimalistic and fresh appeal. When we went to check out the buffet dinner can you believe that we asked the staff member what the meat was and they responded I do not know. Then when we asked how much the buffet was again the staff member was unsure. How can someone work with a product they are unsure of. So because of this the hotel lost our dinner business. At breakfast which by the was wonderful it was the same the lady who was checking in the guests we approached her to ask just for some plates and she said I am reception I do not get involved with that stuff yet she was standing probably 15 inches away from the food section and could easily just get some help from a colleague. This is the difference between a hotel which is very good and a hotel which can be excellent and I believe this hotel just needs a few simple improvements to bring it up to a fabulous level. My final comment is about the gym. Equipment was old and dated eg running machine needed servicing. I run often and know the noise was due to poor maintenance. Similarly the mats for floor work were grubby and old. The cleanliness in there was actually very poor. There were no towels also. I appreciate a gym is not a priority for many on a holiday but some of us like to go down there and get some fitness. Despite the comments I have recorded here. I did enjoy my stay and I would certainly go back. And I have said it once but in my opinion simple things could be done at minimal cost to improve this establishment because it is a unique product in a unique setting then I would have given 5 stars for sure.", "offset": [1946, 2274], "date": "2015-09-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "65ea0828-f37a-49da-9e6b-3e6f657feb4f", "sentence": "Great breakfast.

The room was basic but it did us just fine. We made very good use of the clothesline kindly provided in the bathroom. The fridge was also put to good use. There was ample enough storage also. The bathroom was excellent nicely decorated with lots of shelf space to put your bits and pieces on. It always surprises me when holiday accommodation over look shelf space. But not here in the Memo Baleira. Cleaning staff were excellent also always leaving the room spotless and perfect whenever we wanted it serviced. Friendly too whenever you passed them in the corridor. The pool area is fantastic one of the highlights. Getting to it early helps with nabbing a parasol and sun bed but people always seem to be coming and going to so if you wait a bit you will probably get a sun bed by the pool throughout the day. The view from the pool also gets a special mention. I do not think I would ever get bored of that view the harbour the sea and the blue blue sky. Wonderful And the little public beach at the bottom of the cliff which you can get to from the hotel grounds via a steep set up steps is also worth checking out. Not many people staying at the hotel seemed to though as it was always relatively empty. Probably due to the steps taking some getting used to they are a tad difficult so not for the meek. Next the breakfasts wow really impressive. And a great range on offer so you do not get bored of the food by the end of you stay. It got very busy after 9 am so may be worth getting there early. There are a few downsides mainly in the bar where the food is overpriced for what your get. I got a cous cous salad one lunchtime and I have to say I can make a much nicer one at home myself. This one was just bland boring and tasteless. Our second and last lunch was by the pool. Our advice is go somewhere else for lunch. The other downside was the bar staff. We were more or less ignored one evening when we went in for some cocktails. We left cocktail less. Baffling behaviour. But as I said the poor food and bad service seemed to be confined to the bar.

Views are amazing when you have the full sea view rooms land view equals parking lot. it is seen better days though. Cool would also describe the staff who work here. Or perhaps hostile might be more appropriate. Unlike the rest of Portugal where people a friendly and nice this hotel seems to have hired the few exceptions to the rule. The receptionist refuses to greet her guests the restaurant staff does not even acknowledge their existence. OK it is cheap when you book online but they forgot to mention the construction site next door. There is drilling and hammering all day long. What they did mention is how kids friendly the place is.

When booking our room we added the breakfast into our room charge we are very happy we did. The breakfast was phenomenal. The food was fresh delicious the choices were so plentiful. Also the staff continuously restocked any foods that ran low so you never had to worry about missing anything. It was well worth the money to have the breakfast every day. In the evening we ate Dinner at the Restaurant several times it was also fantastic. Everything was fresh absolutely delicious again the Restaurant staff was exceptional. This little surfer town has a lot to offer. We took some beautiful hikes along the cliffs there were bikes to rent surfing beautiful beaches tours of the Forts.

We received a lovely welcome at reception. The reception is on large desks and guests can sit down whilst they speak to the staff there. The room was very modern and also had a kettle and refrigerator in it. The hotel provide a few tea bags and some herbal tea bags plus milk in the room. My wife drinks coffee I asked for some in the room and the reception said they only provided tea. This seems a bit unfair. They do provide one bottle of water free of charge. The room had a small balcony which looked out over the sea and harbour. The door handle to the balcony door fell off twice and a maintenance engineer came to fix it. Even during December we enjoyed some magnificent sunrise views from our room. The satellite TV had a few English speaking channels also some other channels in English were subtitled in Portuguese. There was only one armchair in the room and I would have appreciated two so we could both sit down on them in the evenings. The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well. The bathroom had a circular sink which was on top of a unit. If the tap was turned on too high it splashed anything around the sink including a wash bag or razor. The shower was over a bath and was very good. The hotel provided shower gel body lotion and conditioning shampoo. Breakfast was buffet style in a separate restaurant. The spread of food and drink was superb. There was sparkling wine to drink if you wanted it. Plenty of salmon cooked breakfast cold meats and salads. There was fruit juice water and other beverages available. Lots of healthy options as well. On the first two or three days the cooked breakfast was stone cold when there were less visitors. This happened at least three times in spite of reporting it to the waiting staff and reception. The rest of the time we were there more visitors arrived and the turn round of food was quicker and much hotter. The main restaurant has great ambience and also a good choice of food. We were allowed to choose anything on the A La Carte Menu as we were on half board. The food was of a very high standard. I would like to have seen Sea Bream or another fish on the menu but the Salmon Kebab was outstandingly tasty. I liked the Cuttlefish starter and also the Calzone Pizza. I also recommend the Beef Medallion. They have a Pizza chef in the restaurant who hand makes Pizzas for diners. Pizzas are extremely large and filling. We shared one and another main on one occasion. The waiters in the restaurant are very friendly and hard working. Staff also said hello to us when we were out and about the hotel later in the day. The last night a group of Portuguese men were drinking draught Sagres in the restaurant bar which ran out of draught beer. The waiter did give me two bottled beers for the same price which was appreciated. There are also soft drinks which my wife enjoyed several times. We both had wine by the glass as well and this was excellent and reasonably priced. The desserts were tasty as well. We both liked the Lemon Brule home made ice cream Tiramasu and Chocolate pudding with custard. We also found Luis Dyan Mario and Dyane to be very attentive and friendly waiters throughout our time at the hotel. You can have towels for the indoor or outdoor pool in exchange for a voucher. These were appreciated by us as we swam daily in the indoor pool. This pool is heated and was empty each time we went there in the late morning. There is a sauna changing room and shower in the Indoor Pool area. The pool was free to use and although small was large enough for two people to swim and exercise in. If there had been more users of the indoor pool then it would have been rather crowded. The Wi Fi is available all over the hotel free of charge and It is quite fast. When I checked it it was 12 megabits. It supported Netflix and general surfing. There is no need to log into the network so be careful with your online security. A bonus also is the free use of the Press Reader ap. This allowed me to read a variety of daily newspapers and magazines free of charge whilst staying there. I am also delighted to find that my local library also allow free use of the ap. The harbour is interesting to walk round. In season there are several companies that run trips to see Dolphins etc or organise fishing trips. Mario and Laura were helpful and friendly on reception. Laura let us know our taxi had arrived to take us to the airport on the last day and took one of our cases to the minibus for us. There are not a lot of shops in the main town but if you are on half board you should not need to go to them much at all. The first shop is a cafe if you walk a little further you will get to a Spar supermarket. One walk down to the beach is down some very steep steps and the hotel has a warning notice about this. There is another large beach on a gentle undulating pathway. This is worth a visit with rock pools atlantic surf and a magnificent sandy beach. You can also walk along the cliffs as well which give spectacular views but are very steep on on one side. I recommend that you catch an EVA bus to Lagos which is a lovely town with plenty of beaches near it. Overall a lovely winter break for us great weather with plenty of good food and chances to relax.
