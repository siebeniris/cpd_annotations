Bercy village is a 2 minute walk away and is a must to visit. It is open from 11 am 9 pm some some lovely independent shops and some fantastic eateries. I would recommend the Burger fast food restaurant and also the Frog restaurant and bar during happy hour 5 8 Monday Friday. do not make the mistake we did by getting off the metro at the Bercy station and it is a 15 25minute walk.

This Bercy area and Bercy village worth a visit. It is beautiful and quiet place. I doubt that you can sleep well if the hotel is not well structured in the downtown and in closer circles to the center you should know first from the map that in which neighborhood you want to accommodate because Paris does not know day and night. Good sleep is important in a trip and you can have it at this Pullman. The room space is fine. The floor and furniture clean. The entrance lobby bar and restaurant is nice and modern. They change the design with flowers for every event happen in the hotel. It was good management. Many Lufthansa crew come and go to this hotel as they might have a contract or something. So it can talk about quality. The design of the reception is different for staff to approach to guests and ask for their needs. Most of the time they do. If you ask for help with an address or something most of the time they help with a map or a print. Although I think for this modern reception desk like this and reply to all the customers without delay they should be trained more in my opinion. We got a room in first floors but despite my assumption it was well quite and nice. In higher floors I believe you can have a good view of seine river as well. The neighborhood is calm and safe.

The closest hop on hop off station to the hotel which would be at the end of the park near the stadium arena would be approximately 20 minutes to walk. Metro is so close and only 7 8 min. walk. For Metro make sure to get daily passes or more because it is also a good mean to visit sights with no extra charge. If wanted to buy souvenirs check the price first with some other people or shops. I experienced that in Paris you can bargain. even for taxi transportationBreakfast good and complete set. Different breads and fruits. You can hardly find taxi in front of the hotel.
