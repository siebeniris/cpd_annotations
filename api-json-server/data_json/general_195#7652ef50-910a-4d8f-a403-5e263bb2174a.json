My partner and I arrived Saturday 20th Feb in the afternoon. The staff were friendly and our room was ready for us. We found it a bit strange that the receptionist asked for a \u00a3 150 deposit. We had already paid for the room and they had the card details should we need to be charged for anything but they still took the \u00a3 150 and said it would be refunded when we leave. The room layout is strange the sink to wash your hands and brush your teeth is in the middle of the room and there are no tea coffee facilities. Other than that it is pleasant enough. The sink in the room did not drain and so when we left to head out we notified a member of staff who said they had take care of it. When we later returned there were doormen standing at the entrance. We tried to walk in and were asked what we were doing. We were then told we needed to queue up. We stood in the queue for a few minutes and told a different doorman we were hotel guests. He was apologetic and let us in. We headed to the bar on the first floor and were faced with lots of typical London people. The girls had very little on and the blokes were arrogant. Half of the seats were reserved so we could not sit down. For the amount we paid we expected to be able to have a drink in the hotel bar. We could not get served so left. We headed down to the spice restaurant and sat at the bar there. There was a nice atmosphere and we ordered a beer and a small glass of wine this totalled \u00a3 19 the barman decided to add a service charge even though all he did was pour and serve as we were right opposite him so no need to bring over to us.

We choose the W primarily for the location and it was perfect as locations go. The downside of location is that despite the fact I think our room was facing the quietest side it was still a bit noisy through the night. Trash collection is about 3 am. The room was awkward and small. Ok for maybe a weekend but not great for 5 nights. Sink in the middle of the room was not horrible but it contributes to awkward. Light in our shower kept going off because it is motion censored and you have to give the perfect motion for it to stay on numerous times during a shower. We had repeated charges made to our credit card over the first couple of days. Big charges. No idea why this kept happening. But the desk was quick to respond and have them removed. The fact it happened a couple more times before it stopped made us question what in the world was going on. One night the fire alarm went off at 3 am. Ca nt even begin to tell you how terrifying that is in this day and age in the middle of London. No explanation for it or apology. Just a false alarm. On the bright side. The staff is absolutely wonderful. This was a surprise given previous reviews. We are mid forties so I thought they would think of us as the old folks in the building and not give us the time of day. Completely the opposite. If they so much as glanced at us when we would leave the hotel we would be greeted with a super warm Welcome back. How was your day. when we returned hours later. No idea how they have such good memories. You could ask ANYONE there do you know a good place for a burger ramen whatever. and they would have a perfect recommendation and directions. Concierge gave us outstanding recommendations. The staff carries the hotel for sure. I personally LOVED the bouncers outside. Gives you a very secure feeling as you come back at night.

This hotel covers every need of the young modern moody hip traveler or those who enjoy that sort of feel. Leicester Square is a bit like a mini Times Square and this Hotel hosting the MM World in the same building. You could easily walk by this hotel and miss the entrance and that is the perfect way to describe the understated delivery that W Hotels do. Once inside you find block of 3 eleveators super modern lobby and super narow you could be in an exclusive club a brand new office building. it is hard to tell. If you are lost you are in the right place. Up to the first floor and you will find the lobby and it is beautiful. The hotel bar loby is here as well. If you come here without your weekend best you may feel underdressed. Yes there is actually a queue outside for people who want to come to this lobby bar. It seems to be a bit of a hotspot. Small clean great service and the young well dressed crowd. Once you head toward your room the hallways are dark dark dark. The feeling of an underground tunnel a secret passage way almost like diving under water and coming out at another place popping up at your room. The hallways almost entice you there for nefarious activity though you will only find the hip stylish roaming these halls. I had the Wonderful room and from the moment stepping in the door the world brightens. Very ample outdoor light white or light color scheme very clean and crisp. The room makes the best use of the space you have never feeling small but to accomplish this the toilet room and walk in shower are hidden behind mirrored doors. You can see out but you can not see in. The walk in shower was amazing and large though a bit difficult with the doorway and water. The sink and utilities are moved out to the center of the room kitchen island style and it works. You can access the sink without needing the toilet you can fix yourself while someone else is in the shower or the toilet I loved this aspect of the room. Power outlets were at a premium. One UK and one EU plug under the island. and that is all that could be found. Luckily I had a power strip with me otherwise this would have been a rough situation. The room was near silent though it was only on the 1st floor facing China Town and all the pedestrians you had imagine in this part of the city. The air conditioning worked excellently and was silent. The room key worked perfectly. There is ultimate control of the lighting in the room both from the entry and from the bed. There is a door that covers the storage and close that also rolls in front of the dor I suppose in case you needed room service to leave something in that space without disturbing you. A bit curious if you get my intention. So if you are looking for a hotel optimized for two this would certainly be it with a modern feel slightly dark underworld mood in the halls trendy night spots and an excellent location. You can easily slip in out without being noticed and without much fanfare. I felt completely welcomed and in control the entire time during my visit. I had return. The only criticism was one others have mentioned if you go a bit wild in the shower the water can leak out the door and sop up the tile a bit.

However my two main concerns1. The noise. we stayed whilst there was maintenance work taking place on the hotel unavoidable I know. Although the notice provided in the room clearly stated that the work would begin at 10 each morning and this was not the case during our stay I was woken up before 9 on some days because of the drilling. Could also hear the noise from other guests in neighbouring rooms. 2. The service. For a 5 hotel and for what I was paying the service was hit and miss. For instance the bar staff in the W lounge and the concierge on ground floor were all very helpful and friendly. However staff at reception seemed to be unenthusiastic and less than welcoming.

There was an island in the middle of the room which has the sink. so you wash up and brush your teeth in the middle of the room. The toilet has very limited space and when you flush it splashes outside the toilet seat. That night I had to go back to the front desk and ask for a more convenient and practical room. So I had to upgrade to a suite and I was charged \u00a3 80 per night. But I had like to thank Mr Ted on the front desk who was really nice helpful and patient. Also I had like to thank Mrs Marina at the Whatever Whenever Concierge for her help. The suite was really clean and has a big window that added more to the space.

W Hotels have the reputation of being very hip but also elegant. This hotel was so hip that it got in the way of everything else. From the outside it does look really cool. The lobby is on the 2nd floor. It is right next to the bar area with no separation. The DJ was blasting the music so loud that the receptionist could not hear us and vice versa. We got a room on the 3rd floor and it ended up being right over the DJs space. The room literally shook. The layout of the room was I am sure meant to be really cool but they neglected functionality. The first thing you notice is the big walk around counter in the middle of the entry area. The bathroom and shower are hidden behind panels in the wall. It took a while just to find them. Since the counter and sink in your entry area are the only ones your bathroom kit ends up in the middle of your entry area. There is no dresser and a small closet is hidden behind another sliding panel that covers the doorway when you open the closet. Really inconvenient. Because of the noise we asked for another room before we did anything else. We also asked if there were any normal rooms with an actual bathroom. We were put on the other end of the building two floors up and did get a bathroom. Much better. Only real issue here was the big concrete pillar in the middle of the room making it almost impossible to walk from the far side of the bed without side stepping around it.

The Good and the Bad. My husband and I travel quite a bit and often stay in luxury hotels resorts including Ws in other locations around the globe. but I must state that although this hotel has its funky modern features is easily accessible to major tourist attractions by walking this was by far the worst decision we have made in staying at this hotel. I do not want to only focus on the negative aspects of our experience because there were certainly positive ones as well. We traveled during Pride Week where we arrived to a huge fun. crowd outside of the hotel waiting to go into the W club lounge to party. We made our way upstairs to the lobby to check in. We were greeted by the staff who were very friendly and assisted us almost immediately. We requested a quiet room away from the party we had traveled 7 hr on a flight plus stood in a 25 hour customs line. needless to say we were exhausted and wanted uninterrupted sleep. The gentleman who checked us in was very attentive and put us on the higher level floor away from the loud club music. The rooms are extremely modern quite bizarre in design since the bathroom bathroom sink vanity are basically in the middle of the room next to your bed. It took a minute to realize that half of the walls are all mirrors and 2 doors open 1 for the toilet and the second for the shower not really private and our door had issues so the water was leaking out in the middle of the \u201c bathroom \u201d. This issue was immediately addressed by the staff which we appreciate but the functioning of the door was not resolved. The light sensor turns on and off in the middle of your shower and when you are in the bathroom which was quite frustrating. Further I loved the amenities Bliss co toiletries the black out curtains were awesome and the bed which had fluffy linens were extremely comfortable. The closet is a decent size but the sliding door had to be moved over and blocked the entryway door. The robe slippers and towels were also of great quality. Since it is the summer season where the weather is quite hot and humid we would have expected the hallways and the elevators to be air conditioned. I understand this is Europe I have lived in another EU country before so I know not all places are fully air conditioned but we expected more out of this hotel for the price we paid per night aprox. 360 USD. With that said we felt that the quality of our experience was not up to par with the price of the hotel. Although most of the staff were friendly I did run into a situation where I was told I could n\u2019t consume a soda I bought myself in the lounge area while waiting for my room to be cleaned. I mentioned I was a paying guest staying at the hotel and was still denied entry to even sit on the couch near the elevators. I was pretty furious but I walked away and stood in the hallway on my phone. The lady approached me soon thereafter and said she \u201c spoke with her manager \u201d and \u201c it \u2019s ok for me to sit down \u201d. I was quite embarrassed by the way I was treated. After this situation the hotel manager reached out to us and apologized and offered us a round of drinks in the lounge. I appreciated the gesture but wish that the staff could be trained on how to handle a situation like this. Perhaps a suggestion would be to let guests know WHY outside drinks food are not permitted in the lounge bar areas not just state this is hotel policy. Moreover this brings me to my next topic prices. Yes hotel food bar drinks are extremely overpriced but wow the breakfast buffet is over 35 per person and the variety is quite disappointing. There are tons of cute coffee shops bakeries around the corner that are much less expensive and higher quality. I ordered room service a couple of times which I must say was DELICIOUS and the staff who delivered it were lovely and prompt. The cleaning staff are super friendly as well. Lastly perhaps our biggest complaint was the noise outside of the room and hotel. It was pretty unbearable at night as my husband and I had to wear ear plugs I do n\u2019t think this is the hotels fault since the hotel is right in the middle of Trafalgar Square a MAJOR tourist spot.
