My 14 year old Son and I traveled to Atlanta for a championship football game and chose the Ritz Carlton Buckhead. It was an excellent choice and I highly recommend it. First of all the location is excellent. Many good restaurants are walking distance as well as a few huge shopping areas. The MARTA or subway is also very close. The hotel is great. Staff is excellent as is facility. The hotel is warm and very inviting. The concierge is very helpful and always smiling and greeting you. On the weekends they offer a free candy bar mimosa bar and bourbon tasting. I appreciate that having traveled to many hotels which never offer extras without a price. The brunch was fabulous.

This was my first visit to stay at The Whitley and was glad to see some of the same employees from when it was the Ritz. However this hotel is lacking in service. There was a party going on next room to my room on the Club floor. They were not sold out so not sure why they would not space the rooms anyway. At midnight when the party was going strong I called to get help from security to quiet them down. An hour later I called back to the operator who never answered as I stayed trying to reach her for 20 minutes and no answer. So I tried again and explained that she may have forgotten to get security to come but this was unacceptable for this loudness to happen at 1 am with ho assistance from security or anyone from the hotel to assist. I had an executive suite on the Club floor which was nice size room and well appointed with espresso machine and bottled water provided for make the espresso. The valet parking was understaffed but okay because I called well in advance for the car to be brought around. As for the Club Floor there is significantly less food and drinks. It is not that I expected for it to be the same as the Ritz but if you go to The Whitley save your money and do not stay on Club floor. Not worth it I hate to say breakfast was sufficient but not a thing out around noon and limited drinks. The Mariot Atlanta Airport Hotel was as good or better than The Whitley titled as a luxury hotel. As enter this hotel it is impressive and lovely. There is a nice bar which is comfortable and electric. The location of The Whitley is great and easy access to highway. I hope more attention is done to update the rooms and more attentive to making the Club lounge as it should be. Even if I had never been to the hotel as a Ritz I would not have been impressed with it as it was when we went a few weeks ago because not a luxury hotel.", "offset": [136, 177], "date": "2018-06-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "11ac35b5-aee7-417c-b039-3e8b0e7668fb", "sentence": "I wish I could give the hotel a better rating but unfortunately I do not see the value add from this place.

There are a plethora of hotel options in Atlanta I had recommend finding accommodations elsewhere.

Recent reservations a few weeks back and the power was out for hours the pool and gym was closed for renovation and we were not made aware when booking and have not been able to speak to anyone in a leadership role at the hotel about this. Over the past few weeks I have made numerous calls left messages and sent emails and told management would call me back yet nothing. Guest Services has nothing more than an unsympathetic tough luck response. Reached out directly to Director level management at the hotel and not even an acknowledgement. I have been polite I have not asked for anything other than to talk to someone. This place will not spare 5 minutes to chat with a guest over a negative experience. The gym is a nice to have but electricity is a basic necessity. If this hotel does not even have the common courtesy to acknowledge multiple phone calls or emails regarding a necessity that would deem a property uninhabitable how do you think they are going to treat your request for turn down service or go out of their way to celebrate a significant event.

Great stay for our family of 4 on short vacation to Atlanta. Great hotel. For the price it was beyond a bargain. We paid 230 for a double bed room on the club level. The room had some water issues at check in so they upgraded us to a two room suite. It was very nice. I wo n\u2019t repeat what has been said on other reviews but a few things stand out. The club level food selection was pretty fantastic. A family could easily eat breakfast and dinner there. No alcohol provided without additional charge but I would rather get a better price for the room and buy my alcohol at the bar. The parking fee is a bit ridiculous at 45 per night. You can \u201c self park \u201d for 18 per day but you essentially pay 18 each time you take your car out. So that \u2019s not an option unles you plan on leaving your car. One strategy I realized on our last day. park overnight at self pay then leave your car across the street at the mall during the day as you come and go. You ca n\u2019t leave your car overnight at the mall without getting towed. In room internet service was shoddy but since most have unlimited data these days this is not really an issue.

We also had an erroneous valet parking charge on one of our rooms upon check out. We reported it to the front desk and they promised to have it removed.

The check in process was not too bad. The lobby was over run with people celebrating so the noise level was pretty bad but otherwise it was fine. My room however was extremely basic. As a top tier hotel traveler I often get upgrades but not only was I not offered one I was placed on the lowest floor possible. They attempted to move me to a room on the concierge level but it was an adjoining room with a very thin door. I could hear every word clearly of the neighbor on the phone. They put me back in my original room on the lowest floor. I was told the club was included in my stay but was not told that the hours were limited. I went to check it out less than 10 minutes after the official closing. The room was packed. I asked for a glass of wine and was rudely told they were closed. I then went down to the bar which was so incredibly packed 3 people deep that it was not possible. I was so frustrated I called the front desk to mention it to them. No one answered the first few times then I was placed on hold for about 10 minutes. The manager ultimately sent me 1 glass of wine as a way to placate me. The room itself was fine. I did have a decent view of the mall and the skyline in the distance even on the lowest floor of rooms I think it was the 7th floor or so. The bed was cozy. Bathroom was small. I called a few times to the front desk and they always put me on an extended hold. I felt like the hotel was too busy and understaffed. My bill had tons of stuff on the minibar that I did not consume. It took a call with a 10 minute hold and then was transferred where I had to leave a voice message and wait for this to be corrected. I now know why this hotel is no longer a Ritz Carlton. The service is not good. The rooms are basic and they are understaffed.
