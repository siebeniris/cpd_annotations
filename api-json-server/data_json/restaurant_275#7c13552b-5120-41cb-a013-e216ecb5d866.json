I have stayed here 3 times as a Hilton elite. Great location in downtown. Corner rooms are AWESOME with great views and relatively large marbled bathrooms with big windows. Complimentary continental breakfast for elites is a nice touch. The restaurant on the first floor is elegant and service is good although seemingly understaffed at times. Hector did an amazing job and his service was on point despite being VERY busy. My only gripe with the hotel is the inconsistency of the service. First stay in 2013 did NOT go well. The property chose to check guests in without informing them that the AC was down. This was late summer and very hot downtown. I did not get much sleep when I returned to the room late that evening. Honors made things right by comping the room and giving me 10 K points. Second stay in 2014 was GREAT. Check in was friendly and I got upgraded to a corner room. Everything was flawless. Most recently the Checkers dropped the ball. I was checked in by a gentleman named Alex. He was not rude but he was definitely not friendly. We all have bad days. but one bad day is enough to lose business. I was not offered the usual Diamond status check in which acknowledged my status potential for upgrades complimentary waters nor did I have my breakfast coupons ready. I asked if any better rooms were available and flatly said No. I dare not sound entitled but these are very basic things. The next morning Philip made things right by providing me breakfast vouchers. He was very friendly and helpful despite the fact that the lobby was very busy with tourists checking out. Thank you Philip.

And this is a bigie. there is no gift shop nor single vending machine within the building and the area at night is rather seedy to go walking about.

It would be considerate of Hilton Checkers to offer vending machines for water and drinks. I understand there is a snack bar but the snacks set on room entertainment section area which did not even have a fridge or microwave well it made for a messy unattractive set up. like perhaps someone carried a candybar in purse then deposited to make up for eaten candy later replaced. So while the room snack bar area does exist it looks a bit shabby and thin in choices which made me go seeking elsewhere only to find even less choices. Come morning we were certainly hungry for breakfast and were glad to upgrade to full breakfast and enjoy excellent service by Hector. The dining area feels like old city San Francisco or New York. We ordered vegetarian style eggs benedict and Greek omelet. Both excellent dishes as well as the coffee.

We recently took Amtrak from San Diego to LA to see Adele at the Staples Center. We chose to spend one night at the Checkers Hilton Los Angeles before heading back to San Diego. The Checkers Hilton Los Angeles is a short Uber from Union Station note I do n\u2019t recommend you walk to the Hotel from the Train Station. The doorman greeted us with a smile as we stepped through the doors into the Lobby. The lobby is small but uncluttered. The Checkers Lounge bar is off to the right as you enter and there is seating adjacent to the bar. We chose to try the Hilton Honors Ap with Digital Key and bypassed the front desk. The elevators require a room key or the Digital key points to Hilton for the extra security. We had to try a couple times but the phone ap worked and the elevator took us to the tenth floor. The hallways are nicely decorated greys and tan making it feel quiet. We were booked in Corner Room 103 and found it at the end of the hallway. Room 103 is a corner room overlooking Grand Avenue and our room was a bit smaller than most Hilton rooms but nicely laid out. The bathroom is large with standup shower no tub all marble and a vanity. Note Room 103 the shower has a low ceiling and at 6 ft I had trouble getting my head under the shower without leaning stooping a bit. I do wish for Hilton to change their choice of guest soaps. The Peter Thomas Roth soaps are n\u2019t to my liking and leave a heavy scent \u2013 how about something clean and fresh scented please. I know I know it is probably just me LOLNot a complaint but an observation we found the corner room not particularly light tight. There are a lot of windows with curtains that really close all the way. LOL. The bane of all travelers. We did find the room to be very quiet which allayed my fears of a room facing Grand Avenue. After the Adele concert we returned late to the Checkers Hilton Los Angeles to crash. We found the doorman right there and still smiling. As we entered the lobby I turned on the Hilton Honors ap to find the site down for maintenance. Now this was annoying because we had to stand in line at the front desk to get room keys. Also note that if you bypass the front desk with Digital Key you will not get bottled water or your breakfast coupons Diamond benefitWe slept ok but to be honest that bed was n\u2019t very comfortable and I question if it was really a King bed. We actually overslept and had to hustle to get to Union Station for our train to San Diego. Therefore we did n\u2019t get to try out Checkers Downtown restaurant for breakfast.

This property is different than your typical cookie cutter Hilton and as they self proclaim it is the only boutique hotel in downtown LA. it is a small property in an old building but the location is great. Grand Ave is relatively quieter than some other streets particularly at night so it is not too bad but you are within a 10minute walk of many restaurants and attractions. Verbal recognition of diamond status is great as they thank you and make a big deal of it when checking in but it stops there. Then you have to lead the front desk staff into upgrading you into a better than standard room. Literally take them by the hand and talk through different room types are there any junior suites available. what about corner rooms not the smaller ones in the 02 series but the larger ones in the 03 series. I appreciate the properties that do not make you do the dance. You are recognized as a diamond and they automatically search to find you the best available room within their operating policies. does not have to be an executive suite but just be proactive is all I am asking. I know that another benefit of being a Gold Diamond member is complimentary continental breakfast. Many or even most Hilton brand properties even Stateside will give you the full hot breakfast. This one gives you a breakfast voucher with two options hot buffet breakfast and continental and checks off the continental. I get it that is strictly by the rules but would it kill them to give you the hot breakfast. You can apply your continental voucher and get a 15 credit towards anything on the menu so the restaurant staff was nice about that. Very courteous and responsive group the restaurant staff. Loved eating breakfast thereThe room was nice. Yes it was small but you are in the city. Higher floors are better of course and you want to face Grand north if possible for the nicest view. Clean room and mostly isolated from outside hallway noise for a city property. I also do not like the Honors policy of being vague about extended checkout same gripe with Mariot. You kind of have to negotiate with the front desk about checking out later mostly they are only willing to extend you an hour when you are allowed up to four usually. Some properties are better than others. The DoubleTree in Little Tokyo almost always lets you stay until 4 pm. Hyat does a better job in guaranteeing 4 pm checkout for their Diamonds.
