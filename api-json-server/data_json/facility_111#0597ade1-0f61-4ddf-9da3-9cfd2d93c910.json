Getting a decent place to stay in Bhubaneswar in a budget hotel is difficult. Most 2star and 3star hotels are similarly priced. The options are limited and a 3star hotel with the most basic of basic amenities is your best bet. Although the city is safe in general the idea of women travelling alone for a longer duration is still not a widely accepted concept. So be prepared to garner some wide eyes sometimes cold tones and scanning stares from people. Having said all of that my stay at Ginger was very comfortable the staff were pleasant to interact with and the ambience was hospitable. it is a busy place and the staff seemed on their toes throughout the day too. There is really nothing much to do around except a few eateries. So you are dependent on the hotel restaurant for your meals especially if you are there for work. I really hoped they served some traditional meals rather than the regular Chinese Mughlai options. The hotel is a bit overpriced for the amenities it provides but like I mentioned earlier this is kind of a norm here. So it is actually adequately priced as compared to other similarly priced hotels. Ginger still is a good option compared to some dingy place near the station as it is somewhat conveniently located and is comfy for a short staybr The room was comfy except the AC did not really work and the view was not too great directly opposite the restaurant building.", "offset": [943, 1060], "date": "2018-10-04 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "b4edccd4-7b1c-492d-b4b6-9327b620a293", "sentence": "Ginger hotel.
