We stayed only one night as a stopover to Mexico but was delighted by the stylishness of the hotel when we arrived. The pool area was super inviting if it was not cold I would have spent my day there. All the staff we came across were super friendly and helpful. The room was quaint with a touch of style and a super comfortable bed. The breakfast servings were generous and garnished with deep fried potatoes. If that is your thing you will love it. Oddly no poached eggs much to our disappointment.

Super cute hotel with small pool restaurant on pool side heated terrace decent food some ambiance very cute staff knowledgeable. D\u00e9cor is a bit dated but still captivating there is something about that hotel I really liked. They have fitness botcamps organized on the beach in the morning which I truly enjoyed and I was able to borrow a stylish beach cruiser for an afternoon in the canals. The lovely staff even directed me towards a really good caf\u00e9 on Abbot kiney intelligentsia which I did nt know was in that area of LA. I was also able to walk to most of my favorites places in the area. Urth caf\u00e9 caf\u00e9 gratitude bodyworks and Exhale yoga studios wasteland etc its not too far from the airport too. Only downside was my ocean view. room which was more on a street view a few block from the ocean. it was not bad just not an ocean view and room quite small. Otherwise great location.

For Halloween night the hotel hosted a killer party that was open to the public. Irene Crowe at the hotel front desk even made our stay better by snagging two tickets for our friends and the party was a sold out event.

The room was cute and comfortable. The bed was really cozy king sized and comfortable. You can see the ocean from the bed which makes for an excellent kick back situation. It is close to all kinds of restaurants and shops even a Segway rental place so we never had to get in the car once while staying there. The pool area was stunning but we never went in. Good place if you like the nightlife as people get their drink on out by the pool. The restaurant had nearly zero vegetarian options but we had pizza delivered and it was delicious. The concierge at the hotel recommended the pizza and we were not disappointed. The amenities are nice and you will find things in this hotel that you really will not find elsewhere. Case in point is chewable Il Morso coffee bites. They are chocolate with caffeine delicious and quick for those days when you need the caffeine but do not have time to swig down the liquid. Yes chewable coffee that is basically just tasty chocolate. You can order these online for a lot less than you will pay the hotel BTW but it is a clever add to the usual chips and snacks that are standard in the honor bar. The room was decorated nicely things were all clean and comfy. The tub plug did not work but they came and fixed it up as soon as I reported the issue. A nice soaking tub and some great robes to lounge around in all day longMy one nit that brought this to 4 stars was the family with children right next door. The screaming kids sounded like they were actually in our room. Normally I do not nit much about noise at hotels hey you share walls what do you expect right. But no this was so loud I am sure because it was one of those rooms that has a door for people to share when they are in joining rooms. So as a pro tip ask for a room that does not have such a door if one is available. You pay a little more for the ocean view but it was worth it and cost less than hotels directly across the street with better ocean views. So in many ways this is a good value as well as a nice hotel. Not cheap but it is worth the spend. I would go back I would just be a little more choosy about the room if I could do that. Go downstairs for the free coffee in the morning it was surprisingly good. The Santa Monica Pier and the official end of Route 66 is kitty corner a short walk from the hotel.

Just Run. I stayed at this hotel only one night out of the two originally booked. The service is non existent and employees are lazy rude and non educated. The two receptionists who looked at each other laughing and openly mocking me when I left Change jobs you guys are pathetic. It starts with the check in the room is not ready but it is normal as we arrived around 1 pm 2h before the guaranteed time of the check in the receptionist takes our phone number and tells us that he will call us as soon as the room is ready. We \u2019re offered a welcome drink that we take on the terrace. And there \u2019s chaos. the pool which is really tiny btw is crowded no space if someone hoped to put a foot. everybody is with glasses and just stay there people scream laugh and of course with so much people there are no deckchairs available. Disappointing and very far from the calm afternoon at the swimming poll that we hoped for \u2026 We go for a walk outside we think things will be better later. We come back at 3 pm without any call from the receptionist who ends up telling me that the room is ready \u2026. do not offer a service that you are not able to provide. The room is so so the bathtub did not work on the other hand great reactivity of the maintenance department which came within 5minWe go down to the pool it \u2019s even worse. More people even more noise. I go to the concierge to ask what \u2019s going on if this is a special occasion it could be. how naive \u2026 Not at all they just explain to me that the hotel sells Day Pass to outside customers and that wouldl be the same tomorrow. There is a manifest abuse the guests of the hotel are taken for fools. We pay for night but we are ousted from the pool area we do not have the possibility to benefit of the hotel facilities all is taken by dozens of outside noisy customers. At about 17h I finally went to ask for the cancellation of the second night no apologies from the receptionist anyway there was no reason for him to do his job better than before so not so much surprise. but above all he has been asked for the approval of his manager in his office and the manager did not even came to see me we better understand the behavior of his team. he just gave his approval that is all too kind of you good complaint management. What. it was coffee break so you could not come ask what happened or apologize for the inconvenience. This is an unacceptable situation they have no consideration for hotel guests the behavior of their employees is deplorable. We asked a girl to check if anyone had brought car keys we had lost ours. she opened a drawer in front of us before answering no nothing about research calls or anything. We searched everywhere for an hour literally an hour before I ended up asking the valet who actually had them. the girl had absolutely not asked the person in charge of keys car. And to finish with the best we finally asked for our luggage and the person we had asked for it was doing NOTHING waiting for I do not know what. we waited for 10 minutes just in front of that person. I end up asking again we were already pretty upset after this horrible stay and their behaviour. FINALLY she moves and meanwhile the two guys at the reception look at each other and laugh at me.

This morning 217 some work started before 8 am and full blast work started at 8 am. I am in a room facing the back yard and pool and I can see workers working in the pool who are making the noises. I went to the front desk and asked why they are starting work at 8 am vs 9 am written on the paper right on the front desk. The front desk person went to ask the manager and came to tell me that they are trimming the trees vs construction. I told her i can see them working in the pool. She then went to get the manager who came out and admitted the noise was from construction. It is unethical for someone to run a luxury hotel by lying to its customers to their face. The hotel charges 300 a night. it is bad enough that there is no amenities whatsoever. Then start construction early and lie about it is just unacceptable.
