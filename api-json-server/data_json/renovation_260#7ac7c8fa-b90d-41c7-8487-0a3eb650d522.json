We were very impressed with the service friendliness of staff quality of food room and overall layout of the property. And the views are stunning. Pure white sand and varying shades of azure water. We are in our mid 40s and felt very comfortable here. We saw a mix of older couples and young honeymooners. The property is not plush or opulent. Rather it is simply elegant and befitting of a spa resort. Aromatherapy smells everywhere. White decor with simple lines evoke a sense of calm. The music varies throughout the resort from spa like to a chill vibe. Sugestions1. If you have resort credits to use ask your butler for help in booking uses for your credits or go down to the spa area to book a service. This way you avoid the membership sales pitch in the lobby. From there they will explain how the credits work and will book what you want from cabanas to a romantic dinner on the beach to massages etc. ALL taxes are clearly explained and require your initials on the reservation forms. There are NO surprise fees or hidden costs. The resort credits simply allow you to get services for the 16 tax. We were stopped by the membership sales people a few times and simply said we already booked our credits and they left us alone2. We tipped for service as so many of the staff work so hard. We confided in a few locals and were told that they prefer USD over pesos. We did however tip with a combo of pesos and USD depending on the server service3. Ask for what you want even if you do not see it on the drink or food menu. If you want top shelf liquor just ask. You will receive the answer it is my pleasure4. do not let the reviews of convention groups scare you. If you see groups or crowds in the main pool or lobby just move to any number of other lovely sitting areas or other pools and you WILL have as much privacy and quiet as you need. There were at least 2 groups and a wedding during our staff and we hardly noticed5. Remember that the resort is located in a humid tropical climate. You will see peeling paint and weathered tiles in places. Adjust your standards relative to the climate and you will find this property to be worth every peny6. do not fret about the weather forecast. Rain was predicted for every day of our stay but it was sunny with crystal blue skies during our entire wek7. Request a room on floors 4 and higher for totally unobstructed views8. There are 3 pools that offer varying degrees of activity and privacy. If you find the main infinity pool too crowded or loud check out the 3rd floor terrace pool or moon pool. The terrace pool is truly a hidden gem. As others have said you will want for nothing here. We found that more often than not staff anticipated our needs before we asked. We asked our butler for eucalyptus aromatherapy once and each day and night the aroma was refreshed in our room. We never had to ask for this to be done. Our room always smelled amazing. We booked the stress free arrival departure. It was perfect. We were greeted promptly at the airport with a Happy Anniversary from everyone we encountered. Our return to the airport was flawless as well. We loved the layout of the property. Small enough to be accessible but enough indoor and outdoor areas to spread out and chill. There are clean bathrooms everywhere. We also enjoyed the abundance of bottled water usually served in a bucket with iceThe third level terrace pool was our favorite. It was the best of all worlds. The same stunning views of the ocean as the main pool but with no crowds. At most we only saw 3 4 other couples at this pool area. A great big thank you to JACINTO who provided us with such attentive food and drink service. THANK YOU JACINTOWe had a couples massage which was ahmazing. And I had a scalp and neck massage. Thank you KAREN you cured my tension headacheThe spa overall was nice but not the best we have been to. Bathing suits are required and underwear must be worn for all treatments. The hydrotherapy circuit is guided which was new for us and a bit awkward. The staff person directed use of the sauna for 10 minutes then the steam for 5 minutes etc. It did nt feel relaxing nor was it at your own pace. Perhaps this is an attempt to make the spa experience very attentive. However we found it to be a a bit too regimented. The plunge pool areas were very loud at least in the womens area. Unfortunately this area of the spa was the only place I could not escape the larger crowds that must have been there as part of a convention. Our room was a Governor Suite on the 5th floor 517 and was stunning. Worth the cost. Unobstructed views of the beach in both directions. VERY comfy bed. Air cond worked perfectly and was unobtrusive. We did nt hear it running ever. Overall the room was pure serenity with incredible attention to details. Even the toilet paper was scented like baby powder. We used the balcony but would not have minded just having the one french balcony. There is much debate over the lack of true balconies here. Honestly after experiencing the resort in its totality the balcony would never be a deal breaker. There are so many lovely views and sliding patio doors in all the rooms. A balcony would not be missed in our opinion. HUGO and FRANCESCO our butlers were so friendly. We did not ask for anything special other than the aromatherapy but they were always there to say hello good night call the elevator for us and tell us about the special events of the day. Excellent job gentlemenFod was sublime everywhere. We tried every restaurant including the romantic dinner on the beach. Every meal was fresh and tasty. The only item that we did nt care for was the lobster upgrade too overdone and definitely a warm water tail which has a different taste. Not a big deal though. We still ate every pieceDrinks are awesome. Strong not at all watered down. And the fun drinks like mojitos and margs were made with muddled fresh fruits no syrupy drinks. Thank you to GUILERMO and HECTOR at the lobby bar. Loved our stay at Le Blanc. We often forgot that we were at an all inclusive. Everything was that good. Highly recommend.

Our stay was very enjoyable. All staff provided outstanding service from the time we arrived until we left. Minus the pasta the food we had was delicious. The service staff working the beach area were working extremely hard yet service was slow seemingly due to a shortage of staff. We spent a few afternoons lounging at the beach so this is not based on just one day. However I expected more of the building. The decor was beautiful but you could see that there was a lot of wear on some of the walls and in the hallway. There were mirrors in the elevators where the finish was peeling at the edge. One day we also had ants in our Jacuzi we stayed on the 4th or 5th floor. Someone on staff promptly sprayed to get rid of the ants and ran a cleaning cycle. I simply expected a better higher quality from the building of Cancuns 1 hotel last summer. Otherwise the rooms were beautiful and very well appointed. The butler services like pillow choice and aromatherapy in the room were also a plus. Although the spa was beautiful and a very relaxing experience I was disappointed by the room credit promotion we cashed in at the spa. For about 500 in room credits my husband and I received a couples massage that was very light pressure nowhere near the pressure of a Swedish massage. Higher pressure massages were more than the 500 or so that we had in room credits so we did not pick them. I hope they revise their prices to be more reasonable.

The price is definitely worth it as Le Blanc pays attention to every little detail. The staff remembers us and make us feel like family.

Bring plenty of money for tips as everyone on staff will go above and beyond for you without expecting anything. You will want to tip them.

My husband and I have just returned from a week long stay at Le Blanc. We have vacationed in Cancuns finest resorts perhaps 15 times but this time we booked Le Blanc. After experiencing Le Blanc we will never stay anywhere else and can not wait to return in November. Le Blanc is an adults only smaller resort that is the height of elegance. What really makes this resort so incredible are the employees. Every single employee at this resort treats you with friendly gracious service and go to great lengths to ensure that you are pampered and spoiled every minute. Really the staff is the best we have ever experienced anywhere in the world. We booked an ocean front room with a Jacuzi tub. The room was not particularly large but was very elegant and perfect. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. A C worked flawlessly and would get the room as cold as you like. There is a mirror television in the bathroom and a large flat screen tv across from your bed. Our personal butler would draw us a Jacuzi bath if we wanted and offered to scent our room with our favorite essential oil in diffusers. He was also available to book restaurant reservations or tours have ice delivered to the room or anything else you needed. Housekeeping kept the room spotlessly clean and did turn down service each evening and would leave fancy chocolates by the bed. Robes and slippers are provided. A fridge in the room is kept well stocked with alcohol soft drinks water snacks and candy. There is a safe in the room for valuables. We loved the view and the room amenities. The spa is spectacular and we loved the atmosphere and services. The hydrotherapy area is great and we enjoyed our holistic massages so much we did it twice. The entire Caribbean is experiencing huge amounts of dead seaweed washing ashore but the maintenance people at Le Blanc worked tirelessly to remove it and keep the beach groomed to perfection. There are beautiful cabanas available at an extra fee that have comfortable mattresses and come with a bottle of champagne. Service everywhere in the hotel is phenomenal and the beach is no exception. You are constantly asked by employees if there is anything they can get you or do for you. There are three swimming pools and the main pool has a swim up bar. The other two have bars right at the side. Waiters will bring you lunch or snacks to the pool. Pool attendants place a silver ice bucket for bottled water next to your pool lounges and come by frequently to change out the ice so you always have an ice cold bottle of water handy. A pool attendant came by asking if I would like a cooling mask. She placed slices of chilled cucumber of my eyes covered it with a cool scented washcloth and misted me with cool water. It was so refreshing and a completely unexpected luxury. Pool bartenders mix special drinks you may not have tried and a waitress places them on a pool float and wades around the pool offering them to all guests. And each afternoon the staff comes around the pool with homemade popsicles. The restaurants were lovely with outstanding wait staff. We particularly enjoyed the Italian restaurant and the manager there could not have been more gracious. Food was sophisticated and really great. The International restaurant has an excellent buffet for breakfast and lunch and switches to a more elegant service for dinner. The cook who makes the made to order omelettes there was personable and so friendly each morning. The Asian restaurant was also great. We were less impressed with the French fusion restaurant because the food was extremely trendy but this is a personal preference. Room service is available 24 hours a day and we were delighted with the quality of the food as well as the perfect on time service. Most evenings at this time of the year guests are invited to help release baby green sea turtles into the sea. Le Blanc safeguards 500 turtle eggs from predation in a special beach enclosure and as they hatch they are released each evening after the sea birds have stopped foraging. Normally only 1 out of 100 baby sea turtles survive but this conservation strategy has resulted in a 10 survival rate. It is an experience that you will treasure and is not to be missed. There is so much more to be said about this resorts commitment to absolute excellence in every aspect of your stay but just book your vacation at Le Blanc and I am sure that you will love it as much as we do.", "offset": [1733, 1925], "date": "2015-09-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "285266bd-9a58-44d2-bd92-3cf3044102ba", "sentence": "Best service.

Great but it is NOT. I will start by saying the service and food are outstanding at Le Blanc. We are Palace Premier members at the Presidential level and have been to many of the Palace some now Hard Rock resorts. We nearly always stay in Presidential suites with our two kids at other other Palace properties. There is nothing comparable at Le Blanc. One of our primary gripes about Palace has been that the food is just ok and not on par with the great service and the quality of the accommodations. So we hoped that Le Blanc would embody the best of everything. The good news. the food is REALLY excellent even for a foodie. All the restaurants have beautiful decor design and the service was outstanding. The wine selection is upgraded. The best restaurant at Le Blanc in my opinion is Lumiere with very good French cuisine. The Italian restaurant was second best for dinner. The Asian restaurant was very good and MUCH better and more interesting than asian food in other Palace properties. I would recommend NOT ordering the chefs choice at the Asian restaurant only because the main course selections are very similar it arrived with 4 different dishes but all with essentially the same sauce. In any event the quality of seafood and meats are MUCH better at Le Blanc than other Palace spots and the meals are individually cooked. Overall the service is outstanding better than regular Palace properties. The bad news is that compared to the Presidential Suites at regular acomodations other Palace properties the honeymoon suite at Le Blanc was disappointing not much if any better than a garden variety Jacuzi suite elsewhere. The rooms are small the bathroom is cramped and has an odd open layout and it is a bit rough around the edges. I asked as a member for an upgrade and was quoted a price for a Junior of an additional 90 dollars per day. On Expedia the difference was negligible at around 25 per day. Not sure why they were so stingy. The room was clean but paint touch ups were sloppy the shower door and hardware were at the end of their lifespan the room was nice but not pristine some of the furniture was worn and it was not as luxurious as MANY other rooms I have seen at other Palace properties. This was a disappointment. Although we had an ocean view only the VERY expensive ones have balconies. The property was very clean but the hotel physical plant seems to be in need of a major renovation the pools the decking the gym are well maintained but wear and tear shows. It is a small property which I like very much and the main lobby area and bar are really elegant and open. The Spa is small but excellent. This is a quite place which is nice and the only drawback is that evening activities are relatively limited. So its an AB overall. I have seen MUCH MUCH more luxurious properties in my travels and believe that the Trip Adviser 12 rating is off a bit. If you get a great deal or have Palace credits its definitely worth it. If you are gon na spend 4 5 K for a couple I had look at the Excellence or other more swanky properties.

The most important is the service culture of the resort. You get that same feeling of joy happiness relaxation and kindness as you move effortlessly around the resort due to the well trained and naturally kind people whom work there. The leadership is constantly interacting with guests to make sure everyone is enjoying the sublime experience they want to create.

First of all full disclosure we are Diamond members of Palace Resorts. This gives us a few extras that retail purchasers do not receive. After getting through the gauntlet in the Cancun airport terminal we spent a week of not having to lift a finger. One of the perks of our membership is private transportation to and from the airport. Our driver loaded the bags checked us in to the resort and took our order for drinks to be waiting for us as we walked in the door. This was our second visit to this property the first being in Dec 2013. While completely satisfied with the service and amenities on our first visit the lobby bar and the spa were in need of some TLC. They did a complete refurb of the property last year and it looks great. New electronics in the guest room allow you to use you wristband to enter your room still has a few kinks but overall good job. You can access the internet on the TV and there are multiple showers heads in the wall and rain head in the ceiling. The snack drawer and fridge was restocked daily. There was also a bottle of red wine in the bar that was replaced whenever the holder was empty. The only complaint we had for the room is that soap lotion shampoo etc was not replaced on a regular basis. There is a butler on each floor and he took care of it for us. The food ranged from very good to excellent. If you are looking for a lunch time burger head to Tereza on the 3rd floor. it is a big burger made with beef and lamb. On our our last day we had the pizza and they customized it even tho it was not on the menu. We ate at all the restaurants and the only downside was the refried beans in Blanc. They were runny and cold not what were are used to. The service in all restaurants was excellent but Bela went over and above. Whenever we eat Italian my wife wants calamari and it was not on the menu. The waiter says let me check with the chef comes back and says give us some time and and you will have calamari. Service everywhere was excellent. We were sitting on the patio overlooking the pool I went to get a towel for my wife and they insisted on taking the towel to her. All of the employees seemed to be very happy working there. I asked the driver about that on the return trip. He told us that the company work with them asking where they want to work and what their goals are. He also told us that during the 6 month remodel they assigned them to work at other properties so that they would not lose income. The resort had a really laid back atmosphere and there was no pressure to take tours or by stuff from the gift shop. Got a bit of pressure form the sales guys when we went to the sales presentation. As long time members we were not impressed with the new marketing plan and will probably not got to any more presentations. Would I recommend this property to my friends absolutely. Happy employees create great service which creates happy guests.", "offset": [2364, 2494], "date": "2019-02-07", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "876cbaba-8ae8-4ca8-b5a1-e50d0e33ab3b", "sentence": "A truly amazing stay. Where should we begin. We have visited LeBlanc Spa Resort annually for a number of years and of course the outstanding customer service and family style atmosphere promoted by the wonderful staff here is truly UNIQUE in and of itself hands downAnd having said all of that since the renovation of LeBlanc things have only improved. There have been wonderful improvements to the food and the physical renovations to the property have only enhanced and beautified and already stellar property. The customer Service has remained the absolute BEST and in our opinion paralleled by no other. Everyone was involved in making our 10 day stay like no other but to name a few individuals who made it a truly amazing one there is Leslie who always does everything with in her power to create a professional friendly and truly satisfying environment for all of the LeBlanc guest including us. There is Marco and Juan our wonderful and very attentive butlers who strove always to satisfy our every need. Laura and Lucinda and Mayra are among the hardest working and loving pool assistants. Marco and Elias in the Blanc restaurant made our dining experience along with Isabel and Vanessa enjoyable and with a smile each and every day.

Breathtaking LeBlanc Spa Resort Cancun Celebrated our 10 year Anniversary and Wifes birthday. I will try to make this as short as I can. For those contemplating on making a reservation to LeBlanc Spa Resort I just want to tell you that this place is breathtakingly awe spiringly amazing. What makes it so is not so much the facility although the upgrades from the recent renovation brought the elegance and regalnes of it to another level. What makes LeBlanc Spa Resort breathtakingly awe spiringly amazing are the sincerity courteousnes. genuines in their service phenomenal hospitality of the wonderful staff and the food is just delectable and exceptional. These are some superlatives that describes LeBlanc which makes it consistently the top all inclusive adults only resort in Cancun year in and year out hands down. Do nt just take my word for it need to check it out for yourselves. For honeymooners if you ever decide to have photos taken outside of LeBlanc like the beach or a cenote I highly recommend Ro Del Rio Photograpy based in Playa Del Carmen. Now for Palace Resorts Management and Member services This trip did not start out well. We intended this trip to celebrate our 10 year anniversary with a renewal of vows and to celebrate my wifes birthday. We did five years ago without any issue. Five years ago we did the vow renewal on the beach at LeBlanc and it was complimentary. Five years ago we had a wonderful and memorable time we hired Ro Del Rio Photagraphy one of the photagraphers that were contracted with Palace Resorts at the time. We had amazing photos taken during the ceremony and trash the dress photo session the following morning at the beach and in a couple of cenotes were also stunning. This year on our ten year anniversary we were planning on doing the same thing. We used our Anniversary week to get a considerable discount to be in the Governor Suite. We were even going to pay 10 no longer licensed to take wedding photos for palace resorts for Ro Del Rio Photagraphy take our photos again this year. Two weeks before arriving we received an email from the palace resorts wedding department telling us that the renewal would not be complimentary and we needed to pay 1250. We contended and even pleaded with management with a letter requesting them to waive the fee as it was complimentary five years ago. They refused disregarding that we have been loyal members for 14 years invested considerably amount of money and have visited the Palace resorts every year and at times twice a year and stayed at LeBlanc about 7 times already. We did not feel this was right so we canceled our reservation to the Governor Suite got a refund and booked one of our prepaid week for a royal honeymoon suite. Despite the disappointment from palace resorts wedding department we still love going to LeBlanc we love the staff and the awesome hospitality and we still intended to have a great time celebrating our anniversary and wifes birthday. Our intention when we arrived was to penned a letter explaining our disappointment that we were no longer interested in doing any update presentations or even speak with member services. Basically that we are done with Palace Resorts and just hand the letter to guess services and enjoy our time at the resort. We had 4 more prepaid weeks to use at Leblanc and 3 more regular palace weeks. We were going to used those within the next 3 5 years but to never agree to attend any update presentation again. We were picked up at airport but not how we were accustomed to. We were not picked up by one of the LeBlancs drivers in an Escalade as we were also accustomed to. We were told that those were now only done with flights that arrived between 9am5pm. Guess it was a new palace resorts policy with their airport transfers people. We miss you Ramon. We always requested Ramon to pick us up from and drop us off to the airport or to another resort. We pray that you are doing well in your retirement my friendOnce we arrived at LeBlanc the disappointment faded. As usual we were greeted with the warmest of welcome. We were checked in and since it was 6 am our room was not yet ready. We were offered a courtesy room while we waited for our room. After a nice breakfast seated outside to enjoy the sun and the view we took a stroll around the facility for a quick tour before getting ready to go to the spa to enjoy the hydrotherapy and our first massage of the trip. After a fantastic time we ended our trip at LeBlanc eight days later with all of our expectations exceeded exponentially. After having had the pleasure of speaking with Alex Garza and getting to know him 90 Mexican minutes our stance changed as well as our mind. What a wonderful and inspiring story of grit and determination. We feel blessed to have gotten to know him. We ended up moving to an awesome room secured more LeBlanc weeks for future returns and added privileges in exchange for of course but that is how it goes. Well it turned out that Palace Resorts Wedding Depts decision to not grant our request was truly a blessing. We made an arrangement with Rodrigo the owner of Ro Del Rio Photagraphy to do our renewal of vows to God and to each other at Playa Blanca which is at the northern tip of Cancun. We also did a photo session at Cenote Chikin Ha in Playa Del Carmen. We can not wait to see the pictures. We have so many people to thank and recognize for making our 8 night and 9 day stay at LeBlanc very memorable. Roger our concierge is the best of the best. can not say enough about him. He definitely sets the bar for all the concierges. He took care of us before during and even after our stay. Constantly and consistently going above and beyond for guests.

They did such a awesome jobs decorating our room for Janes special day. Thank you for making us feel special everytime. That goes for every staff at LeBlanc. Butlers Cesar and Mario were also very helpful. Mario has been a fixture for as long as we have been coming to LeBlanc. Always courteous accommodating and hospitable. All of the butlers are just like that. Another fixture of LeBanc is Alfonso or should I say The Fonz. The sports and entertainment guy. Also want to thank two familiar and friendly faces Lucinda and Laura for the amazing job taking care of us at the pool. Luis and Julio for taking good care of us in the cabanas at the beach. Very helpful attentive and certainly work very hard. We want to recognize the excellent waiters in all of our dining experience. Arturo at Zama was excellent gave awesome recommendations with the food and drinks. For our Diamond Dinner at the falapa Felipe and Francisco both did an excellent job serving as well as entertaining us helping us enjoy the free mariachi music from next the neighboring resort note to management. need to build a wall high enough to sound proof excessive noises from the neighboring resort. Special thank you to the manager at Blanc for the special attention he gave us and even coming out to great and welcome us at the falapa. Enrique Santini and Azael Cordero at Bela. Both went above and beyond with their phenominal service. Thank you also to the Bela manager for greeting and welcoming us to Bela. Thank you to waiter Carlos Diaz at Lumiere for the first night dining there. He was superb with his excellent and timely service. Miguel Pot on another night at Lumiere.

Also want to say thank you to the manager at Lumiere for the special attention he gave us both nights we dined there. We also want to thank the staff in the spa our favorite place to visit at LeBlanc. Ana Rodriguez in the Spa for always making Janes birthday celebration a special one by decorating a locker for her with cake balloons flowers and other gifts.

Amazing how she did Janes hair and make up 10 years ago when we did our symbolic wedding then five years ago for our renewal and again this year for our 10th year anniversary. Thanks you also to Alexandra Guadalupe and Maribel for Janes massages. She said felt relaxed and rejuvenated everytime. Thank you to Ana Mier for her friendly welcoming and infectious smile and for ensuring that we had a meeting with Alex for the update presentation. Also because she is related to the person with the coolest name in Quintana Ro Oscar Mier. Thank you LeBlanc Spa Resort for another wonderful vacation. Already booked for 15 nights next year to celebrate my wifes 50th birthday. See you then if not sooner. Note. The staff is always amazing the hospitality and service are always out of this world at LeBlanc. The upgrades during the recent renovation are great but the staff is the main reason we invested and want to keep coming back to LeBlanc However we have higher expectations when it comes to the managers or those in similar positions. We would expect them to have some interactions with guests even to just say hello and welcome. Just like the three managers previously acknowledged they were all excellent.", "offset": [1403, 1490], "date": "2019-04-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "23356c57-7bf5-4e6c-be71-0f7500424c3a", "sentence": "May 2019.

We visited for 25 weeks in June 2019. And just when I thought LeBlanc Cancun could get no better. They took it up another notch. Yes the service of the superior staff is the absolute best in the biz. Yes they still could write novels on how to be treat a customer but now after major renovation the facilities are even more spectacular than before. The lobby is beautiful open and modernized. The glistening marble floors run throughout and each restaurant has been re decorated with gorgeous accents and cozy romantic tables. This trip we stayed in the tried and true romantic ocean front \u201c Royale Honeymoon Suite \u201d. The updates to the room were fantastic. No expense was spared on the unseen but very evident AC and plumbing updates. The rooms were cooler than before with very little humidity in the room and the water temps pressure improvements were evident as well. Not that any of it was less than good before. It just has been stepped up. We were pleasantly pleased to see the massive tubs remained and were still our favorite feature of the room. If you \u2019re looking for a great ambience and unparalleled service LeBlanc Cancun still sets the standard in my opinion. There are always \u201c stand out performances by the staff of LeBlanc \u201d. Truth is all the staff is amazing but there are always a special few that you \u2019l find yourself wanting to hire and carry home with you. For this trip it would be a crime not to at least mention the exceptional service of the following Leonardo in the spa was amazing. He made chocolate covered strawberries just for my wife while she was in the spa. He really attends to details and every want and need of the customer. Manuel did a great job in the salon and was so personable for her mani pedi. The ocean front pool is the place to be. Laura Mauricio Sarahi and Lucinda please come home with me. In all of the world no finer or sweeter people exist. The guys at breakfast are always fabulous Candelaria Manuel Elias Juan Erick Jalisco and chef Isabel. It simply does n\u2019t get better than this crew of affable staff. Marco the manager at breakfast is amazing. He always greeted us with a warm smile and hug. Victor the food and beverage manager is constantly searching for ways to improve an already stellar service. No detail goes unnoticed. If you are lucky enough to get Israel as your butler you \u2019re in for a real treat. You will not find a more knowledgeable guy about the resort and if he can not satisfy your every want and need. well you \u2019re way too \u201c wanty needy \u201d. Seriously he is impeccable. I just referred to him as \u201c El Presidente \u201d. I will not go back without requesting to be on the floor in which he serves. Our favorite restaurant. even after all the renovations and menu changes NO DOUBT the Italian Restaurant. You \u2019l be greeted by the beautiful and delightful Samantha. She is the sister you \u2019ve always wanted. Why sister. Because she always makes you feel like family. Make sure to request Many or Jose to be your waiter. You ca n\u2019t go wrong in picking them. They both have big personalities and make the menu come alive with brilliant meal descriptions. Ricardo who manages the Italian restaurant is fantastic and ensures everyone has a great experience. Chef Rene was constantly wowing us with his culinary creations and specialties. We simply could not resist the temptation to eat there every other night. I could go on and on and on but the simple truth is LeBlanc can not be adequately described. It should be experienced. If you ca n\u2019t fall in love with resort life at LeBlanc you simply were n\u2019t meant to be pampered in this life.", "offset": [262, 410], "date": "2019-09-10", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "a6eee001-47f0-43ea-bbd7-483a79bf898a", "sentence": "The Perfect Holiday. This was our first stay at Le Blanc and we were blown away by the service and attention to detail that they provide. We were celebrating an anniversary and Le Blanc was the perfect choice. Our Butlers Saul and Cesar went out of their way to make sure we were very comfortable from unpacking our luggage to arranging dinners getting medication from a pharmacy to running the perfect bath with rose petals chocolates and champagne. The restaurants were all very good but we especially enjoyed the Italian restaurant. We ate there 3 times with waiter Jaun going out of his way to make sure each meal was served to perfection. Chef Rene received highest accolades as he suggested and made me special dishes to accommodate my food allergies. He would come to the table several times to check to see if all was well. He surprised us with a special meal designed around my food needs for our Anniversary and topped the meal off with a special chocolate flower dessert. The service and attention was over the top and we thank you for making our stay so enjoyable. Anna Maria the receptionist at the restaurant was fabulous too. Kudos to the pool concierge Carlos Laura and Lucinda for always being so attentive and always making us very comfortable. Lucinda your cool face compresses and neck massages were heavenly. Regina in the spa gives a really good massage too. All the staff are so friendly and work very hard to please. The beach is wonderful the water is clean views are spectacular and the pools are warm and inviting. There is some entertainment but not much which was fine for us.
