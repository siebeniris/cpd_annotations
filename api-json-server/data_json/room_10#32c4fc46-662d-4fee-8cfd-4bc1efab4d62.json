The room was always clean. We had a beautiful view of the McDonel ranges which changed colour throughout the day. We did not eat at the restaurant we could not afford to but we were there to visit our nephew and his wife so we ate lunch and dinner out most days. I have a movement disability and the shower was in the bath. I had let the hotel know that Iwould like a toilet raiser if possible and a shower chair but theoy did not seem to have read the comments and even looking at me in the foyer booked me into a room with the shower over the bath with no comment to say they could not provide me with a room that was disability friendly.", "offset": [136, 222], "date": "2015-06-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "4ee2d6ac-1107-438b-bdc4-1992afadc04b", "sentence": "Comfortable.

Stayed 4 nights for work purposes. Hotel looks dated but staff at reception was efficient Room smelled a bit funny but spacious and clean with a comfortable bed and well stocked bathroom. Breakfast was fine but not much variety. I ordered room service and food arrived quickly. Gym was well equipped and pool was nice especially during the hot afternoons. There s also a slightly aggressive peacock roaming around the hotel. Tried calling the Careline service for some help and never had anyone picked up the phone. Spoke to my colleagues and they said the same thing as well. I then tried calling reception after no one answered on the Careline number and again no one answered the phone. And I tried doing this everyday during my stay and never had anyone picked up the phone. I know the phone is working because when I called room service it was answered almost instantly. I walked to reception a couple of times after this and always found reception empty. I waited for about 5 10 minutes before anyone came out to talk to me. Maybe they need a bell on the desk or more staff to answer the phone calls. Check out went smoothly as well. Plus points for having Hanuman restaurant in the foyer great food.
