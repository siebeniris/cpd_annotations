The staff is awesome except the front desk. that was a really disappointing experience. The front desk could not find our reservation even though it was supposed to be guaranteed. The front desk clerk named Manuel said he did not recognize Expedia and asked what kind of company it is. We had a very difficult trip on Delta Airlines and to arrive finally at our destination knowing full well our reservation was paid in full upfront and then to be told they did not have a room for us. Wow that was so disheartening. After some effort finally the reservation was located and we were assigned a room that stank of tobacco smoke. That room smelled so bad that when we got home we had to wash all our clothes and put our luggage outside to air out. The initial experience with the front desk was such a bad one that to my experience this should never have happened. Proper training of this staff person or perhaps the reception desk staff could make the arrival really special and create the total sense of luxury and hospitality. Truly in all my years of travel this was a notably bad experience. In the future I will always call the Hotel in advance to verify that they have my booking correctly recorded. I also used Expedia to book a rental car with Eurocar PUJ that also turned out poorly and after being berated with high pressure sales by that representative we just hired a taxi to drive us to the Resort 40 into Santo Domingo 250 RT The food is awesome high quality and lots of choices. The bars are stocked name brand liquor. Entertainment is awesome. Staff is great. Beach. Right on this gorgeous beach. 30 minutes from PUJ Airport. 25 hour ride to Santo Domingo. The front desk needs to be educated how to create exceptional experiences.

This is the fifth time we have been to Punta Cana and the fourth time to Bavaro Beach area. This beach is one of the better beaches I have been to. Also this is the first time to a Riu. I have seen them many times when shopping for vacation spots and always wanted to try one so finally we booked the Hotel Riu Palace. When we arrived at the airport we endured the mile long lineup which was the worst I have seen. But we made it through and got to our bus. The trip to the hotel was short. 20 minutes. We stopped at 3 other Riu properties in the same complex before arriving at the Palace. Good thing one of the passengers were paying attention because they removed our luggage at the wrong hotel so we had to get off the bus and get the luggage put back on. Something to watch for. We arrived at the Palace and it is a very impressive drive up the lane. Check in was fast and easy. Staff very informative and friendly. Welcome drink and off to the room. The lobby and area were quite lavish and very Palace like. Our room was exactly what we saw in the photos on the travel site. I had heard that the rooms were dated and some folks complaining about musty smells. They are a bit dated in terms of key entrances not card swipe and the art work on the walls is a bit out of date but I have no problem with that. It was clean. big enoughand we were not planning on spending a great deal of time there so it was quite acceptable. The view from the balcony was really nice. We overlooked the centre fountains and walkway between the hotels. The restaurants were quite nice and service was excellent. Tipping is included in the cost but we always left a buck or two and the staff were very appreciative. The buffet was probably one of the best I have seen. There is an outdoor patio section we frequented most times we ate there. It overlooked the main plaza where the evening entertainment starts. The a la carte restaurants were good. Very similar to most hotels I have been to in this area. The food is good but not excelentdid not go to the disco. The property has four or five Riu hotels on it and you can walk the entire property. It is a nice walk if you are into it. There is a shopping area with local vendors and typical tourist goods. Also if you are into running you can run the perimeter circuit on the road and the beach walk way which brings you in a complete circle. It about a 15 km circuit. The pool was busy and getting a chair can be challenging if your not an early riser. The animation team was very good and entertaining. They try to get everyone involved that wants to be. The beach is where I like to spend time. Bavaro beach is beautiful and I enjoy walking it and seeing the sites and other hotels. Water was a bit murky one of the days as the water was churning up a lot of weeds. It was gone by the next day. Take lots of pictures on this beach. We went to the spa for massages. Go worked over pretty good. If you like strong deep tissue massages then this is for you. All in all I was really impressed with the Riu and I would definitely go back or try another one.", "offset": [1489, 1555], "date": "2015-04-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "a6716c79-9bd7-4f16-bfda-acdf64e83653", "sentence": "Worst hotel I have stayed in.

The ceiling fan made a racket whenever it was in use making normal conversation difficult. Mold was visible near the ceiling within the room. It would have been nice if the resort offered nonsmoking rooms to guests who do not smoke. Our first room assignment smelled like an old ash tray.

We request that the drain and hot tub be fixed. Upon arrival back to our room we found the maintenance person who was just about to work on the hot tub as he said he was finished with the shower. We ran the shower will he was working the hot tub and it was not fixed. We asked if he can use the plunger once again as it was still filling up. He did and it cleared. He mentioned the hot tub was fixed and left. We we to the beach and came home hoping to use the hot tub. Again now 2 guys come to fix it and we do now have hot water.

I \u2019ve been hearing that they are doing a lot of changes to the mane lobby. I think the lobby is beautiful and in my eyes really the only thing that might need updating is some furniture and maybe paint. And the same with the rooms just a little maintenance. When we arrived at the hotel there was a little conversation to where to go and get check in. And the reasoning for this was because a wedding party got there just before us. And they had a table set up for them to get checked in. And we did n\u2019t know it was just for them. We asked the guys handing out welcome drinks. And ask him if we go there or front desk and he had no idea. So finally decided to just go to the front desk. Got our room key and safe Key and was told how to get to our room. And that our luggage would be believed shortly. Now time to start our vacation. We noticed that on the sign at the pool it says no saving chairs. But as we found out people did it anyway. Then we found out that if you paid one of the pool boys they will save your chairs for you. By putting a blue towel down. So if you did n\u2019t pay them. You have to get up before 6 am to get your chairs. And a lot of time no one came to those chairs that were saved. And people were left still looking for a spot. Entertainment at the pool was ok. They played the same music every day. And was ever disappointed that they do n\u2019t start any of the pool activity \u2019s till 4 pm by that time most people are starting to go to there rooms and get ready for dinner. Dining was great. Like the idea that you do n\u2019t have to make reservations for the \u00c0 la cart. Just remember they open at 630 so get there early if you \u2019d like to be in for the first sitting.

We had a beautiful and relaxing week at the Riu Palace Punta Cana. The entrance is so grand and breathtaking. The resort and grounds are immaculate and newly renovated this year. The rooms are recently renovated as well with comfortable beds and pillows a nice big bathroom and beautiful balconies overlooking the resort. The food is great. We started every morning at the breakfast buffet with a cooked to order omelette and tons of different varieties of meat cheese fresh fruits and pastries along with amazing coffee mimosas fresh juices etc. The breakfast was the best meal of the day in my opinion. For lunch there is another buffet which on most days had great sushi which we loved eating by the pool. There was also a large variety of other food available at the buffet with seating right by the beach. For dinner we tried some of the a la carte restaurants which Japanese Italian steakhouse and Krystal. They were all good but Krystal is by far the best. I tried the lobster risotto the first night which was awesome and the duck the second night which was also cooked very well. The squash and goat cheese soup is also delicious here. There is also a great polside bq which has burgers and the best jerk chicken I \u2019ve ever had. There are 3 pools but we spent most of our time at the swim up pool which was 99 of the time adults only which was nice. Not too many kids at this resort in general which is also a plus. The beach here is fantastic it \u2019s calm with enough waves to make it fun. The sand is very soft and clean. There was some seaweed the first few days of our stay but it was cleaned after day 3 and it was not enough to be bothersome anyways. The only downside to the beach is lots of vendors trying to sell you things but this is common across the region. There are lots of waiters on the beach to get you drinks while you relax which is nice. On the topic of water activities we also visited the water park which is on the resort and free to visit and it was fun. Entertainment wise the common area has live performers every night from singing to acrobats it \u2019s fun to watch and runs until about 10 pm. We also went to the pool party twice during our stay neon night and the white party which were both a lot of fun with great music and entertainment. If you like to party late into the night there \u2019s also a 24 hour sports bar with pool tables food and good music. There \u2019s also a casino in the complex but it \u2019s not very big with about 5 tables and 10 slots. We found the staff to be some of the friendliest people we \u2019ve encountered and they really went above and beyond after my boyfriend told them it was my birthday. From breakfast to dinner they made me feel extra special and decorated our room with balloons and gifts. It was a nice touch.

Let me start with the good the staff overall work really hard the servers and bartenders are great the housekeepers do an amazing job and the grounds are beautiful. The not so good we booked a suite and specifically stated that we wanted an ocean view suite. At the time of booking the agent said that we could n\u2019t specify ocean at this time but could do so later. Later I emailed the resort and let them know that the booking agent stated that ocean view could be determined later and that I was requesting that. I also emailed to let them know I needed vegan and gluten free food. She replied that room selections were done upon check in. I also stated in the email that I was requesting a room with no stairs as I was traveling with a toddler and the stairs were a safety issue. Her response was that the only rooms with no stairs were handicapped rooms. So here we are at check in and guess what. They do n\u2019t have any ocean view suites. That \u2019s fine we \u2019l take an ocean view junior suite which they had which we LOVED when we toured it which had NO STEPS which was n\u2019t handicapped and they were going to charge us 370 US dollars to switch to a lower category room at the time of check in even though the junior suite was a less expensive room. I have never been more appalled at the lack of good customer service. We ended up keeping the suite and had to watch my daughter as she repeatedly went up and down the steps. It was extremely nerve wracking and dangerous and I \u2019m disgusted that they couldn\u2019t wouldn\u2019t do any better. This was our second time at this resort we came 10 years ago for our honeymoon and chose to come back to commemorate.

We have also stayed at the Riu Palace Bavaro in the same complex and the Republica further west but this hotel is our favourite.

Towels were changed twice a day the mini bar was replenished every day. Riu Palace Punta Cana has a wide variety of dining options including buffets for every meal snacks available in between and 5 themed restaurants. Krystal was our favourite although the dinner buffet was a close second. The buffet offered beef tenderloin one night roast turkey pork tenderloin roast lamb were features other nights.
