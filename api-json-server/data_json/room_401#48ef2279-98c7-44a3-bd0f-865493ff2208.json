Impossible to sleep as all you can hear is the constant noise from the system. It ruins the whole experience of staying in a wild location. The next morning we explained the situation to the front desk and we got a symbolic small refund on the price of the reservation. Although we appreciate the gesture the refund was too little to really show the intention from the management to resolve the matter in a fair way. The right way to handle the problem would have been to give at least a 50 refund which did not happen. The fact is that it is not fair that room 115 is available for booking. This room should never be offered to paying customers. It is absolutely not fair and we suggested the management to remove this room from the available bookings for future customers.
