The Fairfax is a historic hotel and located in beautiful neighborhood with many things to do and see. The room was small and it could have been cleaner. We found hair in the tub the first day we checked in. The sheets were not changed during our five day stay except for the pillowcases. Furthermore the AC kept going out and when the maintenance man was called he hust told us to turn the temp to 60. that did not help. The staff was friendly at the front desk and knowledgeable. They were accommodating as I paid for the wrong day. They allowed us to remain in the same room even though we were supposed to change rooms the last day of our stay. I think that we would have been given a better room if we had not booked with a discount web site. Upon checking the manager had told the front desk clerk that we paid with Expedia and then pointed to the screen gesturing for her to choose something.", "offset": [314, 427], "date": "2016-07-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3675e861-b919-4b67-8a7c-823976840863", "sentence": "Comfortable hotel in excellent location. A very nice hotel with fantastic staff and the area it is in can not be beat. They do not offer room service though which was annoying and the breakfast is very overpriced. it is a very old hotel and though they have updated nicely the heater is insanely loud to the point of waking you out of sound sleep and the windows are not well insulated so the wind was audible. Despite those drawbacks I would stay here again.

Tip my hat to Expedia for adding value here my VIP package gave me free breakfast buffet a free drink at the bar and free WiFi. These really enhanced the stay. What else gorgeous suite on a corner back side nice and quiet loads of space in drawers nicely appointed bath with exhaust fan. What to update the iHome console needs to include a Lightning adapter still uses the 30pin interface usually I travel with one for lesser hotels but I thought that it would not be needed here. CFL bulbs should update to LED desk chair is too high to fit under the drawer of the desk without impacting the arms. Finally do not overlook the hotel restaurant open very late and well above expectations for an in house venue.

The design of the room the spacious of a suite location desk staff very friendly. I felt that housekeeping dropped the ball. Had to ask for more shampoo soap etc. Did not receive water bottles everyday as promised had to ask for more cups for bathroom. I have stayed at much less expensive hotels and these items are always refreshed without asking These items should be replaced each day without requesting them. The cost of renting a movie was ubsurd. Over 230 for each movie rented was outrageous. I did not see that cost listed anywhere and just assumed it would be about 10 for each movie rented. Shame on the hotel for charging that amount.

The renovation is gorgeous and room was comfortable with fridge and great shower. The staff could use some renovation as well. There were a number of missteps which they seemed unconcerned about addressing. We needed to store our luggage since our room was not ready. When we claimed it the bags were handed to us including coats and shopping bags. No offer of assisting us to our room was made and no cart was available. We got up to our room the key did not work. We asked the housekeeper outside the room if she would let us in and showed her our key folio. She said we had to go back downstairs. Rather than taking all of the bags back downstairs I chose to go solo and have the kids stay with the bags in the hallway. When I got to the front desk and told them the key did not work the desk clerk took the keys and gave me new ones without saying anything. The next day we needed towels and shampoo for three of us to shower in the morning. I called with our request. 20 minutes went by and no one showed up. Plan B was to go outside our room and take what we needed off the housekeeping cart. When we checked out no one asked how our stay was thanked us for staying or offered a goodbye please return.
