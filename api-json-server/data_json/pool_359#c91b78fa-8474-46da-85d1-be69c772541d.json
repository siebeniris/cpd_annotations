I would be remiss if I did not dispel some of the negative reviews I read about this hotel. I admit that I was terrified and thought that I had made a huge mistake and was about to embark upon an unsafe situation. When I tell you that the General Mgr provided his personal cell number to accommodate any issues I experienced that was a stellar move. The hotel was beautiful. You can tell that they pride themselves on the recent renovations. Many told us that the area was low class but for the geographic location we felt very safe. The rooms were a nice size and they were clean. Initially my refrigerator was making a noise but maintenance handled the matter expeditiously. The pool and patio area was very relaxing and the restaurant was nice as well. The fountain in the back could be renovated and cleaned with modern furniture for sitting. There was nice patio furniture by the fire pit area. The staff was very nice. I would stay here again and I would recommend this hotel to others. To the person that spoke about the adult detention office near the hotel one would never know that it existed. This was a nice and peaceful trip. All of this is coming from a true hotel snob.

Stayed one night. Tried checking in on a Friday at 2 and was told room was not ready and to come back in a half hour. Came back 45 minutes later 15 minutes before official check in time and still no room. Told them I was told to wait so she found me a room. Tip if you have the mobile ap you can chalk in ahead of us that were standing in line waiting. I wish I had the ap. The room was decent but the beds were really low to the ground. like IKEA platform bed low to the ground. But plenty of pillows and a comfy mattress. Tip. this hotel only has double beds but there is plenty of space for an air mattress if need be. No rolaways allowed in a double double room. The hotel is past its prime. There was a hole in the ceiling near the lobby which was sectioned off with a black convention curtain. The room has been renovated but has some finishing touches that need to be addressed the fan in the bathroom did not work the hole for the outlet was not cut to proper size and the paint job looks. meh. Tip. these did not detract from my good night sleep the carpets look brand new the water pressure was A M A Z I N G and the air worked very well. There are very limited options for food by this hotel the Mexican place we were going to go to closed at 9 and did not want to seat us at 830 Rosas. so we chose Cafe Azul at the hotel. Got there at 845 there was NOBODY in the place but our food took over an hour and 15 minutes to get to us including the chips and salsa we ordered with hour drinks. The kids were starving after a long day at their dance competition so when they did get their food it came in waves. 2 3 plates at a time there were 10 of us. the kids devoured their food. Which is good they did not waste any. Tip find ANYWHERE else to go if you do not have 3 hours to try to get a cheeseburger or quesadilla. Yes. Chicken strips cheeseburger quesadillas took over an hour from the time we ordered them to make. The drinks came fast though. A Shirley temple a quesadilla a kids meal and a glass of wine came to 40. I think I should check my receipts now because they does not add up. Gr we think they made and delivered room service before us which is total crap. Did I mention do not eat there. Mariot if you are reading this I would like my money back for that please and thank you The pool was heated but if you live in Arizona you had think it was winter. Not the hotels fault. Pool was open until 11 but they did not kick us out at 11. Tip. bring a towel as there were none to be found at the pool unles you wanted to use a dirty one from the dirty towel hamper nope. The kids used the hot tub after the pool and were happy. Nice patio too to have a drink on that you bring yourself as there is no service while the kids swim. Cleanliness the room felt cleaner than the hallways but the windows are in desperate need of washing especially since it does not rain much in AZ they clearly have not been cleaned in a while. Tip had a courtyard view of the fountain not a pool Was better than parking lot view Housekeeping came knocking on the door at 830. Tried opening the door. But the latch was on. Then KNOCKED. and when I answered it was oh you are still here insert angry face emoji. Another manager came knocking at 1050. This was ridiculous. Tip. I would not pay more than 100 to stay here again and would only do so under duress. The Hilton is the better option.

They have done some nice updates to the room since I was here last year and made the rooms much nicer. I will say there are still some things that they did n\u2019t update like the windows along the walkways the doors on the exterior and the HVAC and showers in the rooms. Upon check in the customer service rep notified me that I would need to call engineering to have them come into the room to switch out HVAC from heat to AC. I \u2019ve never had that happen in any hotel I \u2019ve stayed at. He ended up having to open up a panel in the bathroom ceiling to switch it from heat to AC. That system MUST be older. That \u2019s a bit frustrating if you like to toggle between heat and AC throughout the day as they would need to continue coming back to adjust it. It \u2019s also pretty loud once it kicks on. There was some sort of a rattle going on. The shower stall also needed some updating. I found that the water tends to pool in the middle and you can clearly see it \u2019s an older tub. One other thing I noticed is that the hallway to our room was a bit uneven by the ice machine so you have to be careful especially if you are unsteady on your feet.
