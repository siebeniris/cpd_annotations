The hotel is nicely designed and the room was quite nice. Very updated and upscale feeling. Great views of the golf course and beyond. The room was very clean and the bed was more comfortable than most hotel beds. While my husband attended his meetings I took advantage of the onsite spa Mokara. It was wonderful. Very clean and nicely appointed. The staff were exceptional and the services were very good. The relaxing room WAS very relaxing. Nice steam room too. That was a definite plus for this hotel. The hotel dining had a bit to be desired. We ordered room service the first night and it was good but a lot of the dinner options are from the in house restaurant Trevi. We did not want Italian again so we did not eat at that restaurant. The Broadway Deli is great for a a sandwich and is open quite late for a snack but not really a dinner option. There was another breakfast style place that closed by noon and a bar but it would have been great to have another dinner choice since we were there for a few days and especially since this hotel is not near much. It is a good 15 minute drive to Celebration where they have pretty much everything. There was only a chain restaurant and a fast food just outside the hotel. We had to drive for everything a good distance so the location is not terrific if you are going to the parks ect. I did use the cart trails thru the golf course for walking and it was beautiful. There are also two nice pools and a tubing river that everyone seemed to be enjoying plus a sandy area with a volleyball court and lounge chairs to just hang out. Great for a reading spot. All in all this is a great hotel but could be better with another dining option or two and the location is not ideal for the typical Orlando tourist spots.", "offset": [1525, 1687], "date": "2015-04-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "9264f532-86e5-4c59-bfdc-67c1a6a632bd", "sentence": "Incredible family resort.

During the summer time when we went the pool closed at 11 pm which allowed you to stay cool day and night. We spent hours here as a family as they had a water slide jacuzis and a lazy river that had entertaining waterfalls fountains and surprise water cannons. The view is amazing no matter which way your room is facing. There are a couple of restaurants located in the hotel for fine dining or just to grab a drink and watch some live sporting events. Also there is a supermarket and some fast food options just down the street from the hotel for some other food options for the family. Hotel is located around 20 min drive south from many of the Orlando amusement parks.

We stayed here for an overnight just to get away for a bit. The hotel itself is rather drab with dijon mustard being the predominant color. it is a place for many conventions so be prepared to be surrounded by huge name tag wearing conventioneers. The front desk personnel at check in were less that pleased to see us for some reason. We did request an early check in when we made the reservation so our arriving somewhere around 1230 pm should not have been a surprise. We were unable to have early check in though as they had no king rooms ready. No matter they said they had text us when the room was ready. They did not. We discovered it ready when we returned to hotel at the usual check in time. Not sure when the room could have been occupied but that was that. Out of 16 floors we were given a 5th floor room. We did request a high floor as we are both light sleepers. The 5th floor was drab as the rest of the hotel and the room was your standard Hampton Inn style. Word of warning the little refrigerator is more a freezer than a refrigerator. Use it only if you want your items frozen. The view was ok. Partial golf course and some of the pool and hot tub area. The key entry is tricky. it is not intuitive nor are the directions on the key card accurate. We had to have a thankfully nearby housekeeper let us into the room and show us how the key worked. Odd mechanism. We could hear other hotel guests. Not sure if they were particularly noisy or if the walls are thin. The service staff here counter service in the little Broadway Deli on the ground floor lower lobby and the staff in Trevis are particularly slow. The staff of the deli are the same for the Morsels coffee shop only open on weekends. Imagine how thrilled we were to see that. We did use one of the hot tubs meant for adults only I believe and the lazy river area of the swimming pool. These were the nicest features of the resort. They compare to Disneys Beach Clubs Storm Along Bay and the Dolphins Grotto. Made for a nice interlude. Would we stay here again. Probably not. We enjoy trying different resorts in the Central Florida area and this one presenting as a luxury or deluxe resort really was not. If you have an excellent room rate 100 per night or so then maybe you will be ok.

The location was great for us and ideal for anyone wanting to visit the nearby attractions as Disney is not more than 10 miles away. We arrived early as we wanted to spend as much time by their incredible pools and to our surprise we were able to check in early and quickly despite the heavy traffic of guests in the hotel that day. The resort had a beach entry pool and Waterside which was very popular with familys especially those with younger kids but we took a liking to their lazy river where we could relax and float about. They also have what I would consider a Miami style formal pool with cabanas staircases along the pool for entry or relaxing and adjacent to this I had a very large hot tub. We enjoyed polside service for drinks and food but there is a polside restaurant for those wanting to sit down for lunch or dinner. These were the highlights of our stay but there is so much to experience such as a large bon fire every night smores kits for purchase and 3 on site dining areas although there are some off site chains right alongside the property.

We arrived late at night after 24 hours of travelling hand over our British Airways Reservation which was fully paid. Only to be told that we did not have a reservation. She looked at us like it was our fault. We were left trying to ring BA whilst stood at Reception. My youngest son started to cry finally the lady came back and said it was an error with their system by which point we were very stressed. When we pulled up to the hotel there were no valet or bell hops available. In the end my husband brought in our own bags and it was only when we were stood trying to sort the room out did someone finally ask if we wanted to have our bags taken to our room. The room itself was nice two queen beds and of a good size. Unfortunately the carpet upon entering the room was badly stained and we only had enough towels for the three of us. On a number of occasions we were only left with enough towels for two and constantly we were left with hardly any toilet roll and twice ran out. It improved after phone calls to Reception. The pools were wonderful they have a new wave pool and family slide pool along with the family pool and lazy river. This is where they are excellent and even though we only used these facilities twice as we were in Disney my boys had a fantastic time. Had to queue for ages for towels on the one day as a woman was holding everyone up. It would have been nice if towels were available to just take as they are in most hotels. Having to queue again to ask for one more towel seemed a waste of time. The staff around the pool who took drinks orders were friendly and prompt and the prices were fair. The coffee shop in the morning does the best pastries at reasonable prices. My son would have eaten their chocolate croissants all day given a chance. The wi fi was great and not limited to a certain number of appliances. Also we were given cards for free drinks each morning I am not sure if this was part of the sorry for the reservation mix up or a perk everyone gets. A big thank you for he sorry cake the kids were very pleased with it. Upon checking out we were presented with a bill for over \u00a3 250 for resort fee something that was not mentioned to us on check in so came as a big surprise. We have stayed in America for the last two years at the Rosen Shingle Creek and never encountered this. I have not had a chance to re check my print out re accommodation but the manager was very pleasant and explained if we could show our resort fee was included he would credit this.
