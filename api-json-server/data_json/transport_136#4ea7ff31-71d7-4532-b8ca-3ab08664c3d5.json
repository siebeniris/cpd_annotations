Appreciated the price point about 72 USD per night via a third party discount website. Free parking was great. Room was a really good size comfortable bed. Separate living area and bedroom. Bathroom was to be expected. While some other reviewers have suggested that the hotel needs updating which I agree with. it was not as bad as I expected. Very comfortable stay. Couch was not comfortable at all. Local dining options abound through all price points. Hotel offers a shuttle to Vienna Metro which runs about every half hour during rush hour only. Last departure back was just after 60 pm. Be forewarned that this is the community shuttle so it covers the back 9 and then some before picking you up or dropping you off. We only took it one day. The directions from the hotel about using the shuttle are incorrect and need to be updated ie the bus will drop you off on the north side of the station and pick you up on the south. It picks you up from the same spot it drops you off. But a free shuttle. Took about 20 minutes to get to the metro during the rush hour be forewarned. About 32 minutes from Vienna Metro to Smithsonian.

This hotel is located in a region with a large number of successful companies including IT companies defense contractors and telecoms providers and from the outside looks the part large building prominent location and prices at the top end of the mid range hotel brands Mariot Hilton etc. It has a lot of amenities including a large lounge area off the main lobby with a bar and a small restaurant where they serve breakfast. It also has a business center fitness room and pool. Overall pretty much what what you might expect. I was disappointed with the charges for incidentals though 3 for a bottle of water provided in my room when many hotels will provide that for free these days room service charges that seemed much higher than normal for this grade of hotel 15 gratuity for a breakfast buffet that might be 10 in a lot of similar hotels. Also I arrived on a Sunday evening after a long drive only to find that the pool is only open for a few hours on a Sunday and closed at 60pm when I had been looking forward to a swim and maybe a soak in the hot tub to unwind. Looking in the hotel information I saw that the pool is only open on other days for relatively limited periods of time too when most hotels I use more typically have the pool open from early morning through to at least 100pm. I also discovered that the wall between my room and the one next to it was paper thin. I could hear conversations that the people next door were having and later that night when they were enjoying each others company so to speak it was so noisy that it kept me awake. The following morning I was woken up by the same people when I think someone jumped onto the bed it slammed into the wall and I actually felt my bed shake. I really do not think the people in the next room were actually being particularly noisy. it was just that the wall was so insubstantial. More what you had expect in a low budget motel than a brand like Hyat. Having made those comments overall the hotel was not terrible just less than I had expected given the location and the star rating. If you are there for work and you need to be close to one of the local companies it is probably a reasonable option but I would shop around and see what else is on offer before making the booking.", "offset": [1976, 2107], "date": "2015-08-12", "cpt": "1", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "7e333c59-311b-40b7-a1b1-fbee783a2af9", "sentence": "Nice but needs improvement for families tourists.

I stayed here two nights on business and had a good stay. The hotel is located in a nice business park area of Fairfax and is close to the mall restaurants and even a couple fast food places McDonalds and Chick Filet just down the street. For the Fairfax area the rates are very reasonable and the self parking is free. I stay in a lot of hotels on business and rate them as I would a similar hotel in its class ie a Hampton Inn could be 5 star against other Hamptons or in this case this Hyat I would rate 3 to 3 12. if they had that designation hence 3 star against other Hyats resorts excluded. The hotel looked modern and upscale from the exterior however once going inside my first impressions where that this hotel needed a facelift ie major refresh. The entrance is a bit strange you actually park and enter from the backside of the hotel. Arriving late at night the first nightI was confused if I was in a legal parking space as there were no space markings only faint diamond shaped markings throughout the parking lot indicating a space. I actually got out of my car and went over to a sign to make sure I was legally parked. No problem though I figured it out and went thru the back entrance to check in. The back and MAIN entrance are not the most convenient for a person with a couple pieces of luggage however and although there is a ramp to the right for wheelchairs and wheeling your luggage up for a main entrance it seemed a bit lacking in convenience even if it was only 3 or four short stairs. There was no Bellman or other staff to open the door for you either. Not that I needed assistance with luggage but there were a couple luggage carts in the hallway which I saw other guests using to self service their luggage to their rooms. This was at 1030pm so maybe there are no bellman at that hour again lacking for a full service Hyat Hotel. Still I did not see any Bellman or Doorman my entire stay at the Main back entrance holding the door for you or offering assistance. Check in was quick and efficient at this late hour and I had a nice room on a high floor with views overlooking the office park area of Fairfax. On the way to my room I thought the hallways seemed a bit dull and drab and the carpet old. My king bedded room was quiet however and the bed was comfortable. The internet was a bit slow at times to downright little to no service but fortunately I had my work hotspot with me. While the room and hotel was good it just had an aged look and feel to it inside. My room had the old fashioned chain link lock which you slide in the door to fit something I have not seen in years as most hotels have a swinging bar type mechanism for easy use. Not a huge deal of course but it does show the lack of updating as with the carpet and curtains in the room which were dull and weathered. I did not use the restaurant or lobby lounge so can not comment on those. And while I did not use the health club down the hall on the first floor I did have a look in ok but not very big even that was a bit strange the fitness center in the middle of the first floor of guest rooms. The indoor pool however did look nice. The area the property resides in is nice however so if you want to walk around the area or take a jog there are tree lined sidewalks to do so. I would stay here again if only for the convenience of location. I did not have a bad stay it just does not seem to be up to the standards of other Hyats business locations.
