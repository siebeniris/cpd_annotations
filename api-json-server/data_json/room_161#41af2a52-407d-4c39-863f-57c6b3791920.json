The restaurants have lost their appeal for me and I found them very average this time but again can not fault the staff in most of them. The Captains table still delivers decent food consistently but sometimes the staff become a bit flustered especially when it gets a tad busy.

I want to like it more than I do. We went here for a week over xmas with my wife and 2 children aged 20 15 on a bed and breakfast basis. Unfortunately my wife was ill I stress nothing to do with the hotel and that tarnished the holiday. I have to say that the hotel itself was nice with little to find real fault. but I am unlikely to go back in a hurry. What I liked. Clean comfortable rooms amenities and really friendly staff. Lots of activities golf tennis watersports horse riding etc. so you could choose to do as much or as little as possible. The beach area was wonderful with the exception of the view out to sea see below and there were always plenty of sun beds available despite I believe the hotel being full. The hotel has a resident nurse who came out very promptly when called and was professional. What was less good 3 main things1. Location. the hotel is some 20 km from Dubai city and sits pretty much in the middle of nowhere between the unfinished 2nd palm and the industrial port. This means the views seawards are not great and there is not much to explore outside the hotel without a meaningful taxi ride even if cab prices are very reasonable2. Food drink prices I could not help but feel that the hotel exploits its captive audience. Whilst food was of good quality with a decent variety you had really struggle to justify prices even for Dubai standards. The standard buffet came in at \u00a3 40 per head without drinks and the seafood restaurant which was average was \u00a3 50 per head. It may be less painful if you have paid for all inclusive up front the premium quoted to upgrade from BB to AI was \u00a3 120 per person per night. This meant that on 4 of 6 evenings we chose to take a 20 40 min each way taxi to the city and eat there. Even adding taxi fares this was substantially cheaper for an equivalent level of dining3. The hotel in my view suffers from a lack of identity and was a bit soulless. I know that one could level the same criticism at Dubai itself and I am not naive enough to think that some of the cultural experiences in other places eg Caribbean is uncontrived. However if you did not know this hotel could have been anywhere and it was all a bit functional and anodyne. That all said I read the above and feel I am being a bit harsh given the good standard of the hotel and the brilliant staff. I also know met people who come here every year and love it. For a week of guaranteed winter sun in a clean comfortable environment you can do a lot worse. just do not expect a cultural or cheap experience.", "offset": [1015, 1181], "date": "2017-01-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "71455d03-fd7e-4b1f-a142-63e8b6a2e373", "sentence": "Great family holiday. Just spent a week here with my husband and 2 small children. it is an older property and perhaps contrasts a little with some of the blingy hotels in other parts of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

This resort is very family friendly and all the staff work so hard to make sure that the children and parents have a good time. Even the other guests who were here without little ones were great with our kids. The concierge staff were very polite and helpful and the restaurant staff were endlessly cheerful and patient with an opinionated 3 year old and a 7 month old just learning to eat. The whole property is kept spotlessly clean and our housekeeper Mahalia was the kindest and most gracious we have ever experienced at any hotel including some of the aforementioned ones. A couple of niggles there is not much storage space for clothes or luggage in the standard rooms so we ended up living out of our suitcases.

We stayed here for a week at the end of January. We timed it well as the weather was fantastic always helps. Our room was a standard garden view. It was very spacious and clean. I have seen some reviews from others complaining about the size of the room but we had no complaints. The cleaning staff were amazing came in twice a day to tidy up do not think I have seen that before in any hotel I have stayed at o Shower was also very hot and powerful so all in all very good. We only had the breakfast package but it was a buffet and can eat to your hearts content. there is loads of choice including a full fry up and was enough to keep you going right through till early evening. Again the service was excellent and the quality of the food very good indeed. Plenty places to sunbathe. Pool areas were sometimes hard to get a lounger if you do not get down early enough but there is plenty on the grassy areas which are nice and quiet. Plenty small restaurants bars near or right by the pool areas too. My only criticism would be the sun loungers. Not very comfy when lying on your front and can not lower the handles either but was a minor discomfort. Price wise the drinks were quite expensive but if you timed it right you can catch happy hour in quite a few different bars around the resort effectively doing happy hour from 5 9pm if you wanted a cheaper drink. there is plenty to do at the resort from golf to water sports we went paddle boarding 100 dirhams per person for an hour but well worth it. The gym was also pretty well equipped. Would definitely stay there again probably look at the all inclusive package next time though so you are not having to watch your spend. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful hotel was clean and the atmosphere very relaxed and comfortable. One last thing. the hotel also lays on buses to the main malls and shooters for free which is very convenient. It does take a bit longer than a taxi due to stopping at a few different malls. I had recommend you download the carem ap same idea as uber as we used it a good few times between each other and got discounts for referrals etc plus can also find promo codes online which bring the cost right down we even got a free ride at the end from the hotel to airport which should have cost 150 dirhams so was well worth searching for.

My advice if you are staying here is to book all inclusive as it could get very pricey if you chose bb. We booked our restaurants 4 weeks prior to arrival. We had a 3 yr old travelling with us and he used the creche on a couple of mornings and loved it and also attended the mini disco on Friday nights 730pm to 830pm. I like the choice of pools and you had a lovely grass area and a beach also onsite. I would love to see a bit more younger kids entertainment or a slide and a couple of waterfalls in the kids pool to keep them entertained and possibly a kids show for an hour each evening so the family can enjoy it together. The staff work very long hours and have a welcoming smile on their face and do their very best to make sure their guests are treated to the highest standard.

Several pools to choose from and of course the sea with the spotless beach and plenty of sunbeds on the beach and grass it is such a relaxing place especially with teh stunning weather we had if you are looking for relaxation this is the spot for you.

Having never travelled to Dubai before we were apprehensive about many things but this was a special trip for my partners 50th Birthday to attend the Grand Prix the hotel was perfect. Tip we were meant to fly into Dubai but due to a major mess up by BA we flew into Abu Dhabi this was easy and the travelling distance to Jebel Ali is pretty much the same as from Dubai Airport we were reliably informed by air crew that Abu Dhabi flights are less crowded and cheaper so do look at flights into Abu Dhabi if staying here. Travelling too and from the Grand Prix Abu Dhabi is about 170 Dubai \u00a3 \u00a3 so not expensive at al do check taxis only have \u00a3 5 on the meter before you get in and you know where you are going you would be amazed how many taxi drivers in Dubai do notThere are always taxis outside the hotel that will be called for you. Jebel Ali is a little out of the way so it is JUNCTION 13 this should help. The Hotel A little out of the way but we liked that and found it was nicer to dip in and out of the craziness that is down town Dubai Abu Dhabi and relax at the hotel. The hotel does have a courtesy bus to Dubai Mall which is insaney busy and HUGE but a taxi is about \u00a3 150 DUBAI \u00a3 \u00a3 30 ish UK if you want to do your own thing. The Hotel is not super posh by Dubai standards but it is immaculate a little dated in decor however clean airy and despite its size has a small friendly feel to it. It was a full capacity when we were there but you would never know. Welcomed by a cold drink and a friendly receptionist our bags were whizzed up to the room whilst we did the paper work and despite not landing until 2 am we were offered fod we declined and went to bed. The roms again not amazingly posh but very clean comfortable fine decor and the bed was great as were the pilows So often you do not sleep in hotel beds. in problem here the mattresses are slightly on the softer side as are pillows but despite having back issues I slept like a baby whilst I was there and no back pain at all. Ample wardrobe and drawer space we asked for more hangers they arrived in minutes Safe Tea and coffee making facilities you can get an iron if you need it hairdryer also fine. There is a flat screen TV and good UK options and films to watch. The room service cleaner was amazing always fresh towels toiletries EXCELLENT cleaning service. turn down service I think he cleaned 2 to 3 times a day and was delightful. I hope the hotel recognise this we were room 125 Tip 2 no need to pack shampoo body wash conditioner or body lotion you get Espa products daily restocked and they are lovely my hubby did not use them but I loved them and felt very pampered. Every time you used one it was replaced fabulous. Food is great we have both gained weight as a result. Breakfast is a buffet lunch we were on the beach at either Captains or the Anchor both lovely slightly diferent Captains has a Caribbean feel serving salads burgers snacks etc. Anchor which is near the infinity pol is a little more of a diner biut both were enjoyed daily with a bottle of wine followed by a snooze at the pool or beach. Again the staff are fabulous. Tip 3 take time to speak to the staf the rewards are massive they are all lovely and mainly from overseas India Kenya The Philippines. They look after you so well but are really grateful to be treated as humans and have people talk to them politely and engage all with fascinating backgrounds and are all genuinely interested in hearing about the UK what you do the cold weather etc. We would not be any other way with people but sadly the money in Dubai appears to make some people arrogant and rude to staff. The pols The one nearest the hotel is quiet clean and with plenty of sunbeds you will find shade or sun all day dependant on where you want to sit. The infinity pool is more crowded or was when we where there as it is on the beach there were rugby teams staying for the 7s who all descended on the infinity pool and probably effected the ambience whilst being great funRobin at the pool bar is FABULOUS and needs a special mention. You can get whatever drink you want at the pool the man never stops working and is so sweet and polite. I hope the hotel realise how good he is. Shooters restaurant is lovely Mexican Steaks etc you get taken in a little bus to eat there as it is a few minutes away in the Shooting Range sports complex. The Italian was fabulous very Masterchefy in presentation and service without being l over the top again the staff are fab as was the food. We did not make it to the sports bar or the other restaurants due to being out at the Grand Prix but apparently the fish restaurant is truly amazing everybody raved about it by the pool. There is a 7th floor cocktail bar with entertainment the band are great and will chat to you and like all the other hotel staff will become friendly quickly chat and make you feel part of the family. I can vouch for the Mojitos Strawberry Daiquiris and Espresso Martinis my hubby can vouch foe the fact the White Russian cocktails have a kick Hic. Again great service great drinks very professional and friendly staff. I can not fault anything about this hotel If you want 6 star with crazy fish tanks and location on the palm downtown not for you if you want to pay over the top for location and Dubai razzmatazz by being central go somewhere else. If you want great food drinks great sleep excellent service nice beach feel like you are at a family hotel well Jebel Ali is perfect all round.

This seems to be the one of the only All Inclusive resorts in Dubai. Although this is not in Dubai around 20 mins awayaparently there are shuttles in although we did nt use them. With prices so high for drinks and food it is a good option cost wise although i was keen to see the quality. Summary Pros. The hotel is clear on what is included on drinks and what is nt. There are good spirits bottled beers and wines etc although if you want the high end stuff it is clear with prices to pay. The food and restaurants were very good. Great quality and good choice. Divaz and La Traviata have lovely atmospheres and food. Interconnecting rooms worked well for us with two children aged 4 and 8. The New year Party was amazing. I have been to some fantastic work parties and other parties over the years but this was right up there. Drinks were flowing freely too freely the entrance lighting set up entertainment and buffet was very high end and included in our stay. Amazing memories so thanks to the hotel for that and the fireworks. We took our children who had an amazing time dancing and being treated like royalty. Golf course was really good well kept and not too pricey bearing in mind buggies clubs etc. i thought the service was good from nice friendly people. I really enjoyed a beer in the sports bar after some time in the gym tennis court etc. CONS I am not sure why All inclusive hotels do nt include mini bars as it just means people break the so called rules and bring drinks back. I would nt mind the paying if it was nt back to extortionate prices such as almost \u00a3 5 for a Snickers bar. let alone a beer. It was nt a big thing but leaves an odd taste. Pools although the beach is good and there are a lot of sunbeds a lot are in gardens. IN the winter there are only about 40 sunbeds in the sun around the main and only real pool for families. Fine you may say but you quickly realise that the only way to secure one is to pay the main guys around the pool to reserve them for you at about 6 am. When i came down 2nd day before breakfast 38 were taken so i ended up having to play the game but overall it needs another pool perhaps by the tennis courts.

We witnessed a few times holiday makers being extremely rude to the staff at the bars and restaurants but the staff remained professional at all times. Our room was not best located as I am a light sleeper so after peservering for a few nights I asked to speak to the manager. Ceyril was amazing met us in person immediately and understood my concerns and arranged within a few hours for us to be moved to a new room. He kept in touch by email which saved us having to keep going back to reception. Once we settled in we all quickly relaxed and enjoyed our stay. Dubai Park Resorts was literally 15 minutes down the road so we made the trip over a couple of times. The kids loved the water park and motiongate but we did n\u2019t get time to see Bollywood unfortunately. The hotel is located out of Dubai but there are free shuttle buses provided to Atlantis the Emirates Mall and Dubai Mall which is really good. The food was average for an all inclusive apart from Shooters which was really good. Steak cooked to perfection. Our little girl 4 is an extremely fussy eater but the restaurant manager went out of his way to ensure she had something to eat even if it was n\u2019t on the menu that night. There was a lovely bar are the top of the hotel with amazing views but unfortunately under 21s were not allowed in. This therefore left families with not a lot of options in the evening. It would have been nice to have a nice bar for families with entertainment for a couple of hours in the evenings.

The drinks are included if all inclusive but think you have to be in a certain room type or staying at the Palm Tree Court for this area to be complimentary. Breakfast in the sports cafe is very pleasant so worth getting the buggy if you fancy a change from the buffet in the mornings. Yes it was hot but expected so the pools are actually cooled so they are refreshing. They have outside air conditioningI can not fault the hotel in anyway. Thank you so much to everyone for making our stay so memorable. We hope to return next year.", "offset": [221, 300], "date": "2018-09-09 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "01107489-ba78-445a-9069-4a7635d8e652", "sentence": "Wonderful Hotel Jebel. We booked our holiday with Travelbag never used them before but would certainly do so again nothing was too much trouble. We flew with Emirates on the Airbus380 which was amazing. so much room and the service was good. Our hotel was about 30 mins from the airport and we booked a private transfer with no problems other than waiting around at the airport for a while. Dubai airport is huge it took about 25 mins to walk to collect our luggage lovely airport though and very well organised and clean. We arrived at the hotel there were drinks and biscuits available and you helped yourself to these while waiting to check in. My only criticism would be there should be a separate checkout desk as you do have to wait a while as they are checking people out as well as in so a good tip is to settle your bill earlier make sure you do n\u2019t have anything else to eat drink before you leave unles you pay for it and you wo n\u2019t wait as long. We paid to upgrade to a better room it was bigger and had a better view. We originally booked half board and upgraded to all inclusive which is a definite must for this hotel we did this with Travelbag in the UK as they charge more when you are there otherwise. The drinks are branded the cocktails are freshly made not those tasteless pre made ones and you can drink as much as you like in the hotel. The food is lovely and plentiful. Lovely buffet breakfast bacon eggs sausages mushrooms hash brown cereal toast fruit cakes you can ask for a latte or cappuccino if you do n\u2019t want the coffee tea they offer you when you are shown to your table. Sometimes you have to wait for a table as it \u2019s busy after 90 but we enjoyed the breakfast every day. Lunch we had next door in the Palm Court hotel restaurant called White Orchid. It \u2019s a buffet lunch and the food is really good quality always a joint of meat roast potatoes and veg. A curry of some sort salad rice other meat dishes amazing desserts sticky toffee pudding crumble marshmallows and hot choc sauce plus lots of other desserts. You do n\u2019t wear a wristband at this hotel you sign every time you have something. We ate in the restaurant most nights and the food was really good always a good choice available and hot. They have themed nights so you get to try different dishes. We ate at Shooters this is a must book direct with the hotel from UK otherwise you wo n\u2019t get a table it is so popular as the food quality and service is so good and again branded drinks as much as you like. The Sports Bar is good you can have a 3 course meal there steaks burgers chips ribs desserts plus lots of others choice of food. Nice change to go there in the evening for a drink and catch up with the sport on TV. We ate in the Italian to celebrate our 30th Anniversary they decorated our table but showed us to the wrong table at first which was a shame but the chef prepared an extra dish for us and the staff were very attentive the food was excellent and plentiful. We travelled to the Atlantis hotel using the hotel shuttle which was nice to see very busy at the hotel with tourists you only see the shops and you can go in the Aquarium which you pay for but that \u2019s all no rooms pool or anything else. You can pay to go to the Waterpark but we did n\u2019t have kids with us so did n\u2019t bother. We went by taxi to JBR only cost about \u00a3 5 and worth seeing. We used the shuttle again to go to the Butata mall and the Dubai Mall to see the fountains and the Burj Khalifa well worth a visit lovely to see. We loved the Jebel Ali beautiful beach lovely warm sea like a bath. Plenty of sun beds towels are free and you can have as many as you want. Nice pool area. Daytime entertainment available and boards show what \u2019s on. Band playing most nights on the 7th floor gets very busy but open until 2 am there is a lady playing the piano most nights near the dining room she is excellent and always looks lovely too. We ca n\u2019t fault the service and the staff here they really look after you and we would definitely holiday here again just wish it was n\u2019t so expensive to get there but it is a lovely hotel not one of the plush ones but you will enjoy it here especially if you are all inclusive you get so much to eat and drink.", "offset": [3724, 3913], "date": "2018-10-14 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "3de5f0a2-a3af-47aa-a9ec-677d5901fad8", "sentence": "5 star service. I have been meaning to write this for absolutely ages but this hotel was perfection. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed with refreshing smoothie type drinks and checked in. Our room was so beautiful with a balcony and a view of the sea. I quickly got changed and wanted to explore. The room provided drinking water so I packed some in my beach bag and off I went to find a pool. There \u2019s not one. There \u2019s three. My favourite was at the one at the bottom by the captains bar restaurant. Such a beautiful place. I stayed for a week and everyday I was swimming there. The staff absolutely make this hotel I would request from my room for a golf buggy to the swimming pool or even the pool and the staff make conversation and are always so helpful. The products on the rooms are Elemis I would use the shower gels in the morning and then they were replaced in the afternoon. I could leave money on the side and it would still be there I had no worry about that. The breakfast options are EXCELLENT. Asian Arab American and good old British breakfast options. I tried a bit of everything. My favourite was probably the omelettes made to order. At breakfast with blue skies you have the choice of eating inside or out they had a Falcon for the guests to look at it would fly off and come back. I found this as a lovely touch. On the third night we came to our room after a day of shopping and a bottle of wine was left in our room I rang down to reception in case the housekeeping team left this and they said this was a complimentary bottle from the hotel. What. That was such a lovely touch. The buffet restaurant here was the only one I tried in the evening and I will be honest I still salivate now when I think of the food. oh my gosh was it so delicious. The Indian food and salads was my favourite. Would I come back. YES. will I go back. YES. Thank you for making my 30th birthday holiday extra special.", "offset": [591, 770], "date": "2019-03-12 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "0ae18301-d76b-42d7-b14a-ad2d8188dfd3", "sentence": "Super Fantastic. My partner and I arrived early in the morning at the hotel from the moment we walked through the door the service from everyone was second to none. Although our room was not ready the portor took our luggage for safe keeping in a store cupboard. We were then given a pass to use all the facilities until our room was available. We stupidly did n\u2019t take our swimming stuff out of the suitcase but that was our own fault. We were given a mobile phone which the hotel rang us on when our room was ready. We booked on an all inclusive basis. And we were not really quite sure what to expect. But wow we were not disappointed. I will explain why later in my review. Our room was spotless a nice size and with everything you would expect. A minibar filled with miniature spirits beers and soft drinks. Good quality toiletries the most luxurious large bath sheet towels and flannels. And dressing gowns that you can request in the correct size. A large wall mounted tv with several English speaking channels. The hairdryer was also the type with several settings. The turn down service is lovely every evening. The all inclusive is one of the best we have ever had. None of the cheap local brands that so often turn out to be undrinkable. We were given premium brands of white rum gin and vodka. Also snacks and ice creams were all well known brands. Whilst writing this I feel I should n\u2019t give such a great review for fear of the hotel becoming so busy we wo n\u2019t be able to rebok. LOL But on a serious note we really could n\u2019t find any faults and believe me we tried. The main restaurant was great for every meal hot plates more food options available than I can mention and for those that love bacon and eggs in the morning they have that as well. Eggs cooked fresh to order. Children are looked after as well with the hotel supplying small knives forks and spoons with children \u2019s plates and bowls. The staff always well presented smiling and happy to do anything to help make sure you have a pleasant meal. Wine is also included by the glass or bottle again a very good list to choose from and great quality. Also included in the all inclusive package every breakfast or dinner we had was a feist. We ate at the Shooters Resturant one evening and the service and steak were fantastic. The pool bar nearest the hotel had a lovely feel about it and again service was really good. Also lovely soft LARGE beach towels which you can exchange whenever you like. The Captains Bar was something else all the staff that work there are smart attentive with a great sense of humour we exchanged many jokes with the guys who work really hard to make sure your every wim is taken care of. The Pitza is cooked in a wood burning Pitza oven fresh to order and tastes Devine as do all the snacks served by these great guys best service you could ever want. Thank you lads for such a great experience. I would also like to express our thanks to Janybek Akanov for his assistance and ask him to pass on our thanks to ALL the staff for making our holiday a wonderful experience. Graham is on his iPad as I write this trying to book our return in September and we really ca n\u2019t wait to be back. Our room 450 was lovely thank you. One other thing I have to mention is the fantastic day trip we arranged with Amar from Seawings located in the reception area of the hotel. He arranged the whole thing including the flight on a Seaplane. If you have the chance book it money well spent and a most memorable day. Thank you and all the staff at Seawings for such a wonderful day.

Rooms are imaculate clean and very comfortable Staff are very helpful and nothing is too much trouble all staff are friendly and you are greeted with a smile.

All staff on the beach were amazing I must mention Martin every morning our \u2018 usual \u2019 sun loungers would have towels on umbrella up and a welcoming smile from Martin anything we needed he would assist with he is an absolute credit to JA resortsFod and drink is everything we have come to expect from the resort. Some of the menus did offer identical choices a little disappointing but that said the food was very tasty.

We stayed for 6 nights at the JA Beach Hotel and we had a lovely stay. We travelled with our 17 month old and we found the hotel very family friendly. We found all the staff great with our son. We paid for a sea view deluxe room and got one on the first floor. We were glad we did as we had a lovely balcony space with sun loungers. The room was lovely and clean with fresh water provided daily. We were half board and food was tasty with lots of choice for breakfast dinner. The hotel was also flexible and we were able to change to lunch on days we were heading into Dubai for dinner. The pools were great with safe baby pools in the shade and we could get sun beds easily at anytime. The hotel is far out but easily accessible with a taxi or by using the complimentary hotel bus service. Top tip use Carem kids like Uber if you have a baby toddler as they come with car seats so great safe for all journeys.

This happened due to no space being available to access the lifts. Finally we found reception staff very helpful and informative. However we found the caddy service between the lake and beach hotel very varied on timings. Finally my biggest disappointment was arriving at the lake view hotel which was your booked accommodation.

Overall we \u2019ve had a great time and enjoyed our stay The rooms are clean modern and tidied everyday to a high standard. First of all if you have a small baby I would ask for a room towards the front our room 319 had a great view looking over the pool and marina however the sea plane is extremely loud we did n\u2019t have a problem with this. but it would definitely wake a little one in the morning. Secondly ALL INCLUSIVE PACKAGE. The all inclusive package is not very well designed and it is unclear what you can have and where etc. Unles you walk around with the sheet that is provided upon check in you are not going to remember the \u201c rules \u201d. For our first 3 days breakfast was fine and we were provided a Diet Coke when we asked for it around 1030 with breakfast I do not drink juice. however on day 4 this suddenly became a problem and apparently I was n\u2019t allowed this. That is fine if that \u2019s true but I should n\u2019t be told different things from different staff members. The resort is so big you need to be given a map on which restaurants are where it \u2019s not very clear. However staff are always happy to help and jump on a buggy when needed. Overall food was good did n\u2019t once have a bad meal. Be careful what you order though we ordered proseco in Vasco de gama on every night and this was included in our all inclusive package but when we ordered proseco from the restaurant apparently it \u2019s not included there. We were not told this and why would it be different. Luckily reception staff took it off our bill in the end. but just be carefulVASCO DE GAMA super chilled vibes in here for cocktails and popcorn. East meets west play here and they \u2019re fab. Such a wide range of music from current chart music to queen to Rod Stewart. Anything. BIG SHOUTOUT to MAK. He made our stay so warm and welcoming and if you are lucky will have a quick boogie with you. He works very hard and your glass is never empty with MAK. We love you. All of the bar staff in here are amazing. WHITE ORCHID this is even more chilled here. Very beautifully presented too. HAZEL AND YANG are the duo here and we can not fault them. We would come back JUST FOR THEM. They take requests and can literally sing anything. Hazel has a bloody fantastic voice and she \u2019s such a beautiful singer. Her business partner. YANG absolutely nails the acoustic guitar and also has a fantastic voice. We absolutely LOVED karaoke with them on a Wednesday in sports cafe. The Itinerary of what is going on which you can access from the tv is incorrect and needs updating as a Brit I love a good schedule so followed it and found ourselves arriving too early for performances. SPA we can not fault this one bit the SPA it was one of the best massages I \u2019ve EVER had and I \u2019ve had my fair share all over the world. The staff are so friendly and smiley andWould do anything for you. Amazing. SWIMMING POOLS there are 3 pools all superClean and all have swim up bars. The pool staff are SO helpful and super kind always checking our chairs are okay and helping with the umbrellas. Our favourite was \u201c P POOL \u201d. right in front of the lobby. Staff here are amazing and the lifeguards never take their eyes off the pool. WATER SPORTS water sports at the beach are included in the all inclusive package between certain times. We tried paddle boarding and kayaking. The staff here are very helpful and funny \u2019. We had a fantastic afternoon trying to paddle board. I did n\u2019t catch his name but the man there was trying to Teach us made our \u201c lesson \u201d a very funny one. Highly recommend. Lastly there are free shuttles to the mall and Atlantis water park which is very helpful.
