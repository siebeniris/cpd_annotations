I ought to say from the start Vegas is not one of my favourite places. We were in Vegas to attend our daughter \u2019s wedding. Last time we were here about 4 years ago we stayed at the Luxor which was perfectly adequate a bit tired but just too far from the centre of the strip. We wanted to stay somewhere more central and the Cosmo came out as one of the best on Tripadvisor so we chose it. When informed we were there for my daughter \u2019s wedding the receptionist apologised that they could not put us close together but we anticipated that as my daughter and fianc\u00e9 had elected to have a balcony and we had not. We were however given a room with a very nice view of the Belagio fountains and Paris \u2019 Eiffel tower and Montgolfier balloon and down the strip. Rooms were of a reasonable size effective aircon queen sized beds 2 in ours nicely equipped bathroom with shower no bath. Etc. The bars like most places on the strip were expensive 6 8 for a small beer. tip. The hotel exists as several towers and it can be a pain getting from one to the other. Eg to the restaurant or swimming pool though you do not have to go through the casino every time as you do in other hotels. We did have to wait overly long for lifts elevators. sometimes \u2026 usually when we were in a hurry. The dinner buffet is 40 but you will be charged 50 if you go as a large group Why. The food is good quality but you would be hard pushed to eat 40 worth. Winewil set you back another 40Swiming pools are well equipped plenty of sun beds and waiters are attentive. Towels are provided. It is a casino \u2026 People are allowed to smoke in the bars and casino not in the rooms and therefore as a European I find it stinks of cigarettes and whatever they use to attempt to mask the smell. But this is the same for all the Casinos in Vegas as far as I know. So I am going to ignore the fact I do n\u2019t like Vegas and mark this hotel on its merits assuming I actually wanted to be there. Reception a bit busy on arrival and leaving but we were dealt with very courteously and efficiently. Hotel spotlessly clean and gives impression of high standards. Bar and restaurant service good and prices normal for the strip. Consierge helpful. Rooms of high standard. Would I recommend it. \u2026. Well if you must stay on the strip and you want a bit of quality then yes. Especially if it is a special occasion etc. If you are not bothered about staying on the strip then see my other review if you want something budget.", "offset": [1620, 1815], "date": "2015-04-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "1230e467-b456-48d3-92ba-e83cc6324d99", "sentence": "Fun gamorous awesome not pretentious.

Gorgeous rooms and best staff I have ever experienced in Vegas. Excellent customer service from arrival to departure. Very helpful and always available. Hotel is noisy with daily pool parties and also from the general public wanting to come and have a peek. Feels like you are staying in a giant jewelry box. Hotel is deceptively large with 2 towers and many amenities. Room looked nice but was also starting to show its age with frayed carpet broken fixtures paint wallpaper peeling. Internet connection included in daily resort fee was adequate but not impressive. Pool area was not as nice as others on the strip. Lack of dining and shopping options. Internet wifi was just ok. Went to Wicked Spoon buffet twice. A few stand out dishes but not par with the other offerings on the strip. Marquee nightclub is a fun elevator ride away. I would like to mention that I received a great online rate from a well known travel site that was too good to pass up. So for value for my spending dollar it was excellent if I had paid full retail rate I would have probably been disappointed. Location general cleanliness decor. japanese soaker tub.

Food not so great. The Cosmopolitan is a great hotel. In my opinion its the trendiest nicest hotel in Vegas. My room on the 45th floor had a direct view of the Aria as well as a portion of the Strip. At night the view gave me a space aged futuristic glimpse into Tomorowland especially since the Aria looks like a space structure. Having been upgraded without charge to a terrace room it was quite an experience to sit on the patio chair at night and to gaze into a symphony of lights. The room itself is terrific as well. The room has a chic modern decor that gives the appearance of being relevant and trendy without being too cold and minimalist. The color choices in the room are comfortable and conservative without being old and boring. I particularly like the layout of the bathroom. The shower is large with a marble seating area. The shower head emits forth a moderately strong stream of water from its rainfall design. The bath tub which is separate from the shower is geared for one. it is deep and comfortable. The bath tub area and the bedroom are separated by a window less opening with a blind that can be rolled down for privacy. It goes without saying that the room was clean and neat. The beds and linens were comfortable. The shampoo conditioner and shower gel were all delightful. I loved my two nights stay here. I had stayed at the Wyn for three nights earlier this year and I much preferred this room to the Wyn. The most amazing part of my vacation at the Cosmopolitan is that I got the room at a nightly rate of 1400 not counting a resort fee of 30 night. it is a deal that can not be beat. Having said these kind words about the Cosmopolitan my thoughts on the food here is rather harsh. The food here is outrageously expensive and terrible. I had breakfast buffet at the Wicked Spoon for 500 a person which included a 15 tip. The food was either cold or lukewarm. It was largely flavorless. Nothing stood out except maybe their excellent gelato. Except I would not ever pay 50 just for gelato. The beef tenderloins were too salty. The Asian portion of the buffet tasted like something you can get in Chinese buffet restaurant in Anytown American. The selections were paltry for the price. The food selections did not look good aesthetically and certainly it did not taste good. it is as if management paid total attention to the rooms and the accommodations and then left the restaurants to senior interns from the Cornell School of Hotel Management. My dinner at China Poblano was equally disappointing. Maybe I should know better than to go to a Mexican Chinese fusion restaurant. I shared 4 tapas dishes with my son. For refreshment he had a Mexican Coke 50. I had a non alcoholic drink that billed itself as Agua Fresca for 50 except it likely came from a can of JuJuMax Mango juice. Our late night dinner came up to a whopping 850 with gratuities. My suggestion Go to the Cosmopolitan. Stay in one of their terrific rooms. Try to get one with a view. it is definitely worth the cost. As for food eat somewhere else until they get their act together.", "offset": [2660, 2701], "date": "2015-12-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "a90bf328-e73e-482c-a975-ad12be7e031a", "sentence": "Luxurious stay in the centre of it all. Studio Terrace in the East Tower. We arrived on the Thursday of Labor day weekend. We checked in late as such there was no wait. Adrian greeted us with a smile we were offered a High Floor Studio Terrace room in the West Tower or a mid level floor Studio Terrace in the East Tower. Both faced north. We were advised that the West Tower was quiet and the East Tower was going to be noisier. We wanted to be closer to the Strip so we decided to stay in the East Tower. Our room overlooked the Boulevard pool the Marquee nightclub a view of Aria to the west PH and Miracle Mile Shops to the east MGM and beyond to the North. We really enjoyed the view and our terrace. Note that should you be in the East Tower facing North on any floor above 20 or so you will overlook the Marquee Day Club where three or four days a week top DJ \u2019s from around the world play from 1 pm to 6 7pm in their outdoor pool area April November. For some this can be troublesome or noisy for others who enjoy EDM this is great. If you \u2019re planning on being out gambling or touring during the day you wo n\u2019t even notice. However if you want a place to nap you may want elect a room facing South or East or elect a room in the West Tower. I doubt the noise would be noticeable above the 30th or so floor but I do n\u2019t know for sure. We enjoyed the music and sat out when the sun hid behind neighboring towers. Otherwise close you door and it should be fine. The room was clean had a spacious bathroom with a separate shower and jetted tub. The seating area had a sectional LCD TV a desk a microwave was available as was hotel minibar fridge with a selection of expensive liquor snacks and drinks. An ice bucket was available with four glasses. Bedroom had a King Bed and LCD TV. The room was well appointed modern some aspects showed wear and tear but nothing was of concern. It was a busy holiday weekend never had to wait too long for an elevator as others had complained. We notice that the Casino and common areas became busier on Friday and Saturday which is to be expected. Some noted drunken young adults this was only around 4 6 when the Marquee Pool was closing it \u2019s no different than other hotels as they offer the same experience in their pool club bars Wyn Aria and others. It was a little annoyance but hey you \u2019re in Vegas it \u2019s to be expected. A wide selection of mid to high range restaurants is on offer. Wicked spoon was great we enjoyed it mid day the buffet was 27 Brunch until 3 pm and 40 some odd dollars there after. We enjoyed it the selection was great it \u2019s in the West Tower on the 3rd floor. The Boulevard Pool in the East tower featured a sloping beach like pool to wade in another pool is also in close proximity and a Jetted pool as well. Polside bar service was available. The Bamboo pool was located in the West Tower with a jetted pool and it \u2019s own bar service it was not as busy as the Boulevard pool. We enjoyed them both. We left the room around 11 am and upon our return around 3 4 for quick stop it was cleaned. Cleanliness and maid service was excellent. We did n\u2019t use any other services. Walking across the strip to the east there \u2019s a Walgren \u2019s where you can pick up liquor and supplies such as water and snacks. There are cheaper food options at the Planet Hollywood across the street. The only complaint I have was the water temperature was temper mental it went from warm to cool for no reason.

My husband and I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for 5 nights a few weeks ago. We had never been to Las Vegas and decided to splurge and book a Terrace Suite. The room categories are fairly confusing but all Terrace Suites have a fountain view which was a priority for us two bathrooms including one with a bubbler bathtubbeautiful large bathroom and great toiletries a kitchen and small living room. around 90sq ft. The hotel is beautiful and modern. The lobby has huge pillars in which digital art is displayed so the look of the lobby changes every few minutes. There is even hip street art in the parking garage. The suite was also decorated beautifully with a huge balcony and sliding glass doors from the bedroom and living room. We really enjoyed the room and the incredible view of the strip. Housekeeping was great though they did come early and would walk into the living room checking to see if we were there so I learned to put out the do not disturb sign. I found the room to be very clean. We visited several other large hotels on the strip Caesars Belagio Rio Treasure Island etc. and I really thought the Cosmopolitan was the nicest. We had a rental car and used complimentary except tip valet parking the whole time. Self park was completely free. My only complaints with the hotel though we had a kitchen in our room full sized stove refrigerator mostly taken up by mini bar but one empty shelf which we used and microwave NOTHING is provided. The trash can is the size of a bathroom trashcan no paper products no silverware or dishes. I am sure they do not want to encourage use of the kitchen but it seemed a bit extreme. AND to get a cup of coffee in the morning you had to ride the elevator down to the main floor walk a mile through the hotel then wait in line for 20 min or more at the Starbucks or Cafe. We had caryout bfast sandwiches at Egslut get there early or be prepared to wait in line for 30min. Excellent egg sandwiches though. China Poblano for a late lunch a mexican and chinese restaurant not fusion they just have both very good if a bit pricey for lunch 100 for two no alcohol and Secret Pizza again call ahead and order a whole pizza then keep that in your fridge for when you are super hungry at an odd timeI was told people wait over an hour in line when they get back late night lol. Very good New York style pizza and a good value compared to the other restaurants onsite. Our first night we ate at the Wicked Spoon the buffet onsite. small plates many exotic choices and excellent quality though there is a wait to get seated and they never came and collected our dishes the whole time we ate we just kept stacking them up Great food overall loved the shrimp and grits. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a modern upscale place and the Terrace Suite if you want to splurge have a little apartment style room with a great view. We went for our anniversary and though it was mentioned at check in there was no other acknowledgement during our stay which was a small disappointment as most other hotels do something to make the stay a bit special.", "offset": [1506, 1597], "date": "2016-12-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "25522e92-6b74-442e-9e8d-77a6e6416415", "sentence": "Great room with a fantastic view.

I stayed at the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas with my husband and son at the beginning of August for 10 days. We were supposed to fly to Las Vegas and then take a ten day tour. When the tour got canceled we decided to stay at The Cosmopolitan and take day trips. When we told our story to the gentleman at check in he upgraded our room to a suite with a balcony and a view of the Belagio fountains which was amazing. The people at the concierge desk were extremely helpful in helping us decide on day tours and booked them for us before we even got there. Every employee we dealt with was friendly gracious and helpful. The entire hotel and casino are gorgeous incredible decor very clean and well maintained. We had a few small problems when we first arrived. They have a very nice system where they give you your room keys when you check in even if your room is not ready. Then they send you a text when your room is ready and the card activated. This would have been great if it worked. We went up to our room when we received the text and our key cards would not work. It took them almost 12 an hour to get security up there to let us in and then sent up new cards. After 8 hours of traveling sitting on the floor in the hallway was not really the way we wanted to start our stay. Once we got into our room the air conditioning was not working correctly. It took two visits from maintenance and a few phone calls to guest services to get it fixed. To their credit the people in guest services could not have been calmer or nicer and I was pretty upset and irate at the time. They gave us a credit to use towards dining at any of their restaurants and called us several times to make sure everything was okay. The food that we ate throughout the hotel was delicious even if it is overpriced. We had breakfast sandwiches at EgSlut that were amazing. The food at Holsteins was also great burgers fries etc. There is a small Secret Pizza place that is tucked away down a hallway that you have to ask someone to help you find that sells slices that are really good and that is coming from a New Yorker. We also had cookies and pastries from Va Bene Cafe that were very tasty. The pool areas were beautiful both are rooftop pools one of which was overlooking the strip. We found the other pool on the 14th floor to be a bit quieter and more family friendly. I also used the fitness center which was clean and pleasant. There were plenty of cardio machines and it was not crowded at all when I was there early in the morning. The only real complaint we have is about the way a problem with the fire alarm system in the entire West End Tower on the second day of our trip was handled. The fire alarm started going off around 7 am. The phones were busy so no one could get through to the desk to ask what was happening. We grabbed our valuables and headed for the stairs with hordes of people all doing the same thing. We were on the 47th floor. I had a badly sprained ankle and walked down all 47 floors. only to find out that it was not really an emergency the alarm was going off accidentally and we did not have to evacuate. No apologies or explanations were given. No security people or management staff were around throughout the entire ordeal. I can not imagine that situation being handled any worse. All in all we did enjoy our stay at The Cosmopolitan. I would recommend it more for couples singles and fun get aways with friends than for families but it was still overall a pleasant stay.", "offset": [1589, 1722], "date": "2016-12-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "b28bfef2-2512-4727-9f1b-8cbb2a10bb4d", "sentence": "Went to the Stephen Marley concert and had a great time.
