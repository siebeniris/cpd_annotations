We were in a spa king room and it was absolutely beautiful. Room was spotless bed linens were the best the bathroom was huge and room service for breakfast was unusually quick and perfect. They even called about a half hour after we ate to see how we enjoyed the breakfast. The staff at the hotel was extremely polite friendly and efficient.

I am not a big player but I did it anyway and tuned to channel 5 for some lessons. Once out of the room we hit the casino floors and spent several hours at the BlackJack tables. I noticed they have a smoke free area of the casino which is a great idea but there are only slots there. Would be great if they could put a table games section too. The next morning I spent some time out at the pool which is beautiful. The staff will provide free towels and there is of course another bar to grab some cool refreshments. There are so many employees who we chatted with that made our visit exceptional. Victoria at the lobby bar Diane at the Rise Kitchen Jesus at the front desk.

He said this is all the manager could do. I then got dressed and went to the desk to speak to the manager. I spoke to Jerome aleyne who was extremely rude and not understanding. He told me that my sound asleep brother and unpacked bags were quote not his problem that he was offering me a solution by offering me a room at 6 am and that i had to pack my bags and wake my brother and have him pack his bags. I then told him that this is not how you should treat guests especially and nice hotel. I stayed in my room and listened to the very loud noise and was not able to sleep. Ruined my stay and the rest of my day. If Jerome is the standard you have set to be a manager and this is the way you treat guests you clearly have a very low standard of hospitality. I will never stay at a hard rock ever again nor will I visit anything to do with hard rock.

I never was offered a beverage by anyone. I also sat waiting for technical service for over 20 min at a slot called Gold Winners which is a spinof of the blazing triple sevens games. First I wanted to lodge a complaint about my comps being rescinded at some time during a substantial absence from the casino over 6 months. Second I had hit 2 rows of blue sevens. Every possible payline 15 of themwas flushed with 7s a natural screen fill win no wilds. Paid back my bet and not a penny more. The croupier had no clue how to calculate 201 the posted payout for each payline on a 040 bet. I tried to explain the identical nature of the payouts by payline but she was insistent that she needed to add each line. I saw that her very progressive employer let her be the level of stupid to which she felt entitled so I followed suit. The wait to get satisfaction was far more costly than the prospective 740 correction. Now before I continue know that I have at times in my life worked as a waiter head waiter sommelier banquet captain and floor manager in some of the finest restaurants in a top national top 5 metro area by population home to the premier post graduate hospitality management program on the planet and aside from Vegas and NYC is the best overall food scene in the US and can boast the most knowledgeable most vibrant and most service conscious market for hotels and restaurants without qualification. I know how this business works at the single proprietorship level and in the world of multinational conglomerates. This smells like a dicey consultancy engagements HR shakeup being either tested or implemented on the floor at this backwater adjacent consumptive outlet of a massive chain of entertainment services supply. So disarmingly personable was this person while simultaneously exhibiting a disinterested and helpless ignorance that was as complete in its scope as it was instantly crushing of my resolve to get the money I was owed that I do not think one could convince me that this service interaction was not the result of concerted hiring and training directives that could only originate in the executive level of corporate administration or consultancy thereto. Put simply no individual on this planet can actually be the level of confidently stupid I witnessed and still reliably shoe themselves for bipedal locomotion in the event the mouth breathing simpleton has advanced that far. Much less can that level of buffoonery be accompanied by the easy smoothly timed almost convivial manner in which this person convinced me that I could not do anything to be made whole which would not also be damaging to my soul or my wallet or more likely both. It was a value call. Lolol. As far as my comps are concerned I will have to talk to someone at player services which is about as enjoyable as waiting for the return money services counter at the most urban of Sam Waltons multicultural retail emporia. I am not looking forward to that one bit. But those oatmeal raisin cookies at Rise Bakery are otherworldly even if I would summarily fire about 70 of the dismal staff and automate their jobs. I still go to the Hard Rock because of those cookies.
