There is no mention of a charge for parking in any marketing materials. There was no gate to monitor your cars coming and going.

We have stayed here at least 25 times and it would be even more times but its so convenient to the airport that sometimes the supply and demand makes the rate prohibitive for our budget.

We have been there several times on Holidays and they have left cards with candy in the room. Even got a Christmas Stocking one year. They have a great shuttle service if you are flying and its less than 10 minutes to the airport which makes it great if you have an early morning flight.

The room was fine if a bit awkward a sink in the bathroom and another in the bedroom with very little counter space for toiletries. There are NO accessible outlets near the bed this is the second decade of the 21st century and THAT is irritating. I had to pull back the nightstand to plug in my cell phone. The elevators were a whole other source of frustration they were incredibly slow and often the buttons did not light up or if they did light would extinguish. The breakfast was fine the parking ample and free and the hotel well kept. However the HUGE crane in the atrium was distracting and we had no notification of that pending work when making the reservations.

During the loud music from the party the window in my room shook loose from the frame and slipped down leaving it crooked and hot air rushing in. The engineer came to fix it by using tape duct to block the edge of the frame and keep the air out. I had to be up at 6 am and the party did not end until after 11. The Manager offered me points to stay another night but the next day when I needed to book a room because the conference committee I was on decided to do an extra day suddenly the points I was given for a free stay was not valid and they were going to charge me double for one more night.

Lobby area is undergoing renovations of the bathrooms. Closed off a lot of the initial walkway upon entering making it uncomfortable to get by or waiting to speak with the front desk. Carpeting in the hallways is dated and clashes with the beautiful tile in the front entrance. Perhaps this is another renovation step later. Interior glass elevators overlooking inside atrium of embassy suites is a design staple that is always enjoyable. But the elevators need a major overhaul. Floor buttons inside and call buttons outside seemed flimsy with the surrounding paneling easy to move when pressing. Floors in the elevators were just bad and looked like they were missing a layer. Parking is 16. They offer free parking for veterans but I still received a 16 parking fee even though I checked in while in uniform and after showing my ID.
