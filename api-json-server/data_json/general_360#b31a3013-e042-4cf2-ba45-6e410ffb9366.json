This is a real city oasis our favorite Chennai hotel by far with discreet efficient service yet radiating an atmosphere of leisure in this otherwise strictly business city. This time we had an early check in really too early and when we saw Devendar waiting at the exit all smiles and genuine warmth we were in gay abandon. After winding the roads of the Shringara Chennai as the city is called we were at the portico of what was once the house of Lady Conemara the estranged wife of Lord Conemara the Governor of Madras who was always found in the company of beautiful lassies at the sight of whom the lady Conemara walked out on him and stayed in this house then known as The Albany. The hotel which is turning 125 years old this year is on a mission to recapture the old world glamour of its past with glossy butler service languid English high teas and vintage car rides. Quite fortunately for me I was with my wife no lassies and no arm candies like the then philanderer governor and hence we had a warm welcome from my friend and accommodation manager Saniz Potaikad with a retinue of beautiful girls at the portico and the check in was all in a dream phase. Actually the Conemara hospitality had taken off as soon as we landed at the airport and were escorted to the hotel. The hotel is charming but not prepossessing. Although the exterior is very attractive enter and you are transported into another era it is been here since 1891 albeit much changed with grand gracious public spaces wide corridors and high ceilinged rooms all tastefully and luxuriously decorated. Book a room that opens onto the delightful lush courtyard where comfortable loungers are arranged around a large sparkling pool the modern suites or heritage ones both stupendous. this is the perfect place to recover after a bout of shopping at next door Spencer Plaza or the many other Chennai options. Facilities are top notch pillow menus comparable with the Lelas and the like staff superb and food delicious a recipe for total comfort. Good large suites and rooms good atmosphere and food. The hotel was getting groomed for the Easter a great ringer of good times no pun intended unleashed a million reasons to smile. The first reason was Vivanta by Taj. My wife and I Immersed ourselves to the unmatched hospitality of the hotel staff many of them familiar and those who were new and unfamiliar lined up showing their affection and warmth in a way peculiar to the Taj Signature hospitality. Our suite 123 \u2013 easy to remember had been bedecked with blowers basil leaves and other paraphernalia for welcoming our deities. Later we would come to know Ms Richa Bhala the house keeper and her assistant Akshaya as also the unparalleled florist Gopi whom I knew for quite a few years whom we were going to meet for the first time had taken pains to ascertain our preferences from the older staff to settle us without any hassles. The lunch was at the Verandah that day and every other day for at least two meals a day including the sumptuous and multi menu breakfast only the Conemara can boast of among the Vivanta Hotels the hospitality love and affection that poured in abundance from the chefs Natarajan Gopi and Rajendran only to be surpassed by the individual attention bestowed by Bhaskaran and Anthony who left no stone unturned to make us feel at home whenever before or after a hectic day we found time to feed our starved stomachs. I would never forget the indulgence of the Chefs Natarajan and Gopi who concocted our daily offerings to deities be it a rice jigery kher or the impossible modak of which the chef Gopi proved to be an expert. At our request on the penultimate night Gopi produced at short notice the nihari mutton smooth and jellified meat melting in the mouth with khameri roti to go with. The Verandah was our usual reclaim though due to our uncertain schedule of work we missed our Raintre soiree but we were privileged to taste the signature varieties of the Raintre at the Verandah like Elaner Payasam a kind of kher with tender coconuts. As we returned late every day after work and busy with our Puja As usual Gopi and Simon took care of our special flowers requirement \u2013 the Verandah was our evening bistro significant for taste variety and tranquility. The quality and quantity of food is good. Restaurant Manager Saravanan and his team \u2013 Bhaskaran and Anthony took special care of us. Gopi the chef was my wifes favorite. He concocted so many dishes as per our choice in a jiffy every time we dined at for the Verandah as also the Pool. Fantastic superbly clean excellent service terrific staff wonderful atmosphere splendid breakfast. A haven of tranquility which we needed during our busy trip. Shopping Tip. the Spencer \u2019s plaza mall around the corner is quite grotty while the newer express avenue is a couple of blocks away. We were unable to find a supermarket in Spencer \u2019s but EA had one. The Spencers however has lots and lots of handicraft shops. Bibliophiles will like Higinbotham \u2019s book shop a short distance up Anna Salai aka Mount Road. Throughout the stay we enjoyed the signature hospitality of the Taj Associates reception to room attendance are very courteous and caring. The hotel was ideally located so you can travel around especially if you are engaged in a business visit you will really love the location had dinner at the Verandah restaurant \u2013 amazing food service provided by the staff was spectacular. Honestly I am flattered with the service WIFI Internet is free but the connections are which kills your core. Restaurant Tip. Visit Raintre restaurant. Delicious food with impeccable service. My wifes comments as soon as we were booked into this hotel for the seventh time were I think this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff could not have been more helpful in any aspect and were very friendly never too busy to stop for a chat to help out. I would easily recommend this hotel to anyone going to Chennai for a break. Mr Ahmar Sidiqui General Manager was courtesy embodied with a flattening smile and showered warmth even in his busy schedule as the hotel was preparing for the Easter Bash. Mr Sanij Potakad was kind enough to book us a special session at the unique spa where we had achieved heavenly bliss at the nimble but strong fingers of Ayang and Zen for a couple spa package. Divine and soothing blissful and relaxing. No comparison. Entering the realm of the Taj Conemara is to enter into a delightfully calm scented world where one feels cosseted soothed and at peace in the midst of hectic central Chennai. Despite the somewhat jarring presence of airport style security on the front steps a necessary evil it seems in light of 261 the welcome feels sanguine and safe and as it did each and every time I entered we were always greeted warmly and gently guided through the security protocol. The warm professionalism of the entire staff from the front desk to trainees cleaners security guards chefs and service staff in all the restaurants was a delight at every turn. It seemed these people were genuinely pleased that we had picked their hotel to stay at and made it their business to make sure we knew it. The breakfast buffet is diverse abundant and delicious room service fast the pool a welcome spot to relax in Nirvana. The hotel environment is terrific with a huge lobby and grand staircase. One thing worth to say is their well trained staffs always provided whatever info we asked for. The staff at the reception though I missed Mr Ashirbad and Ms Joselyn. She had gone back to Goa with a bonny baby a new arrival. God bless her. The bell boys speak good English and they all make you feel at home. We enjoyed our breakfast or meals every time and all the time the staff was always there to give a helping hand and I can see that they want you to be really comfortable. All out to make your stay a memorable one. My wife felt like a queen getting the best attention every time we visited the restaurant. I would like to stay at the Taj Conemara again and again. On the day of checkout since we had an early morning flight to catch Chef Gopi insisted and Saravanan made us accept that they would hand over some takeaways so we would have no problem to start a busy week. No problem Saravanan had got it all ready for even at the early hours we had the takeaways at the reception with freshly made puris and a variety of morning delicacies. Ahmar Sidiqui the GM was there on the second day to join us at the lobby. He is cornucopia of information with regard to many a Taj property in the Taj Group in a few of which he has worked. On the day of checkout when we were being escorted to the waiting car Saniz asked when can we expect you back next. When I replied it would be July next he exclaimed So long. Saniz. You should talk to the Sales Manager about the prices too dear. Conemara you had me ensconced as usual encapsulating the \u2018 memories for another day \u2019.

We asked the concierge for assistance and a wonderful woman named Tamilselvi presented herself and spent a great deal of her time helping us make the Sari perfect. She was very generous with her time and we were touched. After the first event we came back went out for a bit and Tamilselvi surprised us yet again. She hemmed the edges of the sari and pressed it. This is a wonderful person and quite above and beyond the call of duty. Finally we had to prep for the last event of the evening a slightly different wearing of the same Sari. Tamilselvi again came to help I suspect at the end of her shift even and again sorted us out even lending my wife two hair clips from her own hair. This woman is simply amazing and if this is the sort of person that works at the Taj we will make sure we stay at a Taj whenever we can.

I had a bad throat and a very sneezy cold. At breakfast each day the staff at Verandah would see me smile and get me hot water before I could ask for it.

Also a special thank you to the lady at the receptionI did not catch her name unfortunately. who went out of her way to find me a packet of bindis which i needed for my sari.
