We returned to The Cosmopolitan after receiving another generous comp offer through Identity and we are very excited for the stay. We were initially booked into a standard City View room but thankfully were moved in a 2 Queen Terrace at check in. We were placed in the West Tower for this stay and if you are paying top dollar to stay at this property you definitely want a East Tower balcony facing North. We had a view overlooking City Center Monte Carlo but it paled in comparison to the Belagio fountain view we had during the previous stay. Not nearly as glamorous and that is really what you want if you are staying here. Also the 2 Queen layout is not quite a nice as the King layout but when you have 3 in the traveling party you expect to have to make sacrifices. Those are the not the reasons I decided to rate this stay as 4 stars though as that mostly has to do with sheer luck and the realities of our travel party. The reason I did not feel quite as good about the Cosmo this trip was because of a few housekeeping issues and the behavior of other guests. First the room housekeeping issues. As we were staying on a comp I did not address any of these issues with the hotel staff as it is simply not worth the time and I do not want to be the freeloader who complains. The television on the bed side was inoperable and showed another guests name info during our entire stay. Housekeeping did not honor the requests for additional towels shower amenities that were needed as we had 3 in the room and left one of the trash cans full during cleaning. There was also a disgusting room service tray and trash can full of vomit left outside the room across from us when we checked in early Sunday afternoon that was still sitting there when we came back to the room after breakfast Monday morning. that is a simple thing to fix and I am sure there were staff members who walked past it thinking it was not their responsibility to do anything about it. When a property is charging the highest rates in the city that simply is not acceptable. Another housekeeping issue though this one is a little more understandable was that one of the paintings in the hall was covered in lipstick outlines from a presumably drunk guest. The behavior of the other guests was a constant issue during the stay. This trip was night and day compared to our stay last Summer. In August we stayed during an extremely large convention where most of the property was filled with attendees paying a high rate and did not notice any obnoxious or destructive behavior. During this stay rates were much lower and it seemed the property was mostly filled with club goers and revelers. As a result there was regular drug conversation during elevator rides including offers of Cocaine Aderal guests walking through the lobby casino in hotel robes and nothing else still drunk from the previous night and an escort who decided to get things started with her client in the elevator rather than wait to get back to the room. We were also unable to use our balcony for most of our stay as the guests next door were using theirs to smoke a great deal of pot at all hours of the day. Waking up early and enjoying the peace and quiet of the strip from the balcony was one of the highlights of my last stay and that simply was not possible this trip. My wife and I are certainly in the target age demographic for the property but you will never see us stumbling out of Marquee in the morning. We choose to spend our money staying at higher end properties to try and avoid the typical over the top Vegas behavior and rowdiness. If those are the usual guests at Cosmo and we got lucky on our first trip then I guess we will have to hang out with the older crowd staying at Wyn Encore or Palazo instead. that is a shame because we much prefer the design pools restaurants and location of Cosmo. The casino floor was boom or bust as usual. Walk through late night on a weekend and the place is packed. Midday on a Tuesday and hardly any tables are open and no one is playing. We love the casino floor but since they only open the pit with our game when the place is absolutely packed it is difficult to play here. You should not have to plan a specific time in your schedule to lose your money at a property. Restaurants were top notch as usual we made several stops at Holsteins and Secret Pizza during our stay. Overall we would still be thrilled to return to the property on an Identity offer because the first stay was so transcendent. We will not be recommending the property as strongly to friends and family at this point though. it is too hard to tell which of our stays was the true experience one should expect at the property.", "offset": [3817, 3907], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "8b7b2234-5c5b-4977-9b41-172fd96470f5", "sentence": "stunning but not perfect. really enjoyed the cosmo and the rooms casino area bars shopping and restuarants were all stunning and genuinely enjoyed my stay. but it could be better. it is a tad on the exspensive side and it does seem to try and cater to the grey goose war with alot of posers at the pool and bar areas. the staff were 1st class tho and service could nt be better. even the blackjack dealer was educating my novice self on the game which was fun. the fact i was charged for wifi though is my biggest issue in this modern day and age and from someone who works in the comuication industry a hotel of this size luxury and cost should be providing it for free to all their guests.", "offset": [180, 317], "date": "2015-01-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "dfdb6bef-b411-406d-9a57-88485f019b21", "sentence": "Fabulously opulent hotel.

I stayed 5 ngts in Dec 2014 in a Fountain View Studio Rm. By far the best Las Vegas experience I have ever had. This is my 5th trip to Las Vegas but my first time staying at the Cosmopolitan. This place is beautiful and the customer service is the best I have experienced in a Las Vegas hotel. The great experience started with the check in desk clerk who was very warm and welcoming. We arrived prior to check in time and our room was ready. The clerk explained the hotel to us and gave us tickets to Rose Rabbit Lie Supper Club for free. The balcony room was everything I had hoped for. The Fountain View room comes with a beautiful view of the strip and Belagio Fountains. We were on the 38th floor where we could see the snow covered mountain tops back behind the Palms Hotel to our left and more snow on the tops behind the Stratosphere. The temps in Dec were around forties in the evenings sixties during the day. It was so nice to sit out on the balcony all bundled watching the fountains and listening to the sounds of Las Vegas. Our room service breakfast was great for our first morning there. The flat screen TV there are 2 always had greetings Good Morning Good Afternoon etc and your name. Nice touch Cosmo. The pool was turned into a skating rink for the holiday and they have fire pits to enjoy. Some were open to the public and there was also some for rent for your personal group. we made smores with the kits they sold there and enjoyed some hot chocolate and a movie that was showing on the side of the building. Entry is free but there is rental charge for skates. It was fun just to sit by the fire pit cooks some marshmallows and watch the skaters and movie. There was also billiards and other gaming tables to play. A great experience all the way around. This hotel is in a great location on the strip. The monorail stop is across the street at Balys so it is easy to walk over there and take a monorail ride with a purchased ticket to go up and down the strip to enjoy Las Vegas with less walking. Also the Walgrens is right across the street for anything you might want for your room. They are open 24hrs. The Fountain View room is like a condo with a partial kitchen microwave sink dishwasher mini bar that has a small space to freeze a couple items in the bottom section There is NO fridge space. Its home away from home. The Wicked Spoon Buffet was very good. Lots of specialty items especially Asian foods and the desserts are beautiful. Join the Identity Club before you book you will get discounted room rates. Also use the card when you play dine and shop. Treat yourself to room service or charge the buffet to the room you will earn extra points this way and earn money to spend before you go home. Check with the Identity Club desk before you end your trip you may have earned free play and or money to shop. I earned both.

This is my 13th trip to Vegas and had decided to stay at the cosmo as I had never stayed there before and it felt like a lovely casino hotel. Having loved the venetian on my last trip in March I expected it to live up to or exceed the feeling of that hotel as reflected in the priceOn arrival I had to queue at the rather strange 4 queue system which stopped working when queue no 2 was moving faster than the rest of us so took 20 mins to check in and I picked up my keys and as there was no luggage assistance available without a wait I took my case up into the Chelsea tower to my room. I booked the hotel and flight together but it was still an expensive combo as I was staying on my own so when I walked inside the room I was in for a surprise and not a good one. The light fitting as you walked in was broken and behind it a big black mark on the ceiling the frame on the mirror was chipped there were marks on the walls and on the carpet and the desk looked as though it had come from a thrift store. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever had in vegas no bath and hardly any storage for clothes. Then I turned on the tv and that finished it off for me the left side of the screen was damaged pixelated so blue bits across the screen. I was really really tired after the long flight from the UK and now I was really really disappointed. I walked back to reception and shared my view of this luxury hotel room. honestly my sisters room at the monte carlo was a lot better and was told they would find me a new room and would call me within the next hour. So after an hour and no call I phoned down to find out they had another room but I had have to take my own bags as there again was no bell boys available. So the new room a lot bigger than the last one but no more furniture. it was better nothing broken but still not a 5 star hotel room. The rest of the hotel was amazing the gym the best I have ever seen in a hotel and I have seen a lot. the spa where I had my hair done for an evening out was great and the pool and pool bar and restaurant were great along with the lovely bars in the casino. so if it was not for the room I had give this hotel a 5 star review but I can not and would I stay here again. no my expectation for the price is that the standard rooms should still reflect a 200 a night hotel and these do not.

First of all I will say I liked this hotel a lot and would probably stay there again now that I know what to expect going in. it is easy to navigate despite its size was fairly quiet had friendly staff and decent rooms with some amazing rooms if you can pay for them. We were there for a wedding and our families had three rooms two in Chelsea and a fountain view suite in the Boulevard. First let us start with the Pros and Cons. Pros Great friendly staff maids bell desk front desk etc. who actually listen to your neds Easy access to everything because you are at the center of The Strip including the Walgrens across the street which you are going to need if you want to save some money for the slots and tables and not spend it on food and drinks. Wicked Spoon buffet is pricey but worth it Our wedding couples wraparound suite was ridiculously cool. Large clean great views very fun. I found Secret Pizza and it was an expensive delight The Chelsea pool was pretty nice and had more than enough chairs and cabanas. That said we arrived on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday Thanksgiving was a beautiful day. I am not sure if this is why the pool was closed but it was. The pool opened Friday for the weekend and we had a good experience there. Cons. Try explaining to a kid what Egslut means. Basically it is not a good hotel for families with kids even though there were tons of us. The minibar was a great example of this too as the food was right on the bar within kid reach and if you even budge one thing it charges your room because it is pressure activated. Try keeping a kid out of the minibar fridge too. Over expensive. Like everything else on The Strip. Being centrally located helps redeem this a bit though. We stood and waited forever to get into the Wicked Spoon even though the line in short. It was clear they did not have enough staff working for Sunday brunch on a holiday weekend. do not expect free in room or in hotel coffee. They make you overpay for that at the cafes downstairs This one is pretty objective but I did not experience or hear good things about the slot machines my entire stay. In fact I and everyone I was with won more at other hotels than we did at the Cosmo despite playing there the most. Some observations Check in When we arrived we were amazed at the lobby area and the screens. I had never seen anything like it. We had a great bellhop as well who took our 6 bags put them on a trolley and set them aside for us. Check in was a little delayed but that seemed to be because a multitude of flights into Vegas come in around the same time. Once we got up to the front desk we received the typical upsel to a more premium room we had a Terrace Studio in the Chelsea tower which is a mid range room but chose not to in order to stay close to family staying in the same tower three floors away. Once we got up to our room we had to wait around 30 minutes to get our bags from the bell desk. I had to call them twice to tell them that I needed the bags quickly because we had plans and people were waiting on us. When the bellhop came again he was courteous and went above and beyond for us. This seemed to be the theme for the whole trip the staff was amazing despite the hotels small flaws. Rooms. We liked our room a lot particularly the huge shower and bathroom area which included a separate toilet room. The room was pretty nice and spacious and we had a south facing terrace that overlooked the pool and the Aria which blocked our view of pretty much everything else but kept the sun out too. Overall it was about on par with the Hilton Doubletree I had stayed at in Fargo ND less than a week earlier. So not really the five star room I was expecting. You can definitely tell it has been lived in heavily since the hotel opened as the couches carpet and bed were showing signs of wear. If I had to do it all over again I wish our three families had all stayed in the Boulevard tower which seemed much nicer. We got a peak into other rooms being serviced by maid staff and they looked nicer than ours. Also because my sister in law was getting married they had treated themselves to a wraparound suite with fountain views in the Boulevard. It made my room look like something out of a dive hotel. If you can afford that room GET IT. Bedshets Let me first say that the bed was very comfortable but we are convinced that we slept in dirty sheets our first night. They just seemed off. We caught the maid staff the next morning and politely asked them if the could change our sheets when they serviced our room. They said they would and it seemed as if they had when we came back. But when we got in later that night there were crumbs at the foot of the bed from our toddler earlier that day before the maid came. That means the bedding was not changed. We caught them the next day again and told them our issue and they were able to get the sheets changed. Other than that the maid staff was friendly and did a great job on the room. They even took our sons stuffed animal and made it the centerpiece of the bedding which he loved. TLDR. Great hotel but there are aspects that make me question the five star rating. Not extremely kid friendly but it is not a gigantic problem either. Despite the small flaws we had probably stay there again.", "offset": [965, 1095], "date": "2017-11-27", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "d82cf5d9-9759-4978-9220-42b3a416225f", "sentence": "Vegas Baby. The Cosmopolitan is in my opinion one of the most beautiful in Vegas. it is modern sleek clean and simply beautiful. Check in was quick and painless the room was huge and the bathroom was gorgeous. The staff were attentive and friendly. We especially liked Egslut for breakfast and the secret pizza place was a gem. we were so glad we found out about it the pizza was to die forThe pools were really nice we went to the one on the higher level more often than not as it was a little quieter the lower pool has more of a party atmoshere.
