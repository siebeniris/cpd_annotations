I stayed for two nights at this hotel on the back of a 14 night cruise to South Pacific. Even though we arrived early check in was very smooth and my room was ready before midday. I had included this Package with Princess Cruises and had specifically requested a Harbour View Room. I was allocated a 7th floor room which I knew was not particularly high up but I was looking forward to my view. I opened the door and was bitterly disappointed to find a city room view which was basically just a view of a road. I immediately went down to reception to explain my predicament and disappointment. The lady on reception was wonderful very apologetic frantically tapped into her computer trying to find a better room for me. Albeit I ended up paying an extra \u00a3 80 in total for the two nights I was allocated one of the best Harbour View rooms in the hotel with complimentary access to The Lounge. Friday was Australia Day so I had full view of the wonderful fireworks and other celebrations from the comfort of my room. It was amazing. All the staff are fabulous from the Reception Bar Lounge and Room Service. The room itself located on the 32nd Floor was probably no different in size from the 7th floor allocation they were both very nice rooms but nothing exceptional nice bathroom and good shower. Good to facilities and mini bar. Of course it was the Harbour view that made all the difference. I had breakfast room service on both mornings. Beautifully presented and punctual. There is not much to go wrong with fruit and toast so I can not comment on any other menu offerings. I did frequent the Bar Restaurant Mode on Level 1 for my first evening though I only had a drink and bar snack. The venue seemed well frequented. As expected the prices were very much on the high end given the very near location of the hotel with Circular Quay. If I had ventured further away from the area I would have got more value for my money. However I did love my stay at The Four Seasons and would recommend anyone to give it a try.
