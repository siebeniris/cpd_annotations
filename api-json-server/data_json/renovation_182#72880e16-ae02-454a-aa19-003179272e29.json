They offer s sleep number bed which in the room we were in it needed a new one. Very uncomfortable. This facility is in the process of being remodeled and the pool is closed it would have been nice to know before I booked. Hopefully they will be remodeling the rooms as they are a little outdated. We had a problem with our room key not working. They had to replace mine 4 times and I finally gave up and my husbands had to be replaced twice. They told me that I can not keep it by my other cards because it would deactivate it. I explained that it was not by any cards and I kept it separate. It was not an awful place to stay but I do not think i would go back there. And breakfast is not included.

We traveled here for a Wedding and stayed for 2 nights. The Sleep number beds they have are terrible. We did not have a good nights sleep because they were so uncomfortable. Our room was offered as a Suite but it was tiny and only 1 nice Chair to sit in and the other was an office Chair. The whole hotel on the inside needs some upkeep to make it looks nice. I will say that they Staff working were very nice and very helpful. It did concern us that one poor young lady worked in the morning in the Breakfast area and then we saw her doing Room Service deliveries also and then when we left for the Wedding she was working the front desk and when we arrived back late that night she was still working the front desk.

Since this is a new hotel and only 1 review I will be even a little more detailed than usual. It was a Radison years ago then independent and now it is DoubleTree I think since August 2019. The renovation is very nice pool room bathroom shower only in mine bar gym conference rooms common area. The strange thing is the air conditioning vents and panels are still rusted and not fully closed in the hallway and in the room. Some of the window door glasses are still kind of dirty. Stair cases are outside. Housekeeping is the biggest issue I experienced. When I got to my room the toilet seat was down usually they are either closed completely or up. When I flipped it up there was a urine stain on the bottom of the seat toward the front. The toilet paper was not folded like hotels usually do. The tissue paper was already showing blue almost finished. The bag with the hair dryer was dirty. There was also some stains on the sofa. So housekeeping really needs to improve. On the subject of facial tissues it is the cheap kind that falls apart as you use it DoubleTrees should use better quality tissues than that. Service was kind of uneven. I called before arrival to see if they can help me choose a better room. The person who answered the phone said every room is good and did not seem to want to help. Upon arrival the front desk offered me an upgrade me to a suite without me asking because of my Diamond status. Except for that employee who was not very patient or extra friendly I also interacted with her at the hotel every other employee I encountered was nice and want to go the extra mile for guests at their new hotel. The hotel is L shaped. Part of it is right next to the I10 exit ramp. Then there is also the hot Arizona sun to consider. Somehow the Hilton Ap did not show a map of the rooms. The even numbered rooms face inside the L and the pool. I had a room that faces the pool and the noise from people at the pool does travel up. Could not hear the freeway traffic so that is good. Breakfast is kind of fast casual buffet style supposedly the new DoubleTree Made Market concept. Food quality is decent comparable to other DoubleTrees and price is reasonable 1295 adult 5 kids for full buffet. There is also a nice bar in the lobby. No lounge for Diamonds very few DoubleTrees doThe location is kind of out of the way for Phoenix Tempe Scotsdale. There are quite a few stores in strip malls on the other side of I10.", "offset": [223, 327], "date": "2019-08-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "1603226a-315f-4952-abc0-3b490d9c9b0c", "sentence": "Wow high end reno. So clean and new peaceful quiet room 123. No problem with getting cold AC actually we set it too low and had to raise the thermostat. mind you it \u2019s in the 100 \u2019s temperature in Phoenix right now. Always drink bottled water in Arizona tap tastes horrible. no matter where you stay and as a Gold member my husband I were given 2 on arrival along with 2 freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. We requested more in room coffee packets and staff brought it right away to our room. Front desk help were cheerful and seemed to enjoy their job. also same in the restaurant area. Breakfast was good no evidence of pest control guys in the kitchen for our stay. But unlike the one reviewer who did not like spotting him leaving the kitchen area I would of felt reassured that they were doing what is necessary to keep bugs and pests away. Come to my house. I have my kitchen done by pest control too. The decor is high end resort quality. Speakman showerheads non slip shower with heavy glass doors Crabtre Evelyn toiletries plenty of plush white towels high end quartz countertops LED lighted mirrors LED lighting floor lamps wall bedside and table lamps at every area also numerous charging outlets luxury porcelain and vinyl plank marble tiling accents. Great front entrance inside bar area expansive pool area and well equipped gym. I seriously considered canceling my Airport Hilton hotel return reservation just to be able to stay another night at this hotel but unfortunately they do n\u2019t have an Airport shuttle too far from.
