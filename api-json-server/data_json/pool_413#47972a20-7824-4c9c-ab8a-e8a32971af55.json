ROMSAs an Ambassador I am entitled to receive a free room upgrade. Some properties are stingy about the upgrade and this is one of them. I shelled out big bucks for a Club Premier room and was upgraded to the same room but with a angled view of the harbor. The room was clean but small and not very special. I said YOLO and paid for another upgrade and was upgraded to a suite. It was a world of difference. The suite was very spacious and functionally well designed essentially two regular sized rooms with 2 bathrooms and huge windows overlooking the harbor. The decoration and even the amenities in the suite were different Feragamo toiletries it was very high quality. I would highly highly recommend splurging for a suite if staying at this property or else not stay here at all. Wifi is free and fast. SERVICEIt was my first time in HK so I can not compare service with other properties in the region but service was not exceptional. Nothing was amiss but I felt that the staff could be better trained to deliver more welcoming and attentive service. I liked the fact that laundry service was fast returned the same day and not too expensive. PROPERTYThere is a small rooftop pool and a well maintained fitness center with modern equipment. There is no shallow area in the pool for children. CLUB LOUNGEI felt this was the highlight of the hotel. Club lounges at ICs are hit or miss usually miss. The one at Grand Stanford was very special. It is finely decorated with comfortable furniture. It is the most beautiful part of this hotel. Evening cocktails are wonderful here the ambiance of the place is perfect for unwinding. Honestly this is the only club lounge I have been to where I wanted to just hang out and not just because I paid for it. The food and drink selection is very good. Breakfast is included and some items from the restaurant are delivered to the lounge. You can choose to go to the restaurant instead where there is a massive selection and it is included in the lounge access but it is packed with people there. The only downside of the club lounge is that alcoholic drinks are only served until 830FODThe food at this hotel is by far the best that I have seen at any Intercontinental. The room service menu is extensive. There are separate sections for Western East Asian and Indian cuisine. Breakfast here is a must. The buffet selection is vast and has everything one can hope from a Western Asian breakfast plus more.", "offset": [1218, 1315], "date": "2015-02-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f5189a08-07f7-4d85-8d68-457f0383a064", "sentence": "Loved it View Room Service Bar.

My husband was a Platinum Ambassador when we stayed here a couple of times in December 2014 and January 2015 both times in Suite 173 for around 2 3 weeks each time. It is a corner suite with quite good harbour views. This is a really spacious room with walk in robe beautiful large bathroom and a separate living area with a large u shaped lounge. I found this place like a second home very liveable and the bedding and in room amenities VERY comfortable during my stay very fast WiFi too. I am aware that this floor has been renovated so the room is modern and clean I would however like to see it dusted I am quite finicky about dust as I have allergies. The room at the opposite end of the corridor that our friend stayed in has a separate guest toilet but no door separating the bed and lounge with a better view of the harbour but I still prefer 173 for the space and division of rooms. The A C in the hallway is absolutely freezing I would often run down the hall to my room because it gave me the serious chills. My husband has also stayed in the suites on lower floors 10th and he has been happy during his shorter visits. The gym is quite small and the pool is on the rooftop in a wedge shape with very attentive attendants who will bring you fresh ice lemon water and towels. Dry cleaning and laundry service is excellent and very attentive to detail. The hotel is very clean overall from what I saw and the service was really good. The staff remember you if you stay longer and it was nice to be taken care of at breakfast every morning. Breakfast is a full buffet costing additional to the room of course it is substantial for vegans vegetarians with lots of seeds nuts salads fruits and vegetables. I would really love to see a juice bar throughout the Intercon chain. the Hilton in KL has one and I could not have been more grateful. The bar Tiffanys downstairs is really dagy and lurky like somewhere you would find sleazy old guys drinking alone. but I am told this is common here anyway. Location is really convenient not too far from TST East very close to restaurants along the main road and nearby shopping malls. Minute walk to the Avenue of Stars. Overall the hotel has a somewhat dated look about it but most hotels in Hong Kong do unles it is the Pen or Ritz newly built.

Hong Kong has the super luxury hotels that cater for the mega wealthy. But it also has a bunch of 5star hotels that really do have everything you could ask for without ridiculous prices and arguably over the top service. For example do you really need or want to pay for a Rolls Royce to bring you from the airport. Do you really need genuine butler serviceThe IGS is one of these hotels as it has none of these extras. But it is a 250HKD taxi fare from the airport very reasonable. The overall service from the staff at the hotel was faultless could not ask for more. Particularly from our family of four one adult and three children 10 8 7The four of us stayed in one room for four nights. 2 double beds were comfortable enough for four people. Air conditioning was a little draughty and noisy so I turned it off for sleep. However temperature control was excellent in combating the sweltering heat of HK in summertime. Additional positive negative details of the room include International plug adaptor available Old style Apple charger dock on the clock radio so BYO lightning conector All amenities included shaver dryer. etc Chocolates every night 2 X complimentary bottles of water every dayGeting breakfast included with the room rate is advisable as it covers two adults and one child. it is excellent value for a high quality buffet which caters for Western Chinese Japanese and Indian tastes. My children swam every day and made friends with the other children that came to the pool. They did not receive any looks from the staff as they had fun and made some noise. If anything the parents including myself kept a lid on our childrens behaviour to limit the disruption for other adult guests. The fitness centre is well equipped and complements the pool area nicely. I was able to work out and keep an eye on my children while they splashed about. On our departure day we were able to check out late at 140. We then went up to the pool for a couple of hours. Adjacent to the gym pool area are change and shower facilities so we were then able to shower and prepare ourselves for travel in comfort. Excellent for a night flight departure. The location of the hotel is excellent with the closest MTR East Tsim Sha Tsui less then 10 minutes away. We were able to walk to one of the best shopping areas. Harbour CIty and carry our bags back easily. One negative was the in room dining. Service was of course excellent but the food quality was ordinary. Certainly edible but the quality seemed incongruent with the overall high standard of the hotel. One definite positive was the wifi. Fast and accessible everywhere on the property. We were placing video calls from polside. A tip is to join the IHG Rewards Club. Like other programs it costs nothing to join. Members receive free wifi access for the duration of their stay.

Stayed here for a weekend thanks for the nearly expired ambassador weekend Certificate so basically it is Pay 1 to stay 2 which is a good deal for IG in HK. So I checked in around 130 I do nt really care is my room ready or not. which I just wana drop my bag and head out. But the check in process is longer than expected seems like they mix up my booking with some others and they keep asking me do I have any company and I keep telling them I am travel alone. Anyway I finally get my room on 17 F which is the high floor the club floor but like he emphasis many times I am in club floor but I wo nt get any benefit by the club. And if I want to there is 30 discount for that which is 490 day. It could be a good deal if you decide not go out at all and you love booze. But just a reminder you are in a bar area where you get Happy hour easily in few steps. Anyway I got an upgrade with the seaview yea I could see the sea when i come close to the window as it is at the corner so it is a funny angle. The room itself is spacious transitional IG style classy and clean which I manage to get some good sleep. And the best thing I like the hotel is the pool it is not big or with the good view but rooftop. You have to know that if you love the sun as much as I do rooftop is really important as the sun will not get block by the other buildings. So which means if it is sunny you can just go to the top and enjoy the sun and you could find the most friendly staff there compare to the front desk and the Tiffany bar. And again can IHG stop calling me as Mr ng the welcome card and letter keep making mistake for ages. that is kind of rude.

Life is godLocation 55. is excellent IF you want a little less of the fast pace of Hong Kong. It is a bit slower here than in Central Nathan Rd or Causeway Bay. There are no huge shopping areas or attractions. You can actually walk down the street here without playing bumper people. If you want the HK experience a 5 minute walk west will put you in the Mody Nathan area and you can go wild. This area has enough restaurants and bars to keep you going. There are about 20 of them that line the frontage road area with a view of HK island and the daily light show. There are many more in the pedestrian malls that begin across the street.

It was a wonderful way to start each morning especially with a view of the harbor from the dining area. The outdoor rooftop pool is quite nice and was one of the highlights of my daughters time in Hong Kong. Otherwise the experience is exactly what you had expect. Over the top service there is a pillow concierge for example for whatever your heart desires.

Having stayed here a couple of times before I knew what to expect when I booked this hotel to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary and had requested a deluxe harbour view room on a high floor. When we arrived they could only allocate us a room on the 5th floor. When we got to the room there was a bottle of Proseco on ice waiting for us with a note of congratulations from the General Manager which was very nice. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the room was well appointed. The view was superb and if you could not sleep you could just relax and look out of the window. Now I have retired I can afford to do that. There is also a warm outdoor swimming pool on the roof. The downside was that when we returned to the room around midnight we could hardly see out of the window. The problem is more noticeable when the lights are on. I went down to the front desk and was told that there had been some bad weather in the previous days and that the windows would be cleaned the following day. That did not happen so I went back to the front desk again and they kindly moved us to a 12th floor room with clean windows the day after that. We just had to pack and they moved the luggage. If you do not want to pay for a harbour view room you can still get a great view of Hong Kong Island from outside the hotel in Salisbury Road or from any of the local bars and restaurants there. At breakfast time the restaurant offered a choice of Western Chinese and Indian dishes and there were a couple of chefs cooking the eggs to order. The breakfasts were superb and set us up for the day to the extent we seldom wanted another meal until the evening. Tiffanys bar on the ground floor is OK but I personally prefer a bar with carpets which would be more relaxing. On the map the hotel looks a little far away from the centre of TST Nathan Road but it is actually quite an easy stroll. You just walk maybe 200 metres and opposite the Shangri La is an entrance to the East TST MTR. Just go down and you can come out again at TST MTR or up into Nathan Road. The total walk is about 15 minutes. Of course November is not too humid and ideal for a pleasant walk. Hong Kong is a very safe place so you can freely stroll around at any hour. Apart from breakfast we did not eat at the hotel as there were so many other options within walking distance. In case you do not know there is a free shuttle bus K3 from Kowlon station which leaves every few minutes. So when you are arriving at the airport get a ticket to Kowlon Station and then take the shuttle. It is fast efficient and free. From the station it calls at about 3 4 hotels before the Intercontinental and on the way back it just stops at the Shangri La before heading back to the station. It only takes about 15 minutes. On our way home we had a night flight so we checked out lunchtime left our hand luggage at the hotel and took our check in bags to the BA check in at Kowlon station. We then got a train to Hong Kong Island and spent the rest of the day there. We then picked up our hand luggage from the hotel around 8 pm and took the shuttle bus back to Kowlon station and then a train to the airport. It was stress free. We did not have to carry all the bags at one time worry about when to check the bags in by or if our luggage would get to the airport in time for the flight. This was the first time my wife had stayed in this hotel she said that if we are lucky enough to return to Hong Kong she would like to return to the Intercontinental. We loved the view the comfort the location and the service from the staff was first class.
