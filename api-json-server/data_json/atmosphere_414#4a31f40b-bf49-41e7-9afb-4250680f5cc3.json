It actually really bums me out to give this resort only two stars but food is an INTEGRAL part of any vacation and the food was worse than bad. Unfortunately it does not seem like they care either you have already paid for the trip so if you mention your negative experience regarding the food all they do is apologize. Anyone we talked to that had been there longer than 5 days was ready to go home. Also their wi fi is really spotty so do not count on it. Here is a quick recap of our recent experience we went to celebrate my birthday and I will go into detail below if you are interested. FOOD Abysmal. STAFF. Amazing. Very accommodating. RESORT. Slightly dated but clean. SPA. Incredible. do not book in advance they always have specials while you are there. Here are details FOOD Chez Isabele French was flat out gross. Nothing was even remotely French. Their Duck Confit was a grilled duck smothered in BQ sauce. I do not think they know what Duck Confit actually is. Spice Asian was the worst. We sat down and ordered sushi for appetizer. It literally came out in 30 seconds the speed of service only speaks to the fact that none of the food is made fresh and it is all sitting in the back ready to go. The sushi was warm the presentation was so messy and it was just not good. The Nigiri had way too much rice and the rolls looked like I could have made them myself. We did not even stay for the main course and went elsewhere. Lobster House was at least average. It seems like their lobsters are not very good quality hence the reason they have got about 10 different kinds of sauces you can drown them in. Flavor Market Tapas was also average. Just order one of everything and you will find something you like. I think the only thing that I enjoyed was the Patatas Bravas. Toscana Italian was at least GOOD but there were STILL problems. We went to this restaurant for our special anniversary dinner. The Duck Ravioli has way too much ravioli in proportion to filling and it tasted almost stale. The steak was not awful but if I were at a restaurant where I had to pay after the fact I would have easily sent it back. Breakfast at Toscana was pretty bad. Everything is cold and nothing is fresh. The omelette guy was making fresh omelets and if you wanted a two egg omelet instead of three he would take the egg batter that he had already put in the pan and he put it back in the big tub of batter to use again. Seems like he was not aware that customers were watching him with a grossed out look. All the BQs and specials they had throughout our stay were below average. Drinks were super strong. My husband and I cook about six meals a week at home and we could have EASILY taught the chefs some things. It really makes me wonder if the owner ever tried the food he was serving and if he did did he think to himself that it tastes good and that is what he should serve his customers. do not get me started on desserts not ONE good dessert at ANY restaurant. Not sure why all inclusive resorts always seem to fail on desserts. STAFF. Everyone is incredibly nice and goes out of their way to accommodate you. They are so energetic which I find amazing given that it seems like they work practically 24 hours. RESORT. The rooms are slightly dated BUT overall really great. Everything is nice and clean and we got a great deal on an upgrade when we arrived. Love the turndown service with the chocolates. Pool is great and water temperature is perfect. Grounds are well kept so no complaints there. I love how everyday they have fun activities going on eg water bingo kayak race pineapple toss etc. I remember reading a lot about bugs before we went on our trip I have to say we did not encounter that problem at ALL except when we went horseback riding on the beach there were definitely sandfleas. But if you are on resort grounds you should not have any problems with bugs mosquitoes. SPA. This was one experience that we really enjoyed. We almost booked in advance at 160 per person for a 80 minute massage. When we got there there was a special for 120 per person and the next day they had a special for 100 per person. SO glad we got the last deal. They have a new spa special everyday. You get 50 minutes of hydrotherapy included in your massage which is awesome. They do a hot and cold bath sauna steam room jacuzi etc. The spa is really fantastic. 80 minutes FLIES byOveral there is no way we would come back here. If we came back to Punta Cana we would stay at the Four Seasons and pay separately for food.", "offset": [173, 348], "date": "2015-06-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e5439593-05a1-486d-a931-6ac892fff108", "sentence": "Excellent.

We just got back from a weeks vacation at EPC. The grounds were very nice. We had a nice room in Building 8 but it was a little smaller than some of the other resorts that we have been to. The food was pretty good but did not like the Lobster House The Grille and the Mexican Restaurant. The French was our favorite and we liked the Asian and Italian restaurants as well. The entertainment was OK. We were very disappointed with the beach. There was a lot of seaweed on the beach and in the water. We did not see them cleaning it up until the end of our week and it stank. They took much better care of the Excellence area of the beach. Also the sand was not the same white powdery sand that is on Bavaro Beach and they do not do much cleaning up of the beach other than the seaweed. I know that there has been a big problem this year with seaweed in the Caribean but other resorts did a better job of cleaning it up than they did here. I did not see anyone in the water the entire week because of the seaweed. I knew there were pretty large waves here but that did not bother me since we are used to the waves from the Jersey and Maryland beaches. I read in other reviews that the service was excellent but we did not feel that it was up to par with other resorts that we have been to. The pool was nice and the last day of our vacation they got new floaties and they had a lot more than they had before. We also did not have any problems with mosquitos at all which other travelers before us experienced. I also did not like the layout of the resort. The shops spa sports bar and disco were far away from the other amenities. They also did not have a coffee shop which would have been fine if they offered you coffee after your dinner which they did not. They also did not have any specialty coffee available either. We were to the Excellence Riviera Cancun in May of this year and we liked that resort so much better. That is the reason we decided to try EPC but we will not be back here again.

We are here at the moment so this is a live review. Let us start with the good things. all the front of house staff work very hard and can not do enough for you. English may not be there first language but come on people try a little Spanish or use the translator on your phone the gardens been as this is a mature hotel are well looked after by an enthusiastic garden staff. Drink quality is excellent and contrary to what people have said is not watered down and all the bar staff are very knowledgable. There is also ample towel service around the beach and the pools. Now the bad points the building is coming to the end of its life. And everything is dated and worn but still well maintained. This goes for all the room fittings and bathroms all soft furnishings in the hotel are showing their age and all the place settings in the restaurants are antiquated. Possibly the worst thing about this hotel is the food. The only thing that seems to be consistent is that it is all over cooked and inedible some nights we are still here for several more nights so we will do a full review restaurant by restaurant on our return. Be very aware about the beach there is something biting you on it. My wife has over 200 bites and I am also covered but not quite as bad.

My boyfriend and I recently traveled to the Excellence Punta Cana for a quick weekend getaway. As experience and frequent travelers while we were not blown away by this hotel I certainly would not say it was the worst experience of our life. The hotel itself is closing July November for a full gut renovation so I think that it explains some of the aspects of the property that seem a bit tired. AIRPORT70 private taxi roughly 45 minutes away. Very easy to arrange transport when you land if you do not want to pre pay to make arrangements. ROOMS. We upgraded to an ocean view not sure it was fully worth it. The hotel itself is only 3levels so the view is fairly obstructed by palm trees regardless of where you are. The room itself was spotless and was serviced 2 3x a day. No complaints there. Great water pressure in the shower. The bed and pillows are a bit firm but we have stayed in another Excellence property in Mexico and felt the same way. BEACH POOL. Large stretch of beach. yes it was a bit wavy in the ocean but if you walked a little further to the left 20 30 yards there seemed to be a calm patch. Great stretches for walking far in both directions which I always enjoy. Pool was shallow and enjoyable for floating and cooling off. The swim up bar was tucked away in a bit of an odd shady location but that was not important to us since we prefer the beach anyway. FOOD DRINKS. Mediocre at best. I have been to many all inclusives and while the food was edible and we did not get sick I would not say I was impressed or even excited by any thing that I ate. It all did the trick but I would not rave about the flavors or presentation. Breakfast had good variety at the buffet lunch options felt a little lacking and dinner tried but just was not there. Everyone raved about the French restaurant which I found to be a very confusing re occuring comment the food was bland and cold. The tapas restaurant was my favorite since we were able to snack try several things. Drinks were plentiful and very accessible. STAFF. All very nice and friendly. I would not say that the service on the beach was super frequent but then again the bars were very close and easy enough to go to ourselves. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful in allowing us a courtesy room to shower and change in before our evening flight just ask about this and arrange in the morningOVERAL I would give this hotel another try after the renovation but currently would rank this hotel at a 35. We are fairly easy going and just like to relax and be away but I would say that food is very important to us and this could potentially be a deal breaker for the brand if we tried the hotel again and it did not improve.", "offset": [117, 263], "date": "2017-05-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "4c18bc5d-0946-4ee1-9349-74b5b4eebb78", "sentence": "There is much that is Excellent about this resort. My wife and I just finished a 5 night stay at this resort. Congratulations to the staff friendly eager to please fun efficient. The resort runs parallel to the beach so there is never a long walk from room to pools and then to the ocean. There is ample seating at the pools and the beach. We ate only one meal breakfast at the large buffet restaurant preferring the small venues instead. Nevertheless the food there was well prepared and maintained. We enjoyed the Lobster House Chez Isabele Oregano and the Mexican restaurant in the context of such a large hotel it was a pleasure to have a la carte dining in a small quiet setting. Unfortunate though that you can not make reservations the French restaurant was nearly always oversubscribed. The resort is very well maintained quite clean. The room junior suite swim out was large and included double sinks in the bathroom. However it was plain and had generic inexpensive looking dressers and closets. To improve functionality please consider adding hooks in the bathroom and bedroom. You can never have enough hooks. Also the placement of the full length mirror led to a badly bruised and bloody stubbed toe in the middle of the night. The vibe at the hotel is adult and generally quiet. This is not the place to go if you enjoy the party all day atmosphere. WiFi is excellent.

Definitely not at Sandals level yet. We stayed for a week with the Excellence upgrade. The bad Food was ok. We went to the Magna three times 1 was great. 2nd time the waiter got my order wrong but still looked for a tip when we left 3 time took an hour to get food and mine was partially raw. Tried to explain to the waiter the problem but he did not understand me so I gave up. Lobster house overcooked my food. At the pizza restaurant we each ordered a pizza and they were completely different one was thin crust the other came super thick crustWhile they say tipping is optional it really is not. If you do not tip service level drops to about zero. While the beach is beautiful the service is mediocre at best. We ended up going to the bar for our own drinks. When they did come around and ask it took an hour for them to return. And that was with tipping. When we arrived we spent about an hour in their Excellence room viewing the warm weather in ice cold air conditioning from a window imagining what it would be like to eat something after our 12 hours of travelling. Our concierge kept leaving the room to do other things for 5 10 minutes at a time. We were not impressed. Rooms are damp just like the other reviewers stated. My passport actually warped from the moisture and would not scan at the airport. it is that bad. Rooms are very intimate and do not have exhaust fans in the bathroom for when you need it if you know what I mean. As with all inclusive resorts alcohol is free which results in people drinking more than they can handle. If you \u2019re 30 and getting drunk every day night you have a problem and should seek help. For the most part most of the hard core drunks were on the non excellence side. The smoking area is upwind of the theatre so you get to enjoy their cigar and cigarette smoke while watching the shows. Waiters are always pushing their wine list which you pay for and give you attitude when you do not buy the fact we do not drink wine did not seem possible to themThe souvenir shops are a rip off and the service is bad. Go to the shop just beside the beach property line. The good The grounds are immaculate. Beach was always clean. The staff is excellent. Never had a problem with them other than the concierge. Room service was fast and food was godThe shows were great. The performers really put 110 into their work. The audio however was always turned up to 10 and distorted. For the Michael Jackson show it was next to impossible to understand the words due to the distortion. Would we go again. Maybe. it is 12 the price of a Sandals vacation so the price is right but if you are looking to come here for quiet honeymoon anniversary etc then you might want to spend a bit more for a better place.

I seriously could n\u2019t eat many meals that bad. The sushi was bizare the rice was an odd consistency. The meats were all gross. The pizza dough was raw the 3 times we ordered it. We ordered cheese quesadilla with grilled peppers for lunch on the beach and received two 4 inch tortillas folded over with mozzarella cheese and microwaved in the oven. No peppers no salsa any not even enough food for an appetizer let alone a lunch. I ordered a mimosa and received white wine with OJ. The list goes on. Our room had a horrible odor that smelled as if you walked into an abandoned house where 100 cats were living and urinating all over the carpets. Must be mildew and mold from the Hurricane. I could n\u2019t handle or get over it. Only room they could move us to the first night was a room with no AC so we stuck it out and moved the next day. The next room still smelled bad but slightly better than the first. Oh and the first room had water coming down out of the ceiling from the room above when I let the front desk know they did nothing.

My husband and I stayed at Excellence Punta Cana for our honeymoon. We were originally very concerned with flying to a different country for the first time especially being a gay couple. The moment we arrive to the resort we were greeted with smiles and felt completely safe. There was not a single employee that did not say hello and ask how we were doing whenever they saw us throughout the entire trip. We had amazing servers and bartenders each day. Names that we will always remember are Dany Joendry Joel and Omar. All these guys went above and beyond to make sure we had fun. All the other staff made our experience amazing but these guys will be ones we look for every year when we return. Our room was beautiful. We had a junior suite with plunge pool. When we walked in on the first day there was a beautiful heart made from a pillow on the bed and rose pedals all over the bed. Every part of the room was breath taking and truly amazing. Our mini bar was restocked daily and if we need something more all we had to do was call and it was brought to us in no time at all. Housekeeping came to clean the room at least once a day but would come for an extra cleaning if you requested just by tapping a button next to the do not disturb button on the AC box. The overall trip was something that we will always remember. We walked into paradise and it will be hard to stay anywhere else. My husband and I decided that we will always try and come to this resort for our anniversary each year. I do not think any other resort could compare to Excellence Punta Cana.

We stayed at Excelece Punta Cana late August to early September from the moment we arrived all efforts from the staff were directed to making sure our stay was stress free and the best experience a 5 star hotel can offer for the duration of your stay. At this point I have to mention the reception staff Reynaldo David and Carmen. What a great team. David in particular which we initially dealt with on our booking in and welcoming procedure. I assure you that any problems questions or inquiries that you might have will be dealt with in a timely manner and to your satisfaction. These guys go above and beyond to make sure you feel special and to uphold the EXCELLENCE brand. Rooms are spacious clean the very large bed and pillows are so comfortable it is fit for a King. We also loved the rainfall shower. We stayed in Block 1 which overlooked the pool area but also a beautiful view of the beach and sea. Mini bar in the rooms were replenished everyday. On the first day I advised the staff I did not drink and the fridge was stocked with fruit juice and different soft drink including snacks. Big shout out to the chamber maids who work so hard in maintaining such high standards of cleanliness throughout the rooms. Also a mention to the gardeners maintenance men cleaners that keep the appearance of the hotel and it is grounds in immaculate condition. Oops nearly forgot the Chefs too they are fantastic. We were there when Hurricane Dorian was due to hit the area. Work was done discretely around the hotel and it is grounds without any disturbance to guest or the day to day running of the hotel. I really do not even think that most of the guest noticed work being done. We were well informed regularly to any changes of Dorian. You must go and walk around the ecological gardens it is beautiful. Parrots Ducks Flamingos Cranes Fish Geese to name a few. Food plenty of it. We visited all the restaurants and places to eat 11 in all each of a very high standard which provided excellent service and top quality food. Quick mention to the coffee shop loads of ice cream fantastic cakes and top quality English tea and Hot chocolate. Beach and pool areas were kepted immaculately clean and there were plenty of beds and clean beach towels for all guest to use. As per normal the waiter waitresses service was excellent very polite and attentive. We recommend a trip to the Spa we used it on three occasions I guarantee you will be walking out a new person. All the staff are professional and very good at what they do. GymThe facilities are of a high quality. On my wifes first visit for a circuit is class Mario was the instructor. She was the only one to attend so had a one on one training lesson. As this happened again Mario saw this as challenge and made both classes hard work which was great. Her last circuits class was on the beach with Marco and some great people from the UK. Again hard work but great fun. Thanks for keeping the excess pounds. down she says. Evening Entertainment There was music at the martini bar prior to the shows. Every show was professional and well thought out something for everyone. The Michael Jackson one being the best in our opinion. After the shows there were either a DJ Karaoke Fire show live band and best of all the silent disco if your not dancing you will laugh your head off. After these had finished the Sports bar was open until 2 am which offered more food alcohol Sports tv and good company. The ENTERTAINMENT TeamWhat a fantastic bunch of people especially Jonathan Nicky M shakey Shakey Junior and Evan. The daily events included bingo quizzes crazy games in the pool aqua aerobics and crafts. All completed with humour and a smile. They are a warm and genuinely a great team who added to our holiday experience. We will genuinely miss them all. Special thanks to Jonathan for the daily bike rides. Every day we set out to see the country side outside of the hotel. The laughs and chats with him and the people who decide to make the trips were great. The rides allowed me to get the exercise I needed to burn off the calories I ate during the day. Jonathan demonstrates everything the EXCELLENCE brand wants in there staff.

On our first night we went to The Grill restaurant. Two hours after ordering and after asking the staff about our order twice the food arrived cooked wrong apparently medium rare means well done but after a 2 hour wait I was not about to complain lest I not get my food at all. Steak quality I would rate as less than what can be bought at Wal Mart and the \u201c New York Strip \u201d. was about a 4 oz cut. Upon finishing up at the restaurant my wife and I returned to our room to find the power was out in our room. A trip to concierge and a 20 minute wait later our power was restored. On day two we started off by going to the Aroma coffee sweets shop. The coffee was ok but the interesting part was that all the coffee drinks both hot and cold came in white 8 oz solo style plastic cups. Weird but sure whatever. For lunch we decided to order room service. The hummus with pita chips turned out to be some sort of neon yellow bland paste sprinkled with paprika served with a side of stale sliced baguette masquerading as the aforementioned pita chips. The nachos were laughably worse. Far from the appetizing picture shown in the menu of freshly made tortilla chips with pico de galo what we received can best be described as stale movie theater nacho chips liberally sprayed down with ez cheese 3 jalapeno slices and a glob of what was apparently supposed to be guacamole. After this we went out to the pool area to hang out with some friends. Returning to our room to change for dinner once again our power was out in the room. Another trip to concierge another 20 minute wait for maintenance to turn our power back on. Power is restored we finish up getting ready and head off to dinner at the \u201c Sports Bar \u201d. Ordered the Cesar salad and was greeted with a romaine salad slathered in an odd amalgamation of what can best be described as tartar and sriracha sauce. After dinner we returned to our room to yet again discover that the power was out. Again we go to concierge wait 20 minutes for maintenance get the power restored wait for the room to cool down to a temperature that is capable of being slept in and go to sleep. After restoring the power the maintenance man and concierge blamed us for having our phone chargers in. Although confused that something like a phone charger could cause a circuit breaker to trip we took the advice and my wife and I took up the practice of unplugging all electronics in the room whenever we were not occupying it. Day three. The wife and I decided that a spa trip might be in order. We booked the 100 minute intensive destress couples ritual which came with a free 1 hour hydrotherapy session. This was my first time in a spa environment but my wife has back problems and gets massages at home in the states on a weekly basis. We both agreed that the hydrotherapy was a good experience. The massage ritual on the other hand can be best described by my wife as \u201c 90 minutes of applying lotion and oil with 10 minutes of somebody randomly prodding pressure points. It was quite obviously something that anybody could do after watching a ten minute youtube video \u201d. We finished up at the spa returned to our room and to our surprise once again the power was out. Cue the usual concierge 20 minute wait for maintenance get blamed that we are causing it to happen even though we have literally unplugged every electronic device in the room capable of being unplugged. Explain to the maintenance guy that nothing is plugged in his response is \u201c OK Bye \u201d. Day four. Booked reservations for the Spice restaurants Hibachi grill dinner. Was pleasantly surprised when the food we received matched the description of what was on the menu. Return to the room and once again No power. At this point concierge and the maintenance guy are just visibly and verbally annoyed with us. Still nothing plugged in in our room still somehow our fault. 20 minutes later the powers back on. Day five. At this point you pretty much know what is coming the food menu is filled with misleading descriptions and straight up incorrect pictures while the food itself is of sub par to middling quality. Come back for dinner and the power is out go through the same old routine wait 20 minutes get it turned back on get told not to use any of our outlets in our room that we are already not using. You know the usual. Day six. Checkout time rolls around and we once again head into concierge only to be told that the reason our power went out last night no mention of the other 8 times it had occurred on the trip was because my wife had apparently tried to use a curling iron in our room. Upon informing concierge that we did not bring a curling iron the issue was promptly dismissed and the list of ancillary charges to the room was thrust in our direction before we were ushered out to the main lobby to await our pick up to head to the airport. The cherry on top of the sundae here is that the hotel staff attempted to load our luggage into the wrong vehicle until they were questioned about it. make of that what you will. We arrived at the airport boarded our flight and I have commenced with writing this review. Something you may have noticed was that at no point during the review have I discussed alcohol. The alcohol situation is best broken down by beer wine and liquor respectively. Beer is incredibly inconsistent what is available one day may not be the next. Wine is a mix of middling quality Whites Reds and a single Rose offering. Liquor can be broken down in general by top shelf here being middle to bottom shelf anywhere else. On the whiskey bourbon side you have got Jack Daniels and Jim Beam. Scotch is Johnie Walker Black label. Gin is Bombay Sapphire. Vodka is Stoli Smirnof. Rum is a split between Bacardi and Barcelo. A word of advice If you order a drink and do not specify and see the pour of liquor you are going to get a well drink. Additionally all of the drinks are incredibly watered down. If you are into mixed drinks your best option is quite simply to make your own drinks with the contents of the in room liquor and mixers from the minibar. Seriously. TLDR summary. This is a mid to low tier resort masquerading as a luxury one. The food is painfully mediocre at best and does not match the description or the pictures of the menu to the point that if someone tried selling these items individually they had be taken to court for false advertising. The drinks are weak and of well quality the majority of the time. The spa is underwhelming. If you have an issue with your room it is probably going to get blamed on you and disregarded by the staff. Everything is quantity over quality and if that is your thing you might enjoy it assuming there is not something inexplicably wrong with your rooms electrical system that will be blamed on you regardless of your actions. Bottom Line I can not in good conscience recommend this resort and my wife and I will not be returning. Now we just wait for the canned form response everyone else gets.", "offset": [3581, 3640], "date": "2020-02-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}]}
