In fact the entire hallway to my room smelled like mildew. My coworkers on other floors had the same complaint of their hallways. The decor is very tacky looks like a cheap motel.

I was not presented with the option to purchase breakfast but I heard bad things about the offerings anyway. There should be triple points for anyone who stays here as well as free wireless for unlimited devices and free breakfast to make up for the shortcomings. They obviously do not have keyless entry installed but that was true of some much nicer Sheratons as well. I have been to four Sheratons.

We have stayed here many times so this is not my first review but things look like they are generally improving at the Sheraton Pasadena. The hotel still has some nagging issues with the elevators that seem to take forever even though the hotel is not very tall. There is no service elevator so the staff are often using the elevator to transport laundry and luggage carts. Another thing that I have to note is that even though the towels and sheets are fine the tissue and toilet paper is notably poor. It becomes very uncomfortable to use the hotels paper goods and we would have purchased our own toilet paper and tissue if we stayed another day. Sheraton should really be able to get decent paper goods for their guests. The hotel is going through a big and much needed remodel of their public areas and rooms that are supposed to be completed in January 2018 so we look forward to seeing the updates on our next visit to the Pasadena area. We had an already updated room and the furnishings were very nice and had a pleasant contemporary look. I just really thing they should upgrade their paper godsOveral the staff are all pretty great we had a very smooth check in and the valet fellows were all friendly and very quick with retrieving the car. We had room service on Christmas morning for coffee and that was brought quickly. The housekeeping was excellent and they were able to accommodate all of the requests we made of themOveral we were pleased with our stay over Christmas and would certainly return and just hope some day they are able to work out the elevator and paper issues.", "offset": [780, 999], "date": "2017-12-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "1c90d22a-6b30-4244-8f14-abefd7ddfcae", "sentence": "loud renovations no slep tiny roms treated poorly by some staff members. managers that i called to speak with were nicebest thing was the waiter in the breakfast restaurant. he was delightfulwe overheard the lobby staff state the emmys took precedence over normal guests. ie our reservation was not important to them. we were given a much smaller room see photo showing how you hit doors into each other with no view not the one i booked from the site which was larger and had a view because our room was given to the emmys guest. the bed was broken and you slept tilted. i was blocked from walking on parts of the property and i have a medical condition. there were internal renovations going on imagine waking up to the sound of jackhammers. i have video.", "offset": [656, 743], "date": "2019-05-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "558116f5-b4bd-4169-b077-680ba357f552", "sentence": "Nice short stay hotel. When visiting my son at Cal Tech I generally chose a Mariot Brand ya one of those guys who has drank the entire pitcher of Mariot Rewards Kol Aid.

This Sheraton was built in the 1970s and from the minute you arrive you know it. The sloping sides of the hotel mean the top floor rooms are smaller than the ones lower down which is all for the sake of design. However I had still take a higher floor as they are a little quieter. The hotel is shoehorned into a narrow lot and situated between the Pasadena Convention Center and the driveway and some older apartments. I had opt for the north facing rooms that overlook the convention center. The smallish rooms with circa 1970s low ceilings were redone recently and stylishly. The location is quite central to the main sites of Pasadena so it is a good choice in that respect too.
