The hotel itself is very elegant from the outside and walking inside you could almost feel the atmosphere of its history. It looked to have been kept as it had always been and felt quite tropical in parts. We were eventually shown to our table inside and sat with 2 others from the tour. A waiter came around to enquire if we would like tea to drink and offered several choices. Coffee was also available. but we all felt at Raffles tea was the correct choice. A cake stand was placed on the table with a small variety of cakes and sandwiches all very prettily presented. There was also a nicely displayed buffet at the back of the room with further choices which included a range of hot Asian selections as well as the usual delicate slices of cake etc. Leave time too to visit the gift shop within the hotel of which we almost forgot and made a bit of a dash to.

We stayed here in September 2017 when the renovations where in full swing. Having booked it the impression I got was that Phase 1 would be completed and open by the time we went. This was not the case and parts of the hotel inc the Long Bar were closed. I was somewhat concerned that the Raffles atmosphere would be lacking. Not a bit of it. We stayed in Raffles back in 2015 and apart from parts being closed there was no discernible difference in what was on offer. A fabulous welcome on arrival and then shown to the East India Rooms where the reception was located at the time. No queueing but your are taken to a table and chairs and they come to you. A number of managers coming up and welcoming us to the hotel almost to the point of slight embarrassment but can not in any way knock it. Our room was on the first floor over looking the small square outside the East India Rooms with the much photographed fountain. On entering the room there is a lobby with table and chairs sofa and mini bar and other drinks. Shuttered windows on either side of the door into the main room. In here is a massive double bed wardrobes desk and chair pot plants chaise longue and all in the colonial pattern. The rooms are air conditioned to take account of the humidity. The bathroom was large with two wash basins large shower and a bath plus wc etc. Outside the room on the shared veranda as with many rooms in Raffles with a table and chairs. We made use of these when he complimentary Champagne arivedDue to the renovation Evening Meal was available in part of the Billiard Bar. This was not the same as the Raffles Grill but good choice of food and service was fine. Breakfast was also served here and the normal choice of a buffet and menu ordered food. Due to the Long Bar being closed he main centre of attention was the Billiard Bar. They had kept the peanut tradition from the Long Bar so it kept some of the Long Bar atmosphere. It is the case that the prices in this hotel will not suite all budgets. Some people just come and walk round take photographs and leave that is fine if it is all you want to do.

Not a wonderful start to a special celebratory meal. SERVICEThe team was warm and effusive and rather delightful and Janet the manager was apologetic about the reservation faux pas. Marie was a joy to have around during the dinner as she shared few interesting stories about some of the dishes \u2013 particularly the cheese course. FODSnacks and amuse bouche were individually well considered and highlighted some Asian spices and flavours quite well. But they did not make a cohesive foil for the rest of the meal. We can not fault each of the courses for execution. However textures and flavours were rather homogenous and the meal felt boring after the third course. Also it is 2019 \u2013. do we still need so much foam in our food. This may be a personal preference but with every course requiring some sort of broth or foam just reeks of complacency. I also have to mention that they offer 3 types of sparkling water \u2013 Antipodes Badoit and Perier \u2013 but we were not offered a choice until we noticed the servers pouring different bottles at other tables we were served Antipodes which we are not a fan of. SPECIAL ACOMODATIONDue to my partners dietary requirements certain amuse bouche snacks and petit fours were not available. We thought it would have been graceful for the restaurant to offer an extra piece of the same item if there was only on item that could be enjoyed. Dessert was also a terrible creation of julienned apples \u2013 disappointing from a 3Michelin star chef or rather her protege. we have enjoyed more thoughtful alternatives from lesser restaurants. And what truly takes the cake is that another table received a special birthday dessert but we did not get a single acknowledgement of the occasion we were celebrating despite their initial screw up with the reservation. It felt downright offensive. CHEFThis deserves a special mention simply because Chef Gatin visited with us to find out about our meal. Of course we respectfully conveyed our thoughts as shared above but it was obvious he was having none of it and was condescending in his responses and demeanour. I shal not go into details as it would be a case of his word against ours but I implore you to speak your mind and give some constructive feedback which we did and make your own judgment if the chef was gracious or not. There are far better places that offer more enjoyable meals for less. The quality of the produce was excellent as was the service and the environment.

When we arrived we were asked to wait as the check in desks were full. We waited for a total time of 25 minutes maybe half an hour. Only five minutes before we were then checked in someone offered us something to drink. I had been contacted by one of the Raffles Butlers before arriving and i had asked for a late check out he replied that at the check in I would have been told if it were possible or not.

Please consider any feedback below within the context of an overall very enjoyable stay from a detail oriented individual who understands that you too are striving to be at the very top of a competitive group of luxury hotel experiences Peninsula HK Tokyo Aman Tokyo Mandarin Bangkok MO HK MO Singapore as reference point for some of our prior travel experiences etcThe check in process left some room to be desired. We were greeted appropriately at the door and ushered to the check in area. I did feel that the check in staff though friendly and efficient were too few and thus frequently tied up having to handle other requests on the phone or even other in person interactions with other guests. I noticed this both at check in as well as check out. I mention this only as other hotels offer in suite check in which removes the distraction to this portion of the guest experience and allows the guest to explore the room during the check in process. Bag handling at check. in was excellent on point and largely invisible. We requested bags to be stored at check out for about 3 hours prior to our late flight that evening. There was some confusion as we did not know whether we could leave them unattended in the room to be picked up and we had already checked out and handed in our keys. It was clarified that they would be taken care of and we did not need to sit in the room and wait for them to be picked up. However upon picking them up from the concierge we were asked if we had a ticket. At any other hotel this would be a non issue. But it represents a break in the continuity of the experience either the process is completely invisible the whole way through and the concierge when we pick up the luggage simply asks for our name or maybe our room number from earlier that day or we interact with the people who pick up our bags andor receive a baggage ticket from the check out staff. It is a little incongruous to have an invisible baggage pickup from the room but then be asked to provide a receipt of the transaction at the concierge desk upon pickup. The round soap dish as found in the shower is difficult to remove the soap from and re place into the dish as the dish is almost exactly the size of the soap bar. The alternative is to leave the soap bar bare on the ledge in the shower however there is no corrugation to keep the soap bar from sliding around on the smooth surface. The butler service is friendly but also likely on an early learning curve. We received our complementary welcome Singapore Slings in the room and enjoyed them in addition to snacks from the minibar. We returned to the room after a decent period of time I believe over an hour to find the room uncleaned. I would not expect an automatic full room recleaning at every exit of the room however one might anticipate that first completion of welcome beverages will leave the room partially unkempt and it might make a strong positive statement as to the attention to detail if this was briefly surreptitiously taken care of when your guest makes their first exit of the room to explore the grounds etc. I also noticed that the butler pages to a general number and not our specific butler which partially detracts from the personal nature of the relationship. The bartender at the Writers bar was extraordinary as you might expect both in knowledge capability and attention to detail. At this level and price point would anticipate flexing up more support waitstaf as the bar got crowded around the time that the Long Bar made last call and there was an influx of additional guests to the Writers bar. I do recall a similar bar in Tokyo where both chairs for myself and my wife were pulled out for us simultaneously not even having had any prior reservations. Details like these are memorable and understandably difficult to pull off routinely. The cocktails were phenomenal. The breakfast was truly wonderful. The captain was deeply apologetic at a small misstep of the kitchen with regards to a request to serve an ingredient on the side but it in no way detracted from my overall enjoyment of the atmosphere the service or the quality of the meal. Afternoon tea was impeccable. There was an error in our reservation that we had to clarify both to confirm the same day reservation reservation was made on the day of after check in and to cancel a reservation which had been made for the following day. But thoroughly enjoyed the quality and creativity of the dishes the tea the atmosphere and the service. With regards to the feel welcome endeavor for the stay I did sense the effort to make guests feel more like residents than traditional hotel guests and this was noticed and appreciated. I think there are some challenges at the front door with separating guests from tourists passing in for food and beverage with regards to the welcome.

This should be on every travellers Bucket list. Best hotel we have ever stayed in. From the Airport pick up it was top quality all the way. Check in was in our room. We were in the Palm Court Suites. Outstanding accommodation enter through living area then bedroom and into bathroom. Staff were amazing so very friendly. Breakfast was superb. Did the obligatory long bar. As a resident you can book a tome to go so you do not have to que with the non residents. Returning to hotel you are greeted with Welcome Home by the door staff. Had dinner twice and was very impressed with choice of where to eat and high quality of the food. After one meal I said to the waiter please give my compliments to the chef. On our way out the waiter introduced us to the chef so we could tell him personally.

The welcome was fabulous and the Butlers truly professional. Highlights were The Writers Bar and Madame du Pic. I listed the horror of The Butchers Block before I left. The re fit has installed umbrellas at the pool which only look good in promo photos they are far too small to provide any shade so my much anticipated lounging pool side reading a book was impossible might prevent my staying again. hm. Pool Bar was great with fab staff. Breakfast experience was dodgy one day and marvellous the next the service excellence was on a pendulum. Overall I loved it and only list the downers for your reference.

It was wonderful to stay at this historic hotel. The staff were polite and very attentive from the moment my partner and I arrived up to our departure. I would really only fault the hotel on few points. First please use leaf tea instead of tea bags. This was a real let down at breakfast time. Tea bags are a tasteless abomination on par with instant coffee. This is a hotel that still takes the trouble to use and look after customised silver plated cutlery including old fashioned butter dishes and toast racks so surely it can not be too much trouble to serve real tea as well in a proper tea pot with a tea strainer. The other problem was with the breakfast room. There needs to a discreet sign or a manager willing to have a few discreet words with people who babble into their mobile phones. Our breakfast on our first morning was ruined by one such pest who babbled incessantly into his device. He was altogether oblivious to frowns from us and fellow guests. This prompted us to take breakfast in our room the following morning.", "offset": [645, 691], "date": "2020-02-25 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}]}
