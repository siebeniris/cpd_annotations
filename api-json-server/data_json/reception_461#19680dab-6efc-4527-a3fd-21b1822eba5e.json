The Four Seasons Kuda Hura Maldives is not only the best Four Seasona we have stayed at but also the best place we ve ever been. Unbeatable beautiful surroundings lovely beach and reef outstanding food quality and lovely restaurants fun healthy activities in a wonderful safe environment an excellent spa amazing diving center and the most important plus the warmth and attention to detail you feel from each one of the staff. The people working at this Four Seasons are the ones that make the real difference. They work with love as if they had discovered how enjoyable it is to achieve excellence in their professions from houskeping to the managing level everybody cared about us making the most of our stay and made us feel welcome every single day. It s been very nice to find many of the staff from our previous stay. Although this was our second stay with less things to discover and more to expect the hotel managed to exceed expectations again. My husband took adavanced cooking lessons to master his cooking skills with the extraordinary chef Kapil Sharma at the prestigious Baraburu Restaurant. Kapil is not only an amazing chef that cooks the most delicious indian food he \u2019s also a very generous and kind person and talented teacher every class has been an adventure of flavours to discover. So cooking classes are highly recommended as well. Baraburu Restaurant is one of the best indian restaurants in the world and my favourite at Kuda Hura. It has a complete and delicious buffet on Sundays thay should not be missed. I also liked very much the Asian Buffet the fresh grilled food at Kandu Grill and the delicious breakfast at Cafe Hura with fresh baked croissants made by a Chinese cook who specialized in France. There you feel so welcome by such lovely caring and attentive hostesses as Maria Niang Bayon and Bryn. I have to mention Henry as well here and many more I can t recall the names. All remembered our names and cared about everything we might need. The Sunset Lounge Bar with Didi an excellent barman and Das is a must for sunsets and after dinner cocktails. It is also where Randy the manager Randy meets the guests during his Wednesday s cocktails thank you Randy for sharing with us many interesting things about the island. The diving experience are definetely another highlight of the trip. Diving is so much easier here than anywhere else in the world. I can not thank Ibrahim Nazer more he is one of the Dive Center managers and he went the extra mile to help make the most of our dives in the safest environment he joined himself in one of our outings to make me feel more confident near sharks \u2026 it was a great experience and we could see a great variety of marine life including sharks turtles and a great variety of fish on a reef near Baros. Thank you so much Nazer. These are experiences that last for a lifetime. Hope to be back soon. Nazer is also a great cameraman he loves the underwater world so much and it shows in the way he films underwater. so we went home with amazing pictures and videos of our dives. My 11 year old son shared amazing scuba dives with Fernando a great diving Spanish instructor who was really caring and patient. Thank you so much Fernando. Also I d like to thank you Zahir for being always there for anything we d like to do Zihan with whom we shared such great jet pack and windsurf classes Monica for the attention at the gym Shamem for the lovely art you surprised us with and for being so kind with us with anything we might need in our room I will upload the pictures as I promised. Afitey for the pictures at the beach and the coconut juices. It is difficult to think about things to improve but if I make an effort I could say I would like the buggies and service buggies to drive a little bit slower \u2026 for instance between bungalows 123 and 124 there is curve and it s not easy for them to see people walking on that side \u2026. and we felt the speed was a bit too much sometimes. Also when walking in the peer it is narrow and buggies are too fast sometimes. It would be great if you could always use the big boats for picking up guests in Male and not the small ones as it gets really bumpy. scary sometimes when you go through open water in the small one we arrived in the small one and didn t like it much but we were lucky to leave in the comfort of the big one as we did the previous year. The ACs in the rooms are still noisy but really all these small things are disregarded when the important things are in place which is the case. It is easy to forget about anything to improve when things like this one occur I lost a pashmina I especially liked before arriving to the hotel and I was not sure if I left it on the plane on the boat to the island or maybe I had lost it at the airport. Without much hope I told reception about this just in case they had seen it and they told me they would check and let me know. Next day Mandas from the Four Seasons brought the pashmina to my bungalow. He had recovered it from Emirates plane. I had never expected that to happen and it felt wonderful. Thank you Mandas and all the reception teamLater I found out a couple had lost their ring while diving and the staff managed to find it. All these are normal procedures for them \u2026 but for a guest is the dreamed vacation surrounded by a real team of caring people that love what they do. It is expensive but it is amazing. I don t have to say we hope to back soon because I ve said it to everybody also during the lovely farewell we were given when we had to head back to Male. There are very few places so difficult to leave behind. Thank you from the heart to all of you for such lovely memories that will stay with us forever.", "offset": [140, 437], "date": "2015-02-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "14c3c5b3-e448-49e0-a62e-fd843bb83287", "sentence": "Absolutely perfect holiday. When going on vacation the most important thing is the feeling a place gives to us. At the end of the day this is what lingers long after you have returned home. My family has been coming to this resort for round about a decade gradually growing adding kids and therefore adding new and different challenges to make up a perfect holiday. We keep coming back and here is why. On top of things like absolutely stunning grounds the perfect size for a maledivian island beautiful botanics a truly stunning beach serving picture perfect views and amazing water well mentained pools bars and restaurant \u2026 a timeless design for me timeless means not particularly following any trends but a very high quality regarding furniture lighting and electronics all in sensible regard to the region the resort is situated in very nice food and beverages a one of a kind spa situated on a private little island it is the staff and the people that make this resort just a bit more special than the rest. It is very hard for me to point out individuals as seriously each and every person I met working in this resort has been extremely polite really friendly and just went that extra mile to make our holiday truly amazing \u2026 in an honest and cheerful way. Not in a our HR guidelines make us smile and greet every guest although we may not feel like it at all way. You genuinely have the feeling the working atmosphere is a very good one and you get the feeling the whole team is really motivated and likes what they do. From the very first good morning of the housekeeping staff the pool maintenance guys to a chat with the wonderful FB team or the bar and restaurant staff it is just a pleasure being around those guys. As we traveled with 2 kids and a toddler we had quite a few special requests that I stated before via email. Everything I had asked for and more has been organized and cared for. A true bliss for traveling with little ones. We took advantage of a few services that I would like to point out specially they provided us with a really cool buggy stroller with big air wheels awesome with the sand. so we would not have to take our own stroller. On arrival we found the right size of nappies baby powder and kids amenities waiting for us in our room. They had everything from play blankets to bottle sanitizer milk heater water kettle and so on. A special designated kids menu was provided for us in the room and under the age of 5 kids dine fro free. The kids club is really fun with lots of interesting things to do for the little ones yoga learning how to massage exploring the island turtle and fish feeding and so on \u2026 There is baby sitting service available so even our smallest could accompany her cousins to the kids club without a problem. All staff seemed really proficient and it gave mom and dad some truly amazing us time. This may sound as if we would have chosen this resort because of their absolute child friendliness. This is not so. We went before we had kids and perfectly enjoyed our stay its just so rare that resorts with this level of service offer such extensive sympathy towards children aswel. I absolutely recommend trying the spa and one of their awesome massages. Truly an amazing experience. Also I would recommend trying out different restaurants and theme nights as they are all really good. Especially the reef club and the whole team there made it into our hearts and we went there quite a few times. We had a birthday during our stay and I have never experienced such an awesome day full of little surprises and touches that made it truly special for all of us. The GM seems to be doing a great job and is a really friendly person on top.

I have just returned from the most amazing holiday of my life courtesy of The Four Seasons Kuda Hura. This hotel and its wonderful staff just tick every single box you could possibly wish to tick on your holiday. The resort was simply stunning. From arrival at Male airport we were escorted into a welcoming lounge to wait for our speedboat. The crossing was a bit choppy and staff were aplenty on the boat to make sure we were ok and not concerned. The arrival at the resort was beautiful and staff could not have done more to make us feel at home. Our water bungalow was out of this world and we did not even need to go snorkeling as the array of fish that passed by our home for the 5 days we were there were spectacular. We had rays and shark as well as a huge abundance of fish day after day. Although the resort and accommodation was second to none what really sets this place apart from any other is the attentiveness and professionalism of the staff all of them. Everybody is so welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. The food must also get a mention as this was by far the best food I have ever tasted. As a fussy vegetarian I even tried things I had never tried before in my life and every single restaurant on this resort offers exceptional choice and quality of food. Normally when a holiday draws to a close I am sad but in many ways looking forward to going home this time was different. I was so sad to leave this beautiful paradise but I know 100.

We split our stay between FS Kuda Hura and Landa Giravaru. The resorts are quite different with Kuda Hura being the more dense and casual of the resorts and Landa Giravaru having a remote lush setting with greater privacy and intimacy. Of the two I preferred Landa Giravaru but Kuda Hura was a great introduction into the Maldives after 30 hours of travel time. The highlights for us included Recreation Diving. My husband could not have been more pleased and he is now spoiled for diving outside of FS. Things like handling his gear partnering with a dive master vs a guest providing post dive coffee and treats. these all left a lasting impression. Recreation Other. The recreation team was extremely helpful and friendly and I appreciated the attentive service of their director. On our afternoon Turtle Snorkel Safari we saw 7 turtles hawksbill and green and enjoyed our guides insights. We also went on a sunset dolphin cruise and while we did not have much luck in dolphin sightings it was a beautiful evening spent on the water. Sunrise Water Bungalow. the view was incredible as was the sound of the surf in the distance. We watched the glorious sunrise each morning from our deck savoring every moment. We appreciated the welcome champagne and sweets and especially the upgrade to a suite with its complimentary afternoon dim sum Sunset Beach the waters and beach were stunning. We loved being able to tuck into the landscape under a palapa while enjoying the incredible views and drinks. The beachside service was attentive and being able to buzz for service ensured we had what we needed when we needed it Barabaru the setting food and service at this Indian restaurant made this our favorite at the resort. While I did experience and issue with my spa services when I brought it to the spa teams attention they made it a priority to establish an acceptable resolution. In addition I had misplaced a spa product after my spa services and the FS team did a great job in locating it I left it on the beach and returning it to me. While the service was not as personalized as it was at Landa Giravaru the Kuda Hura staff provided sincere service that created a warm and welcoming environment this is what keeps us coming back to FS. It was the FS management team at Langkawi that inspired us to venture to the Maldives and they were right to do so. The Langkawi GM even went out of his way to assist in finalizing our plans and reservation.

Over a year ago I contacted the previous Manager \u201c Tulio \u201d about a 2nd trip to FS Kuda Hura. He responded and we decided to rebok our old room 18 at the Four Seasons for our family. This was a great decision. Put simply this has got to be one of the greatest resorts in the world. The greatest strength of the resort is the staff. I would like to acknowledge the folowing1. House Keeping Ali The Famous Soccer Player Nashem The young man who brought our daughter gifts from Male2. Joseph Daniel from Reef Club. We remembered him from our previous trip. He is an excellent host3. Shirley Wang and all of the management staff who saw to our special requests4. Abdulah Sameer was without a doubt the star of the show. He and his Lieutenant Didi met our needs at the Indian Restaurant and polside. They exceeded our highest expectations. Our little daughter who was only 1 and a half years old still recalls getting mango juice from Didi polside over one year later. We can not thank them enough for their hospitality and friendliness. Abdulah Didi and the polside staff have perfected the art of service5. I just wanted to thank Didi for a 3rd time about his hospitality6. The telephone operator who took our room service orders etc was phenomenal7. Airport service manager I regret that I lost his name but I wanted to thank him accompanying us into the airport for our departure. The airport reception and send off are both fantastic especially when we come from so far awayThis return trip to FS Kuda Hura was our 2nd trip to the resort and 3rd trip to the Maldives. You will not be disappointed. We were afforded every possible accommodation and courtesy. I was especially impressed when I got a birthday card from the resort nearly one year after our trip. You owe it to yourself to experience this special place. I do n\u2019t want to spoil any surprises so all I can do is thank the people who make this resort great. A few more points1. Best breakfast ever2. Best Indian Food ever3. Great Value for young kids. Everything they did for our daughter food laundry supplies was complementary. 4. Special Dinner was also a knockout. We dined in the hut at the end of the pier at Baru Baru and also had a beach side meal that were wonderful and romantic5. Kids services They went out of their way to make our little daughter \u2019s experience wonderful. A few examples they had a kids meal and apple juice waiting for us on arrival. 6. If you are a honeymooner as we were in 207. you wo n\u2019t notice any kids stuff or be disturbed at all. There is a separate pool on the sunset side for grown ups. Overall this is a ca n\u2019t miss bucket list experience. I would also like to emphasize the convenience of being a half hour boat ride away from the airport. You are far enough to get away from the crowd but not so far that you need a seaplane ride to the resort.

We stayed at Kuda Hura after spending four nights at Landa Girviaru and then another 4 nights on the Four Seasons Explorer. After spending time at LG I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about how anything could match up even another Four Seasons. To our surprise they stood up to the test matched in comparison. Reception was without hassle. They met us at the dock as we were disembarking The Explorer handed us a welcome drink and walked us to the reception lounge and provided us a cold towel. Informed me that they had transferred the charges from LG and The Explorer handed me they key to our room walked us to the buggy shuttled us off to our room. Our Luggage was waiting when we got there we were on the beach within 10 minutes of arriving. that is how Four Seasons does things as it should be. We had a Beach Bungalow with a large private pool and once again outdoor showers. We had a Over Water in LG so we wanted to mix it up try the beach. I can not tell you which I preferred because they were both amazing. I feel that if I was to do it again even if I just stayed at one resort I would still split the time between the two styles of rooms. The rooms are as well kept as you can imagine nothing is spared. We had a Sunset Bungalow and I feel that on this Island that is the best. The beach is much nicer the water calmer and more clear its closer to the marina and the adult pool. We loved the location of our room 131. The adult pool is so un crowded that most of the time we were the only ones there. We would actually set up our beach chairs in front of our Bungalow and they would set us up the same day bed at the pool every day we would just walk back forth and spend time at each. We had dinner at each of the restaurants and all were exceptional. I guess I would say I preferred the Reef Club because we ate here most often. It was also close to our room which may have had something to do with it. But nevertheless all were good. We had a Private dinner on the beach just after sunset which was amazing and as romantic as it gets. The food served there is whatever you want you just have to let them know earlier in the day. The service is extraordinary. Always with a smile always whatever it is you need. Service on the beach and the pool iced water every 15 minutes very attentive they would bring you cold fruit on a stick bon bons yes Bon Bons frozen juice bars etc all day long. Examples are that I grew fond of the Maldivian Chilies I would eat them with almost everything. The day we left Joseph from the Reef Club came to me with a vacuum packed bag of chilies for me to take home. Another example would be that on our 2nd day after a whole day in the sun we came in to get ready for dinner they had come in and made my Wife a HUGE bubble bath complete with rose petals and a heart out of bubbles. Departure again was seamless. We had a 130 pm flight out of Male. So they allowed us to stay in our room all day night until they shuttled us to the airport at 930 pm. This is a nice touch. They met us at the dock walked us to check in at the airport and said goodbye. This may be more information than you need for a review but I felt it necessary to give the Four Seasons experience their credit due. I would definitely return to the Maldives I would not even consider staying anywhere other than the Four Seasons.

The excellent service starts with the friendly hotel staff at the airport the transfer is smooth and requires just about 30 minutes by speedboat. The resort is based on a long stretched island. Both sides sunrise or sunset are equally beautiful. I prefer the sunrise side but this is the more active side as the water activities are based on that side of the island. The sunrise side is more quiet but better for some basic snorkeling. Common facilities as well as those in the bungalows are well maintained. Staff is very efficient in taking care of any shortfalls or issues. Fitness centre kids club business center are all in good condition. The quality of the food at the various restaurants is excellent. Guests can participate in many excursions ranging from sightseeing to fishing and snorkeling trips. Our favourite was the dolphin cruise. All in all a very well run resort with well trained staff who are anticipating your needs whenever possible.

My wife two kids aged 10 and 12. and my parents stayed in Kuda Hura for a week in late June and had a fantastic time. Having stayed in several Four Seasons in the past Bora Bora Maui and Whistler our expectations were high in relation to service and even those expectations were surpassed. The staff were all incredibly friendly and chatty and looked after us all the time. The island itself is small but beautiful with loads of activities to do in the immediate area. Having been fortunate enough to also stay at Four Seasons Bora Bora it is hard not to make a comparison. Bora Bora is a sensational resort and quite a bit bigger than Kuda Hura but does not have as many local activities as Kuda Hura. At Kuda Hura we snorkeled right off our beach every day took surfing lessons at the resort went on various 2 3 hours snorkeling trips with turtles and sharks went on a dolphin cruise and went fishing. We also hit the spa. All of those things were fantastic. During our stay we had booked two rooms since there were six of us. One of the rooms had a minor condensation issue on the roof minor enough that we did not even feel the need to complain. Despite this the staff moved our family into the Royal Villa so we could all be together with no condensation issue.

From the reception buggy drivers restaurant staff housekeeping the managers gym staff yoga instructors even those sweeping the beach were all very nice friendly accommodating. There is not anything they will not do to make sure their guests have the best time. One perfect example was when we experienced a storm on our 4th night we did not want to go out of our villas because our 3 villas were located on stilts we will need to pass the boardwalk going to the restaurant. We ordered room service but 30 mins. later a restaurant staff informed us that it was difficult for them to deliver the food because they could not assure the quality of the food if they will bring the food with the strong winds rain instead they offered to escort all of us to the restaurant. We told them we did not want to get wet from the rain so we do not mind if they deliver the food in plastic containers we will understand if the food was not hot anymore without the usual cutlery formalities under the circumstances. They delivered our food after a few more minutes when we were asking to sign the bill we were informed that it was complimentary because of the inconvenience we experienced brought about by the storm because of the casual preparation. If that was not what an impeccable service is I do not know what is. We booked 3 sunrise water bungalows the 3rd bungalow with a pool. I requested that all 3 bungalows to be adjacent or near each other. When we arrived there were no available 3 water bungalows that were adjacent so they just upgraded our 2 bungalows to be adjacent to the 3rd water bungalow with pool. The water bungalow is so beautiful we can go down behind our room walk to the sandbar. At night we stay on our balcony to watch the sharks mantarays swim by. We even saw a big turtle in front of our bungalow. We also enjoyed the facilities amenities. The gym was open 24 hrs my children enjoyed the sports activities like wake boarding snorkeling banana boat. We also joined the shark safari and the turtle safari. The swimming pools were also very nice. Lastly i truly appreciate when they extended us a late check out our flight was at 10 pm the management was kind enough to allow our 2 rooms a 90 pm check out while the 3rd room was given till 12 noon. The housekeeping surprised me my husband on our last night when they decorated our bath tub with heart shaped rose petals complete with a cold drink. We stayed 8 full days at Four Seasons it was not enough when you are having a grand time. I had say Four Seasons surpassed my familys expectations.

This one came close. kite boarding kite surfing kiteboarding kitesurfing. Key worlds for search to clear up this issue with Four Seasons in Maldives. Wife and I love the Four Seasons brand. We make it a point to visit one at least once a yearit is unthinkable for us to give a Four Seasons resort less than 5 stars due to their impeccable service but this one came close because of few issues. We saw a picture of Yuri Zon riding a kite in a pool in Four Seasons Maldives and thought what a beautiful place to kiteboard. But wind being not so strong in Maldives we decided to split the trip here and Kalpitiya Sri Lanka. We noticed that kite boarding is offered in Landa Giravaru but not in the Kuda Hura. It was not clear if it was just lack of gear in Kuda Hura or what but since we were coming from Kalpitiya we thought we will have our gear anyway so no matter. We did not want to take puddle jumper sea plane to Landa Giravaru because it make us woozy plus the return trip to MALE airport was going to be at night. A guarantee that we will get motion sickness so we chose Kuda Hura. Not only is kiteboarding gear not offered in Kuda Hura it is strait up NOT ALOWEDThe beaches are public and you are in the sea but it is NOT ALLOWED. The reasons sited was disturbance to other guests. Wind was so strong other guests were choosing the other side of the island so the wind side of the island was practically deserted. Another reasons sited was small lagoon. Again most guests were choosing leeward size for activities like snorkeling since the water is more calm. Lastly there are constructions going on in the Villas so there is a lot of debris and garbage in the water from bottles to wood chunks with nails foam. But other watersports like windsurfing jetski and other listed activities were fully allowed. This made me realize how Apple ish Four Seasons is like. It has many interesting Aps Activities but trying to do anything not listed is going to take jailbreaking and they do not like that at all. In fact I would wager ANY activity not listed on their website will require jailbreaking and NOT ALOWEDWe have visited other exclusive island resorts before in the past and one was in a beautiful place. I was able to work with the resort hire a boat and they provided me a 1 meter square launching and landing platform so I can take AMAZING aerial drone videos in 4K It was spectacular. But I am going to have to bet Drone videos Not listed. NOT ALOWEDWhat is ALLOWED Resort was under filled and most of the guest were Chinese. I am guessing Mainland Chinese from their accent. They were allowing their kids to run around throw sand at each other throw sand in the pool blow on toy whistles bounce around on the deck. All the while resort staff was trying to teach them that was inappropriate behavior during dinner. Parents were too busy doing things on their phone. They were loosing BUCKET FULLS of FACE but they did not seem to care. Also rich enough to come to Four Seasons Kuda Hura but not rich enough to bring an Ayi. Face loss. This kind of allowed activity every night lowered the class of the resort. But that is the state of the world in travel this parts of the world now. Just enough disturbance for guests to loose face but not enough for you to video tape them send it to their government and have them banned from travel. Not really resorts fault. Plus service to us was as other Four Seasons was impeccable. Strongly recommend the fishing trips since the fantastic chefs prepare what you caught for you. Also recommend the cooking class. You come to really appreciate the great staff and what they go through to prepare great meals for you. But we will not return to this resort. We love kiteboarding and we will choose a kiteboarding specialized resort in the future. Which by the way was fully booked during the Months we wanted to travel while this resort was practically empty. What does that say. Or choose ClubMed on next island or something since the class of guest class seems similar plus perhaps they will be more flexible in activities. Especially being on a small island and you do not have options to go out of the resort for activities. Staff at Four Seasons in Maui thought that I was AWESOME being able to jump 10 meters on my kite at age 47. And they marveled at quality of the hand built Carved Kiteboard that was delivered to me to the resort. Maybe the activity is too scary to watch for the Chinese guests.", "offset": [226, 429], "date": "2016-09-30", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "e1f14f10-8b31-4097-a475-9ff0bbe34c77", "sentence": "Kid Friendly Paradise. So you can probably see from my review history that I do this very rarely. Kuda Hura deserves a review because of the amazing service and quality that they delivered during recent family vacation. Where do I start. let us just say once you get out of customs everything is handled from that point onwards. You are greeted and put into a nice air condition waiting area to the boat is ready. Your bags and everything else is sorted. When you arrive on the island about 20 minutes my two kids 25 years and 4 months were both asleep. Instead of doing the normal check in formalities they just took us straight to the room so they could continue their nap. The room was as described all set up for a toddler and infant. They had included some baby food diapers and all the necessities. a nice and unexpected treat. From that point onwards we just hit the restaurants on the islands and enjoyed the beach. All the staff were super friendly and understand the needs of the a couple traveling with young children.

We stayed here for four nights as part of our silver wedding celebrations in November 2016. We then went on to the Four Seasons at Landa Giravaru. What sets the Four Seasons at Kuda Hura apart to us was the happiness of the staff. Without going into detail we had shared some laughs that can only come from a truly happy team. If you take the time to go into the Heart of the resort behind the scenes and thoroughly recommended it becomes clear why as the closeness of the team and the humour extends from there. It is also fascinating to see what it takes to provide such an exceptional experience in such a challenging and fragile environment. At Kuda Hura you are not just staying at a resort with the sea and sand you are really experiencing a slice of the Maldives and its way of life. The two Four Seasons Resorts house and support the only turtle rehabilitation programmes in the Maldives. Make sure you spend some time with the fantastic staff and get up close with these amazing animals their remarkable stories and personalities. They also support MantaWatch RefScapers and other marine conservation programmes. The Four Seasons also runs an apprenticeship programme for Maldivians. There is no school for Hotel and Catering in the Maldives and this scheme gives locals a training and route into this key industry. We really appreciated that all of the beach properties had direct access to beaches that received sun throughout the day. The resort also works hard to keep the beaches large and pristine in a challenging ocean environment. We also appreciated the very high standard to which the complimentary watersports equipment was maintained. The diving experience was excellent. The dive team is very well integrated with the resort and the level of personalisation and commitment to giving you a great experience was very apparent. The restaurants are all up to the top class standards you would expect from Four Seasons. As much as possible is sourced or grown locally and the rest always with quality in mind. We had a whim for something that was n\u2019t on the menu and the kitchen managed to create the dish for us in true Four Seasons style. The reef fish is incredible and the house granola is the best I have ever tasted.

My husband and I first visited Kuda Hura in 202 when we lived in Singapore. We now live Europe and have been coming here every year since except when the resort was under construction after the tsunami in 204. We have travelled the world and lived in Asia and Europe and are lucky enough to have stayed at the best hotels in places such Tokyo and Buenos Aires and over 40 destinations in between. We have been to Mauritius Barbados Thailand and have tried other resorts in search of a place that compares to the beauty of the Maldives. Nothing compares. There is only place where you can literally take off your shoes and spend your entire holiday in an absolute state of bare footed relaxation. The Four Seasons Kuda Hura is our home away from home for my husband son who is now 8 and myself. 1. The Service Beyond five star. The team at Kuda Hura spends the time and takes the effort to cater to our every need. The big things one would expect and all the little details without our even having to ask. My husbands extra hot double machiato to my sons penne pasta with extra cheese sauce. Sebastian always greats us in the morning with the most lovely smile and the rest just follows. By the way the GM just asked me if I would like a home made salted caramel ice cream stick. Why not. I know I just ate lunch but how can I refuse that oferWe genuinely feel the team and everyone cares about our stay and how happy we are. The Four Seasons sets the standards here and to our mind worldwide. However the service can not be copied it is the spirit and the mindset of the resort that can not be bottled and recreated somewhere else. Faisal carved my sons name in a beautiful shell. Ashfan showed him how to cast. Joseph stops by at breakfast to see how we are and is our resort godfather so to speak. Randy the GM and his wife had us for dinner ostensibly a barbecue but more like a banquet. It sounds unreal and isI will just mention briefly that we were airlifted from Male in 204 after the tsunami. Our friends at another resort were stranded for 2 weeks. Only Four Seasons. 2. FodThere is a choice of three restaurants and room service. The food is unbelievable. We are used European standards and are big foodies. My husband is 63 and serious eater. Last night was the Easter BQ. Crab claws lobster a pasta station steak and frog legs quail. Yes barbecued quail. A gentle breeze and all the tables on the beach with perfect live acoustic music. Pinch me. Sameer and the team at Barubaru cook and serve world class Indian. Be prepared to overeat. My husbands favourite dish is the lobster curry. 3. Amenities and water sportsWe have been here for 18 days. Some of friends ask whether we get bored. Sadly no. The longer we are here the longer we want to stay. There is so much to do if one wants to. Complementary activities not to mention the amazing kids club I have read four books need I say more. Thank you Lisa and team. And adventures like big game fishing. We caught actually my son reeled it in. a wahoo and we had the most amazing fresh fish for lunch fish sticks for the boy and olive tapenade crust for us. Today we started with a scuba dive learned here with trusted equipment and expert instructors and dive masters Nazer thank you. Then watersking with Abdulah yes we learned here and my son skied in the middle of the ocean. Next year he wants to try mono skiing like his dad. Great gym never crowded. Snorkeling so much to see. The water is like a refreshing bath and clearer than Evian. Surfing. Donna and Cliff at Tropical Surf. True pros. Bored. Never 4. ChildcareSince last year my son runs around the island on his own. He loves the independence and has met so many other children. he will say hello to Didi and grab a fresh smoothie at the pool bar play ping pong go to their villa to hang out and stop by to see us at lunch and have an Oreo cake. He cried when we left last year. Our friends who joined us this Easter have a 4 month old and 2 year old. The childcare is impeccable as many of the caretakers have children themselves Shaheda is an amazing lady. They are more like nannies than babysitters my friend said. She has spent several afternoons relaxing in the amazing spa. Watch the fish through the glass window in the floor while you have a fantastic massage knowing that your children are happy and safe. There is a kidie pool and a gradual slope into the big pool which is perfect for young children. My son started coming here when he was 3 months and very water shy. Now he takes the ski bob out in the beachside ocean under the watchful and attentive eye of the water sports team led by Zahir Abdulah and Razak. So much more to say. We are sad leave and have decided to book Christmas. A year is just too long to wait and life is too short.

The words that comes to me in regards to this hotel are genuine kindness. I have been to 4 different hotels in the Maldives but the four seasons blew me away. Mostly because of the staff. The first time I noticed this above and beyond kindness was at breakfast. A disabled gentleman was brought to breakfast while it was raining in a cart. As soon as they arrived several employees without being told walked over and had large umbrellas covering the gentleman and his family. The staff is quick and see everything that is going on to make sure ALL guests are taken care of. Every time you ask someone a question they offer you more. Our first day at breakfast we were given an entire tour of what is available. When we went to sit by the pools we were notified also where the nearest bathrooms were. Things I would not think to ask of initially but very important information that I would have eventually asked for. If we hung out by the pool or the beach we were immediately greeted. Our chairs were set up. We were brought cold towels water a service button and water to spray on yourself if it got too hot. Many times they brought around a small snack and were constantly refilling my water without me having to ask. We stayed in a beach villa with plunge pool which I highly recommend. It was spacious and I like having the pool in case we want to go in it after we had been out snorkeling. it is nice to relax in your own space sometimes. Everyone in housekeeping was amazing. Always checking in with us to make sure we did not want anything else or anything extra. Shamem decorated our bed with flowers one day which was beyond our expectations. The food at the restaurants were delicious. And the staff quickly figured out what we liked. They would come by during breakfast and make our dinner reservations for us. The managers and staff were attentive and constantly checking in on us. Even if to just ask how our day was. I highly recommend the half board. The breakfast buffet had every type of food you could think of. No matter what your dietary needs are. I loved that there was so much to do even though the island is small. Even if the weather did not cooperate I was able to fill my day w activities. The turtle feedings and monitoring was my favorite. I am greatful that the staff put up with all my questions and visits. My husband has been surfing with several different companies but this one by far was his favorite. They welcomed us as soon as we arrived. They discussed all the plans with him ahead of time. Gave him tips to improve his surfing. And had the best surfing stories to tell. We went to the spa just to see the facilities and it is on a separate island. It is a must do when we go back. The thing about the staff is they are not intrusive. They are so genuine and sweet which shines through. The heart of the house tour was so sweet. I love that we started in Human Resources and on the wall is work hard be humble because that really is what ALL of the staff does. This tour is basically a behind the scenes tour for the guests. I was also so happy to see the staff being recognized at the managers cocktail hour. That was heart warming to know that even the management appreciates the staff and everything they do. At the end of the trip our flight did not leave until late and they gave us a late check out. We appreciated this immensely since we would have had to shower in the gym instead. Again that would have been fine but they had space to let us stay in the room longer and they did it. Most hotels kick you out at a certain time no matter what. The four seasons just wants your stay to be great and memorable. It truly was.", "offset": [3083, 3167], "date": "2017-06-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "d18a47bf-d51c-4f42-bd18-a8da68d56b7e", "sentence": "Paradise Found. My partner and I holidayed here 24 28 March 2017. It was the best and most amazing vacation of our lives. From the moment we were met at the airport and taken to the Four Seasons Lounge there we felt that we were in very good hands. Even the hotel staff who met us there were super friendly and immediately made us feel welcome. The airport lounge itself is small but it is fine because you are not there for very long and there are soft drinks and snacks while you wait. The boat ride from the airport jetty to the Kuda Hura is short and pleasant. As the stunning view of the azure turquoise waters against the green islands take us further and further away from the stressful reality of our daily lives being on the well appointed boat that is all white with soft baby blue upholstery reminds us of the famed luxury of Four Seasons properties all around the world. As the boat gently comes to a stop at the hotel jetty the first things youl see are the wonderful thatched roofs of the structures of the resorts. You will also see the adorable spa boat that ferries guests to a tiny island where the spa is located just a short disatnce away. On the jetty you are greeted by the friendliest angels the staff of the resort who give each guest their warmest personal attention right off the bat. Their greeting is quite accurately Welcome to ParadiseCheck in is a breeze as you sit in the lobby that looks out to the jetty and one side of the beach and you are served cooling drinks and refreshing cold towels as they brief you about the property. My partner and I chose the Romance package for our holiday which included a romantic four course dinner for two at the Indian restaurant Barabaru. So at check in we were presented with the menu choices and wine pairing options too just so everything is ready for our dinner on the second day. Next we are driven to our sunset water villa one of the electric golf carts that ubiquitously roam the resorts and are on call whenever any guest needs a ride to and from their rooms. It would have been nice if we had bicycles to cycle around the resort but the hotel staff said it was not provided and that too may bicycles around the island would make it seem too busy and less idyllic unlike what paradise is supposed to be. He has a point i suppose. The water villa is a dream within paradise. Beautifully appointed the ambiance of the room was a perfect blend of island chic with modern luxury. The bedroom was perfect with a sumptuous bed and all the modern amenities you could ask for. I loved the reading nook that had windows you can open and jump out of straight into your private pool. On the terrace of the villa we also absolutely loved the over water hammocks from which you can see the fish swimming below you in the crystal clear sea water and we loved the whole setting of the terrace. If I had any improvement to make It would just be to provide a roof over where the outdoor sofa is placed so that you can still sit outside when it drizzles or when the sun is too hot and you still want to be outside but in a bit of shade. The bathroom was spacious with its own access to the deck terrace and the large bathtub also has a view of it and the ocean beyond. The toilet has a hand bidet which for me is absolutely a hygiene essential. The restaurants at this resort are all excellent and because the resort is aware that as guests there you are not likely go anywhere else for the duration of your stay they try to create variety by changing the menus frequently and by having different themes to liven up the atmosphere. We joined the beach side barbecue on the first night and had our romantic dinner set on a private thatch roofed gazebo of the Indian restaurant right on the water complete with a traditional music trio playing live music in the background. We also tried the Italian restaurant and bar which were both amazing. Daily breakfast at the main restaurant Hura Cafe is great with a wide range of local and international dishes available. I loved the smoothies and the asian noodles station in particular. Needless to say all the restaurants were priced on the high side. but then one would not be staying at the Four Seasons if one were too concerned about such things right. Perhaps the hotel should consider a dining inclusive package for guests who just want to have it easier and know everything is already paid for ahead of their arrival. just a thought. The thing that left the most impact on my partner and I however was not the rooms nor the restaurants nor the many activities that you can get into during your stay. What took our breath away was how the staff treated us. There was so much genuine warmth and caring that was evident in how each of them interacted with us. In particular I would single out Irene Johan and Renata who went out of their way to ensure everything went perfectly well for us. They are the embodiment of Four Seasons philosophy of treat your guests how you wish to be treated. When the time came for us to sadly leave this Paradise we had a late flight well after the hotels noon check out time. But Four Seasons Kuda Hura did what very few other hotels would do unles you are a regular or a platinum member of their loyalty program they gave us an equally beautiful room with a plunge pool. to stay at until our departure time at 9 pm from the Hotel jetty. And we are just firs time guests. How is that for clasThat made all the difference for me and I immediately knew then that the Four Seasons Kuda Hura will be a place we would be returning to annually year after year for many years to come. On a final note There was a small incident where I carelessly left cash in the safe of our temporary room and only realized it when I was back home thousands of miles away. I called Kuda Hura immediately but for some reason i was not able to get through. My partner somehow managed to find Johans social media feed and i sent him a direct message explaining who I was and what had happened. Within minutes he called me back on his personal line and assured me that they will assist me all the way. I then was in touch with Renata who was very comforting and assisted me very attentively until the matter was resolved and i received my money back with minimum hassle absolutely no extra charge. I doubt any other hotel in the world would have been able to do that with such ease sincerity and kindness. The Four Seasons Kuda Hura is in one word.

Every staff is sending their sincere warmth in any interactions and always anticipating our needs or wants. This is an additional luxury that we experienced apart from its \u2019 well handcrafted interior villa and very well maintained for it is cleanliness and it is features we stayed in the land instead of the water vilaAnother interesting spot in the resorts is the kids club. Kuda Mas. It is well set up interior design with beautiful oceanic mural and Alice \u2019s in Wonderland theme and their intensives activities is very interesting and educating to embrace the creativity and positivity. I would love to spend my whole day there if I have more time to stay only to retreat my childhood memories. I love the most is the staffs \u2013. well what comes from the heart you must have feel it that they love what they do. From few properties that we visited in Maldives this resort is one that very friendly and fun for the kids to stay. Enjoying our meals with exquisite foods is another experience that we embrace very much. We have no wonder though as we know that the team is being led by a famous world class jury in culinary so that we know we can always expect to the best. We \u2019ve spent a lot of long hours in restaurants and the bar just for a very well mixed cocktails and great views to the shore that we just realized that we have a very good time there not only enjoying the foods and drinks but also to reconect to each other. Moreover the staffs are accommodating our requests very well and very amiable that we feel more like friends with them \u2013 it is a casualty that comes with their professional manners and behaviors. Love. Love. LoveMy highlight for the stay is the water activities \u2013 as I am a very amateur water sport person. Gladly it is designed for any level of difficulties though. Usually I will be skeptical about the safety and all yet to my surprise I really enjoyed them all snorkeling kayaking swimming with turtles. I missed to have the dolphin activity due to my nap \u2013 too bad. Most of it I love their turtle rescue program. how they educate us to have more awareness and responsible for the life of the species. They have a great preparation and presentation before we start our activities that make us feel safe. I will start to snorkel more now. Too bad we have n\u2019t tried the spa though we heard that they are famous for the massage and therapy sessions. I think we spent too much time in the villa for napping and resting. Walking around the island is fantastic that we love the atmosphere and the smells around the island \u2013 it is flowery smells. The most memorable thing that I \u2019ve never experienced before is that on our last day we \u2019ve been taken to the Back of the House tour where we can go inside all of the staffs area the kitchen restaurant to knowing how our breakfast pastries and all the foods drinks supplies are being manage stored meeting with the staffs in their duty as well to the water processing room and electric generator area as well being introduced with their waste management program and much more that we can not see as a guest. All is to give us the glimpse of how they are running a teamwork to maintain this beautiful property for us. I feel overwhelmed and full of gratitude at the same time to understand all the hardwork they do to ensure that we are well being taken care during our stay. Such a great amount of work to make everything happen with great level of quality of services. I feel so blessed to know all of this and leave the island with more appreciation to the staffs. Knowing that I should explore more of the activities in the island though I would love to explore other resorts in Maldives for sure I will go back again to Kuda Hura.

It may feel unfair to mention a few names \u2013 especially since we can not recall all so sorry in advance \u2013 but we would like to give our extra thanks to great staff like Paiton Tsering Rusita Didi Das Ashfan Brian Faisal Rizham Rushdan Faisal \u201c Opo \u201d Baka Mas Sebastian Mare Ibe Maximilian and the kind waiter at the Reef Club who always asked our daughter about her book \u2026 plus many more. We stayed ten days and could have stayed a few days more \u2013 but we are sure we will come back again.

My wife and I spent a restful week at the Kuda Hura resort in November. Before we woke up each morning the grounds crew was out picking up fallen leaves and other debris and raking the sandy pathways so that when you went to breakfast the surroundings were beautiful. The rooms and common facilities were spotless. The white beaches ran down to the aquamarine water which was calm and inviting during our stay. The islet us reef is healthy and well populated by a colorful assortment of tropical fish including many parrot fish puffer fish needle fish more than one species of rays and even some small black tip sharks. Every day we got our steps in when we walked my wife ran out to the end of the kilometer long walkway that ended on the small island where the chef was growing herbs in his small greenhouse. Speaking of chefs I will never forget some of the wonderful meals that I ate at the resort. In particular there was this red snapper that had been smoked over an open fire which sticks in my mind. One day I also sampled a century egg which I can now remove from my bucket list of things I wanted to try. We had great weather while we were there so every single meal was eaten al fresco and served by not just friendly staff but by very special people that made you feel like family. At meals all the resort managers would come by to say hello and make sure everything was perfect. We got to know several of the staff on a personal level and it seems the Four Seasons hiring practices are bang on. Everyone takes the time to treat every guest the same way. Kudos to General Manager Randy Shimabaku his assistant Chanate Khukhan and the wonderful guest services manager Ahmed Nazim. Thanks to Maximilian Schilick Director of Rooms and Maxime Lureau Director of Spa who not only kept the resort sparkling but were warm and welcoming. Thank you to Giovani DAlesandro Director of Food and Beverage Restaurant Managers Joseph Daniel and Branka Novakovic and Rajendra Meravi the Sous Chef. Also warm regards to Das the best bartender in Asia. Special mention to the resident marine biologists that were caring for a large number of injured sea turtles at the resort. The poor turtles had been injured in fishermans nets and got the same TLC that the guests did. We have stayed at many Four Seasons resorts now including the ones in Lanai Bali the Seychelles and Mauritius. They are all different and each one was a wonderful guest experience but Kuda Huras staff standout as the best.", "offset": [1416, 1531], "date": "2020-01-01", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "acaf4d4e-8444-426c-a7f4-520e6a9da89c", "sentence": "Wonderful experience.

We had already been to Kuda Hura three times for surfing and have always dreamt about coming back when we had a baby and we are so happy we did for our fourth visit. The island is compact and service is excellent. Our little one is now 8 months old. She loved the ocean and the island and whoever she interacted with. She was all smiles and giggles. It was just a whole new experience for her after the city life in London. Since the island is quite compact it is very easy to get around with the baby either with the baby carrier or her pram. We had a yoyo so it was perfect for the trip. She does n\u2019t have a nanny and we always took care of her. Since it was our first trip with her we thought the trip would be more tiring and we were ok with it. Luckily for us the team accommodated every single detail and request we threw at them so we could also find plenty of time to relax and even surf. A special thanks goes to chef Raj and his team. Every single day during our stay he personally cared for Palma \u2019s menu as well as ours and cooked custom recipes for us. We thought we would be cooking for her during our stay and brought her cooking machine. This alone took great weight off our shoulders as we are quite particular as to how her food is cooked. It meant a lot to us. Housekeeping was very responsive and fixed minor issues very quickly. Anything we asked for was at our door momentarily. For example the baby crib had to be secured with pads and they did an excellent job with that. Team at Cafe Hura where we spent a great deal of our time made us feel home. if I remember the names correctly the supervisor Ashfan and Weisu were amazing in terms of hospitality and service. A gentlemen at front desk whose name I ca n\u2019t remember arranged an upgraded accommodation as we were initially not happy with the location of our pavilion. Although we had already settled and later decided not to move I would like to thank him for promptly arranging an alternative during the busiest period of the resort. Overall we were spoiled beyond our expectation. I can easily say it already exceeds highly esteemed Four Seasons service. Thank you for that.", "offset": [1752, 1907], "date": "2020-01-29", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 31, "uid": "43b60230-24d1-4c64-957f-9ea23f889aeb", "sentence": "An excellent resort. I recommend you try both FS in the Maldives. As a companion to our stay at Landa Giravaru we also stayed 3 nights at Kudu Hura. I would highly recommend that visitors to the Maldives stay at both resorts to experience the contrast and variety across two locations as well as try out several different accommodation types as oceanfront and overwater provide such stark differences. Landa Giravaru is a bit more \u201c barefoot y \u201d for example. I am usually wedded to high heels and strapy sandals but even I went barefoot much of the time in Landa Giravaru. Kudu Hura is less sandy in the public restaurant areas so guests can easily don footwear if they choose. Kudu Hura is also smaller but does not feel too small. We flew into Kudu Hura from Landa Giravaru on the FS private plane which is a superb service and takes just over 30 minutes in the air between the two resorts. It \u2019s then about 2 minutes in a hotel speedboat from the pontoon where the seaplane drops you to the reception area. Both resorts greet guests royally on arrival. At Kudu Hura we were heralded by a group of musicians before a very quick check incompanied by the excelent Maximilian and then whisked to our Sunset Overwater villa with pool. The view of the turquoise sea from the massive window in your overwater villa is stunning just like in all those hundreds of photos you see and the outdoor space is also excellent with sunbeds a table and chairs as well as a small pool. My one disappointment is that the current is too strong to allow safe swimming straight off your deck. I had expected to be able to gently snorkel straight from our villa but that was n\u2019t possible and we needed to go to the other side of the island to do this. It \u2019s obviously not a big issue to stroll a few minutes but it \u2019s worth making other visitors aware of this I do n\u2019t know if this applies to many or all resorts which have overwater acomodationStaf had really gone to town on our room d\u00e9cor with the sweetest and prettiest welcome in petals and leaves on our bed \u2013 delightful. The other point to mention with overwater villas is that the sound of the water when the tide is high sloshing against the villa is quite loud. It is NOT a complaint it \u2019s an overwater villa after all. but it \u2019s an observation. Lighter sleepers might prefer to be oceanfrontFod at this resort is very good coupled with truly stellar service. Branca in the Reef Club is exceptional. I love authentic Indian food having travelled extensively in India and both the chef at Barabaru and FB Manager Joseph went out of their way to provide the best of the kitchen and we were not disappointed. I also loved the breakfast masala dosa the lunchtime truffle pizza and especially the excellent lobster and Italian seafood delicacies created by the Head Chef Daniele. I \u2019m still dreaming about the lobster carpacio and the delicate lobster salad \u2026. Of course with all that eating exercise is required. The gym was well equipped and quiet and we did a lot of snorkeling. Loads of marine life and you can see lots of fish just walking along the walkway to and from the overwater villas \u2013 we whiled away several hours watching crabs fighting and defending territory eels an octopus squid as well as myriads of pretty coloured reef fish of course and LOADS of safe sharks black tip reef etc. nothing remotely scaryService was of the highest order everywhere. We met some charming young Australians who were the surfing instructors as well as an impressive very international and experienced set of staff. The staff were also very decent people. Whether that was the young British marine specialist who took us around the Turtle Sanctuary or the young chap who advised us against going jet ski ing as the water was too rough to enjoy it. I respect this enormously. It would have been all too easy for mgt to pressure staff to flog a jet ski trip at all costs but they did n\u2019t and the hotel is all the better for thisOf course the day dawned when we had to leave and we departed in great style \u2013 aboard a monstrously large Four Seasons yacht with 4 staff for the two of us. Ah sometimes we can get to live \u201c how the other half live \u201d after alI would highly recommend this hotel especially in combination with Landa Giravaru to experience both superb resorts.", "offset": [893, 1009], "date": "2020-02-21", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}]}
