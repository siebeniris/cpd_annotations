This was my second visit to Vegas having previously stayed at the Belagio and it was my boyfriends first visit. Upon arrival we were checked in quickly and were upgraded to a balcony suite overlooking the Mandalay Bay end of the strip. Room was lovely with a living room area and bathroom had a big bath and walk in shower. We were asked upon check in whether we wanted to be in the east tower or west tower. We requested the east tower as this is on the strip and is where the majority of restaurants bars etc were. We were on the 61st floor and heard no noise whatsoever. Resort fee was around 25 dollars per day and this included wifi access use of business centre fitness centre etc. Concierge were very helpful in printing our boarding passes for us and wifi was very quick. The location of the hotel is great as very central on the strip. Each end of the strip is walkable from the cosmopolitan and there is also a bus stop directly outside the hotel which takes you up and down the strip as well as to the shopping outlets. The restaurant options in this hotel are impressive as there are a mix of upmarket and casual restaurants. We ate in Holsteins one lunchtime and their burgers are good. Would definitely recommend for a casual lunch or dinner. We also ate in the Wicked Spoon buffet which was great much better than the Belagio buffet. Had all different counters eg breakfast Asian desserts etc. Secret Pizza is also great we visited at around 2 am after a night out. We had drinks in the chandelier bar as well as vesper bar and the bar on the left as you walk in the strip entrance. you are looking at around 14 dollars for a vodka and mixer. This did not bother us as pretty similar to London prices. Girls walking around the casino often offering drinks etc also and we really liked the casino at the cosmopolitan. The weather was quite cold when we were there so we did not use the swimming pools I think only one was open and the ice rink opened on our last day which looked great. We had such a great time that we have already booked to go back to Vegas at the end of this year. We definitely want to go to Marquee Nightclub this time around. Would say that this hotel is more suited to a younger crowd. Highly recommend this hotel.", "offset": [1286, 1342], "date": "2015-01-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b8732926-7b90-4079-b093-0f8bbe700317", "sentence": "Great Hotel but not if you have a teenager.

Now the drawback. Not enough fast on the go eats. You have to leave the hotel for that. Also the mini bar thing sucks. They stuff the refrigerator with their overpriced drinks leaving absolutely no room for your own stuff. I had to fill the sink with ice and put my water and drinks in there. I did not like the paranoia of the mini bar guy. He acted like I was trying to pull a fast one over him. The maids are excellent and meticulous.

Our party of 4 arrived to the casino. Two of us decided to sit at the bar and play some video poker before heading to the tables while the other two in our party went off to play. We were at the main bar off of the entry. Let me start by saying we are all professionals in our businesses all were dressed appropriately had not had a single drink and were polite professional had on our real jewelry so we provided no know reason for the bartender to have an issue with us. We can only guess the issue could have been her profiling us as not belonging in this bar. Not that should ever in any case be an issue but. The bartender was a blonde female mid to upper 30s and super extremely rude with a bad attitude. So when we sat down I was not going to stay at the bar so my spouse ordered a drink and began playing the video poker. When the bartender asked what I wanted to drink I told her I was not going to have a drink and \u201c Thank you \u201d anyway. So I started talking to my spouse and after a few minutes I decided to play a few rounds of video poker and have a drink after all before heading to the tables. By this time the bartender was having a very long winded conversation with a women at the end of the bar. I tried to get her attention several times but the conversation just dragged on between those two until finally she turned around and I was able to catch her eye while she was still talking to that person who was not only not playing any games but was not ordering any drinks either. So when she came over to me I had already began playing the video poker and so I placed my drink order. She said in order for you to get the complementary drink you need to bet a dollar even though the machine says minimum bet is 25 cents and no other signage states differently. Before we sat at the bar we looked to see what people were betting and the lady we sat next to and another person at the end of the bar were betting 25 cents as well. So I paced a bet for a dollar and then went back to my 25 cent bet while she made my drink. When she came back with my drink mind you I already bet a few dollars and was continuing on she held onto the drink and said I told you our policy is you have to bet a dollar I told her I did and so did my spouse and then I went back to 25 cents she said no either you play a dollar minimum per hand or you pay for the drink your choice and stood there. I said excuse me. She said either you pay for the drink or continue to bet a dollar per hand that is our bar policy I already told you that. I said I already made a one dollar bet and she repeated herself again like I was a child. So needless to say I was irritated and I said forget it keep your drink. How can you do this without posting it. If this is your policy then you need to make the machine a dollar minimum like others are. Note the lady next to me nor the man at the end of the bar who had been playing 25 cents since before we arrived were told anything about this while we were their. This bartender was so adamant and rude and so the drink went to waste. What exactly did this accomplish. Nothing except for your business to lose a lot of money from us because of this person. So my spouse cashed out the lady next to us that was playing 25 cents cashed out too and left. When I told our friends what happened they got angry too and said lets go. We can not believe the bartender was so rude but let us go somewhere else and play where we all will be treated right. So we left with our pockets full of money that would have been spent at this casino restaurant and went down the street where we were treated properly and the bar tender had no problem with our playing 25 cents a hand at the video poker when we stopped to freshen up before hitting their tables. When we told that bar tender the story he told us that he heard things like this about your casino and that the law states if the machine takes your minimum bet that is it no one can ask you to put more money in the machine that is ILEGALWe found many other casinos that even if one of us was standing watching others play would give us the complimentary drinks if we wanted them. After getting home I spoke to others here that said they had gotten similar response from this hotel and casino employees and would not return. We determined that the problem was I am overweight and unles your skinny starched shirt metro looking they do not want you.

Quiet rooms only a few rooms on each floor. we stayed in the East Side Tower on floor 63 over looking the Belagio fountains having stayed at the Belagio Last year in the Spa Tower we preferred the view at the Cosmo. It was fabulous to have an outside balcony and whilst with the doors shut the room remained quiet with them open you could feel the Buzz of the strip in full swing. Superb views of the fountains and even the volcano erupting at the Mirage. Super bathroom with a jacuzi bath huge shower could have had a party in there. oh err usual twin sinks and separate shower cubicle. The open window between the bathroom and the living area in the bedroom meant that if you were taller than me short. lol. you could see the view from the room out of the bathtub if you stood up. Room had mini kitchenette available with a fridge and microwave which was useful throughout our stay. Two huge televisions One in front of bed and another in living area with huge corner sofa and large writing desk. Huge bed following usual Vegas theme. heavenly in all aspects. We loved the Cosmo and would stay again. the housekeeping was not as Sharp as the Vdara in which our room was not spotless. however we were there to enjoy Vegas not evaluate the abilities of the cleaner to remove every speck of dust from the kitchenette. Pool area great plenty of space and sunbeams. Free entry to Day Club at the Marquee on day with a lesser known DJ was great fun. Equally as residents we gained free entry on the guestlist to the Marquee night club which was equally a good night. Usual pretty exorbitant bar prices compared to our home country Spain. although nothing that was not to be expected in Vegas. We visited the Wicked Spoon Cosmo Buffet and this was excellent in our opinion better than Caesars of course he was not there which was more expensive and we considered that the emphasis was on QUANTITY not Quality so Thumbs up for the Wicked Spoon also. We popped into the restaurant in the foyer for Breakfast one morning on the Way back from Drays nightclub BLAU Super night thank you. we had early breakfast at around 5 am which we both enjoyed again the service was excellent. Would be stay here again. Definitely the location on the strip is superb Views excellent as are the Clubs Restaurants Rooms Service. oh. and the gym the smaller one there are two we did not go to the bigger one.

My husband and I have been staying at The Cosmopolitan since it opened. We enjoyed fabulous stays there and enjoyed the perks when it was a Mariot property. Our most recent stay was a little less than stellar. My husband loves to play cards. He is not pleased with some of the payouts that continue to be commonplace at many of the tables ie 6 to 5 on blackjack the lack of game variety no let it ride and dealers asking for dealer bets Dude I am still down 10. I am not tipping you. Our room was one of the wrap around suites. While nice there were gnarly stains on the carpet and our freezer had some type of caked on brown substance that was not cleaned. Also our HVAC rattled the whole night. I had to wear earplugs. As a frequent traveler to Vegas I can only imagine what the cleaning staff has to endure. But if there are stains that are noticeable enough for paying customers to see it should really be addressed and remedied. Especially for how expensive the rooms are going for lately at the Cosmo. We were there for a business incentive taking some of my husbands employees. In oneof their rooms there was a can left on the balcony that contained chew that was God knows how old. Very disappointing. Customer service has also been lacking. When we checked out we were told our host would review our bill and make sure some of our expenses were comped. We of course need a folio to get a reimbursement for the trip as it was business related. We were told all the hosts were too busy to address our folio and that the charges would be kept open and an updated email version would be sent as soon as our host could address our charges later that day. That of course was not done so my husband had to call Cosmo from his work and was on a lengthy hold. Once he did speak to someone they said he would be receiving the update folio with a 250 comp applied. The folio did come but it did not contain the comp. Again he had to call back and was on hold so long he had to hang up. We are still working on this as far as I know. Cross your fingers for us. The Cosmopolitan is a unique beautiful hotel. The restaurants are a big reason we keep going back. China Poblano is AMAZING and Holsteins knocks it out of the park with burgers and beer.

While this might not sound great it was much quieter than when we have stayed in the Boulevard tower. The check in experience was great we got in close to midnight so no lines. We were given a platinum upgrade to a larger room which I appreciated. We love the people watching and the young crowd. The neighbors were obviously having a good time but werents overly loud. The rooms are well insulated. Bathrooms were impeccable. Room cleaining service was timely. Egslut was a nice surprise for breakfast. If you catch it at peak periods the lines are super long. Hohlsteins was enjoyable as well. We seemed to have caught an especially good rate for the weekend so I feel like we got a lot of value. We rented a car from the HErtz at this location and it went pretty well. The one question I have is why Cosmo charges for parking when nobody else seems to. it is not a lot but I scratch my head on that one. Our favorite place to eat was Yardbird at the Venetian.

Recently stayed here for one week and the hotel itself is stunning. Very nice reception area and casino. Quite loud in areas but you are in Vegas after all. We had a superb room on the 28th floor of the Chelsea tower with great views of the belagio fountains from the balcony. Having been in Vegas before a balcony is a great addition to a room. The room was great and very nicely decorated. The pools were nice and fairly busy the downside for me is the lack of shade no umbrellas unles you want to pay for cabanas therefore only spent limited times at the pool. Another downside for the pool area is having to have a passport for ID to be able to charge to your room. In this day and age I found this very poor as I do not want to have this with me all day when I am between the pool and bar areas there needs to be a better way for this as you have your room key and are signing for it. Very inconvenient. This issue was not limited to the pool but all areas of the hotel bars and restaurants and shopsThe ultimate reason for only 3 stars for the review as the hotel is great is the very poor choices of vegan options at each of the restaurants within this hotel. Buffet was exceptionally poor for the price so we only went once the front of house did offer us to go and look before we paid but said that everything with a v was vegan and the cooks could accommodate us. We went with it as we were meeting our 2 non vegan friends on our first day. No non dairy spread for toast. no choice of anything hot and anything I asked for was met with confusion and sorry no that is not possible fried tomatoes grilled mushrooms. non dairy spread for toast beans. nothing I thought was too inconvenient. Had hummus salad fruit and veg. Not great. Again each restaurant has no dedicated vegan choices I have reviewed a few of them separately due to my disappointment with them. Luckily there was a juice bar for ease of having a breakfast at the hotel before going to the pool.

My wife and I were in Vegas for a week the end of July 2018. We stayed at Caesars Palace but we visited the Cosmopolitan while we were there. My wife had been told that there were a couple of bars in the Cosmopolitan that were a must see when you are in Vegas. We went over to the Cosmopolitan one evening to look around. it is reported to be the most expensive hotel in America at 585 billion to complete. With that as a reference point we were keen to take a loot at these bars. The first one Chandelier 1 was not far inside the hotel off of the Strip entrance. It was a one level bar that had dozens of strands of crystals like a crystal chandelier stretching out across and draping down from the ceiling like a large crystal hat. It was a beautiful presentation. We stopped a moment for some photos and then pressed on to locate the other. We had to go up an escalator to the second floor and walk about 12 way through the hotel. Then this amazing sight appeared before us. It was a 3story high bar that was completely by dozens maybe even hundreds of 40 50 foot 15 20 meters long strands of beautiful large crystals. It was a sight. It looked as if someone built a gigantic Chandelier that was around 50 feet tall and about 60 feet in diameter and then built a 3story bar inside of it. It was crazy. It is one of my favorite bars of all time and I have been in a lot of bars in a lot of different places. We took a set of glass steps down to the mezzanine level of the bar and took a seat on one of the very comfortable looking sofas that lined wall in the circular bar. The sofa was quite comfortable. A lovely young lady came to us right away and took our cocktail orders. We enjoyed just sitting there having our drinks and enjoying the beauty of the bar. When we were ready to go we found that the cocktails were not any more expensive than any other nice bar on the Strip 1525 each depending on exactly what you order. The server was pleasant enough and checked on us several times to see if we needed anything else. We are glad we stopped by to check it out. The casino is a long meandering configuration. It appears all the typical casino games. I did not see a poker room but I may have missed it. I can not offer you anything on the accommodations as we did not stay there.
