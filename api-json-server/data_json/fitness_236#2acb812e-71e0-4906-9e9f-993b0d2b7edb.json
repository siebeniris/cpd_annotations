Wish I could give them six. My sisters and I came to the Whitley for some much needed respite after a harrowing year where we lost our mother and another sister had been diagnosed with the same crippling condition. We chose the right place to renew. The bedding was scrumptious. The television was huge and clear and we could watch our internet services quite easily. The furnishings and decor were beautiful. The bathroom was well appointed and toiletries provided were beautiful. Everything was sparkling clean. I wish we could have left our maid a much fatter tip. They brought a small refrigerator up for us at no charge. The lobby is beautiful. The coffee service in the morning was a pleasure. The pool fitness center and locker room area was simply divine. Little touches like cold water with oranges chilled towels complimentary headphones bottled water a large saltwater pool hot jacuzi perfect sauna thick towels comfortable seating both indoors and out. Fresh fruit whenever you wanted it. Quality exercise equipment well maintained and clean. Location is wonderful a short walk to an upscale mall and restaurants galore. If you want a 30 bagel or a 300 buffet for breakfast it \u2019s a short walk to either. Delightful shuttle driver took us to an inexpensive little spa down the road and picked us up although the spa at the hotel was beyond gorgeous just was n\u2019t in our budgetmaybe someday. The manager sent up a sweet cheese plate with nuts cheeses jams fruit and crackers with some water and the concierge sent us the sweetest box of macaroons in a Tiffany blue box with a ribbon. We appreciated that so much. It made us feel special and we kind of needed that. The doormen were polite and kind. Our only small snafu was at check. in we had an issue with our keys working on the elevator and we found the woman who helped us impatient and somewhat rude. but. with all the wonderfulness we encountered we forgot about her very quickly. Thank you to the staff. You gave us such a wonderful time. We will definitely return. Just as an FYI valet parking is 44 per night but right next door. and I do mean right next door is a parking garage for only 18 if you \u2019re on a budget like we are.

We stayed three nights at The Whitley and enjoyed our stay very much. Check in was fairly seamless. I had booked two reservations because I arrived in town a day early. The staff was able to quickly merge the two reservations into one. I booked a Club Level room and was excited to experience the lounge. I have stayed many times at the Grand Hyat up the street in a Club Level room so I wanted to compare the two. I will say that The Whitley Club Lounge far exceeds the lounge at the Grand Hyat. The lounge is larger and the options for food and beverage are more diverse. Hey he food served at The Whitley can serve as a full breakfast or dinner should you not want to leave the hotel. The lounge staff was excellent and attentive to our needs. The Whitley also has a good fitness center. It is comparable to the Grand Hyat. A lot of treadmills and elipticals. Sauna was a nice. Would be nice to also have steam room. The indoor pool is nice but the heated outdoor pool at the Grand Hyat is much better. Overall our experience was great. I am definitely looking forward to staying at The Whitley again. Would recommend the Club Lounge as well.

While this property feels special and displays a level of sophistication which points to the fact that it used to be a Ritz my experience was pretty much negative. At the end of a conference we were attending in Atlanta we decided to stay here for one night celebrating my wifes 50th birthday. What I learned is that this property is not very friendly to Titanium members and if you stay on points they despise you. Management is not very caring and take their customers for granted. We were upgraded to a room that was not completely repaired. There were huge holes in the ceiling by the bed which were covered with unfinished drywall. I had the feeling that we were in run down motel. Even though I called before and the reservation was noted about the birthday we did not receive any recognition note etc. The Spa supposed to close at 70PM. We visited at 50PM and it was already locked down. Even though they have a lot of people working around the service is generally uncaring perhaps with the exception of valet and bell people. One of the highlights is the executive lounge which reminds you of the Ritz lounge. It is well appointed and the food and service is good. After this experience I could understand why Ritz dropped this property. The owners do not invest to properly maintain and update this property they do not cultivate an atmosphere of service and lack the curiosity to really know their customers. I regret wasting a night here.", "offset": [836, 870], "date": "2020-02-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "fitness"}]}
