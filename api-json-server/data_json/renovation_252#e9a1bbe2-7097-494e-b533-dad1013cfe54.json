We chose W Midtown for its contemporary design and proximity to Piedmont Park for a Saturday night stay. We loved the funky vibe contemporary look and friendly service. However the room maintenance at this hotel is what I would expect at a cheap run down motel. We walked into our room to find sheetrock on the floor where someone had tried unsuccessfully to fix the bathroom pocket door it was a struggle to open or close it. The vanity mirror is hung way too high and the lighted mirror on the vanity in a dark area of the room did not work. It took at least 30 minutes for the shower to drain. And the knobs had fallen off the cute clock radio. it is a shame the W does not take pride in the condition of their rooms because overall we liked the hotel and the staff.", "offset": [198, 290], "date": "2015-08-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "acc65fb1-bd1a-4358-b150-616d6d7eaa19", "sentence": "Fair.

I stayed at W midtown during labor day weekend for a guys trip for falcons fantasy football draft get together over weekend. I have stayed at numerous upscale star wood hotels from Bora Bora St Regis to W San Francisco and really love all the hotel brands under SPG but this was the first time I have been disapointed in the W brand. Initial impression of hotel is tired and needs a significant restoration or remodel. The front desk staff are pleasant but lack initiative when really making you feel like a guest or gold platinum member. Concierge staff was never at their desk to assist guest and front desk staff were not busy other than talking amongst their peers and not walking over to assist their hotel guests again no initiative to exceed expectations and management needs to really work on this as they are missing the standard. Hotel room was beyond poor. room 209 had a terrible mildew smell. sheet rock along wall was busted toilet leaked when flushed and caulking overall appearance of bath tile surround was very bad shape. Overall quality of rooms are just poor and need restoration or just a complete remodel staff need more guidance to exceed guest expectations and overall this hotel management staff severely lacks attention to detail from numerous factors to this poor quality W hotel site. I would not recommend this W location and hope to have better experience when I try either Buckhead or downtown W location in the future.

Staff is very friendly and the location is perfect. However the rooms are in need of updating. First off you can barely see even with all the lights on. The decor itself is cute however it skeves me out being so dark as if it is hiding how dirty it was. Bed was not comfortable the pillows were so soft even when using all 4 of them I felt like I was hitting the mattress. The headboard was all torn up like claw marks or something can only imagine how that hapenedThe water pressure in the shower was terrible and the toilet leaked. The light in the bathroom kept going on and off which was annoying. Watch out for one of the elevators even though it was only for like 30 secs I got stuck in one and nearly had a heart attack. I must mention though that the front desk was very apologetic and I did get a free drink voucher.

We checked in at the W at around 70pm on Saturday December 30 2017. As an SPG member I had requested a high floor and at check in it was not even mentioned we were put on the 6th floor which was disappointing but NYE weekend and a bowl game in town just assumed they were busy. When you enter the room at night time it is so DARK. We located a switch which turned on entry way lights only but the lights in the room are controlled by knobs and black switches on dark wood we literally had to use our cell phone lights to figure out how to turn on the room lights. We were checking out the room which is pretty blah with a poorly made bed per peeve of mine and a big bug crawled out from behind the desk We tried to kill it and it escaped and went back under the desk where we saw food on the floor. I called down to the front desk and let them know about the food and bug and they offered a room change and said someone would come up with our new keys. We waited 5 10 minutes and someone who was very nice brought us our keys and vanished. We looked and we were just moved a couple doors down which for us was disappointing. I feel when you are put in a room that was not properly cleaned normally you get a better room. If bugs were not a factor our new room was worse. We entered into the darkness again just a few doors down and the lamps in the room are nt consistent and had the knob in a different spot. One of the lamps by the bed was just completely missing. The desk lights are 4 small lights controlled by one switch and two of them were faulty and all were missing the covers one was sitting on a shelf. The other lamp by the bed was not plugged in AND the knob was broken and it was the pointy end of a screw sticking out. Again we grabbed our flashlight and located the knob on the floor under the bed and were able to fix it but overall the room was still very dark. Upon further inspection there were holes in the comforter hair on the throw pillow on the couch crumbs in the corner of the couch the bottom corner of the wall near bathroom entrance needs repaired the shelves for the mini bar items needed dusted the glass panel for the shower had something that dripped down the outside of the glass and was nt ever wiped off the water pressure at the sink is too strong and you get splashed everytime you turn on the sink the screws were half out if the vent in the ceiling of the shower the caulk grout in the showere especially one corner really needed cleaned there was a stain on the vanity mirror the toilet paper holder is very wobbly you have to hold it in place to rip off a piece of toilet paper. The shower is a terrible design with no door. There is a glass panel that covers half the length and then the opening is about the same width which lets any and all cold air in while showering. It is freezing outside of the water and the water pressure in the shower was awful I had to part and separate my hair to get it all wet and washed. There are 5 elevators one is a glass elevator on the outside of the building and it is not temperature controlled so when we got that one we had to bundle up real quick because it was below freezing for our stay. On Monday night our last night we were exhausted and read about the restaurant in the hotel and saw from literature in the room they had half off bottles of wine on Monday nights so we decided to give it a try so we went down and there was a curtain drawn and the restaurant was not open. We ended up ordering to go food from the bar which had no drink specials and the food was decent. Our housekeeping service on day 2 and 3 was good and the one on day 2 did wipe off the stuff on the glass in the shower. We had to call down for towels and it only took about 15 minutes which is reasonable for a hotel of this size. The sausage egg and cheese biscuit and lattes from Java in the lobby were great and the complimentary infused water in the lobby was enjoyable. We did self parking in the garage connected to the hotel and we arrived at 7 pm on Saturday and left at 8 am on Tuesday and were charged for 4 full days of parking which I do not think is the hotels fault but it was 88 for parking alone after paying 840 for the hotel room for the 3 nights. That was a lot of moneyand something we decided to splurge on and we were more than disappointed in the quality of the product. Not one employee we encountered asked how our stay was or I would have given them an opportunity to recover. Due to the cold weather which we are not used to we did stay in the hotel for breakfast each morning and for dinner one night and there were several occasions we were in the lobby waiting for our ride and did see employees but they did not engage.", "offset": [1932, 2673], "date": "2018-01-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "0642d240-d368-46e4-b98b-89ea8e524e21", "sentence": "Pleasant but expecting more for the price.
