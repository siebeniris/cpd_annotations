The first 2 night we only had 4 channels to watch. The strip is 10 minutes away if you are driving 30 minutes if you walk. Shuttle can only take 20 people at a time. You would think they would have 2 buses. The driver was really nice in coming back for the 2nd group versus making them wait a hour. Its cheaper to take a cab from and to the airport versus playing 8 each for the shuttle. Our room was not ready so we had to either take 2 queens size bed or a 1 king bed smoking.

The couch in the living area of the room was white in its hey day. However these days it was more of a mother of pearl. It looked sketchy dirty like maybe you should not lay too hard on it. The carpet needed to be replaced as it was dingy too. The room was not dirty it was just everything needed to be refreshed or replaced. Positive the beds were amazing and those sheets were crisp and fresh and the mattress was super comfy. The shower and bathroom were great and spa like. Guest services were great.

For a premier property maintenance is sadly lacking. Room was tired looking for starters the shower curtain had seen its better days. No refrigerator or microwave in the room may I remind you that this is an amenity that even most Motel 6 now have. The ice machine that was closest to our room was broken. Really. You do not keep a spare to swap out when one goes down. If this was billed as an economy property I would say you get what you pay for but when you spend 200 bucks a night you expect everything to be clean maintained and in proper working order. How about the 50 a night deposit. What. I am over 50 stayed in a lot of hotels and never had someone charge me a deposit in case of damage. It gets better how about the 2495 per night Resort Fee that they do not tell you about until you check in. They do not include this so when you are booking online so it makes it look like they are a better value. This fee is supposed to cover the WiFi which never worked might I add. Ok now on to why I booked this hotel. It is pretty much a straight shot to the Convention Center which you could walk to if you felt so inclined. The restaurant Mr Luckys I think has a steak and shrimp special for 77 which is not on the menu so you will have to ask for it. The hotel does have miles of style in the lobby an public areas.

I realize that when doing renovations there will be a certain amount of disruption but I definitely will not be staying there again until I know it is completed. I feel there should have been some way to inform potential patrons of the mess they were walking into so that the customer could choose another location if they did not want to deal. The people were very nice. The staff that I interacted with made the best of the situation. Reason this hotel was booked was due to the proximity of the Thomas Mack center Cox Pavilion.

The hotel was located off the strip so not a lot of traffic which was nice when having to drive to meetings. The hotel also had a smaller casino which cut back on the people traffic and was easy to play at a table whenever I wanted without having to wait. The bartenders were also very impressive I tried some drinks that I have never had before and they could make any drink I or my partners asked for which was nice. The shower in my accommodation was broken and took the hotel two days to fix it after reporting it. I was not able to move rooms as the only rooms open were above an beyond apparently. Also my personal room safe was broken and beyond repair as the desk told me so thank goodness I had a computer lock and Ipad lock with me to secure these items while I was out and about. I was not compensated for any of the problems which was poor on the staffs part and I should not have even needed to ask if that was an option. If I was rating the hotel on the room alone I would have given them a 1 for poor maintenance of their rooms. The desk and management staff could have been more accommodating and easier to work through the issues I raised about the facilities. I did use the business center as well and ship two large packages to the hotel that could not travel with me on the plane.
