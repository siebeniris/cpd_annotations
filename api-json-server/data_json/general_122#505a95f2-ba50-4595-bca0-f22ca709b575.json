The hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing. All in all the hotel was ok for what we required which was basically somewhere to sleep as we had so much to see and do in 4 days the room was an ok size one large extremely comfortable bed that we shared. I had the best nights sleep here. Even the noises from the street and constant sirens did not stop me from sleeping well.

We stay in NYC at least once a year and chose this hotel to get a little further downtown than our normal location. It was also a great deal through Travelocity and we ended up booking a King Suite for 212 a night which is a huge steal. The location was perfect for what we were looking for. It was a short walk from Penn Station a few blocks from the Empire State Building Madison Square Park and the Flatiron Building but it was tucked away enough to be relatively quiet. For the foodies Eataly is a short walk away and Les Halles is around the corner. There were tons of dining options within walking distance and the subway line to get to Broadway was a few blocks away and only two stops which makes it very convenient for the theatre lovers. The major draw to this place is that it is out of the way of the throngs of tourists but close enough to get to everything you want to visit. The room itself is attractively decorated in a modern way and the suite was huge even for New York. The air conditioner rattled a bit but it was mostly white noise. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. We were in the front of the hotel so there was a bit of street noise during the day which stopped over night.

Upon our arrival she recognized us right away even though we had only spoke on on the phone. She quickly welcomed us and took care of us. As a courtesy allowed us to check in early. Once we got to the room we were quite surprised that it was larger than the one we had originally booked. Within minutes we received a chilled bottle of Champagne fresh berries and fruits with freshly squeezed orange juice. WOW what a touch. A birthday card for him and all. Everyone at the front desk knew we were there to get married and they were all very kind. Made reservations to the restaurant Marta downstairs the service was great took a couple of minutes to get our table and we again got champagne for the inconvenience. the pizzas are unbelievably delicious.

For New York these are fantastic sized rooms with huge bathrooms too. The bed was sumptuous and comfortable the room clean and well thought out. It was my birthday on check in day and we returned to our room that night to find a complimentary bottle of proseco had been delivered. What a lovely gesture. The location of the Redbury is fabulous as it is close enough to every part of Manhattan in it is central Midtown area. Complimentary water in the room each day is a really useful bonus too.

The road works outside were from 7 am until 10 pm some nights illegally it went on until 11 pm. bins collected at 3 am a cement mixer or some other loud vehicle outside at 4 am. The windows really need updating to block out the noise. A bittersweet remedy was putting the air conditioner on which was so loud it drowned out the sound a bit bbut again so very loud. I appreciate this is not the hotels fault but warning their customers or offering a quieter room or even ear buds. would have been appreciated. Also the facility charge being high compared to other hotels in the area included very little and we had to ask for our included water bottles twice and our toiletries were not topped up once during a 3 night stay. This hotel has the potential to be a wonderful spot with its excellent location great coffee shop downstairs and wonderful pizzeria on site separate review to follow.
