And I stay at a fair amount of standard mariots. The hotel and rooms were very nice modern and clean. The front desk staff were efficient and friendly. The bar was a good place to enjoy a meal. Staff at the bar were very good. But the hotel had several short comings that knocked the rating way down. First my bathroom had warm water not hot. It was a two day stay and would have complained but thought it would be a one day anomoly. Not so had to bathe and shave without true hot water. Next the workout room was tiny and all of the cardio equipment was in use. Had to wait. Again if a longer stay would have complained and asked to use a local gym. And finally one night I had a headache and needed aspirin. Asked the front desk who pointed me to a closed gift shop. The front desk did not have a supply of aspirin that is poor.

I was in room 41 last night and it sounded like there was a a big laundry dryer next door that was tumbling a brick or two.

If you stay here not recommended I would suggest staying away from rooms that end with 1 eg 41 51 61 etc. They gave me an extra 10 points to my Mariot rewards and moved me to a different room. I originally paid for Wifi for 3 days and now that I have a new room number can not get it to connect. I called the front desk but the phone rang and rang and rang. I hung up thinking some wires got crossed or something and called again. After endless ringing I hung up again and decided to tether to my phone. I do not have all night to wait for them to answer the phone. Finally this may seem minor but when I checked in I said that I rarely use Mariot any more because they have no idea how to process my crazy last name OBrien. The apostrophe just blows up their system and my Mariot Rewards number never syncs. something Hilton figured out how to do a long time ago. The front desk clerk said Yea we are working on that. This has been an issue for years and no Mariot is NOT working on this. This just seemed so disrespectful it seemed like a flat out lie to me. How would he know that they are working on this. I took this as. I really do not care what you have to say so I am just going to tell you what you want to hear.
