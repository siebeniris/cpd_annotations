Hot weather both pool and sea as warm as bathwater and constant sunshineWe arrived very early around 8 am and were given a room straight away. We were even upgraded to a Sea View room. The porter took our luggage from the taxi and to our room very quickly we hardly had to wait at all. Reception staff though not the most cheerful were very helpful and efficient. We did have to request an extra bed for our son as we arrived so early the room that was originally allocated to us was swapped but Housekeeping appeared within minutes of us requesting the bed. In fact Kingsley the gentleman housekeeper who worked on our floor was absolutely wonderful always cheerful and professional in every way giving us a first class service as nothing was too much trouble. Our room was always cleaned before we got back from lunch and all amenities were replaced regularly. The room itself was exactly as on the photos 149. Clean well stocked comfy beds and a good sized bathroom. It was a little bit on the small side with the extra bed but as the only time we spent there was to sleep we had no trouble with it at all. I would have preferred a bit more wardrobe space drawers or shelves in particular as we only packed the basics it was fine but for a longer stay I would have struggled. My only issue with the bathroom was the lack of a hand held shower head. My son is terrified of the shower so getting him to stand under the overhead shower was impossible had to rinse him off under the tap. The room did have a small balcony that would have benefited greatly from a couple of chairs as the view is stunning. The Spa requires a special mention. It was fantastic. Very luxurious both the Reception ladies and the Therapists were so friendly welcoming and extremely professional. My therapist Ni was amazing I went to the Spa nearly every day best Spa experience ever. I am comparing with the London SanctuaryThe food was excellent as well. The buffet meals had plenty of choice and all of very high quality. You do need to book the A la Carte restaurants which is a bit of a pain. but well worth it. We tried Divaz the floating seafood fine dining restaurant it was unbelievable. I was very surprised to find that it is included in the AI. I would have happily paid extra for itWe also tried the Italian so much choice and cooked to perfection. The service in the restaurants though not perfect was so genuine and friendly. In fact the only grumpy service was from the pool barman but then he was working 100 to 180 without a break serving an endless number of drinks and ice creams so I will give him the benefit of the doubt. We ordered a hotel car to take us to the airport. It arrived promptly was clean comfortable and reasonably priced 215 AED. The driver drove exceptionally well compared to the maniac taxi driver that we hired in the airport and even pointed out all the landmarks buildings during the drive. We thoroughly enjoyed our holiday. Nothing was too much trouble food was excellent even to my very picky familys taste facilities were beautiful clean and varied. We will definitely be recommending this hotel to friends and family and will look forward to returning next yearA note on the AI I read many reviews that it is confusing it really is not. In fact it is pretty standard that minibar mini golf motor sports and expensive alcohol are not included. The White Orchid Fine Dinning restaurant is not included but you do get a 20 discount room service is not included either but that was the only thing to surprise me I expected a tray charge or a supplement but that is hardly a big deal. if you are travelling with kids well worth going for AI.", "offset": [876, 976], "date": "2015-05-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "93b923c7-1ea0-41ef-a3d8-9ff8b752262e", "sentence": "Great holiday. We stayed at the Palm tree court a wonderful beachfront setting very slightly marred by distant construction work on The Palm Jebel Ali that by the looks of it have stopped. Myself and my wife have now stayed at this hotel 4 times 3 of which have been over the last three years. This year my daughter and son in law came with us. Please read all of my review as I have put my disappointment first this is a reflection on my stupidity not the hotel. We checked in at 10 am on the 6th July 2015 for 10 nights The receptionist was very welcoming once everything was signed we was told our rooms were ready and that if we followed the bell boy he would take us to our rooms by buggy. On arrival to our rooms we was a little disappointed Palm tree court is made up of blokes of apartment rooms the rooms we were taken to were at the far end of the complex meaning a very long walk back to the main reception area where morning breakfast is served and evening meals. As the temperatures outside was around 38 degrees and never really dropped below this even in the evenings My wife felt that this walk was too much. As I suffer from an illness the room was just too far away from all the amenities for me to walk in the heat all the time. We knew the hotel was not full due to it being Ramadam. I called reception and asked if we could be moved to rooms nearer the main building Reception promptly said yes and would send the buggy back to collect us and for me to pop back into reception as I would need to sign new paperwork. We thought everything was going to well. For us to move rooms I had to pay an extra cost 120 dirhams per night per room without thinking I paid this On reflection this was over and above what the room was worth as we did not care if we had sea view or garden as both views have their own beauty. All we wanted was to be near the main building. The room its self was no different from the room we had first been put in other than nearer the building. For the rest of the holiday all I thought about was paying this extra for nothing. \u201c yes \u201d I should have said something my fault stupid. One other very small disappointment for us was one of the main tree pools was under renovation it just so happen to be the one we loved to visit on our last two visits not a complaint as we understand improvements need to go on and at times it will affect them who are there at the time. Other than the two disappointment above I can only suggest that you give the Jebel Ali a try ever the Palm tree court or the hotel as both are equally as good as each other. We spent the remainder of the afternoon at the nearest pool a short walk away. The pool design is attractive looking out over the sea. We dined at most of the restaurants on the site I can recommend Shooter \u2019s located about 4 km away at the Jebel Ali International Shooting Club. The resort has a complimentary shuttle running every 30 minutes. The steaks were excellent services was exhalant. For the evening the only bar not restaurant open for alcohol after 8 pm was the white orchid bar where the staff are great every one of them no need to mention names as every one of them was as good as each other. Overall my recommendation is no different from my review of 2014 the hotel is still very good. One last comment it was the first time my son in law had been to Dubai and his words \u201c fantastic hotel \u201d.", "offset": [695, 975], "date": "2015-07-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "06c8fd0a-76df-4f7c-ad27-d72945cb52d8", "sentence": "Fantastic all inclusive hotel. I would like to thank all the staff at the Jebel Ali Beach Hotel for a memorable birthday. We stayed for a few nights on all inclusive basis in a sea view room and I must say it is probably one of the best all inclusive hotels I have stayed in. I thought it was a little odd that you had to sign a tab every time you ordered drinks or food when you were all inclusive but it gave us an insight to what we would have been spending had we have taken a different board option. Food and drinks are expensive in the hotel and there are no other shops or restaurants around so all inclusive is the better option. As other guests have mentioned most of the drinks are branded. Soft drinks are given in cans and there are a variety of beers that are served in bottles. The strawberry daiquiris are to die for. There are plenty of sun loungers around the complex so no need to get up at the crack of dawn. If I had to be picky two recommendations would be to have more entertainment on an evening and maybe a furnished balcony. The pool party was good on Friday evening. This hotel is quite a distance from the city but a free shuttle service is provided.

Stayed at the jebel ali for 4 nights and loved the resort. We were all inclusive and dined in the Italian restaurant Divaz Shooters and White Orchid and all of them were brilliant. White orchid was by far the best though. The food and service was top class. The buffet breakfast and lunches at the beach bars also served great food. We went to the roof top bar a few nights and it was great. Good service and a great live band. Drink selection on all inclusive was ok. We took advantage of the activities at the hotel. We went water skiing and the instructor was excellent. A shame it took a while to get started and nobody was around to help him at the end because it was earlyish in the morning. The golf course was also great and well maintained. Unfortunately we did not get to try the inflatables in the water because the weather was not great during our time there but it looked like great fun. The beach was clean and well maintained. Would love to have spent more time chilling on the beach had the weather been better. The sea view room was lovely also and the evening turn down service was a nice touch. The elemis toiletries provided were appreciated. The air conditioning in our room did not seem to stay at a cool temperature so it was quite warm at night time. could not really pick any big faults in the jebel ali hotel.

I am an American living in Qatar so I decided to take a short vacation to Dubai. Since I was traveling unaccompanied I wanted to stay at a location that had an all inclusive package. I do not suggest this hotel if you are someone in their 20 \u2019s and early 30 \u2019s like myself. This hotel is for families and older couples. Checking in I would not say the reception was the friendliest or hospitable. My room was small but clean I \u2019ve stayed in other hotels accompanied in Dubai with bigger rooms for a quarter of the price. The food was okay nothing amazing about it and not all the restaurants were part of the all inclusive package which I did n\u2019t know until I reached my room and read their \u201c Welcome Letter \u201d. The best part of the stay was the room cleaning staff spa staff who made me feel like home pool staff and the Captain \u2019s Bar staff. They were very catering to guest making me feel welcome all though I was alone for the most part. The worst part was the location because it was far from downtown Dubai although a shuttle was available reception concierge staff and the fact that I ran into issues getting my friend on my package deal. They were not willing accommodate even though my friend visited for two days.

Stayed for 4 days here which was enough for us because it is located so remotely and there is little to see or do in the area. We enjoy walking on our holidays to try to work off some of the calories but this was not a good place for that. At check in we were offered a sea view room but we stuck to our garden view because we saw the other reviews about this costing more. They took 100 AED for tourist tax about \u00a3 20 which was annoying because it is all inclusive. They wanted a credit card for this payment but we paid cash. It was a shame that free spa treatments and some other useful information was not explained to us when we checked in. We had an envelope pushed under our door later which had this inside but we only found it by accident as we thought it was just a receipt for our tax payment. We did not take advantage of the free treatments. We took tip money \u00a3 200 which we thought would be generous however the cost of food and drink here is astronomical and so we always felt our tips were maybe a bit of an insult. In order to live in Dubai the locals must be paid a lot compared to UK. Still do not know what the tipping etiquette is here. You have to sign a bill every time you have a drink or food so you see the cost. A pint of beer for example is about \u00a3 11. When your bar bill after a few drinks is \u00a3 100 you feel a bit mean leaving a tip of \u00a3 5 equivalent. do not think many people bother. The hotel is the poor relation of the sister one next door. The Palm. Apparently the rooms are larger there. Our room was adequate but not what you would expect from a true 5. For example you would expect a bathroom mirror that did not steam up and maybe a soft closing toilet lid. This may seem picky but it is expensive to stay here. We also prefer a proper shower rather than one over the bath. The balcony is tiny but although there would be room for a small table and chairs there are none. The view over the car park is not that attractive though. We were sometimes woken in the night by peacocks wailing too. The food and drink though are excellent. They are very generous with giving doubles as a matter of course. In fact you have to ask for a single if you prefer that. The mixers are genuine Schwepes tonic Coca Cola etc. The included brands are all fine. My only wish is that there is an ale choice rather than just lager Heineken and TigerWe ate at the Shooters restaurant which was an excellent steak meal and you have to catch a shuttle bus there 5 mins. We also ate at La Traviata Italian in the basement which was less good for us. Otherwise the main self service was very good and our preferred choice. Captains bar was good for lunch if you do not mind plastic glasses for drinks and we enjoyed the Sports Bar for evening drinks. Everything shuts at 11 and the 7th floor bar is the only place to go. This is indoors and has an excellent in house 3 piece band. For us through we like to sit outside in the warmth because you do not travel so far to sit in air conditioning especially when people are smoking around you yes smoking is allowed insideThe pools are small but nice and warm. The sea is like a bath but sadly almost unuseable because there is seaweed seagrass everywhere except for two small triangular sections that they must have cleared where anybody who ventures in will congregate together Why not clear the whole area. You would expect a beach hotel to have a decent swimming area in the sea. No shortage of sunbeds though so no need for those awful people who have to reserve beds at the crack of dawn to bother.

My advice if you are staying here is to book all inclusive as it could get very pricey if you chose bb. We booked our restaurants 4 weeks prior to arrival. We had a 3 yr old travelling with us and he used the creche on a couple of mornings and loved it and also attended the mini disco on Friday nights 730pm to 830pm. I like the choice of pools and you had a lovely grass area and a beach also onsite. I would love to see a bit more younger kids entertainment or a slide and a couple of waterfalls in the kids pool to keep them entertained and possibly a kids show for an hour each evening so the family can enjoy it together. The staff work very long hours and have a welcoming smile on their face and do their very best to make sure their guests are treated to the highest standard.

This seems to be the one of the only All Inclusive resorts in Dubai. Although this is not in Dubai around 20 mins awayaparently there are shuttles in although we did nt use them. With prices so high for drinks and food it is a good option cost wise although i was keen to see the quality. Summary Pros. The hotel is clear on what is included on drinks and what is nt. There are good spirits bottled beers and wines etc although if you want the high end stuff it is clear with prices to pay. The food and restaurants were very good. Great quality and good choice. Divaz and La Traviata have lovely atmospheres and food. Interconnecting rooms worked well for us with two children aged 4 and 8. The New year Party was amazing. I have been to some fantastic work parties and other parties over the years but this was right up there. Drinks were flowing freely too freely the entrance lighting set up entertainment and buffet was very high end and included in our stay. Amazing memories so thanks to the hotel for that and the fireworks. We took our children who had an amazing time dancing and being treated like royalty. Golf course was really good well kept and not too pricey bearing in mind buggies clubs etc. i thought the service was good from nice friendly people. I really enjoyed a beer in the sports bar after some time in the gym tennis court etc. CONS I am not sure why All inclusive hotels do nt include mini bars as it just means people break the so called rules and bring drinks back. I would nt mind the paying if it was nt back to extortionate prices such as almost \u00a3 5 for a Snickers bar. let alone a beer. It was nt a big thing but leaves an odd taste. Pools although the beach is good and there are a lot of sunbeds a lot are in gardens. IN the winter there are only about 40 sunbeds in the sun around the main and only real pool for families. Fine you may say but you quickly realise that the only way to secure one is to pay the main guys around the pool to reserve them for you at about 6 am. When i came down 2nd day before breakfast 38 were taken so i ended up having to play the game but overall it needs another pool perhaps by the tennis courts.

Ceyril was amazing met us in person immediately and understood my concerns and arranged within a few hours for us to be moved to a new room. He kept in touch by email which saved us having to keep going back to reception. Once we settled in we all quickly relaxed and enjoyed our stay. Dubai Park Resorts was literally 15 minutes down the road so we made the trip over a couple of times. The kids loved the water park and motiongate but we did n\u2019t get time to see Bollywood unfortunately. The hotel is located out of Dubai but there are free shuttle buses provided to Atlantis the Emirates Mall and Dubai Mall which is really good.

The cleanliness and freshness of the room is outstanding. The service offered by the members of the staff all around the facilities is simply exceptional. We loved the pools being heated to a comfortable constant of 29 degrees this made our experience here perfect as the outside temperature was not always too warm and yet we were still able to make our son happy and spend a lot of time in the pool. We also found it very helpful that the resort offers free shuttle service to the nearby amusement parks Legoland and three of the most popular malls in Dubai. Food is delicious throught the various places to dine at around the facility but I personally thought that the pastry croissants danish and even the bread served for breakfast every morning could do with looking and being more fresh and soft. We enjoyed the mini golf experience and we had also suggest that maybe more children oriented activities and facilities would make the guests experience even better as we noticed that there are plenty of guests travelling here with their children I might suggest a water play area for children as well as a dry outdoor play area with a variety of choices for the little ones to enjoy have fun and exhaust their energy would be a great addition. Thank you all for a wonderful experience that we definitely wish to repeat next year.", "offset": [992, 1436], "date": "2018-08-30 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "01107489-ba78-445a-9069-4a7635d8e652", "sentence": "Wonderful Hotel Jebel. We booked our holiday with Travelbag never used them before but would certainly do so again nothing was too much trouble. We flew with Emirates on the Airbus380 which was amazing. so much room and the service was good. Our hotel was about 30 mins from the airport and we booked a private transfer with no problems other than waiting around at the airport for a while. Dubai airport is huge it took about 25 mins to walk to collect our luggage lovely airport though and very well organised and clean. We arrived at the hotel there were drinks and biscuits available and you helped yourself to these while waiting to check in. My only criticism would be there should be a separate checkout desk as you do have to wait a while as they are checking people out as well as in so a good tip is to settle your bill earlier make sure you do n\u2019t have anything else to eat drink before you leave unles you pay for it and you wo n\u2019t wait as long. We paid to upgrade to a better room it was bigger and had a better view. We originally booked half board and upgraded to all inclusive which is a definite must for this hotel we did this with Travelbag in the UK as they charge more when you are there otherwise. The drinks are branded the cocktails are freshly made not those tasteless pre made ones and you can drink as much as you like in the hotel. The food is lovely and plentiful. Lovely buffet breakfast bacon eggs sausages mushrooms hash brown cereal toast fruit cakes you can ask for a latte or cappuccino if you do n\u2019t want the coffee tea they offer you when you are shown to your table. Sometimes you have to wait for a table as it \u2019s busy after 90 but we enjoyed the breakfast every day. Lunch we had next door in the Palm Court hotel restaurant called White Orchid. It \u2019s a buffet lunch and the food is really good quality always a joint of meat roast potatoes and veg. A curry of some sort salad rice other meat dishes amazing desserts sticky toffee pudding crumble marshmallows and hot choc sauce plus lots of other desserts. You do n\u2019t wear a wristband at this hotel you sign every time you have something. We ate in the restaurant most nights and the food was really good always a good choice available and hot. They have themed nights so you get to try different dishes. We ate at Shooters this is a must book direct with the hotel from UK otherwise you wo n\u2019t get a table it is so popular as the food quality and service is so good and again branded drinks as much as you like. The Sports Bar is good you can have a 3 course meal there steaks burgers chips ribs desserts plus lots of others choice of food. Nice change to go there in the evening for a drink and catch up with the sport on TV. We ate in the Italian to celebrate our 30th Anniversary they decorated our table but showed us to the wrong table at first which was a shame but the chef prepared an extra dish for us and the staff were very attentive the food was excellent and plentiful. We travelled to the Atlantis hotel using the hotel shuttle which was nice to see very busy at the hotel with tourists you only see the shops and you can go in the Aquarium which you pay for but that \u2019s all no rooms pool or anything else. You can pay to go to the Waterpark but we did n\u2019t have kids with us so did n\u2019t bother. We went by taxi to JBR only cost about \u00a3 5 and worth seeing. We used the shuttle again to go to the Butata mall and the Dubai Mall to see the fountains and the Burj Khalifa well worth a visit lovely to see. We loved the Jebel Ali beautiful beach lovely warm sea like a bath. Plenty of sun beds towels are free and you can have as many as you want. Nice pool area. Daytime entertainment available and boards show what \u2019s on. Band playing most nights on the 7th floor gets very busy but open until 2 am there is a lady playing the piano most nights near the dining room she is excellent and always looks lovely too. We ca n\u2019t fault the service and the staff here they really look after you and we would definitely holiday here again just wish it was n\u2019t so expensive to get there but it is a lovely hotel not one of the plush ones but you will enjoy it here especially if you are all inclusive you get so much to eat and drink.", "offset": [3724, 3913], "date": "2018-10-14 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "491df5ed-0338-4b27-b380-9ececb8ad1b0", "sentence": "Short Visit.

The JA Beach hotel is quite an old hotel which has had a lot of work done to bring it up to modern status but the experience there was n\u2019t without flaw. The Hotel. Old building vintage elevators and a complete air of old school building and layout. Definitely not a deal breaker but one must know this has been around for decades and it shows age. Not a building you \u2019d want to photograph next to. Everything is wide and laid out in a way that everything is external. The gym. It \u2019s outside the hotel and a 5 minute walk. The Room. Fully updated and is quite modern. It is easy to mistake these rooms are from another hotel once inside. Great layout space and features. Our bathroom looked literally brand new. All the modern day essentials are there and the room service are exceptional at bringing you anything you need. The Service. Top notch great service quick effective and always around to support. Requested many things during my stay and everything taken care off nearly instantly. Bonus points for attention to detail. 1. Stated that we were attending for an anniversary and they had sent out a complimentary cake. Why is that relevant. Because 2. When the cake arrived we called to ensure it was clear of nuts. due to nut allergies and when later called room service for dinner they called back to state it had nuts. Not mentioned when ordering food but they recalled from the cake. Brilliant. Facilities. The hotel sits amongst a few other hotels of the JA resort and are almost all accessible. The gym is far and quite sad looking. Put me off exercising. There are 4 pools in total only one of which is private and all the pools are along the beach. Great for mixing experiences. Plenty of greenery and a stable that \u2019s a walk away. Even if you do not book any riding lessons it \u2019s accessible and can visit to see horses and ponies walking around. Food. This might be their biggest downfall. Aside from the hotel buffet and two signature restaurants there is barely any decent restaurant that is n\u2019t a version of the room service menu. The worst part is some restaurants stop serving food and others start at odd times and finding somewhere to eat especially later in the evening is challenging. I would highly recommend planning meals in advance as it could get annoying. Leisure. There are several activities provided by JA and partners like fishing horse riding and swimming with horses shooting club spas golf and others. Plenty to do. Conclusion. JA Beach Hotel is a nice visit but is n\u2019t great if you want a glamorous and modern hotel. It is far out and there is nothing around to do outside the resort. That being said the resort has a lot to offer but requires a little planning and help from the staff. One \u2019s expectations need to be right as well. This is an old hotel modernized but is still at the essence an old school hotel experience. Recommendations for JA A map to highlight where everything is and how one can move around to reach it. We arrived at night and it was quite dark to figure things out and even during the day it was hard to navigate and we resorted to google maps Rework all restaurants having clear defined and varied food cuisines that operate all day and night long. There are little choices at night and what the hotel provides are all the food there is Work on the building itself especially the outside. It looks super old and the \u201c resort view \u201d is basically views overlooking the parking lot.", "offset": [601, 670], "date": "2018-12-03 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "3b9a1051-245a-41e7-ac93-f857dd4eeb88", "sentence": "Good.

On the whole our stay was quite enjoyable we were on the ultra all inclusive package had a free partial upgrade to 2 rooms of 3 and enjoyed excellent evening dining at the various restaurants. However we were slightly disappointed with the following the drinks package finished at midnight rather than 2 am as previously very limited lunch menu in beach bars compared to September strong persistent smell of cigarette smoke in rooms and 5th floor corridor which we repeatedly reported to staff finally we were asked to pay for one drink on checkout that we were assured was included in our package at the time which we thought was rather petty.

We enjoyed our week overall in this hotel but there are a few things they need to iron out. Our room was n\u2019t set up for our children on arrival late at night but we thought we \u2019d just have a drink while they sorted it. Turns out you \u2019re not allowed to take children into the bar at JA Beach which quite frankly is ridiculous for a family resort. We had to sit outside and it was cold. Over the week remember it \u2019s half term. there were more people sat outside than inside as everyone had kids. The lady serving there is lovely but must walk miles having to bring everything outside. Luckily it got a bit warmer but the hotel really need to resolve this. There also is n\u2019t any entertainment well not that we found. We got sent on a wild goose chase one night on the hotel golf buggies trying to track down the kids disco. every member of staff we spoke to said it was in a different area. We gave up. For a hotel that \u2019s far out from the main city it really needs more evening entertainment. You need to get up early to get a sunbed near the pool as the pool staff allow everyone to save beds with towels. They said you \u2019re allowed 90 minutes with a towel on before they remove it. By 8 am most of the beds had been saved. The food is fantastic the rooms are good and well serviced. The staff are very friendly. There was a bit of confusion over the All Inclusive and it \u2019s tiresome having to sign for everything when you \u2019re not going to pay for it. even if your kid goes to get an ice cream you have to wait for a print out and then sign it. A card to show or wrist bands would make it more simple and the paper being wasted is pretty bad. The pool and beach areas are beautiful very smart and all very well staffed and clean. Our kids loved the paddle boarding and did it most days.
