Be prepared if coming during prime check in hours noon 4 pm for at least a 30 minute wait. In my opinion they should consider locating the concierge desks elsewhere and enlarging the check in area. The hotel is very modern and reminds me at lot of hotels and grounds in Las Vegas. Specifically The M in Las Vegas. Our first room on the 9th floor had construction going on with constant pounding. I double checked the website to see if I missed a construction announcement when booking. I did not there was not one. My husband went to the desk to change rooms. We had just arrived from abroad and wanted to shower and then grab a quick nap. My husband went to the front desk where they said they were not aware of any construction going on and then called maintenance. Maintenance confirmed there was some construction going on around our room. The front desk staffer then said they did not have a room to move us to. We are not the loud and aggressive type guests so rather than argue my husband just asked to speak to a manager. He spoke to the manager and explained the issue. The manager agreed with my husband apologized and instructed the staffer to give us another room. The staffer apologized and explained that they could not do that without a manager approval. I find it sad that the hotel can not empower the staff to do what is right without an approval. We were not asking for a suite and we are SPG gold customers. We then moved to the 21st floor. Room was without pounding nicely appointed and clean. PerfectThe bell staff easily accommodated our request to store medicine in their fridge since the room fridge was not very cold. We enjoyed the pool area after our nap. There were plenty of loungers on a couple of floors overlooking the beach. Service was fine. For dinner we ate at the bar just off the wave restaurant. The two bartenders were fantastic and friendly. The one bartender from Sicily went out of his way to make a drink I had a recipe for from a recent visit to Australia. It was delicious as was the food. While at the bar chatted with other couples. One guy was the son of my history teacher from high school. It can be such a small world sometimes. The next day we ate breakfast outside on one of the lounger areas overlooking the beach. Upon our departure there were plenty of cabs.

There are far too many real 5 hotels in the city for anyone to be wasting their time and money here. When we arrived we had to queue for 25 minutes to check in which for a 5 star hotel in totally unacceptable. We arrived around 215 45 minutes before the official check in time therefore our room was not ready which I can understand during busy summer weekends and had no problem waiting. We went away and had a bite to eat almost 30 minute wait for a plate of cold ham and bread and then at 315 went back to reception to the very long queue. During this time we had a call to say our room was ready however we still had to stand in the original check in queue another 15 minutes just to get our key. We have been allocated room 607 which is facing towards the sea and port. however when I booked i did put a call through to the hotel to ask to be allocated a room facing the beach. I called down to reception to see if we could move immediately we were told it was possible but it would cost 100 euros night tax. which I explained I did not understand if it was the same category. I was then told it was one category up I checked online and the difference was actually only 37 euros night difference. I pointed this out to Joana on the phone and she went to speak to a manager and this was agreed. I left the room for a while to go to the beach and when I came back i had another call from Joana to say actually it would be 70 euros night as i had not booked with the hotel direct even though she said she did not know what I had paid to our agent. the price with the agent was pretty much exactly the same as on the W website but i guess the W received less due to commissions being taken and wanted to recoup this from me. In any case I told Joana this was ridiculous and I was not going to pay it and we could stick to what was agreed or nothing at all. She was not prepared to compromise so we are staying in the original room. We attempted to get a seat by the pool but it was impossible so went to the beach where we had to ask 4 times and wait 45 minutes to be brought water and other drinks we had ordered which was extremely frustrating in the heat. Additionally you have music booming from the pool deck plus different music from the beach bar which is pretty un relaxing and headache inducing to have to listen to different tunes simultaneously.
