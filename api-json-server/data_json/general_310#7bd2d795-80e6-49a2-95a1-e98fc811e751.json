Overall this property was a very nice place to stay for a week in Cancun. It is 20 25 minutes from the airport. The service was mostly great I will get into a few examples where the service was lacking in my review but overall they were fantastic and I would stay here again. The beach in front was very nice and the beach staff were incredible. We had 5 people traveling with us two adults two college aged girls and one 7 yr old. My review will be long but I will try to be thorough. Rooms First the roms we had two rooms that were adjoining. One had a king bed and a pull out sofa and the other had two double beds. The kind bed with the pull out sofa was great for my boyfriend and I and my 7 yr old. They brought a pillow top for the pull out which made it more comfortable. The rooms were good size and the bathrooms were large. Good bathroom amenities including robes and slippers. There was a decent size closet with 5 drawers for clothes. We were on the 9th floor in a premier ocean view room and had an amazing view of the ocean. It did look like almost all the rooms had an ocean view so I am assuming that with premier you get a higher level floor some of the lower levels probably had obstructed views. I would think as long as you are on floor 5 or higher you would have a pretty amazing view. Most of the time the room was cleaned in the morning and then there was turn down service at night. We did have one day where we came back for the night our second night and neither room had been cleaned all day. We called down to the front desk to let them know. The next day each room was cleaned and there was a fruit basket from the housekeeping manager. I assume it was to acknowledge the rooms were not cleaned the day before. We had one other incident with housekeeping on the first night. We pulled out the sofa bed in our room and discovered we did not have sheets for it. It was 830pm so I called down and requested sheets for it. We waited and waited. 20 minutes later I called again and we waited. I called down a third time after waiting 30 40 min. They assured me they were sorry and would bring some up. About ten minutes later I called once again but as I got on the phone I finally heard a knock on the door. So overall I was not overly impressed with the housekeeping service. Pool Beach Cabanas We rented a pool cabana the first day and then rented a beach cabana the next several days. The cabana was the way to go. It was 100 rental plus tip each day but well worth it especially with a group of 5. The cabana rental also includes a fruit tray and water ice for the cabana delivered when you choose. The pool cabanas are like a big bed but also include 4 very comfortable lounge chairs with them. The beach cabanas have 4 lounge chairs in each cabana plus 4 more outside the cabana. Carlos helped us each day we had the cabanas and he was great. Very friendly and always so helpful. The waitstaf was very attentive both when we had cabanas and when we just had chairs by the pool or ocean. The pool was very nice and warm most of the time. It is mainly one big free form pool that goes from one end of the property to the other with an infinity pool at one end. There was also an adult pool with a swim up bar on the other side of the property but we did not use it since we had a 7 yr old with us. The ocean had red flags all week but we were still able to get in and play around a little. My 7 yr old did as well although she got knocked around a little she is a really good swimmer but I made sure she was never more than a arms length away from me. She loved boogie boarding on the waves. Restaurants Breakfast. Sedona Grill We ate breakfast all mornings at Sedona Grill. Breakfast was either a buffet or off the menu. We prefer off the menu but this may have been a mistake as it was relatively slow most of the week. We had two very bad service mornings over breakfast. Both days we had the same waiter so I am not sure if this was the reason. It was clear others around us were having the same issues. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out. The first morning this happened it was clear someone forgot our food sitting under the heat lamp because the eggs benedict were so over cooked they were not runny at all. We sent that back. The rest of the food was ok as it was mostly just scrambled eggs and bacon. The second morning it took over 30 minutes again and we finally said something. They started bringing us things we did not order to make up for it yogurt parfait fruit etc. It did not really help matters though. We just wanted our eggs at a decent time. I realize the manager was trying to make up for it but it would have been nice to have decent service to begin with. As it was two days in row I wanted to mention it in my review. We are typically pretty patient people especially my boyfriend and this was a frustrating way to start the day. If we would have been there any more days we would have gone elsewhere for breakfast for the remaining days. Sedona Gril dinner We had a much different experience at dinner. The food was excellent and the service was decent. We are platinum elite status at Mariot so each dinner we had they would bring us an additional appetizer to thank us for being platinum elite. It was a nice touch. We ate here twice during our stay. Mikado Dinner This is next door at the Mariot and is a Japanese restaurant. They cook on the table in front of you. They also have sushi. We had a really fun night here. The drinks were great the food was wonderful and the service was impeccable. Our tepanyaki chef was the best one. He put on a great show that everyone enjoyed. Definitely a must do if you like this type of food. LaCapila Argentinian Steakhouse Dinner This is also next door at the Mariot. We went here for a date night and had a great meal and good wine. Service was very good here as well. Kids Club My daughter went to the kids club at the Casa Magna Mariot next door. She enjoyed it. The room they held it in was a little dingy but it had an attached outside area with a playground. They did different activities each day making pinatas making kites origami cooking which was decorating cookies etc. Each day they go to the pool for an hour as well. I think she enjoyed it but would have had a bit more fun if there were more kids her age there. Overall it was a good value though at 35 per day plus tip days ran 930 430. It was nice for us too because we knew she was having fun and we could relax at the beach a little. Overall the property was really nice and it is nice that the Mariot is next door as it opens up your options for dining if you want to stay at the hotel. The service was mostly good. I think the few bad things I wrote about you have to chalk up to just bad seeds or bad luck. We would definitely recommend this hotel and we will most likely stay here again.", "offset": [2070, 2121], "date": "2015-01-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f7072f99-e808-465a-aa5a-8917b15d0e5c", "sentence": "Great Hotel as always.

R2 takes you in town right past Sorianas and Chedraui and very close to Walmart and goes right into Mercado 28. Just tell the driver who does make change where you want to go and he will call your stop. See my comparison review of Sorianas Chedraui and Walmart under Chedraui. Food was suprisingly good given mixed Trip Advisor reviews. We found the polside and in room dining were both very good not five stars but what do you expectService excellent as noted above. Pool cabanas USD 100 for all day which gets you a huge comfortable lounging space and 3 or 4 lounge chairs which are indeed VERY hard to get otherwise all in full shade bottled water in ice bucket and a fruit plate. The not so good. Furniture. as others have noted on TA the rooms do need a refresh. Sofa looks like it is from the 70s. Layout is great but furniture VERY tired. Dampness high humidity in the room to be expected but means you should bring extra hangers so you can hang all your clothesPol chairs. as others have noted the chairs are all reserved by around 7 am. even though they are not really occupied. People like us. make do by just putting stuff on ledges etc and I appreciate this is hard to monitor but the resort does need to come up with a better system for this. We saw some people get VERY angry about it they need to read Trip Advisor before they come Sewage smell coming from the toilets thank goodness for air fresheners we picked up at WalmartOVERAL Still gets five stars as it is truly a terrific property.

We stayed at this hotel from 07032015 to 18052015. Our transfers were included as part of the Club 91 package and on arrival we spent 20 mins or so trying to locate our driver then we waited another 20 mins or so for some other passengers for Casa Magna Mariot next door. We had spent over 14 hours travelling so we were very tired and on arrival at the hotel we were promptly greeted but then left to our own to find the Club 91 check in. We finally got checked in by Walter at Club 91 but due to issues with our credit card and the fact we were tired we did not know the full advantages of Club 91The rest of our trip was amazing. The next day German sorted out the issues we experienced with our credit card. Throughout the trip we were taken care of like royalty thanks to German Yecora Jesica Erika I can not remember the other names sorry. Our taste pallets were carefully taken care of Luis Club 91 chef and if it was up to me I would have taken him home with me. Luis was absolutely fantastic and we can not thank him enough for the wonderful smoothies omelettes every morning and all our meals were fabulous Luis was prompt in telling us what was for the evening meal and if we preferred alternatives vegetarian. His colleagues Alexandre Carolina and all the kitchen team at Club 91 are the best we have come across. I did meet the head chef of the hotel who was very receptive and friendly too ensuring his team provided the best food and service thank you. The spa is nice with lovely facilities and we took advantage of the couples massage where you get chocolate covered strawberries and champagne simply divine. We had a massage from Monica and Antonia who both have great skills. I used Monica on a few occasions as her massages were addictive. Our room attendant cleaned are room well thank you Heber. We were here on a spring break and this is the busiest most commercialised beach resort we have been too. I was not too keen at the fact it was busy but I did like this resort. One major issue this hotel has is the loungers are reserved by 630am we did get up early to reserve although this was not our preference. On one occasion a member of staff at the pool moved our books when we were away for less than an hour watching Jason Derulo next door which we spoke to Carlos about. We never saw this happening to anyone else also our book went missing.

My friend and I stayed at the JW Cancun for one night last week on the 25th. We only stayed one night because we managed to score a ff rate at the Ritz for the remainder of our trip which we were very excited about. However only staying one night is no excuse for service to be compromised the way it was at the JW. I personally would consider the JW and the Ritz of a similar caliber so I was very surprised when the customer service at the JW was as bad as it was. When we checked in my friend let the front desk know that our trip was for her birthday I had also made note on my reservation but because her birthday was midweek and a few days before we arrived we were told The birthday thing does not count. whatever that means. But essentially I am assuming they meant they would not go out of their way to do something nice for her birthday. That was extremely disappointing I have never had a hotel blatantly say something did not count when they could clearly see her birthday on her passport and see that it was just a few days prior. But on the grand scheme of things that was minor. The true nightmare was the room. The humidity was almost unbearable with the door open. There is a warning on the door that says things in the room may become damp and slippery if you open the door. but that was an understatement. the WALLS in the room were dripping wet. All mirrors fogged. The linen was damp and the bathroom floor became a death trap. You literally could not walk on it without slipping. But the absolute worst part was the PAPER THIN walls. I could hear the entire conversations of the people in the room next to us. I could literally hear them making skype calls and yelling about a bad connection. ALL. NIGHT. That for me was the intolerable part. I can not sleep with tons of noise so I barely slept. The beds were horrid and squeaked every time you rolled over and the pillows had a terribly musty smell that kept me up all evening. All in all I would say if you can afford the JW mariot you can likely afford the Ritz do yourself a favor and go for the upgrade. This JW mariot is not in line with JW branding.

I will start with the few areas needing improvement we arrived about 60 min after check in time and were informed that our room was n\u2019t ready. In the end our room was n\u2019t ready until about 225 hours after check in time. This was after I used the online check in \u2026. so I \u2019m not sure what the point of the online check in was. Since online check in sets some expectations prior to and on arrival it might be better not to have it as a possibility during peak times. However I will give high compliments for Marsela and Elizabeth at the front desk as I believe they did over and above their absolute best to try to make things right. And along the way they were very courteous and professional. The staff outside are fantastic. Pool deck. Carlos and all at the pool desk are very attentive and responsive. These are people you look forward to dealing with as they clearly enjoy making people \u2019s stay better. On the day we went to Tulum Carlos was actively looking for me and calling our room since a cabana opened up. Pool Beach wait staff. Jorges Miguel Amber and so many others are excellent. They are very hard working and exceed expectations at every turn. Other resorts I have been to Turks Cayman Aruba use a flag system to get attention from your chaise and I early wondered if they should have used this. But the reality is the staff are so attentive and working so hard getting an order in is not an issue. Our room 39 was a very nice JW suite and well taken care of daily Carlita. Maybe. As has been mentioned in other reviews if you want a great view try to get higher up. But we were out and about this great resort so much and spent so little time in our room it made very little difference in the end. Christopher at the bell stand was very helpful when some confusion arose with our car service. Finally a word about Guilermo Canto The man is an outstanding example of a service oriented leader. Early in the stay we had an issue with a reservation and delay. He recognized the issue and stepped in immediately to resolve it. But it does n\u2019t end there as through the rest of the stay he wanted to make sure things were right. As this was our first trip but not our last to the JW Mariot Cancun I would agree that the service is top notch. The entire staff \u2019s commitment to service professionalism and attentiveness is a culture that is difficult to get and maintain but somehow they do it. I agree with others who say there is little reason to eat elsewhere. We had excellent meals at Sedona grill Mikado twice and at Sasi Thai.

He knew our name and that we were Rewards members so obviously he was affiliated with the hotel. From his call it seemed like he was a time share pitchman. We inquired about him at the desk in the club level. It would have been a vacation package pitch. We have no interest in a time share and did not go to pick up the coupon book. I would have felt better if he was up front and disclosed that if we would take some time to hear about their vacation packages he would give us a coupon book. Instead he acted like it was a gift from the hotel as a thank you. We were disappointed that a hotel the level of a JW Mariot would be pitching time shares in that manner. In the evenings we would stop in the lobby area bar where they had live music with a piano player and singer. They both were very talented.

The pool was perfection and clean and the cabanas were lovely just like in the promotional pics. Trust me everything is just as it looks on line.

My boyfriend and I booked a flight to Cancun for my 24th birthday months ago and then the search for hotels began. I went through TripAdvisor saw JW Mariot and all of the great reviews then we reserved a room. But then a couple of days before our trip I came back to check TripAdvisor reviews and saw many negative ones about the construction. I was so deterred in fact that we almost stayed somewhere else. I am SO glad we did not LISTEN. If you are reading this I would advise you to take the highly negative reviews with a grain of salt. First of all the hotel is very clear. Yes they are doing construction. However it is only during the day when you should be out and about anyways they always stop at an agreeable time at night and then it is silent until the next day. This being said I still managed to get a couple of 2 pm naps in even with the noise. It was not that loud and it is not that bad. The food at Sedona grill is delicious the oceanfront room that we were in was beautiful and we loved the pools. We mostly stayed in the infinity pool. I also got a massage at the spa and swam in the indoor pool when it was completely empty it was one of the most peaceful experiences I have ever had.

I booked my room on Nov 16 and called the Cancun resort to confirm my reservation and book a shuttle. The representative confirmed both my stay and shuttle pick up. I woke up for my flight at 5 am to an email addressed to a misspelled name saying that they did not have my reservation and therefore could not book my shuttle. I emailed my confirmation details and never heard back. I called the resort again at the airport using paid Skype credit and they could not find my reservation and told me that is why there would be no shuttle picking me up. She transferred me to global reservations who was able to pull up my details immediately and she did not understand why the resort could not do so. I called customer service to share this experience and the agent I spoke with was rude and did not seem to care for the trouble that I have been going through with this booking up until the moment I got on the plane. She then told me that she was on the site and that the resort does not offer shuttle service even though I spoke with two different representatives at the hotel who said there was a shuttle service. The agent on the phone basically said I was wrong and that a shuttle did not exist. I asked to speak with a supervisor and she told me it would take a while and that whatever she said was what the supervisor would repeat back to me. I have never heard of this and most companies in the past have honored my request to speak with someone else supervisor or not who is at the very least understanding and not combative. She ended up calling the resort and did CONFIRM that there is a shuttle service that they use third party. She did not apologize for her disrespect and rudeness and the fact that she was incorrect. When I landed of course I got ripped off by airport taxi because the hotel failed to book a shuttle for me. When my taxi drove up to hotel security they could not find my name on the reservation list and I had to wait ten minutes before being allowed to drive up to the property. When I arrived they were unable to find my reservation and I was asked to wait. Finally they found my reservation and they apologized for the wait. After all of that I asked to speak with a manager to fill him in on all of these details. The woman I spoke with said I could fill her in. I told her everything and she upgraded my room to a higher floor I know that is technically considered an upgrade but after telling me I did not have a reservation up until I arrived at the hotel is a major problem.

I was told by the resort representative that they could not arrange a shuttle and Good luck getting to the resort. without sharing any options. I had to ask specific questions Are there taxis. Are there shuttles. How much are each. How long does each take. Is this how JW Mariot serves clients whether or not they are loyalty members or staying for one night or a week. None of this should matter a client is a client. I do not even want to stay at the resort anymore and I will most definitely be sharing this experience as reviews so that other travelers are aware of the trouble it takes to simply 1 Confirm a reservation 2. Get help getting to the hotel. Update I joined my friend in her room for the remainder of my trip. When we got back to the room after laying out I turned on the bath and she took a shower. I noticed the bath water was brown and called reception. They sent a technician who confirmed that the water was brown and it took him an hour for clear water to flow out from the bath. When I asked if the shower was the same water he said yes my friend had showered in brown water. We called down to speak to a manager about this. They offered 50 room credit. When I went to finally take my shower there was no cold water. They sent the technician again who basically took about the shower and was hammering causing a ruckus for another hour. He told them that he would not be able to fix the problem soon. We were forced to move rooms and they positioned this also as an upgrade because it was on a higher floor but the same room layout. We were finally in a new room and wasted four hours because the hotel was unable to resolve the plumbing issue. The general manager was off duty and we asked to speak with him the next day to ask what could be done to compensate for showering in brown water and wasting four hours. The next day all he could offer was 50 credit for the room. This property and the management clearly do not understand andor care for basic customer service. We spent a total of 20 hours and hundreds of dollars to get to the hotel waste four hours and not have the privacy of our room and you offer 100 credit and an upgraded room. Also note that there is construction all over the property. See pictures of dust on the pool floor of the property and know that many floors are undergoing very loud construction. Update 2 I ended up getting major food poisoning when I returned home. I called and emailed the hotel and general manager to ask if there were any other cases that were reported. I wanted to find out more detail and was not accusatory in any way as I know these things happen during travels and are sometimes difficult to pinpoint. I still have not heard back over a week later. I hope this helps with your decision if you are even remotely thinking about staying at this property during your trip to Cancun.", "offset": [395, 450], "date": "2018-12-02", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 31, "uid": "ca33db6c-23db-4b55-8812-f95b1231136f", "sentence": "Nice place. Just got back from a 4 night stay over the new year holiday. Thankfully almost everyone checked out on 1119 as the staff was very overburdened and it was crowded. After then it was quiet and nice. The size of the hotel was great as it did n\u2019t take forever to get anywhere and the elevators were fast. People were complaining about construction but it did not bother me even one bit. Not a problem whatsoever. Maybe if your room was right next to it but it was going on maybe 5 rooms down from me and it did n\u2019t interrupt a thing. The room was nice and a standard nice hotel room. Each room seemed to have an ocean view balcony. I did n\u2019t go in the pool because I prefer the ocean. It was easy to get a chair under the umbrella and the service at the beach was really lovely. One thing I did n\u2019t expect was the wind and the tremendous strength of the waves in this part of Cancun. I usually stay in Riviera Maya area and it seems like this area is a lot calmer in terms of waves. I will try to stay in that area again because I much preferred calmer waters and also an all inclusive experience but there was absolutely nothing wrong with jW Mariot at all.", "offset": [313, 394], "date": "2019-01-05", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "3140137d-0adc-402e-b65c-1100f21caeff", "sentence": "Great stay at the JW Mariot. We just returned from a stay at the JW Mariot. We stayed on the Club 91 level lot of options for breakfast and snacks. We went outside the resort for dinners came back for the happy hours. Airport pickup and drop off is included for Club 91 level guests. Be advised that there is a an extra charge for kids over 5 years old. We did not know about it till we got the confirmation email about our hotel pickup. The staff at Club 91 are friendly accommodating and polite. Luis the cook went out of his way to help. Rooms and bathrooms at the club level are spacious and include a balcony with two chairs. Pools were busy and full during our visit but there is an adult area with plenty of space. Drink waiters are friendly and fast the cost is the typical resort price. Plenty of food options in and around the hotel. We eat at the thai restaurant at the neighbouring Mariot. Highly recommend it. We also walked to a place called Tora close the hotel beautiful views and great food. There is ongoing construction but it is barely audible or noticable.

It \u2019s like a bed. So comfortable. And they is plenty. I always dislike the people waking up at 6 am to go put towels and a cheap books on 5 chairs then go back to sleep for 2 or 3 hours. I never had a problem getting a good chair. Even tho people still go down and reserve chairs. Now here a secret for you. They is a amazing indoor pool with a big glass wall looking at the sunset. I been to that JW about 4 times and never seen anyone in that pool. And it \u2019s real big and do n\u2019t have that smelly chlorine smell. So. It \u2019s like my private pool.

This resort is beautiful and it is much more sedate than nearby properties no loud music playing at the pool lots of cushy lounges and excellent and friendly service staff. Our JW Junior Suite on the 10th floor had a beautiful ocean view and a lot of space the bathroom was large with a separate shower and tub. The hotel recognized our anniversary in a couple of special ways which we appreciated. The public areas are bright and spacious and unlike the regular Mariot next door all rooms were entered by interior hallways. Some small issues there was no light on the balcony so no nighttime reading with the waves lapping in the background. Twice I was chased off the balcony in the daytime by nearby smokers one cigarette and one marijuana. And as a Platinum Bonvoy member the only real perk I got was continental breakfast every day the full buffet was available for an extra 12 person. The continental breakfast was nice certainly a step up from a Fairfield Inn or something. But there was no lounge access no spa discounts and really no other benefits. Tip there are nice restaurants next door at the regular Mariot that you can also charge to your JW room. However you can not change currency at the Mariot if you are staying at the JW which seemed weirdly inconsistent. Also we preferred the JWs Beachwalk restaurant to the Mariots SacBe Beach Shack next door. As with all hotels on this strip there was a serious seaweed problem while we were there which made walking on the beach much more challenging.", "offset": [1222, 1335], "date": "2019-08-04", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 37, "uid": "5b209a0f-239d-4352-a915-e98704a83ef5", "sentence": "First time trip and certainly not the last. This was both a new experience in terms of vacation and hotel choice neither disappointed. Our arrival at the JW exceeded our expectations from the hotel and we accepted the suggested offer to upgrade to a suite at a reduced fee. This was a great decision. The suite had we understand recently been part of the hotel refurbishment and was certainly one of the nicest rooms we had stayed in particularly the bathroom etc. Our travel preference is where possible to avoid large hotels but given reviews we had read we decided on the JW and were not disappointed. We dined in the hotel on our first night as there was a Mexican buffet and met our waiter Ricardo who excelled with his service and information. Luckily for us he was also around for breakfast during our stay and made a point of ensuring all was ok even if he was not personally in our vicinity. All staff that we met without exception provided excellent service and appeared always willing to stop and chat and provide good local knowledge. Special mentions to Miguel at pool bar and Mayra at Italian restaurant. The measure for us whenever we stay is not necessarily the hotel and amenities but the service and well done and thank you to all JW stafWe will return to both Mexico and only stay at the JW.", "offset": [0, 43], "date": "2019-09-25", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 38, "uid": "994ca8b0-6da1-4786-a5a8-51e26b8b5e64", "sentence": "Great Service.

Overall this property is great. The rooms are recently renovated and large with beautiful decor. The bathroom in particular is a show stopper although the shower is super dark. Wifi worked very well throughout the property at the pool and even on parts of the beach. Check in out were smooth and efficient. Gym was adequate with a nice view of the ocean. If you are a Mariot loyalist like me and are debating between the JW and Ritz the pools at the JW are much nicer and the decor overall at the JW feels much more modern and beachy. We visited the Ritz for sushi and were very happy we chose to stay at the JWThere are a few reasons I gave the hotel four stars instead of five. They are it is ridiculous that as a Titanium Elite Mariot member I did not get access to the lounge Club 91. They call it a boutique hotel within the hotel and wanted an extra 250 night for it it is BS. As my arrival gift I chose free continental breakfast at the Sedona Grill and it was mediocre at best. Pretty much only drank the cofe I like that the rooms have nice tile floors as carpet at beach hotels grosses me out. But the insulation between floors was lacking and I was woken up every night by the person above me walking in heels and what sounded like furniture moving I got a massage at the spa that way below average. At 180 USD including tip it felt like highway robbery. Additionally the steam room which is my favorite part of visiting spas did not work While the main pool seemed to always have chairs available the adults only pool chairs were almost always full. There needs to be more adults only space which would be easy to do because the for rent cabanas and chairs were hardly ever rented and should be converted into free additional adult only space.", "offset": [735, 843], "date": "2020-01-28", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}]}
