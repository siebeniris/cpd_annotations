Pros. The staff was vey friendly and helpful. The grounds were quite extensive and wel landscaped including a firepit. The Broad Street Grilles food was a good quality at both breakfast and dinner. This location is within easy walking distance of the Convention Center which was the hub of our activities. Some rooms not mine must have a good view of Lookout Mountain. Cons. The hotel has no airport shuttle which makes it expensive to get to. There is not much to do within walking distance and the electric shuttle does not pass by the hotel. The beds like many hotels I have stayed in recently must have some sort of plastic mattress pad that generates heat and makes it hot to sleep in. This combined with the new trend to give you only one layer of covers makes for a night of throwing off the covers and putting them back on again.

The food would have been better cooked at a waffle house. It also stormed while there. very common in the afternoons in Chattanooga. The in room tv was always out during these long storms.

We brought jigsaw puzzles sat by the huge fireplace and puzzled the whole time.

There was mold and mildew in the bathroom cracks in the tile hair on the nightstand etc. Trying to not trip on carpet that is sticking up throughout the hotel is like a local obstacle course.

The bathroom tub grout was less than clean and the check in process was extended because there was only one employee at the desk who was clearly overwhelmed with a ringing phone.
