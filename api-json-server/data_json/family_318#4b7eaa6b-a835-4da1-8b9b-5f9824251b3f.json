When we got to the check in desk we were told even though we had a copy of our reservation that there was no reservation under our names the lady Arlene was so unhelpful. We had to put the first night accommodation on my credit card with reassurance it would be sorted the next day. I got in contact with the travel agents who told me it was all sorted so the next day I went down to the reservation desk to be told again that it was not sorted this time spoke to another unhelpful lady called Shawn. At this stage I was quite annoyed so I managed to get someone from the travel agents to come down to the hotel luckily there was someone there from the travel agents staying in a different hotel it took almost 2 hours for it to get sorted meaning we had lost 1 12 days of our holiday. Luckily this experience did not put a downer on our holiday for the rest of our time we met some lovely people experienced exciting day trips and overall had a great time.

I think you should extend your acceptance for valet parking to include handicaps to accommodate the elders who can not walk far. Also the srop off area was bery disorganized. You should have a lane for hotel regustration hotel drop off and not just taci lane. I dropped off my parents near the door and hot honked at many time by the cara behind me. 2.

We checked in at the Diamond Seven Stars check in lounge. I had reserved one of the newly remodeled FAB rooms but we were upgraded to a GO Room with what turned out to be just an ordinary tub. Not a soaking tub not a jetted tub. A run of the mill tub. To start the carpeting in the hallway of our 20th floor room was coming up and had raised ridges the full length of the run of carpet. It was a major trip hazard especially for the elderly. I am shocked the hotel would allow this given the liability risk. Upon entering our room the light fixture over the bed which has 9 bulbs had 3 bulbs out. Someone eventually came up and changed those. The sink in the bathroom backed up immediately any time water was run. The bathtub did not draw hot water while the shower stall had water that was scalding. The safe in the closet was not affixed to the wall with anything anchoring it so it was easily picked up. I never felt safe putting anything into as easily as someone could make off with it. And the carpeting inside the room looked like it may have been from when the Flamingo opened for the very first time. Now heres the kicker. I immediately went downstairs to the Diamond Seven Star check in and told them this room was awful. The woman behind the desk who clearly did not give one iota that there was a problem based on her expressionless reaction turning to one of annoyance gave me two options. I could wait and they had send engineering to deal with all the problems or as she put it and no this is not made up she could DOWNGRADE the room since this was an upgraded room. So the upgraded room has this number of problems. what is the downgraded room include black mold roaches and blood stained sheets. Who offers to DOWNGRADE your room. At the worst she should say she had move us to another room in the remodeled section of the hotel and that the room might be smaller and not include a tub. I work in a customer service oriented field. You do not openly offer to give an inferior service product when there is already a problem with the existing one. And I know she could have done more. The hotel was not to capacity during our stay. The hallway we were in was like a Scoby Do ghost town.

There is a pothole near the cross walk to the Ride Share area. I tripped in it Monday night Jan 13th and bruised up my forearm and hand and jammed my shoulder.

We went back to the area to finally get our ride as we were now almost late to a show and the taxi driver there said that he saw two other people fall in the same hole that week. That makes 3 of us being hurt in one week. The next day I reported it to another security guard and he said he might mention it in the morning to his team. I love the Flamingo but even if the pothole is on city property as the security guard told me a cone should be over it and the city should be told. Its not worth a law suit to the hotel nor is it good that people are getting hurt. Keep in mind I fell in front of a taxi. I was looking at its bumper. If my family was not there and no one saw me I could have been run over by a car. Please take care of this issue. Its a simple one to fix.
