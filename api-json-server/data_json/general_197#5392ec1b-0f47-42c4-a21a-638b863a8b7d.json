The location of the hotel is great within walking distance of the fantastic new Markthal Blak station and the cube houses. there is a public parking garage right in front of the hotel. The staff was nice and very helpful and the breakfast buffet was great. As for the downsides of this hotel it is located in a residential area with little interesting views from the rooms or the restaurant area. The rooms and facilities are pretty outdated with separate beds a desk in the middle of the room and an old bathroom. it is a hotel to sleep not to spend time in the room. For us a good experience and definitely good quality for the relatively low price.
