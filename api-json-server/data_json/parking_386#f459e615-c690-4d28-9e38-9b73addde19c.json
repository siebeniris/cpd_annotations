I came to see a concert with someone visiting from out of town at LA Live. We were apprehensive about the Mayfair due to reviews but I should have went with my gut and realized some people will never be happy. We booked one of the renovated rooms on the 12th floor. We received a discount and got free parking and this was on Halloween weekend. We paid less booking through the hotel website than we would have on any of the travel sites. The checkin was a breeze and parking is in a secure parking garage. We took the elevator to our room and prepared for what might be a let down. Well the room was stunning. Modern and sleek 42 flat screen lovely tiled hallway leading down to our room I think this is because we had a corner room. this led into the room which was black and white with silver accents. The view was wonderful you can see far in every direction including Hollywood sign. Bed is amazing with memory foam toppers and nice quality bedding. And the bathroom. Ours was huge. And adorable. Shower was big and the sink was cute and all was well presented. When we got to our room the phone rang. The girl downstairs was calling to see if we liked the room. We walked to the concert. Surrounding neighborhood is urban. Yes there are homeless people and poverty you will hear some sirens at night. I live in the valley and I see homeless and hear noise at home too in my residential area. We walked 20 minutes each was to the concert in the dark 2 women and did not feel scared. The area has lots of clubs and restaurants and a huge new mall and sleek office building amidst historical older buildings and tons to do. We had a nice visit and I will recommend and would def stay again.
