Upon arrival last night at 11 pm we were told our room was not ready and we had to wait a additional 30 minutes before we could use it. To make matters worse mid way through waiting I asked the young lady at reception for two bottles of water we were exhausted and tired from our flight that was already delayed and she rudely replied that water was only available in our room and she was unable to assist as no water bottles were onsite at reception. I find it very disappointing to be spoken to that way especially coming from a industry that prides itself on customer service and for someone to not have any empathy given the situation we are in to even ask the manager how she can help us. After I spoke to the manager asking for water again and the fact the lady said no he quickly and instantly brought us two bottles of water and for that thank you it went such a long way and was appreciated. 30 or 40 minutes later we finally get to our room it is now just after midnight but my room key does not seem to open the door. I can hear the TV in the room and realise someone is already in that room. I go back downstairs with all my luggage and question the room the reception apologises as they wrote the wrong room number on our check in card holder. We then lug all our suitcases back up the elevator and get to our room and our TV does not work our wifi does not work our safe is not working and our bathtub plaster is in tatters so we are unable to shower unles we wear slippers. I am quite disappointed. Loews Madison and Loews Hollywood are just worlds apart and I seem to have realised all too late. I do hope the next few nights are better as I am a avid traveller and will be providing commentary accordingly on trip advisor. We requested a high rise room and our room has a shocking view and on the lowest floor. I also go back to my comments on my booking specially writing down what time we will arrive at the hotel to check in. Now seems like a waste of time as obviously no one reads this.", "offset": [1372, 1603], "date": "2015-07-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "799e31af-5771-4a35-9863-7dce6d7e73ad", "sentence": "Lovely but No Coffee in Room.

We stayed here for 5 nights on a family vacation. We arrived several hours early and were upgraded to a room with a street view which was a pleasant surprise. The hotel is very nice with a great restaurant lovely lounge and very friendly and helpful staff. it is about 4 blocks from the White House and Mall which we loved since we were here to sight see and wanted to walk most places. it is also close to the McPherson Metro station which we used frequently. It was a also a short walk to several restaurants Le Diplomat Lincoln and the Oval Room all of which were phenomenal. I very much enjoyed Bean and Bite across the street which serves upmarket coffee and pastries as well as grab and go gourmet sandwiches. My only complaint was there was no coffee maker in the room and complimentary coffee is only served in the lobby until 730 am. That did not work well for us so we had to purchase every day from the coffee shop in the lobby or across the street and this became expensive. Beware of the in room mini bar which automatically charges you if you remove an item from the sensored slots. We were not about to pay 4 for a Kit Kat or a bottle of water so did not use this amenity. A mini fridge in the room would have been super helpful so we could stash a few of our own snacks and drinks purchased at CVS around the corner and save ourselves a few bucks. Ice machine is only located on select floors luckily for us it was only 2 floors down. Overall we were very pleased with our stay. If anything was not as expected we notified the front desk and it was taken care of immediately.", "offset": [1135, 1225], "date": "2016-06-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "a6a06176-19f8-4134-a8aa-d67e6998a453", "sentence": "Great location and hotel but some tips. We were looking for a weekend getaway and found a great price on Amtrak to DC from Newport News. The hotel is several blocks from any Metro station but only a few blocks from the White House. Tips below. Upon arriving a doorman immediately helped us out of the car and offered to take our bags. We only had overnight bags and told him we could carry them. He was very polite and helpful and the whole weekend the doormen held the door and hailed taxis and were available to help with anything. The desk staff were professional and curtious. The lobby while not grand was well appointed and comfortable. There is a coffee shop a lounge and a great restaurant on the first floor. The room was spacious with high ceilings. Wi fi is free and ample speed a nesesity for us as we never really get to completely take a day off. We had a king bed and yhere was room for a chair and a desk. The bedding was very comfortable. And we loved the pillows. The only complaint was that our room overlooked the interior so no view but it was quiet. We slept in and when we awoke noticed there is no coffee pot in the room. I went downstairs and was informed that they set coffee out by the elevators til 930 and we missed it. However the desk clerk gave me two complimentary tickets to the coffee shop. I enjoyed the hotel and recomend it. Tips1. If have luggage take a car cab Uber to the hotel. The Metro is a bit far to walk with lugage2. The high end restaurant has an excellent happy with food tappas style and drinks at discounted rates. Be sure to check it out3. Be sure to go downstairs and get coffee before 930.", "offset": [581, 642], "date": "2016-06-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "4a8c981f-76da-4bdd-9f17-906dac73e39a", "sentence": "Comfortable clean excellent food. Spacious clean room that looks like the pictures on the website. We came here in late July for a sight seeing vacation and booked it through Hotwires mystery hotel price. Overall we had a very nice time. ProsVery comfortable bed and living area. We enjoyed having the large wing back chairs large closets and large cozy bed with fluffy pillows. There is only one terry cloth robe but we called down to ask for a second one and they brought one up no problemThe restaurant is excellent. Best burger I had in my life. Also enjoyed happy hour down in the lounge area and it was absolutely deliciousTaxis are right outside all of the time and made it really easy to get oneI loved the shower and bathroom set up. So cozy. However the shower has a clear glass door so if you are going with the whole family it might make it tough for anyone to use the bathroom at the same timeThe lobby is really nice there is a place for you to print boarding passes check in for your flight etc downstairs which was very helpful. They also have a coffee bar within the lobby where you can get Starbucks coffee scones etc. there is also a Pets coffee across the street with breakfast sandwiches if you had rather have thatThey held our luggage for us after check out in an upstairs secure areaThe fitness center is gorgeous clean and offer chilled towels. The bathrooms in the fitness area have a sauna area as well which was very clean and comfortableVery quiet. We did not hear anyone else the entire stay. ConsLocation is a bit tough if you are interested in sight seeing. We ended up taking a cab or Uber to the National Mall or other monuments. it is about a 10 minute walk to the Metro which is far in the heat. or a 20 25 minute walk to the top of the National Mall. I am a city dweller and still found it pretty far especially in the humidity. There is not a ton of nightlife around but there is a Whole Foods and a couple of bars restaurants within walking distance if you are into thatThe food at the hotel is extremely extremely expensive. No coffee in the rooms and no mini fridge. There is a mini bar with food but its extremely expensive toYou have to be a bit forceful with the concierge and check in is really late 4 pm. We arrived from the train really early and desperately needed a shower and rest so we asked for an early check in at 2 pm and was told no they could not do it. It took my travel agent calling and being forceful to allow us to check in early. Once she called everything was fine and we had no other problems. I am not sure if we were flagged as take care of us or what but after that it was all fine. We asked for a late check out and the latest we got was 1230 though. Overall though we truly had a great time. Tips ask for a room away from the ice machine or elevators and ask for a room facing the street with a view.
