Great setting excellent rooms and service everything you would expect from a Ritz Carlton. I did not pick up the tab but the prices were fairly eye watering for incidentals like drinks and food. We went to the Linger Longer steakhouse. I had a 9 oz filet with 2 sides and 2 beers no appetizer or dessert and the bill with tip was 84. Mixed drinks at the bar were 12 plus for basics like JD.

There is no way to put this place into words it simply must be experienced. From the moment you are greeted by Doley the dog upon your arrival until the moment your last piece of luggage is loaded at departure you can not help but smile. This is the perfect place to refresh with all the class of a Ritz yet the comforts of a lodge. I highly recommend the club level. The food was AMAZING with a great variety. Joane and Thomas took wonderful care of us making sure we had everything we needed throughout the day. Try the bourbon tasting with Kevin to perk up an afternoon. Each of the resort staff were helpful and friendly. You can tell they each love being a part of the Reynolds property and it showed through in the service. We can not wait to return for more paddle boarding and pina coladas by the pool.

I stayed here on business for two nights. I have stayed everywhere from the Elijay Motor Inn to the Four Seasons at Hyde Park London. I have had enough lodging experiences to know what to expect. I do not know why Ritz Carlton has their name od this property. It was anything but luxury. It was an overpriced mid range accommodation. The good beautiful views activities for families spacious rooms and bathrooms conference center rooms were also nice the staff was courteous and they are dog friendly. The bad could not find a bellman outside of building not well maintained large wasp nest chairs were not wiped down and had numerous spider webs with live spiders there are shipping containers all over the parking lot and stuff just sitting out everywhere you have to pay for wifi and it is not good wifi food service was over 40 minutes and there is no map of the lodge.

We stayed for one night. The room was gorgeous as was the lobby and open areas. The views were spectacular. We were very happy with our spa experience yet underwhelmed at Linger Longer Steakhouse. We spent all afternoon sitting polside. The pool area is fantastic lots of seating and an infinity pool and they really go above and beyond with lake options. The lake had a cute little beach with a slide mat and docks in the water that kept all the kids on property busy. The water sports team was probably the best service of the trip they were extremely helpful and welcoming offering paddle boards fishing rods and kayaks for free with the resort fee. HOWEVER the polside service was what brought this hotel down so many stars. We spoke to almost 5 waiters asking for menus or to order or for some water yet none of them ever returned. We finally gave up after the fifth time and went to the bartender who was great although the drinks were definitely more heavy on the ice rather than the flavoring. Before we were leaving for the day we were hoping to have a small bite to eat and finally got one of the servers to come over to order guacamole without onions my mother is very allergic. When the guacamole came out after a 50 minute wait it was covered in onion. The waiter came over with our check explaining that the reason it took so long to make was that they do n\u2019t normally make guacamole without onions which we then proceeded to show him the onion all over the food. They kindly removed our guacamole from the bill and I ate it although my mother could n\u2019t and it was good as was the food we ordered earlier in the day. It was just the absolute lack of any service that disappointed us. It was n\u2019t until a new waiter Adam came out at 430pm that we finally got GREAT service as we would \u2019ve hoped for all day from a hotel like the Ritz.", "offset": [157, 245], "date": "2019-09-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "a9376258-facf-410b-93c8-edb907040d42", "sentence": "Beautiful property and wonderful staff but it did n\u2019t feel like the Ritz.

Been meeting a friend in Atlanta for several years here since it is half way and a nice escape for Thanksgiving and Easter for brunch. This year was terribly disappointing. Turns out the per person fee has nearly doubled to just under 150 per person. it is not clear why since the meal served had the same selections as previous years. The food was good. A great selection that was all fresh. It was somewhat of a turnoff to see a palmetto roach walking across the dining room floor just before heading to the buffet. Took forever to order a cocktail. It took doing so with two servers. I have been to Ritz locations literally around the world. This was the first time it fell short of expectations. The other thing that was a bit unusual and off putting had been their valet service. They are pet friendly yet when pulling up front I had asked where the vehicle would be parked so that I might come back during the day to get her crate and other items from the vehicle. Given that i was told I needed to self park and a gold cart would pick me up a few parking lots away. It never showed and had to walk back to the hotel.

I have been to this hotel several times but this was my first visit to the spa. I was staying at a friends lake house on a girls trip and we booked a day at the spa in advance. The afternoon overall was lovely. We each had at least one spa service had lunch and then spent time in the steam room sauna hot tubs and indoor pool with drinks and aps in the bar before we left. Really nice place with friendly staff. My actual spa treatments however were a total ripof. I booked a 50minute body balance with an add on of dry brushing. I have had brushing before and it is been a thorough exfoliation. This time it was a couple of passes here and there no knees or elbows just various parts of the arms and legs. Keep in mind this was an add on 24 to a 50minute treatment. I looked at the digital clock in the room as I was undressing and it said 1206 my appointment was at noon. I looked at the clock again as I was dressing and it showed 1248. The cost of this relaxing 42 minutes with a 22 tip 248. Despite spending that kind of money the therapist rushed me out of the room like I have never experienced before. She walked out said take your time as they all do and then knocked maybe 60 seconds later and cracked the door to ask if I was dressed. I said uh I am still on the table but I will get up now. Not even 30 seconds later the same thing happened. I know it is a busy spa but gez. Look I know when you go to a resort like this you are gon na pay through the nose for spa treatments. And I expect it to be the price of admission for the use of the other amenities. I am used to that. But this time the treatment itself too short too expensive too rushed really left a bad taste in my mouth.", "offset": [1009, 1122], "date": "2020-01-21", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}]}
