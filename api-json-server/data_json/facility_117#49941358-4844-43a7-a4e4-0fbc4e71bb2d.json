So while neither posed a major problem for us it is good to be forewarned. And of course construction and nightclub noise are not unusual no matter where you stay in HKSo this was a relaxing and memorable stay and added to our overall enjoyment of HK the last stop of our trip.", "offset": [0, 33], "date": "2015-03-01 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "d1b838bc-2f45-4989-8990-af82d395d06b", "sentence": "Chic and Trendy Ideal Location. it is easy to miss this amazing hotel but I urge you to find the time and energy to seek it out.

For the business traveller needing to do more work out of the hotel room this hotel did n\u2019t suit as well.

I was coming from IFC and decided to walk with luggage but there was a stretch where the escalator was out of action so I needed to carry my luggage up hill. You then need to negotiate the Tai Kwung police grounds to get here. I liked the free mini bar along with the comfy bathroom. It just did n\u2019t feel as nice to work from at the end of the day. There \u2019s a safe travel charger. But the phone did n\u2019t seem to work properly and the lighting around the desk not strong enough. For pricing point it \u2019s worth it for singles or couple looking to spend time outside but less so recommended for families or business travellers.
