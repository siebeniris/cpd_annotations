Obviously whoever it was changed the beds tossed the clean towels on the counter and disappeared. Not vacuumed and not a clean bathroom. We were too tired to complain about anything. I did get an extra towel and a bath mat and so we managed. They had been so considerate and generous we did not report it. As a former business owner and an employer I tell you now as I feel you need to know. It certainly will not keep us away. We appreciated the staff and their positive helpful attitude. The new sky bridge to the Mariot is a real help in getting up to Peachtre. I have stayed at most of the hotels in that area. I love the Hilton staff etc and found it to be a great location.

I stayed here for a conference and was promptly checked in as a gold member. I was given my breakfast vouchers and a coupon for trader Vic \u2019s. The concierge was amazing and squeezed us in at the Russian restaurant on the top floor. The food was amazing. And then the review shifts The elevator to the restaurant is a fear of height disaster. It faces the outside. I handled it but when leaving the restaurant we were able to go down two floors bc someone else got on and then we hit our floor and the elevator froze. It would n\u2019t let us go up it would n\u2019t let us go down and every time I scanned my room key it said there was an error and no floor could be selected without a room key. Fortunately my mom was in the elevator too because I started to have a panic attack. I called the Hilton and let them know we were stuck which they could n\u2019t seem to comprehend and when I was finally put on hold for ten minutes they said they were sending someone. In my panic I hit all the keys again and hit L which finally got the elevator moving. As a guest with a key there was no reason this should have happened. Still shaking I went to the front desk who said they had never heard of that happening. No apologies no comping just changed out my keys and sent me panic stricken on my way. How can they send non hotel guests up in that elevatorThe rooms were out dated the housekeeping never showed up till almost 5 which is when our conference was over. Then we were put in the uncomfortable position of leaving the room or just asked if they could give us anything. I would \u2019ve liked my sheets changed but the one time we were out all day they said they could n\u2019t do anything because we left something on the bedThe breakfast was great but only because I had vouchers. 25 dollars a day per person would have run us 200 dollars in breakfast for 4 days.

I do not rely on the bedside clock so I did not bother calling maintenance for that but disconcerting to see a 3rd wrong time on the clock when you wake up in the middle of the night while jetlaged.

Worse than any Hampton Inns. I stayed at Hilton Atlanta for 2 nights in mid March during a business trip. Except the lobby and the conference rooms lower level I could not believe that this is at the Hilton level among all its properties. From my experience Hilton Atlanta is worse than most of Hiltons cheaper hotels such as Hampton Inns or Hilton Garden Inns 1. As a Diamond member I was not acknowledged my status upon check in. Although I was put in the room on the top 3 floors which are designated for executive members It was just an ordinary guest room. 2. The room is extremely outdated with bathroom wall paper peeling off rusted door hinges and a broken cabinet door for the mimi fridge see pic attached. The carpet frays and is old and dirty with stains. The AC is loud and did not function well it only blew air without lowering the room temperature. 3. The elevators of the hotel are super old and sound dangerous. At the top floor 28th you hear the motor rumbling loud when the core elevators are running. There are two elevators that run outside the building which are totally exposed to outside without any protection from rain or wind or whatsoever. These two elevators also the ones that bring you the 29th floor Nicolais Roof constantly make metal clapping friction noise when running which is very scary. I am not sure if these elevators have passed the safety inspection recently if so they have maintenance issues. 4. The breakfast provided for executive members at the Nicolais roof is really mediocre with coffee juice waffle iron pastries bread 3 trays of hot items egg bacon potato and some pre cut fruit. This is at best in the Hampton Inns level even not at Hilton Garden Inns made to order hot breakfast standard. Furthermore letting guests grab food items from open trays amid this Covid19 outbreak seems to be really unwise.
