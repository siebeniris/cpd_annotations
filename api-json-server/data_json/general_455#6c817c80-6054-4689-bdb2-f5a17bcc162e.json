Our second day there was quite different. We had attended an outside wedding in the evening. It had been quite hot and buggy. We were looking forward to getting back to the hotel to swim outside. We arrived at the pool and made note that the pool was open to 11 pm. We had an hour and 15 minutes to swim. My family was the only people using the outside pool. It was quiet. Not 5 minutes in to our swim we were bombarded with 15 children ranging in ages 5 14. They were not supervised by any parent in the pool area. Which was a rule stated by the hotel. There was a child who could not swim and needed help from my husband. These children were irresponsible disrespectful and unsafe. 5 minutes later the manager in duty spook with my husband and said the pool was closing because of our unruly children. My husband told him that the group of children were not with us. The manager found the parents of the children and closed the outside pool at 10 pm. I went and spoke with the manager regarding the closing of the pool. He said sorry but it was his discretion to close the pool. He did not want to deal with the unruly children or their parents. He took the easy way out and punished us by closing the pool. We returned to our room and decided to go and get a snack at the restaurant. The manager came and spoke to us again. He had noted that the pool was a problem in Friday night as well and was closed early too. He comped our snacks. Upon our checkout the next morning the front desk never asked how our stay was or even said good morning. I called Doubletree and spoke with customer service. The agent agreed that it was an unfortunate incident and agreed to refund one nights stay. She put me him hold and returned and said she could not do it because the same manager I dealt with did not want to give credit. He said he would give me 45. What a joke. I have always stayed at Hilton on our trips. I will never stay at Hilton again. This was the worst customer service ever.", "offset": [729, 788], "date": "2015-07-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "84b0a8c7-c127-40bb-9608-8e3fe29f9965", "sentence": "H member no breaks. On our most recent stay here at the DoubleTree in Syracuse it was better than the last but not up to Hilton expectations. We waited to check in. Which was no big deal. But I was surprised that seeing how I called shed to verify we had have extra towels. The room was two double beds. I figured at least 4 would be there but the shower curtain here seems to soak the floor requiring multiple towels to soak up the water. Checking the bathroom was a disappointment. Two bath hand towels and zero washcloths. I did not want to seem like I was asking them agin but requesting them in the rest action and calling head you had think more than two bath towels would not have been o much trouble to accommodate a loyal H member with.

No I love Doubletree hotels. I am always seeking them out as a preference when I travel for pleasure or business. In fact I have stayed at this Doubletree many times. Never ever have I been charged for lobby coffee. They have a guard type person manning the lobby coffee charging 250 per 12 ounce cup. I have never been impressed by the food or lack of customer service at the restaurant in this doubletree so I choose not to utilize it. Maybe this outrageous charge for lobby coffee is part of the new renovations. I really think they should rethink this as it is a cheap and rather embarrassing experience when you go to grab a coffee and the security guard informs you that you owe 250. It is not that I can not afford it but when all hotels including doubletree hotels have always had complementary lobby coffee it becomes very strange. I will be choosing a different hotel for my frequent Syracuse stays from now on.

The room itself was kind of noisy because directly across from us was the HVAC system for some of the event halls. And we were on the Hilton Honors floor which are supposed to be the best rooms.

I stayed overnight Feb 9 10th because of an event I was attending the next day. I like that this hotel is close to everything but far enough away from downtown that you do not get that crowd or traffic. especially since there was a game the night I arrived. I decided to stay within the hotel to get dinner after arriving. The bar restaurant is located right near the lobby and is beautiful. The bar has a great selection of beers wines and cocktails. The menu has a variety of choices with fair prices and portion sizes. Ivan at the bar is beyond amazing. I can not say that enough. He is the definition of Hilton Doubletree standards and customer service. I never felt so special and taken care of before. He made awesome suggestions for food made you feel comfortable and welcome and showed that he truly loved his job. He had asked what I was in town for and suggested I use the hotels shuttle service. He even told the front desk supervisor that I may be using the service and to let the shuttle driver know. He also made great suggestions of places to go and see within town. Throughout the night I was also able to meet the hotels general manager. It was awesome to see him engaged within the hotel especially on a Saturday night with events going on. He introduced himself to me and welcomed me to the property. The front desk supervisor was very friendly and made every accommodation I needed from a later check out time to arranging the shuttle service in the morning. Room service was excellent the next morning. I decided to use the door hanger menu in order to get breakfast in the morning. It was more than enough reasonably priced and delivered right on time.
