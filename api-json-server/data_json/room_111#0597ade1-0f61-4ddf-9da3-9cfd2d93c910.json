Guys I would like to let you know that Ginger has the best of the accommodation provided across Bhubaneshwar provided you keep an information of the number of rooms Vacant. Throughout the year delegates from tata and subsidiary units Visit Bhubaneshwar periodically so its not always that you get a room I would insist on a pre booking a room in Ginger Bhubaneshwar than going on that day and leaving disheartened. Moving on double rooms are most occupied which has king size bed so again to take the priviledge of those rooms a preboing is mandatory. Those rooms need to be increased in coming number of years for Ginger. Leave aside these points and the rest is bliss on earth. The staff is the most educated batch of living beings across BSR the room and the wifi remains up all time. The bathroom has more than enough space and toiletries and the bath tub is classy. The food across the restaurant is kinda high as compared to restaurant across Bhubaneshwar but again when you are on vacation these tiny little things does nt come into picture. Mutton Meal and chicken meal are always something that people look out for in Khaja Chowk Menu and then you have a CD which gives 24 hours service for all guests who are staying overnight though that service is a service only for the guests who are staying for the night but again no other CD at Bhubaneshwar operates at 2 pm for a meagre cold coffee. All together its one of the most comfortable and cozy place for any stay.", "offset": [50, 222], "date": "2016-06-08 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "a83f33e3-f5b6-45a2-a7a4-818906aaad59", "sentence": "Very Nice.
