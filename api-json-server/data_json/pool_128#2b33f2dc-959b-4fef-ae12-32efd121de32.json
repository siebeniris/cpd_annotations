It was expensive but we really wanted a nice outdoor pool area. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood but within walking distance to some shops and restaurants we walked to Stans Dounuts for a breakfast treat and I would highly recommend going only a few blocks away. The hotel has a big entry lobby area where they set up a free coffee tea station in the morning. Our room was also larger than most W Hotel rooms I have stayed in. Super comfortable bed bliss spa products and modern decor in the room just like other W Hotels. Pool area is what we came for and it turned out to be a nice spot for our kids to play and for us to lounge nearby. The patio cafe style restaurant is adjacent to the pool and we ordered food which was fine but expensive for average things like chicken tenders salads sandwiches. Overall it was a nice place and we had a good stay but also expensive it is LA though.", "offset": [707, 870], "date": "2015-01-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "95a4c630-137a-4b6f-af76-15ef52cb301d", "sentence": "As Upscale as They Come.

The hotel had some nice aspects but overall they could not outweigh the negatives. At the time of my stay the renovation was complete or appeared to be complete. Bigest problem is the elevators. There are two for the entire hotel three if you include the service elevator which people took frequently. Even if both were working and one was broken half of the time they can not serve everybody staying at the hotel. I wanted to take something up to my room and come back down and it literally took 15 minutes. it is also a 16 story hotel so stairs are not always an option. Roms the room was nice looking but terrible in function. First there are multiple room designs at the same price point. We had to be moved as our original room had no hot water and the second room they took us to was much smaller and lacked a couch. I asked for one that was comparable to our first room and got a bigger room than our original. Keep in mind these rooms are all the same price so you never know what you will get. Also rooms our room and a couple other peoples rooms we were part of a large wedding party had bathrooms with a sliding barn door. Nice looking however these doors left huge gaps between the door and the wall. So as long as you do not mind catching a glimpse of another person having a bowel movement this should not bother you. Some of the rooms also had the door right next to the bed. Our first room had food sitting in the trashcan. The pool was closed one day for an event. We were given 24 hour notice in the form of a memo on the front desk. They did arrange the use of another pool though. 20 minutes away by cab they did offer a voucher for the cab at least. We could easily hear people through the HVAC. Other people staying had issues with the loudness of the HVACThe bathroom has no hooks. It has one bar 2 feet over the toilet so you can not hang your bath towels anywhere. Speaking of the bath towels they are in a basket on the floor under the sink. This just felt really disgusting to me. They charge a huge amount for Wifi. Because the room was not expensive enough on its own.

My stay at the W Los Angeles West Beverly Hills was very confusing. I did not like it then I did and so on and so on. Ok first of all to clarify West Beverly Hills is NOT a thing. It should be called W Los Angeles Westwod. I belive that s the old name but changed it to fool guests and get more money for the Beverly Hills location which it does not have. The drive is only about 8 12 minutes to the Heart Of Beverly Hills including some traffic which is not too bad. The lobby was ok. And when I say ok I mean it was nice but not spectacular as you would acpect from a W Property. Before my stay I emailed the general manager of the hotel to be uprgaded for free but they would not upgrade me even though the room sat open my entire stay. Whatever we checked out early so it did not matter. Parking was easy to fing as we did not want to pay 46 per night. We were places in the largest Fabulous Suite. It had 2 small bedrooms and a small living room and decent sized bathroom with 2 sinks. It was 850 square feet I belive. We got a good rate for this room so that s why we booked this suite. The room was down a narrow hall but it was on the corner so that s why. The rooms are very close to each other and the walls are pretty thin. The room looked a little cheap even thought they just did a 25 Million Dollar Refresh. What does that mean. A refresh that s stupid. Just call it a Renovation like any other hotel to not confuse your guests. The room was nice though but you could definatly tell that they used cheap materials because you could see the wear and tear in the rooms. The pool and grounds were ok as well. The pool was tiny and the gorunds were ok but small. The gym was very nice though. The only reason I gave the W a 4Star review was Rebecca. She was the front desk woman. My family and I were not pleased with this hotel because the room was smaller than expected and the room we wanted to be upgraded to was empty and they would not give it to us. Seriusly Rebca should be promoted. She is eficent friendly and will act nice in any situation. Overall if looking for a place in LA to stay I would not stay here but the rates were good so I would.

Fantastic stay at the W from the check in to the check out. First the location is unbeatable. Walking to Westwod UCLA 10 minute car ride to Beverly Hills or Century City shopping and dining 15 minute car ride to the beach. Second the staff is great. The check in process was quick efficient and very friendly. The rooms we had two rooms with king beds were both well appointed comfortable with views. Beds and mattresses were very comfortable and bathrooms were small but functional. One room had a walk in sower the other room had a bath. Our son had a problem with his water control mechanism so we called the front desk on our way to dinner. It was fixed by the time we got back from dinner. Only one small inconvenience is that there are not coffee makers in the room. We walked to the Ralphs grocery store every morning for the Starbucks they have inside. 5 minutes walk no big deal. We just like to have coffee as soon as we open our eyes. LOLThe pool areas were definitely happening and entertaining people watching dining and relaxing. There are lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas no reservations needed or cabanas that you can reserve with the concierge. Music and DJ on weekends. Parking was actually very convenient. Daily charge for in and out valet. so you basically pull up to the hotel and somebody is always there to take the car and park it for you. When you need your car again just call down and by the time you ride the elevator the car is there waiting for you on the driveway. 45 daily rate may be pricey but hotel offers parking packages you can book if you know you are going to have the car in advance. We loved the hotel the service the location and will definitely stay there again.", "offset": [978, 1075], "date": "2018-08-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}]}
