This Bercy area and Bercy village worth a visit. It is beautiful and quiet place. I doubt that you can sleep well if the hotel is not well structured in the downtown and in closer circles to the center you should know first from the map that in which neighborhood you want to accommodate because Paris does not know day and night. Good sleep is important in a trip and you can have it at this Pullman. The room space is fine. The floor and furniture clean. The entrance lobby bar and restaurant is nice and modern. They change the design with flowers for every event happen in the hotel. It was good management. Many Lufthansa crew come and go to this hotel as they might have a contract or something. So it can talk about quality. The design of the reception is different for staff to approach to guests and ask for their needs. Most of the time they do. If you ask for help with an address or something most of the time they help with a map or a print. Although I think for this modern reception desk like this and reply to all the customers without delay they should be trained more in my opinion. We got a room in first floors but despite my assumption it was well quite and nice. In higher floors I believe you can have a good view of seine river as well. The neighborhood is calm and safe. Take a walk in Bercy park and Bercy village if you had time. They are beautiful. The closest hop on hop off station to the hotel which would be at the end of the park near the stadium arena would be approximately 20 minutes to walk. Metro is so close and only 7 8 min. walk. For Metro make sure to get daily passes or more because it is also a good mean to visit sights with no extra charge. If wanted to buy souvenirs check the price first with some other people or shops. I experienced that in Paris you can bargain. even for taxi transportationBreakfast good and complete set. Different breads and fruits. You can hardly find taxi in front of the hotel. Make sure to ask for one before your departure to airport or train station. We had a bad experience and wasted a lot of time. Free Wifi speed is good enough. Bathroom and bathtub clean and modern.

Main reason for our stay was to watch a show in the nearby Acor Arena \u2026 I write this article as a Platinum member. Arrival into Paris with our private car was fine. Parking at the hotel is very difficult even just for check in. Only two check in counters were available with a view people waiting. When it was my turn I presented my booking details as well as my platinum membership card. No greetings as a loyal member was given as well as no upgrade. Even for the welcome drink vouchers I had to ask at the end of check in. So the check in experiences compared with other Pullman hotels was not so good. Our room was a family room with two big beds. Nice and clean perfect for our stay. I made my self a cup of tea before we left for the show. After we came back we discovered that the water kettle was spoilt and water was leaking all over the area. Spilling water on some of my documents and my mobile phone luckily the phone was still working. The kettle was exchanged after we complained to the front desk but when we returned to the room after dinner the next problem happened. Our room was without power. So I had to go back to the front desk to ask for help again. We had to wait for 15 minutes till somebody came up to the room just to check on some fuses which caused the problem with the power fail. Next morning we went for breakfast around 0930 hopping to avoid the big Chinese \u2019s travel groups but unfortunately they were still there. So we had to wait for a table and it was very load. Once we had a table we discovered that a lot of breakfast stuff was not available. For example the complete tea section was out of stock glasses were missing at the juice section and lots of food was not available. So the breakfast experience was not very pleasant and we were looking forward to it because we read that Pullman has one of the best breakfasts in town. After my breakfast I wanted to collect my tickets for a river cruise on the Sein which I was included in my room package. Unfortunately the tickets were not ready yet and I was ask to wait another 30 minutes before the responsible person would arrive. Of course I do n\u2019t wanted to wait again so we left without the tickets and bought them latter on directly at the cruise company. At check out we were reimbursed for the tickets and the room rate was reduced as well for one night to compensate the price different.
