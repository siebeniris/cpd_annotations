We stayed here as part of a two centre holiday one week here one week in riviera mayaI chose this hotel. I wanted to be in a central location for the shopping malls aqua world which was across the road. Upon entering the hotel you are greeted with a very friendly welcome checking in was good room was ready with great views across the pools and out to sea. The rooms are very good quiet beds very comfortable in fact i slept very well considering I am a light sleeper. The bathrooms are very good they also provided tooth brushes shaving and sowing kit very welcome to have that robes and slippers we also had and a well stocked fridge. The hotel itself has an outdoor feel about it but its all inside very open and airy atmosphere. We did not try any of the restaurants as we preferred the buffet so as to choose what we wanted and when we wanted to eat. The food was very good breakfast lunch or dinner they was always an abundant selection of food and lots of different items to choose from and the waiting staff where excellent. The pools where very good with swim up bars nice snack bar at the side the beach which is private was very good. The evening entertainment is good it usually starts at about 2030 in the avenue bar and lasts aprox 1 hour sometimes less and it can get quite cramped in there. but after the show everyone disappears they do have good shows though just try to get a seat by 1945The only slight negative point is that the beach has lots of seaweed near the waters edge and not that good for snorkeling as the sea here can also be a bit rough. hence choosing two centre holiday and people place their towels on the sun beds around the pool at about 060 in the morning even though there are notices saying that if you have placed a towel on a sun bed and not used it within 30 minutes it will be removed but the management never adhere to this so its pot luck if you can get a sun bed around the pool. You can always get one on the beach though. Over all it is a very good hotel very friendly and helpful staff good food nice pools would stay there again.", "offset": [1070, 1182], "date": "2015-06-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "bac3d339-b3eb-4d53-9c04-8730a763c6a9", "sentence": "Our family vacation experience at Paradisus.

The Melia PARADISUS hotel several pyramid shaped buildings was gorgeous and clean. Our plan was all inclusive but tipping is very welcomed and appreciated do not forget the daily maids. I met many wonderful guests at the pool and bar. The young attendants at the pool and restaurants are absolutely delightful. They are compassionate polite more than caring and helpful. Most memorable was the extenuated family pool and beach attendant named Armando. Young always smiling always attentive and available to us party of 8. He kept us fed and watered and helped us obtain a beach cabana and late restaurant reservations a must. The ocean tides were rough. All pool waiters were wonderful. The pool side entertainment was fun. One activity was the wax hand by ART WAX free. Other free pool activities were the wonderful pool bar salsa and belly dance lessons and festive pool games and music. We frequented the BANA and NAOS buffet restaurants and were never disappointed with the many many diverse food stations including almost anything you would desire. Lovely waiters there were Fernando Arturo Chacho Rodrigo Fredy Alexia and Jesy. Very attentive and helpful. Every restaurant with or without reservations was just wonderful and tasty. In the main AVENUE BAR we were welcomed and attended by Gerard who kept us well watered and amused. His smile was heartfelt. Evening hotel entertainment was interesting. When you take the short bus ride to downtown you can find up scale designer shops and a large clean mall. If you have extra dinner money do not miss LORENZILOs fish restaurant bit pricey including it is lake side alligator who eats your left overs off the patio.

The pool adults only was big and beautiful. The bali beds around the pool are big and comfortable and the service is excellent we also loved the beach. We booked the lagoon side with a king size bed. The rooms have great mostly private balconies. However they did not have a king bed available and the next day upgraded us to the ocean side with a king bed. Everything is the room worked well the air conditioner especially. Either side of the resort is fine a view of the lagoon side is equally as nice. We suggest getting the Royal Service. it is absolutely worth the extra money check into it. Our butler Susana was always there with information and with taking care of all our needs. We love this area of Cancun because it is away from the bars and clubs but a short bus or cab ride when you want it. If you want to be pampered your entire stay this is the place.

The rest of the hotel is pretty awesomeThere is a HUGE pool with a swim up bar that goes from tower 3 to tower 1. And another pool you can enjoy as well that is wonderfully warm toI did not find an outdoor hot tub although there are parts of the big pool that have bubbles. I am sure the spa had a hot tub but we did not partake. Speaking of the towers tower 1 is closest to Fiesta Americana which at the time mid Feb was having MAJOR work done on their northern most building next to tower 1. Hopefully that l be done soon since the workforce was very large and busy. This hotel will WOW you at how beautiful the public spaces are especially in tower 3.

Be VERY hungry the food does not stopBana was mehLa Palapa was mehVento I will be nice and just say I did not care for it. The buffet is Nao and its strengths are the foods prepared in front of you like omelets grilled fish etc. Like any buffet some food is hit or miss depending on how long it is been sitting there. Without question though the pastry chef is absolutely AMAZING. Zillions of beautifully prepared tastes of a great variety of desserts. Major applause to the pastry teamAlso the ice cream here is TO DIE FOR. Always had 2 servings each day. YumThe drinks are great. Not just the availability of top shelf liquor but also their drink mixers are great quality too. The staff is extremely well trained and so polite and courteous. Please tip themThe only negatives I have are1. Our ocean view room needed a refresh. The bed closer to the window had a big sag in it the love seat had a stain in the fabric etc2.

I have visited the Paradisus in Punta Cana before so I definitely had certain expectations. This resort exceeded my expectations. It is GORGEOUS and you can tell that they put a lot of thought into their decorations and design of the hotel. It is also huge. there is 5 pyramids in the whole hotel the lobby is in the 3rd pyramid. This is where my sister and I stayed which was good because it was remotely close to everything. We had an ocean view room and we requested a room on a high floor since we did not want to be close to the pool area or the lobby area at night since we wanted to be able to sleep. When we first entered our room we were stunned by the beauty of it. The balcony is HUGE and gives you a beautiful view of the ocean and the pool area. The only con about the room was the door that connected to the next room. We called the front desk and requested that someone come up and lock the connecting room so that it would not be able to be accessed by the family in the next room. They assured us they would and we waited and waited for someone to come up. Maintenance finally came and told us that there was not a key to lock the door and they were not sure why the front desk told us they would lock it. Lack of staff communication. We explained our safety concerns to the maintenance worker and he understood and told us that the only safe option he recommended was for us to change our room. We were super annoyed because we had already settled in and unpacked and loved our room. We headed to the front desk to change it and they did not have a room until the next day. So we headed back up to the room and a few minutes later maintenance was knocking at the door and told us that they would replace THE WHOLE LOCK for us so we could lock it ourselves and be safe. We wanted to cry we were so happy. I loved how accommodating he was and assured us that we would be safe. Thanks AndresThis hotel is not for people who are strict about air conditioning. There are definitely cooler areas in the hotel but there is not actual air conditioning until you get back into your room which we did not mind since we were used to this at Paradisus Punta Cana. Also their entertainment is lacking. We came on vacation to relax yes but we are also in our 20s so we wanted to have some measure of fun. They do not have a specific area or room for shows just the stairs by the pool and it is really uncomfortable to sit there especially for 2 hours at night. THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS. there is an array of restaurants to choose from and all of the food is great. Vento was our favorite. The only annoying part was having to make a reservation for each restaurant a day in advance because of the crowds we traveled in late JulyThe part that really bothered us was the segregation of Royal and non Royal service. We paid a lot of money to stay at this hotel and Expedia did not offer the Royal Service option to us. Therefore we were not even aware it was available. Considering we paid so much for our stay we assumed it would just be a frivolous extra. Boy were we wrong. At other resorts we were not really able to distinguish between Royal Service and regular guests. It was mainly the quality of the rooms and the discounted spa packages that they received. However this ENTIRE RESORT is segregated. Regular resort guests and Royal Service guests almost never interact. There was a separate beach separate check in separate pool separate bar. One waiter was even instructed not to give us water bottles unles we were Royal Service. It was ridiculous and made us feel like our money was not worth the same as the regular guests. There were several people that made our stay great. Andres in maintenance Telma Magaly in Housekeeping and Benito the waiter.

They both checked in with us daily to let us know when they arrived and offered us help every day. booked our dinner reservations and made our stay vey special with bottle service chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals.

I was lucky to be on the beach while one was being released. We also had hydrotherapy included and went a couple days. love the spa aromatherapy and the shower jets. as soon as you are in the vicinity of the spa you can smell the citrus incense. They have an area outside with the hydrotherapy with herbal teas drinks cucumbers and healthy snacks. Only complaints besides check in. the elevators smelled disgusting. also it is really hard to drink frozen drinks without a straw. They were nt available anywhere on the resort.

In few occasions the waiters were saying \u201c NO \u201d on our wine requests and they were trying to upsel us wines despite the fact they have few different choices unles you tip them. Pizza was never offered at the buffet restaurant which is very desirable for kids as fries were not available every day. I\u2019m a consistent tipper but would like to tip after the service is received not before to bribe for better one after paying for the whole trip. The Entertainment area for the night shows is small and shows were about the same every night there was only one night with life music out of seven nights and also there was almost no evening entertainment for the kids. Housekeeping service was great but may be for the fact that tips were given few times during our stay. We did not use the special restaurants because of the limited menus there with vegetarian and kid choices we preferred to dine in outdoor all of the time that is why we used the International buffet. and The Market Grill but was noisy and not very relaxing with service been rushed especially with servers cleaning the tables and pulling out our plates before we finished with our meals.

My actual rating is 35 not quite a 4 but a little better than a 3Here are my observations. Facilities. GreatThe place is beautiful. The color the d\u00e9cor the design is all worthy of a 5 star resort. I do not believe they have air conditioning in the main areas or the hallways. it is very humid and hot at all times. I found the fragrances they use a little overwhelming. They have a baby room and a kids room. I only have experience with the baby room. you are allowed to leave your infant there if they are over a year old and can stand by themselves. there is a room there with a TV and toys. Mostly they just play tv for the kids there. there is limited arts and crafts and the girls there will do face painting. there is also a little climbing gym for young children. there is also washrooms and a change table in the womens girls washroom. there is no shoes or food or drinks allowed but even then because of the humidity the room seems a little grimy and gritty. Not sure how often they actually clean the room or the toys but my daughter picked up Hand Foot Mouth from there. She had a fever the day after we came back based on an incubation period of 3 6 days she 100 picked it up from the resort. Not impressed but also it could not be helped as my daughter has a tendency to put everything in her mouth or put her mouth on everything. They have decently fast wifi everywhere in the resort. It seems like they have a lot of activities none of which we used. They have bars everywhere. They had quite a few huts for shade by the pool. You can also rent one of the bali beds for. did not do it so not sure how much it is. But they do have electrical outlets built into each bali bed too so you can charge your devices. Room. Junior Suite Ocean View GodView was beautiful. Balcony was private. it is nice that in the afternoon thanks to their architecture you always get shade on your balcony if you are facing the ocean. The room itself was nice. It looked clean. there is no coffee maker so having to warm my babys bottle required several soakings in hot tap water. Eventually we called them and asked for a coffee maker and they graciously delivered one. Their mini fridge has canned beer pop juice boxes and bottles of water. We pushed our double beds together to create one big bed since we never got our request for a king sized bed. After we moved the bed we noticed stains on the floor that look like they have been there for awhile. The sheets are nice and soft but they have just an uncovered comforter sandwiched between 2 flat sheets. I had rather they encase their comforter and give me a flat sheet instead because it was a pain to peel the flat sheet off when I only wanted to use the flat sheet. The a c is strong but a little on the loud side. Although the noise does help drown out the noise you hear from the hallways because you can hear everybody passing by. Our room was situated on top Vento. So we were very close to the nightly performances which were SUPER loud. Luckily my infant did not have any trouble sleeping to it but I can see it bothering others. The bathroom has a tub with a rain shower and a handheld shower head. there is a toilet and a bidet. They give you just basic toiletries shower gel shampoo conditioner and lotion. All were decent. there is a hair dryer iron and room safe. Our room safe was out of batteries when we got there and had to wait for security to come and change our batteries for us. Apparently a c gathers condensation so we had a bit of a dripping issue in our bathroom. Food. Pretty GodWe tried every restaurant but the paid one. They were all ok. Not the greatest but better than passable. there is two omelette stations in the morning at the buffet. The line up for the omelette station is always long. there is also a juice bar. Typical fare. Sometimes there is a wait to be seated for breakfast. If you do not want to wait you can go to ENSO. The A C is extremely weak if maybe not even on in the buffet and the glass panes block the strong breeze from the ocean so sitting there for breakfast is quite hot. We gave up trying to eat breakfast there after the 34th day and instead just ordered room service. Bana one was ok. I did enjoy their octopus and sea bass sashimi. Everything else was only so so. The restaurants book up quickly you pretty much have to book two days in advance. there is an ap of theirs you can download to request bookings but then you end up having this back and forth because you can only request a booking without seeing actual availabilities. Blue agave was a disappointment. At Vento we ordered about 78 dishes and 2 of them were good can not remember which ones they were anymoredid not try Enso at night. Checked out their menu. Looks like it would be a disappointment. Weird choice of dishes. Market Grill was ok. I remember two of the steak dishes were good. The chicken was alright. The pork was too dry. Fuego had the best service out of all the restaurants. Food was good too just portions are little smaller than we expected. Moles food was so so. Maybe it was my mistake ordering duck confit from a restaurant that is service contemporary Mexican. I remember one of the appetizers was extremely salty. Service. PorWe got attitude from the guy who checked us in. He forgot to give us towel keys. Not sure who dropped the ball whether it was the resort or our travel agents but we got neither the king size bed we requested nor the baby crib. We had to request twice for a baby crib with their concierge. They gave us a Graco pack n play which is fine. Another couple we met said they first delivered a tiny crib and they had to ask for another. On the second day our daughters sleep schedule kept conflicting with when the cleaning service would try and come to our room so we skipped it the first day. I find it annoying that they would call the room to ask if we wanted our room cleaned as their phone call would almost always interrupt my infants nap. The second day the cleaning staff came in they took all our dirty towels and did not leave us any new ones. We had to call the concierge to ask them to bring us towels. I would not trust their cleaning if I were you. They did not change our bedshets once while we were there just made our beds. Their waitstaf in general are pretty slow and need to be asked several times to do something. We asked about 3x for a high chair and was brought one with a broken strap. We gave up on asking for high chairs and just brought our own booster. The concierge does not break bills for you so either bring a lot of ones and fives or be prepared to awkwardly ask the waitstaf to break bills for youthere is a towel hut near the kids pools and it seems like they are always out of towels towards the end of the day.", "offset": [3705, 3765], "date": "2019-07-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "917130cc-6dcc-4d52-ab25-a4bfacdba16b", "sentence": "Great time beautiful resort.

Drinks were very inconsistent at each bar and they all had maracuia fruit in them. Only good food was at the taco joint buffet was decent too.

My husband and I stayed here for a quick 3 day getaway last week. The hotel is beautiful. The lobby is stunning and lush. The service at check in was. ok. There was a mixup with our room we wanted a king junior ocean view suite. They put us in a double room. After waiting on the phone for half hour hubby finally just went to lobby to complain. After some arguing they provided us with the room we originally booked. First off whoever had the idea to place tall planters on the balcony was crazy. They COMPLETELY obstruct your view. Oceanview means standing unconfortably at cement planters to see it. Bad idea. It was not just ours this is every room. The hotel has several options for dining however if you want to make reservations you must do so before you ever arrive at the hotel because they are full constantly. the restaurants are so small seating is very limited so you are unable to make reservations at any of them even with 3 days as we had. The hotel is huge. There ARE five pools however only one has a swim up bar and the others are fairly small. Also beach chairs are also very limited. I had go down at 7 am to watch the sunrise and they were all reserved then. it is a shame to have such a large hotel and such limited space. With the number of families young children it is difficult to find anywhere to sit in the afternoons. With so many other options larger pools more swim up bars better service and activities we will not be coming back here.", "offset": [1384, 1504], "date": "2020-02-25", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}]}
