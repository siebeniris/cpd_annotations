Me and my Wife picked The Ovolo Hotel as our place to stay based on the Wonderful Reviews we have read from past Guest. We looked at many Hotels with high star ratings and Ovolo easily stood out from them all. It was a no brainer for the same price I could stay at The Ovolo or stay at another hotel that would not even offer 20 of what The Ovolo Hotel offers. We surely picked the right Hotel. The room we stayed in was The Executive Deluxe Queen Room. simply Amazing. This Beautifully designed room was equipped with everything you could possibly need on a trip and so much more. They offer Free Mini bar refilled daily. Free bag of tasty snacks on arrival and free 5 star Breakfast not that non tasty buffet breakfast served at other Hotels. Apple TV Free Wifi and they even offer a code for access to hotspots outside. This is just some of the many things they offer. The Staff are Amazing as well. They were beyond friendly helpful and welcoming. Upon arrival we were greeted by Staff and the Hotel Manager Jude. Me and my Wife requested an early check in and a quiet room. We were pleased to have these wishes granted. We also received a Bottle of wine accompanied with a card signed by The Ovolo Staff congratulating us on our recent Marriage. Simply Amazing experience. Everything was perfect their attention to detail is beyond Superb. The Ovolo Hotel has what many Hotels are missing Great Customer service Great Rooms Great Food. And to top it all off they offer so many freebies. Most hotels do not even offer free wifi anymore not to mention a really Delicious Free Breakfast. Thanks again to Jude and his Wonderful Staff. You are by far the best Hotel we have stayed in. We live in Taiwan not far. so without a doubt we will stay there on our future visits to Hong Kong. Thank you.

Our room on the tenth floor was perfect. Very clean modern and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The rooms are set up to accommodate both vacation and business travelers. There is a free mini bar with a wide variety of beverages stocked daily a free bag of various snacks the light switches are all rheostat light dimmers the desk is large the chair is comfortable the desk is stocked with office supplies there are a lot of windows the curtains block out light if you want to sleep in and the curtains are electrically controlled from the bedside switch. They even give you a free Ovolo tote bag for your shopping excursions. Ovolo tries to give you what you want before you ask for it. Our bathroom had a walk in shower with a bench to sit on while showering. The location of the hotel was great. It is easy to walk or take a short taxi ride to many restaurants bars the ferries and other sightseeing destinations. The hotel is located right in the middle of an area with a vibrant night life but the windows block out most of the noise if you need to get to sleep early.

For a hotel in the middle of LKF where people often go out late especially on weekends this needed to be disclosed. I would have stayed elsewhere if I had known. I am also not sure if the construction meant the free happy hour was also not available as it was not offered to us by staff. As someone who comes to HK 1 2 times per year for the weekend to party in LKF and also sometimes for work I was extremely let down. I feel for HK30 per night this was nowhere near good enough. In the circumstances I would think a partial refund for goodwill is warranted. I think anyone who stayed under the circumstances would have been very disappointed.
