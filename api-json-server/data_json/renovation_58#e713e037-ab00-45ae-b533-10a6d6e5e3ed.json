The Sheraton Maui Resort is located at Black Rock in the center of the \u201c master planned \u201d Kanapali Beach Resort a few miles north of Lahaina and less than hour \u2019s drive from the Kahului Airport. The Sheraton Maui Report is an \u201c iconic \u201d resort originally designed in the 60s \u2019. Towers four five and six are part of the original construction and give the property a traditional Hawaiian feel. Although remodeled and expanded over the years the property still has large grass lanai \u2019s and offers a low rise feel when compared to most of the other Kanapali properties. This was our second stay in as many years. This year we stayed eleven nights. With a combination of over 50 stays at Starwod properties in 2016 extensive use of the Starwod AMEX card and the transfer of points from my Mariot account we could accumulate the necessary points to cover the entire stay. In addition I could use Starwod points to reduce my folio covering most of the meals and the daily resort charge. We asked and were offered a room in Tower Six. This is OCEANFRONT bliss. No property including any timeshares can offer the OCEANFRONT view like Tower Six. Tower Six also has convenient outdoor parking near the room so it \u2019s a short walk to your rental car and no garage to navigate. I never saw a time where there was n\u2019t a parking space at the top of Black Rock. The trade off Is it \u2019s three separate elevator rides to get to the lobby pools beach or the rest of the hotel. It \u2019s the only way to get around Black Rock. The rooms were clean but dated. I understand that it \u2019s been twenty years since the last remodel. The bathroom is dated and lacks the under sink storage or vanity drawers that newer properties offer. There is no mini bar. The refrigerator is small and a larger one would help when wanting to store ice cream or other treats. The microwave is basic. The room also lacks power USB charging outlets near the bed. They do have plans for room renovations in the near future. We were travelling with our 9year old daughter. The hotel provided us with a very nice roll away at no charge which was only offered with a daily fee last year. Be nice to the front desk staff at check in as they have the power to comp the roll away. The Sheraton Maui recently changed up their \u201c Club Lounge \u201d. A nice breakfast is still served at the top of Tower Five the original lobby of the hotel. Night snacks have been moved to the Black Rock Lounge in an attempt to save money as a test. For Platinum and those paying for \u201c Club Lounge \u201d perks the evening snacks are disappointing. Each night only one hot entry was available which half the time was tasteless wantons. No cheese or cracker platter was available just peanuts and vegetables. This is not what you \u2019d expect from premier Sheraton Club Lounge. Complimentary beer and wine was available but the service was slow. The seating in the Black Rock Lounge was minimal as compared to the Na Hoku Lounge. The Na Hoku Lounge was refitted with \u201c industrial \u201d looking furniture not the \u201c Hawaiana \u201d feel of the rest of the hotel. If you are a Starwod Platinum it \u2019s definitely worth upgrading to the breakfast buffet instead of taking bonus points. The breakfast is amazing with so much fresh fruit smoked salmon and many hot items to choose from. The scrambled eggs and bacon were definitely above average for a complimentary buffet. On the third day of our stay they changed the policy allowing our daughter to dine with us at no additional cost. I understand this is only a summer promotion. A bar at the beach serves food during the day and night but there are better deals to be had by walking next door to the Kanapali Beach Hotel \u2019s Tiki Bar. The Shraton is a ten minute walk from the convenience stores eg ABC Stores of Whaler \u2019s Village. There is a nice small shop on property just off the lobby. The big \u201c rip off \u201d on property is the hot dog stand at the base of tower four. Called \u201c Haute Dogs \u201d they have the priciest hot dogs on the island. Nothing to eat under 10 bucks as you are forced to order French Fries if you want just one hot dog. The Westin nearby has a much better pool concession. The biggest disappointment was wasting two hours touring the nearby Westin Timeshares. The Sheraton has many young attractive polite hostesses always trying to talk you into taking the timeshare tour. We got talked into it for 150 Starpoints. The new Westin timeshares were basic the views fair and the property is at the north end of Kanapali Beach a VERY VERY LONG walk to the south side of Black Rock. The Westin \u2019s \u201c closer \u201d was a real \u201c snake oil saleswoman \u201d and lies like a politician. She claimed the snorkeling in front of the Westin timeshares was much better than at Black Rock \u2026. no one else on the island including the dive and snorkel rental concessions believed it \u2026 they just shook their heads. Pass on the Timeshare pitch. last year we went to the Hyat timeshare tour and it was a much more pleasant experience and a nicer property too. If you are looking for the \u201c perfect \u201d location for the \u201c perfect \u201d relaxing stay on Maui the Sheraton Maui Resort is the perfect place to stay It has character lots of Hawaiian theme and an overall low key experience situated on top of one of the best swimming and snorkeling beaches in Hawaii.", "offset": [3013, 3134], "date": "2017-07-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "5fcde059-136b-47f0-bfaf-e7c1a86bbd61", "sentence": "Premium Location with Beautiful Grounds.

Having stayed for ten days in 2016 at the Hyat upon returning to Maui in 2017 we decided to try the Sheraton. We were definitely happy with our decision as the Sheraton is more spread out with less rooms than the Hyat so it was quieter and did not feel like the resort was a party island. On the day of our arrival there was a huge storm in Maui and the power went out to the whole island during the night the Sheraton was quick to restore the power in the morning. During the storm our ceiling started leaking and after a day of them trying to dry the carpet even though it was still leaking they upgraded us to the next room type Deluxe Oceanfront. This room upgrade was lovely its in the other wing of the hotel an additional lift and a decent walk is required to reach this side of the resort. The other wing seems to be newer the Sheraton is one of the original resorts in Maui and could certainly do with a makeover but this seems to be consistent across all the hotel chains in Maui so it is something you just have to accept if modern is more your thing. If you do you will have a much better experience as it is all very 70s Hawaii feel in the rooms. Having said that the rooms are all functional and clean. The pool is lovely the usual issue of people claiming sunlounges by 8 am was a daily sight. We were at the pool by 8 am every day and people who claimed lounges under the umbrellas were not seen for hours. Only one day out of ten did the pool staff monitor this and remove items after the forewarned one hour time elapsed. It would be a better experience for guests who actually spend time at the pool if this was consistent. We were locked out of our room one day as the batteries on the lock ran out. After walking all the way to the front desk the receptionist did not understand what was wrong which was surprising as surely batteries running out on the locks would happen often enough over 500 rooms for her to have experienced it prior. After a miscomunication on her part as it appears she decided we had locked ourselves out we finally had maintenance come out to our room after half an hour of waiting and let us in using a giant hook under the door as they did not have the electronic device to open the door with them once again surprising. The customer relations manager was kind enough to provide some complimentary drinks to compensate for the inconvenience.

The woman at the front desk almost seemed to delight in telling us on ocean view and only 2 double beds. So much for a romantic week. We also discovered later that we were put in one of the unrenovated rooms with a view of the tennis courts and covered walkway. Luckily there are brezeways along the corridor so you can sit there for your ocean view. We had other challenges while there. Also evident that much of the hotel is undergoing updating many many rooms not available. Beautiful spacious grounds and recommend onsite luau Black Rock Grill is great. Polside staff very friendly. Also room was never cleaned before 2 pm daily. Overall just disappointed with what we got for our money. Do like you get max daily sun and proximity to Black Rock for snorkeling.

As a MARIOT Titanium Elite I booked on points used suite upgrades and was upgraded to their largest suite for the stay. Elite status also got us free self parking and the choice of a 250 resort credit or free breakfast for the entire family. This was a no brainer go for the breakfast. The Buffet has everything and the staff there went out of their way to recognize my status and make sure we knew they were there for us Mac and Gavyn. The pool here is good. It \u2019s not the best pool I \u2019ve ever seen but it has plenty of areas and depths and the water never felt crowded. Like any resort the pool at a spring break can run short on chairs. We rented a cabana the two days we wanted to be at a pool beach. For 150 day it was worth it for us to have space shade and no worries about someone trying to take our chair. The concessionaire that does that and hands out towels was very friendly and helpful each day we were at the beach. Right next to the pool the staff set up soccer corn hole lawn bowling etc every day which our kid loved to be able to go and play as well as meet other kids. The beach at Black Rock has eroded a bit from winter storms so right I front of the hotel there is n\u2019t a ton of room to sit on the sand but take a 5 min stroll south and the beach starts to widen and you can easily find a spot to spread out on the beach. The best part about this hotel is there is world class snorkeling right off the beach. We snorkeled it twice. Tip the earlier in the day you go the calmer the water tends to be. There is a concessionaire right there who rents equipment. The suite we were upgraded to was recently renovated and was a very large one bedroom suite. It was on the top floor. The balcony was big and had a beautiful view. Pic belowWe did the Luau one night. My husband and son enjoyed it. Just know it is out on the lawn and in the direct sun so it can be warm until the sunsets go down. If you are looking for 5 star luxury this is n\u2019t that resort.

We arrived around 5 pm on 113. Check in was easy fairly quick. Because of the construction this was done in an open air area one level above check in parking. We used our suite night awards to upgrade to an ocean front room located in building 6 top floor. Room. Pros it was roomy appeared to have been renovated in the last year. View was outstanding overlooking Blackrock. Service was friendly mostly on time each morning. Had a fairly close walk to the fitness room. Our only gripe would be that our only option for this room was 2 double beds. Had these been queen size it would have been fine but when you are use to a king a double can be a little snug. I have seen many have issues with the length of the walk from building 6 to pool bars etc. Yes it is a hike but the privacy quietness made it worth it for us we do a lot of walking anyway. Pools. Were great we never had an issue finding a place to sit. If you wanted to get chairs that were also covered by an umbrella you had to play the put your things out early game which we did a couple of times. Since we were spending 400 per night we did not mind taking our yetis to the pool area frankly many others did the same. We did order a good lunch a couple days from the pool bar service was always friendly. Most lunch items were 1520 beers are 7. The only Con I can think of is they could use some more of the water pillows as these were hard to come by at times. The free sunscreen was a great amenity. Beach could not be better. Very wide this time of year if you like to snorkle you could not beat location. We had brought our own gear so we did this at least a couple times each day. Current waves were manageable. We actually went all the way around the blackrock outside area. Tons of fish. if you go earlier in the morning 8 10 there is a good chance to see the large turtles. We stopped at Wal Mart 1 mile from airport bought two beach chairs for 13 each an umbrella for 10 less than the cost of renting for one day on property. We did notice a short walk down the beach path. in front of another property they were advertising 2 chairs umbrella snorkle gear for two boogie boards a cooler for 99 for 5 days. IMO that would be a bargain even if you only used it sparingly over your week. Restaurants. The only meal we ate on property was at their Japanese Restaurant. Typical chef show ours was very entertaining. Food was more than plentiful quality was very good. Only Con is pricing but we knew that when we went there. My wife I are not huge eaters so we generally split entrees when we dine out. There was a 20 split fee here so she ended up ordering the veggie dinner which was only 22. I had the shrimp lobster which was 42. Wine split was 28 my beer was 8. One of the most enjoyable perks was we received free breakfast buffet each day because of my Mariot status. This was great. Not sure what the normal charge would have been but I am sure it was pricey. They had anything you could possible want. Made to order omelets egg frittatas scrambled eggs 4 or 5 choices of meat bacon sausages our favorite fresh mahi mahi tons of fresh fruit yogurt cereals pastries juices great coffee. Overall Resort. Excellent considering it is over 55 years old. Sure there are some areas that could use some additional renovation but overall we were more than pleased with our stay. Local Area. As great as the property itself is we really enjoyed the convenient location to visit other areas. Only a 10 minute walk to Whalers Village which has many stores several restaurants. We only ate here one evening bar at the Hula Grill. it was very good. As with all dining in Hawaii prices are fairly steep but we did not have a bad meal. One great perk with the Sheraton is they have a shuttle that runs every hour until around 100 in the evening to Lahaina. We used this every night to go out to dinner. It makes a stop at the Westin the Safeway the Outlets last stop is the Wharf. it is free you can catch it back if you plan your timing right.
