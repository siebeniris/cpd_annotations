The Sheraton is one of the host hotels for the event and is educated about who we are and what we do.

After a significant wait I was checked in thanked for being a rewards member and told I had a harbor view room. I got to my room which had all the natural light of a cave. My view was of a tree that blocked the entire window which was facing. well I do not know because I literally can not see anything.

I went to the front desk and asked for the room to be serviced while I went to the opening reception.

I stopped at the desk on the way to the meeting and again asked for coffee shampoo and conditioner. The wet wash cloth from my morning shower was right where I left it. Figuring housekeeping would be notified to be sure the room was properly serviced. When i returned to the room at 530 the coffee set up was done so i hoped the bathroom was as well. Unfortunately I was given a body wash lotion and 2 bars of soap still no shampoo or conditioner. I called and asked to have housekeeping bring it up.

My family hosted a reunion in Norfolk over the weekend. With most of the family living outside of Virginia and very little to go on other than photographs and a sales pitch we opted for this place as the host hotel. As an SPG member and avid traveler I can say that not only is this the worst Starwod brand hotel that I have stayed in but it is probably one of the worst hotel stays that I have experienced in my 20 years of traveling as an adult. For this hotel to be advertised as a world class hotel is just well fraudulent. This was glaringly apparent from the moment we stepped foot on the property. Upon arrival the front desk staff was cold and unwelcoming no smiles no thank you for being an SPG member etc. Even though they had a two week notice that our party would be arriving early and even picked us up from the airport none of our rooms were ready and we were advised that they would call us when they were available. Two hours later our room was finally ready. Additionally four months prior while making my reservation I requested a room on a higher floor and was told no problem. With that said I was upset that we were placed on the third floor with a view of a tree. We immediately called down to the front desk and requested to be moved. We were again met with attitude and told there were no other rooms available and they mysteriously had no record of my request. When we asked to speak with a Manager we were transferred to a voicemail. We left a message and 4 days later have yet to receive a call back. We were however moved to the 4th floor right above the old room with the exact same view. While the hotel was close to capacity this past weekend I had several family members check in after me who are not SPG members but were placed on the 7th 8th and 9th floors so they lied to us about being unable to accommodate us. They just did not care. Aside from a remodeled lobby the rest of the hotel is about 3 decades past its prime. The elevator was dirty. The rooms are outdated and filthy. EVERYTHING including the TV was coated with dust. The bathroom had mold in the shower a chipped toilet and cracks in the wall. The room reeked of body odor and urine. Later on I was horrified when one of my children discovered a pair of urine soaked underwear underneath the bed that housekeeping failed to remove. To make matters worse our room was only cleaned once during our stay. When we inquired as to why we were told they were behind. So we just asked for fresh towels which took them 1hour to bring. Sadly we heard this was the case from several other family members. Interestingly enough the housekeeping carts and two of the cleaning ladies always seemed to be on our floor even as late as 6 pm. They seemed to be doing more arguing and using profanity rather than cleaning rooms though. When we pointed out that our small children could hear their inappropriate language they told us they were just frustrated because the hotel was short staffed and they were running out of clean linens and towels. As far as WiFi goes the hotel advertises free Internet for SPG members which I can not vouch for since I could never log in. They also advised us during booking that the hotel offered a complimentary shuttle within a 3mile radius. When I called to arrange transportation I was told they could not accommodate us because the airline pilots in the hotel received priority over other guests in the hotel. I then asked if any pilots were leaving or coming in the next 30 minutes as the restaurant we wanted to go to was only 1 mike away. Rather than answering my question the transportation rep simply said he could not help us and then hung up the phone. While I did notice a few pilots during our stay I also noticed the shuttle bus parked in front of the hotel every time we left for dinner and in the same when we returned. Speaking of food the banquet food was surprisingly good. In addition our Event Manager Shelton was professional and personable.
