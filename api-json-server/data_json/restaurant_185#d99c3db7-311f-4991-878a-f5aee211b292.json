However they could improve on service delivery. After traveling for over 26 hours I arrived at the hotel 4 hours prior to check in and they would not let me check in early unles I paid an additional 50 of the room cost for the day. The hotel was obviously not busy and if they had a room available they should be able to provide outstanding service like other hotels in the area and provide free early check in. Also while I was having breakfast in the hotel restaurant the manager approached a table of two guests and told them they needed to move from the four top table they chose to sit at even though the restaurant was empty and had plenty of available tables. As a frequent traveler through Nairobi I normally opt to stay at the Sankara Hotel. I wanted to try something different this time and the hotel looked very nice. However I regret my decision and will return to staying at the Sankara for all future travel through Nairobi as it is a far superior hotel to DusitD2 and they provide superior service.

Prior to my most recent visit to DusitD2 I had stayed at the hotel on 2 different occasions and enjoyed my experience thus the decision to return on my birthday weekend between 9th and 11th OctoberIn my own observation I must admit with every stay it seems the standards are going down. Nevertheless there were more ups than downs on this particular visit. Upon arrival at the hotel there was no porter or concierge personnel at hand to help me with my luggage. Needless to say the security guys were deep in conversation and just stared at me without greeting as I struggled with my two large bags. At the front office desk the check in process was too slow for my liking considering that I had made an online reservation a few days earlier indicating my arrival time and all other specifications. The welcome drink they offered was extremely bitter. They also did not have change in dollars which was a bit of a disappointment. Eventually they allocated a room and Chris from concierge escorted me there. The room had twin beds. I returned to the front desk to have my room changed only to be given another room which was below my expectations once again. The 2nd room was dark and the couch had a really bad stain. At this point I had lost patience and was wondering what else could possibly go wrong. The assistant front office manager Jese Turanta was very apologetic and quick to address my frustrations. He moved me to a much better room that was spacious and had a balcony with a spectacular view. I was very delighted by this. I had all my meals at SOKO restaurant. I must mention three outstanding waitstaf that made my experience worthwhile Evarestus Patrick and Francis. Alan was also very good during breakfast service. It is because of their promptness attention to detail great food recommendations knowledge of the menu and exceptional customer care that I enjoyed my stay here. I would highly recommend the pork spare ribs and the braised beef short ribs very delicious. The tree tomato juice was watery and bland this time round but usually it is quite good. There should be more variety during breakfast too. When i got back to my room Cynthia from room service I think delivered a special birthday package of a bowl of fruit a tasty dessert with a birthday message written on the plate bottle of wine and a birthday card from the hotel. I was over the moon. Joan and George of housekeeping were very good during turndown service. Perminus of Zing lounge was quite friendly and hospitable as well. James at SOI restaurant was also professional. Levina handled my check out the day I was leaving and she was very pleasant and efficient. Overall I enjoyed my stay and I will most definitely return to the premises in the near future.

So it is been a week since that fateful Saturday night when I surrendered my tastebuds to the Dusit Restaurant. I was assured by Dora and George of Dusit that they would get back to me. they have not. So this was my regrettable experience. I dined with my Aunt and cousin. Said cousin and I ordered the 300 g rib eye steak my Aunt the smoked salmon. We waited and waited by the way the place was only 14 full and waited. Anyhow our steak arrived. OK to call it was steak is a reach. A rib eye is a plump juicy steak about 1 15 cm thick. What arrived was a thin dog eared flattened steak with juices flooding the plate. My aunts food arrived about 20 minutes later and was poached salmon so that went back and eventually her smoked salmon arrived. By now she was tired and furious. So my cousin and I put our heads down and ate. I could only manage a little though as it was both TOUGH and slightly rancid. it was also cut with odd flaps like a dogs ear. I did not complain so as not to ruin the evening with my Aunt. Dora came and apologised about the delay and gave us a complimentary hard dessert. I lied and said I was full so pls pack the steak for take away. I then left the steak with reception to be given to Dora she had already departed as there was NO WAY I was going to eat any more. I left my phone number and said I wanted her to try it when she arrived. Come Monday no call. So I called. Dora apologised again and gave me George who is excuse was we have been having problems with our supplier. Dah like that is something Dusit should handle and not experiment with their clients health. I then said your chef probably took an old steak then sliced it laterally to produce 2 steaks and cooked the nearly off meat for me and my cousin. George said nothing and invited me to come for dinner. I said No I do not want another Kamakazi experience in my mouth. I asked to talk to the head Chef. Oh he is not here he is starting at Dusit in AugustGreat some junior hack job is in the kitchen dishing out old steak and then slicing it in two to cut costs. I wish I had taken a photoSO.
