On Saturday night when I returned to my room after being out all day I heard what sounded like a smoke fire alarm going off on the 2nd floor.

The person who took my call told me unfortunately their engineer had left for the evening and if the alarm was bothering me I could move to another room. In my opinion this was not a reasonable or safe option. Fire alarms not working properly in a hotel are really not okay. We had two people in the room and the housekeeper only left two towels and one wash cloth on our 2nd night. We had used all the towels 3 towels 4 wash cloths and 2 hand towels supplied the previous day. There was one K Cup of regular coffee 2 decaf and one tea not adequate for 2 people.

I calmly and quietly relayed the information about the alarm and she again told me their engineer was already gone for the day so it could not be fixed until he returned. I asked her if it was reasonable to ask people to sleep in a multi floor building with a nonfunctional smoke fire her response was no. The hotel credited my breakfast charge for my trouble.
