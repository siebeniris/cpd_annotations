The other half of our party \u2013 in the \u201c new wing \u201d had a very updated room slate tile bathroom with gleaming walk in shower white and grey colour scheme throughout. But these rooms were much narrower \u2013 there was practically no furniture at the bottom of the bed and just enough room to get by and there was no wardrobe just a tiny hanging rail that could fit maybe 3 hangers. The pool facility was like some kind of retro under the sea grotto with fake icicles hanging from the ceiling a hot tub and a pool so small you can barely get wet in it.

The staff ran thorugh the free rooms with us to take a look how noisy they are. As I said. they staff was kind. In the end we got a room on the 5th floor. Still construction work but only renovation and not as noisy as the 8th. They told us the room has been refurbished lately. The walls had stratches already but the room was fine and the bed was cozy. Exept the door which was leaky and when other guests opened the entry of their rooms our door made a loud noise so we thought there is someone coming in. Even at night. Stockholm was a true beauty and we\u00b4ve walked a lot through the city. After we came back to the hotel we wanted to go to the Spa. For that kind of luxury hotel the Spa was small. Two saunas one for men one for woman. no mixed one. We were realxing in the whirlpool as the staff came in and said something in swedish.
