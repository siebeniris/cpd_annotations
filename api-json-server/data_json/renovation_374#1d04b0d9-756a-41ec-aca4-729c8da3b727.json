My husband and I and our 2year old daughter. The hotel gave us a very good upgrade to a junior suite with pool access which really made a difference in our holiday as our daughter was able to just go into the pool from the rooms and we could also sit on our terrace at the pool side whilst she was taking a nap. The grounds are immaculate and the pools beautiful. The beach is very wide and set in a beautiful bay with rocks on each side and behind the hotel. The hotel really has class. People dress nicely for the meals and in general it just feels really classy. The majority of the guests are from Europe and are 50 although we also met some younger couples. RomsVery spacious massive bathroom and comfortable bed. The walk in closet was so large we actually put the baby travel bed in there. Plenty of towels which seemed to be changed every time we went out. Plenty of water bottles as well and nespreso coffee machine plus free minibar with soft drinks. I read some reviews about the rooms being tired and in need of refurbishment but this was definitely not the case for our room 115. RestaurantsWe ate breakfast at the main restaurant and dinner at the China Mood and Beach Pavilion. The Beach pavilion was lovely great setting right on the beach very lovely service and lots of attention for our daughter as well. The kids menu was extensive well done on this as most hotels just get stuck with the usual fast food items. My daughter ate lovely fresh grilled hamour and spinach very tasty. The d\u00e9cor is ok and we did a brunch on Friday which was amazing. Best lobster ever. The China Mood restaurant was ok dumplings bit tasteless but the duck was lovely. the main let down here was the decoration or rather the lack thereof on the terrace it was so uninspired besides the Chinese lamps it felt like you were in a parking lot. No table cloths same chairs as on the beach that go well there but not here no partitions to fence off the restaurant. It really did not do anything for us. Inside it was ok but the terrace was really nothing nice. BreakfastBreakfast is ok nothing special the quality could be better as well. We ate some amazing local food in Muscat and it would be good if the hotel could include some local datebreads and pancakes rather then trying to make crepes and waffles which just were not so nice. For a hotel of this class I was missing some really good breakfast items. KidsclubThere is not really one. Although there are activities for older kids such as sports and cooking classes. It would be nice if there would be some toys andor activities for the smaller kids as well. All in all we loved our stay but it could be made even better with some attention to the interior decoration of the restaurants and some more variety and creativity in the breakfast. We will be back for sure.", "offset": [1074, 1205], "date": "2015-03-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "ea84ac63-0c56-48ae-8712-35e286ee69f2", "sentence": "Exceptional. wow. what a wonderful place. nice weather. nice views. beautiful sea. great service. i will be coming back. really really a place that you will love from the first moment. my room was located in the wing which is not renovated yet and the bed is not that comfortable and the tower rooms all renovated but were full. but they told me all of the rooms will be renovated soon. also rooms in floors 1 2 and 3 does not have that much of sea views.", "offset": [185, 328], "date": "2015-09-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "f7c6d203-1e18-40ff-a627-f8f1dabb834f", "sentence": "Unique Muscat.

I briefly considered the Shangri La for this trip but after visiting the Shang property yesterday I am pleased we came back to Al Bustan and would do again in the future. The Palace is a unique albeit older building with huge grounds vast lawns and dates palms for natural shade 50 m infinity pool and by comparison one of the nicer beaches by the standards of the other local resorts imo. Although the property is 30 years old it is still in very good condition and has been well maintained. I am not sure if it is had a refit since Ritz took the property over and is starting to show some signs that it could benefit from some renovations imo.

First impressions of the hotel were good with a large atrium with the spectacular chandelier and aroma of frankincense. Check in was efficient however rather robotic with little personal service. As we arrived early we were informed the room would not be ready until after 2 pm which was not an issue as we were able to use the polside facilities in the interim. Once we arrived at the pool the attendants were initially reluctant to provide towels and water as we did not yet know of our room number however when asked where we were from and replying London they happily provided us with towels which we felt to be a strange form of verification of guests. After a few technical glitches at reception that afternoon we were shown to our room which was a Deluxe Mountain View twin room. The room felt quite tight however featured all the necessary amenities one would expect from a 5 star hotel in the Middle East including a Nespreso machine desk and complementary high speed WiFi to name a few. The bathroom on the other hand felt extremely tight with a bathtub taking most of the space. Personally a free standing shower would have been more space effective as well as more practical. The room was cleaned daily as one would expect and a turn down service was provided in the evening however we found that the service quality deteriorated during our stay the beds not re made in the evening mats not laid out beside the bed as earlier in our stay and the chocolates appeared to have been placed in a rush beside the beds. Furthermore the bed linen occasionally had holes in it which one would not expect from such a hotel. The hotels grounds including swimming pool and beach area are well kept with a central swimming pool as well as two lagoon pools primarily for lagoon access rooms. As it was Eid the hotel was full and the polside was often quite noisy so we did not use these but instead swam in the sea which was around 24 degrees and usually quite calm so easy to swim. There were also water sports including kayaks and bodyboards available for complimentary hire which was an added bonus. Staff around the beach and polside were attentive in bringing towels and waterboxes and complementary watermelon on sticks and icecream were served in the afternoon. Food at the hotel was of a good quality but nothing outstanding. Breakfast was usually extremely busy given the high occupancy however food was often replenished quickly. Staff often appeared rushed off their feet and were not always on hand to clear away empty plates. We also dined at the buffet restaurant for dinner one evening which was a nice change to the city however far more expensive at 22 OMR plus tax per person. The quality of food was good and was often freshly cooked for you however given the price I think many people chose alternatives as the restaurant only ever appeared 25 full. The hotel provided a complimentary shuttle service to Mutrah Souq departing at 1630 and returning at 190 which was useful however not ideal as the souq became truly alive after 180 and therefore did not leave much time to dine outside the hotel. With a full refurbishment of the hotel including rooms corridors and common areas as well as staff training to match the standards of other Ritz Carlton hotels worldwide the Al Bustan Palace could once again become a jewel within Oman and the Middle East.", "offset": [3177, 3432], "date": "2016-09-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "16f6a011-2275-4150-9acb-a5f3ee2d9f3c", "sentence": "A Magnificent Gem. The hotel is a magnificent gem at the point where the mountains meet the sea and it makes the most of the beautiful cove on which it sits. The beach is one of the best in Muscat though still natural and not overly manicured and the hotel is a haven away from the bustle of life whether you come for the serene spa afternoon tea the glorious lobby lunch by the pool or to stay. We stayed at the end of one of the wings in a lagoon access room facing the gardens the Al Bustans miraculous lawns and the sea. The rooms are very comfortable beautifully decorated and a comfortable size. The bathrooms are slightly old fashioned and basic with the shower in the bath. but really it is not a problem you want to be in the gardens pool and seaAs we visited at the end of the summer season and the hotel was definitely suffering for it. Compared to a previous visit in January 2016 the hot and quiet season clearly has a negative effect on the upkeep and service. The lagoon pool outside the room which is so appealing for a quick morning dip was horribly dirty algae and dust when we arrived and then worse at first light they heavily chlorinated it so it was unusable all morning and full of strings of dead black algae all afternoon. The main pool was also direly in need of a serious clean a little disappointing but the sea was just perfect so more than made up for it. Food was not great either several restaurants seem to close for the summer and it makes the rest busy and over stretched. The food was expensive as well very poor value. Normally the hotel is great for food the beach pavilion does a fantastic brunch through the winter though the Chinese restaurant does not have a pork kitchen so seems vaguely pointlesThe Six Senses Spa is also beautifully situated and an escape from the world. The 80 minute massages are excellent value and the therapists are lovely and really know what they are doing.

If you book to stay hear you wo nt be disappointed unles you are really fussy \u2026 I am quite fussy myself but could n\u2019t find much to complain about. I LOVED this hotel and can not wait to go back. The food was delicious and the service was great they can not do enough for you. But what I loved the most was the lobby the pool area. At the pool area you are either looking at the amazing swimming pool the beach or the palm trees and mountains. Its so easy to find a spot to yourself either by the pool on the grass or on the beach and it \u2019s so quiet and relaxing. It does n\u2019t feel cramped at all like other hotels I have stayed in. You are also given several bottles of water in a cool box and they bring around fruit throughout the day and there is also waiter service so you do n\u2019t have to move if you do n\u2019t want to. The hotel lobby is amazing it \u2019s huge and like nothing else i ve seen the pictures do n\u2019t quite do it justice. If you just want a nice relaxing holiday with nice weather and first class service then I highly recommend this hotel. If I had to find fault I would say the rooms are a bit dated but they are currently refurbishing them so am sure they will be lovely when they are done. Maybe there were some areas around the pool area which deserve a little bit attention the toilets to the left and the hut next to it and some of the umberelas have tears in stains on and should be replaced but this is if I am looking for something to be picky about these things certainly would n\u2019t spoil your holidayThe only other thing would be the pastries I love a pastry and was a bit disappointed with the pain au chocolates as they did n\u2019t taste fresh but the rest of the food was amazing. Re sightseeing would defiantly go to the Grand Mosque what an amazing building. I would n\u2019t bother with the souk unles you like buying crap souvenirs \u2026. But if you want to stay in Oman I would highly recommend here I know other people that have stayed here and at several other places in Muscat and they all say Al Bustan is by far the best.", "offset": [1072, 1224], "date": "2017-03-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "9a3134a1-ac9a-4006-be41-667dca7ab953", "sentence": "A beautiful stay.
