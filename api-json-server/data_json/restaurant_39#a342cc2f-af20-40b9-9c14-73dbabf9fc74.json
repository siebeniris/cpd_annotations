We went to Malta last summer and stayed at the Corinthia Marina in St Georges Bay which we thought was very good. Bob is to have a hip replacement soon so we wanted somewhere with more accessibility and less hills so chose Le Meridien in the heart of Baluta Bay. It has plenty of restaurants close by and a public bus stop outside. Maltas public buses are generally very good except on Sundays when they are so crowded. You check in on the third floor but except for checking out you do not use this floor again unles you want to use the bar. so you do not get the cheery good morning that you get from most hotel receptions. Our room was a deluxe sea view on floor 7. Le Meridien does not have the greatest sea view but this was probably about as good as it gets. The room was large with a good size balcony and good bathroom facilities including robe and slippers. Unfortunately on returning to our room on day 2 the patio doors rattled it was windy and the maintenance man could not fix it. We were moved very promptly next door and although the room was very similar the balcony was about half the size and the sea view that much less due to buildings being in the way. Housekeeping was inconsistent. Some mornings we received a bottle of water some we did not. Coffee was always replenished but the tea selection which was extensive hardly ever got replenished. More often than not only one flannel was left. There is no fridge which in the height of the summer would be a big downside. There is a notice effectively telling you not to even touch the minibar as you would be charged for any items that were disturbed. Wifi generally was ok in the room but we think it is a cheek that unles you have a deluxe room or are a regular Starwod guest wifi is not free. Even when it is it is the basic package and you have to pay extra for faster. Compare this with small restaurants and bars nearby which all offer free wifi. We had a poor experience late one evening. It was nearly 11 and we were reading in bed when there was a knock at the door and almost immediately the door was being opened. Fortunately we had the bolt on. It appeared that there was an internet problem in the next room and they seemed to be checking if ours was ok. We complained about the intrusion. The duty manager Bernard was very apologetic and a couple of days later a bottle of wine and some chocolates appeared with a note. that was a nice response but should not have been necessary. We note one or two reviewers stated excellent breakfast. In our opinion they must be very easily satisfied. When we stay at hotels our preferred breakfast is porridge followed by poached eggs and grilled bacon. At the egg station there was one gentleman who had no problem poaching eggs for us but on 3 occasions out of 12 we were told no poached eggs. Also some mornings there were no omelettes. We do not know from where they source their bacon but only if you like bacon with 90 fat would you have eaten it. Porridge was also inconsistent. some mornings perfect some mornings so lumpy and others so thin you wondered if any oats has been included. The best thing about breakfast was the Ftira bread which made excellent toast. In fact one morning when there were no eggs and the porridge in our opinion inedible our breakfast consisted of ftira bread toast and jam. Finally although it states it on the web site the outdoor pool is only open from June to September and the indoor pool is inadequate for swimming. We did find the concierge very helpful are not they just about everywhereWil look to stay elsewhere if we return to Malta.", "offset": [3223, 3361], "date": "2015-04-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "5cf3fcec-b9bf-41fc-b790-4fcc00eb8f49", "sentence": "Great hotel nice views.

The spa gave me the best pedicure I ever had. The lounge for SPG guests was there with cold drinks warm breakfast and snacks. The beds were clean firm and so comfortable. There were nice amenities included mouthwash toothbrush comb razor and shave cream. Our room featured two balconies and the views were spectacular. The attached restaurant the Villa had delectable food. The taxi stand was there 24 7 with a ride should you need one. The hotel was situated in the middle of the promenade which afforded a magnificent walk between St Julians and Valletta. There were plenty of fruit stands restaurants groceries and bars close by.

My wife and I booked a package deal and when we saw the hotel we would be staying at we were thrilled. A 5 star nice view spa facilities bar great loaction etc. When we arrived we were even more thrilled. Our room was ready at 11 am when check in is at 2 pm. so we were off to a good start. The room was spacious and inviting with a large bathroom and separate toilet and a comfy bed. We did not have a sea view but made nothing of it as the room was great for us. The door lock on the balcony was broken and a curtain came down from the rail so we called down to the front desk and they sent Martin the maintenance man to fix it. We left him there and when we got back all had been fixed. First day we went to the pool in the spa. On the way down we met a waitress from the breakfast restaurant so we asked what time breakfast would be the next day. She also recommended the bar lounge for dinner which would offer us a complimentary meal on Monday and Wednesday should we desire. We asked again complimentary. she said yes. We had had no intention of eating in the hotel because it is expensive and we thought it was strange that we were being offered a free meal with our package. So the next day we went down to breakfast which was fine but nothing to rave about and on the way out we asked the hostess at the entrance to the restaurant about the dinner. She said yes yes it is on Monday and Wednesday and it is complimentary. She checked our room number on her list and confirmed it. We then asked where we could find a pharmacy as both of us were ill with colds. She said there is one across the road and there is also one in the hotel itself. We are baffled as to why she would tell us this as there clearly is not one in the hotel. That evening Monday we went down to the bar lounge for dinner. We asked the waitress if the meal was complimentary she said yes. We had a mix up almost immediately with the food as we had told the wait staff we are vegetarian and would not be going for any rabbit or beef. They misunderstood and thought it was only my wife who was veggie so they brought me a platter of meats and fish while they brought her a pasta. I had just ordered salmon which was not on the menu but they assured me they could make for me with no bother. The salmon was dry and the attitude was even drier. We eventually asked if we needed to provide our room number and she said yes I will bring the bill. So we sat there as she placed a 64 Euro bill in front of us. My wife went to get the Duty Manager to sort it all out because no one seemed to understand us. My wife is half American and speaks excellent English and I am fully British. Our English is not difficult to understand yet we could not make ourselves understood. The duty manager came to our table and stood while we sat and chatted to us in front of the other guests in the lounge instead of taking us aside. There were not many people there but it was uncomfortable all the same. She said that this has never happened before and we explained that in this case it certainly had happened and we tried to describe the person who had told us. She then left to make a phone call came back and said that the employee in question has denied telling us it was a free dinner included in the package and that she would not have had any way to check even if it was. How are we supposed to know this. Still we should have smelled a rat when the in hotel pharmacy never materialized. She even said the words. I am not saying you are lying. We were incredulous. You do not say that to a customer. That infers that that did indeed cross your mind. The duty manager offered us 50 off. We took it but left with a sour taste in our mouths that could have also been the food. Two nights later we had salmon in Frescos. Now that is how it is done. So the staff had trouble understanding us save for the gentleman who checked us in who had a South African accent. On our last day we asked the front desk where we could leave our luggage for the afternoon after checking out and she said with the concierge. We thought she was talking about the lady downstairs who sits in a room booking tours for guests. Is that not a concierge. Apparently not. That is a shop. However instead of simply saying no sir that is a shop. You can leave your bags over here to the right with the concierge here. Instead she said I do not know what you are talking about sorry and then giggled with her colleague. I tell these stories disappointedly because we had such a good start and we were on our belated honeymoon and celebrating my wifes birthday and I feel that if we had not tried to go to dinner in the hotel we would have had a lovely stay but it was soured by the staff. I had say if you do not have any reason to see that staff you enter on floor 0 jump into the lift and go straight to your room. so you do not even have to walk by the reception desk which is on 3 for some reason. you will have a great stay. And if your television does not send you messages accusing you of going over your rooms credit limit. there is a way to relate to people and Le Meridien could bear to learn some new methods to truly earn their 5 star status in the eyes of this guest. Everything else was great but a good experience in a less stocked hotel with friendly staff can make for a better holiday than a fancy 5 star hotel with sub par service. We were not livid just disappointed. And one thing I would advise to all the staff working there if you do not know do not make something up. Say you do not know. Honorable mentions Shaun in the hotel lounge is a good waiter. I have seen another review in which he is been name dropped so I feel he deserves a mention. He was the only on that night who dealt with us in the proper way. Also Martin the maintenance man. Would I recommend the hotel. Almost. I recognize that a personal experience does not mean everyone will have the same experience and it is a nice hotel.

Cons. shower in room is small and poorly lit toilet paper feels like sandpaper I normally do not comment but this was shocking for a Le Meridien. dining anywhere in the hotel is an adventure in trying to catch the attention of several waiters who seem to wander aimlessly with no purpose more on this later spa services are nice but the rooms are poorly insulated so I could hear everything in the hallways not so relaxing wifi was sporadic. I had lunch at the restaurant upon arriving. This was a 2 hour affair cut short only because I begged for my bill. I had mussels. that is it. I had no fewer than 3 waiters come to my table and ask me the same questions and then disappear for 5 10 minutes. There was one other table in the restaurant and they were already paid out. I have no idea what was happening or why it took so long but it was definitely not a 5 star experience. We had tea in the lounge and again had to flag down wait staff both to order and to pay. We could see them standing around staring into space so it is not like they were frantically busy. Odd. And then one night I wanted a port and a dessert. I sat in the lounge for 10 minutes while 3 different waiters walked past me doing nothing. They stared right at me as I sat there holding the menu. I finally had to flag one down. I asked about dessert and was tossed a different menu no explanation of the specials as it turned out they had what I wanted but I did not find out until I paid. I had to go to the bar to pay. I also had similar experiences at breakfast. I had to wait to check in and then when I ordered my coffee it took forever for anyone to bring it. I also always order a side of cold soy milk. The coffee would come but not the milk. Or vice versa. It was never super busy so I could not understand the poor service.

The last three nights of my stay in Malta I spent them at the Le Meridien which proved by far another great choice of a stay. The door staff were instantly on hand at arrival and we were welcomed through the lobby area to the check in desk. We came here by taxi bags were taken care of and it could n\u2019t have been more seamless. CHECK IN SERVICE. Smooth check in top notch service. The warm welcome was accompanied with a wet hands \u2019 towel and then we were served a refreshing drink each. As it is usually the case excellent employees make the difference and the folks here were genuinely friendly and helpful from our day of arrival to day of departure. Mario the concierge was a bunch of help and was there for us any time we needed his help and advice. Extra credit though goes to Luke Azopardi who ensured that I get the most out of my business stay here. LOCATION. Unique in every way with Valetta a 10 km away. The seafront promenade below stretches from the entertainment mecca of St Julian \u2019s to the main shopping area of Sliema. Located in the grounds of a 19th century Maltese Villa the hotel overlooks the picturesque Baluta Bay in the center of the touristic heart of Malta accessible by public and sightseeing tour buses with a stop right below the hotel rear entrance. AMBIENCE. A nice relaxed and inviting lounge with a sophisticated touch of contemporary style. SUITE. Truly homely feeling. We got upgraded to the 10th floor suite 1039. Spacious impeccably clean and functional with comfortable beds and with the most breathtaking bay view. This was in fact the highlight of the suite and I would spend much time taking photos sitting at the balcony enjoying my cup of coffee watching the waves the traffic and people go by. I am sure the stay would have been totally different if it was not for the view. The aesthetically pleasant interior offered the ultimate comfort and relaxation with ample of sitting space a handy worktable a wardrobe a safe and hairdryer iron and iron board as well as coffee tea a mini bar and high speed Internet access. We had a bottle of wine upon arrival and complimentary dainty morsel daily. All highly apreciatedHOUSEKEPING The downside however was that the two out of three nights we spent here we would return in the afternoon to find the room untouched which was disappointing. Housekeeping should be more attentive and be more careful with the cleaning of the rooms. The empty tubes of shower gel and shampoo were piling up till the day we left. BATHROOM. With a separate WC room the en suite bathroom was very spacious featuring a walk in with rain shower cubicle and a big corner soaking bathtub to choose from. The shelf on the wall proved handy towels were fragrant and toiletries were ample. The fresh flower we had in the bathroom counted a lot too. Top line pampering at every aspect \u2026. and of course if pampering is what you are after do n\u2019t miss visiting the amazing Myoka Lotus Spa. I guess the room we had was an executive one but if it was nobody informed us of the exclusive Lounge and terrace. Now as I write this I realized that we might have missed it. In any case be sure to pay for Sea View rooms and Executive benefits \u2013 absolutely worth it. THE POOL. With the Spa and the indoor pool the Le Meridien has truly facilities to make the stay even more relaxed. Of course the outdoor pool was closed and with so much to do outside the premises since it was my first trip to Malta I did not find even the time to have a look on the pool outside. I did spend time at the indoor pool though I used the Sauna just once however the Steam room was not working those days. In any case the pool was great the ambience perfect peace and quiet but the Jacuzi is just for two and on all three days we were here it was always occupied. The other downside was that guests place towels on deck chairs and occupy them and they never show up even after hours. This was very disappointing. THE SPA. With specifically tailored treatments for individual requirements the Myoka Lotus Spa offers top notch services and a plethora of treatments. Upon arrival at the hotel I had a painful backache. I visited the Spa talked with a therapist and I was advised to take the traditional \u2018 Elakizhi \u2019 Ayurveda treatment. 55 mins 85 min for \u20ac 85 \u20ac10Ciara my therapist was very careful discreet and polite and explained step by step the whole procedure. The therapy had to do with fresh herb leaves cooked in Ayurvedic oils packed in bundles and applied hot. The technique nourishes tones and rejuvenates the body cells alleviates sore muscles and joints enhances and cleanses the channels of circulation and expels toxins through the sweat. This pain relief massage was beyond my expectationsBe sure to check for the special offers selected each month with exclusive prices. BREAKFAST. At Sciroco we enjoyed efficient customer service with friendly staff. The live cooking omelet point at times becomes stressful but the guys behind seem to manage and have it under control. There was plenty of choice enough to fill you up till late afternoon and the interior was inviting as well as pleasant. THE TARO RESTAURANT. The Taro is geared to whet anybody \u2019s appetite with fresh fish aged meats and a varied selection of dishes for vegetarians in a relaxing and romantic atmosphere. I had a memorable culinary experience here where in the capacity of a Food critic I had the opportunity to meet Adrian Butigieg the Executive Chef and arrange a Tasting experience comments of which you can find below. The choice is from the \u00e0 la carte menu that Adrian and Ryan Galea the Chef de Cuisine prepared exclusively for us that evening. On my photos the intermediate main course choices are smaller portions as I requested. Based on my experience I ca n\u2019t imagine someone not loving this place. AMBIENCE. Pleasant and inviting with a secluded private dining space Taro is adjacent to the main lobby of the hotel. SERVICE. Our whole meal was further enhanced by the superb serviceThe staff were very friendly and Mario Farugia the Assistant F B Manager gave recommendations on the vast range of drinks available. Melissa the restaurant \u2019s manager as well as Rodney the F B Manager would constantly drop by to check if everything was fine. I met the Bar \u2019s Manager Panos Foteiades as well the next day and thought how nice to have a Greek working hereBEVERAGE We had a Proseco Martini for a start and the accompanied wine of our choice was a delightful and refreshing Ros\u00e9 with fruity tones the Cabernet Medina Girgentina. STARTERS. The culinary trip started with five in all starters to share nicely presented on an oblong wooden flat platter each with its superb flavour and texture. All choices were genuinely delicious. Monkfish and chicken wing Oyster seawater pearls with balsamic vinaigrette local Prawns wrapped in Lardo di Colonata Norwegian Salmon gravalax and Gold Fin Tuna with Vicky Musles. In between and over pleasant chat with the Chef Mario and Melissa taking photos having a sip of wine once in a while and having a good time we had another exquisite dish which I highly recommend. Be sure to try the local Braised Rabbit with Pome Anna. The most tender rabbit leg I have ever tasted. Thumbs up. MAIN COURSE. We opted for the Pan Fried Baracuda fillets with textures of Vegetables. The catch of the day totally fresh it smelled sea. Flavoursome in every way with a firm texture making every bite mouthwatering. DESSERT. As always I requested something light and I had the warm Pear and Blueberry crumble with Citrus Creamy Vanilla Ice cream dry mango and Strawberry Gel. Extremely tasty and super yumyMy friend who has a sweet tooth opted for the Dark Chocolate fondant Berry compote Almond Ice cream and more. She loved every bite. IN ALL If you are looking for a hotel where you can simply unwind and take it easy the Le Meridien is highly recommended. Ideal for a tranquil hideaway with its Spa exceptional services but it is also ideal for business trips corporate tours events even conference meetings. The Taro restaurant on the other hand delivers the utmost care of every detail. It is one of those restaurants where you can rest assured that everything will be good.

In our room on the 9th is was LOUD it must have been awful on the lower floors. However all quiet by 230 so not too bad. Also the lift system takes a little getting use to. TV OK but only news channels and a couple of extras. pay per view movies. Breakfast we took in the lounge which was more than adequate and nice and quiet. can not comment on the main breakfast buffet but heard it was great. Decent and fee wifi for up to 5 devices. Ice on our floor always a nice touch. The staff were ALL incredibly friendly and professional. The reception supervisor so sorry forgot name Alex was great all the time. Check in was fast and efficient but gave us all the info we needed. Lydia in the bar awesome and helped accommodate a large last minute drinks reception. Thanks. The hotel is well Located on St Julians bay. Malta is small enough that taxis anywhere are never more than 20 \u20ac it seems. Airport was 20 mins and 20\u20ac The swimming area in front of the hotel is ok. Not a beach but the bays on this side of the island seem to be rocky entrances as opposed to a sandy beach. Water impeccable clean and shallow enough. Perfect temperature mid JuneThe Spa treatments were good. My wife said one of the best massages she ever had. Massive variety and nice surroundings. Loads of bars and restaurants around the hotel. We had a good rate from bokingcom at 205 \u20ac per night for 2 of us. This represented top value in my opinion. We have now joined the SPG rewards and will definitely be back. Our 4 night stay was outstanding a good value.

Getting the access to the exec lounge is recommended. They do a good enough breakfast and you could even eat enough here in the evenings. They even have a wide selection of alcoholic drinks and soft drinks and hot drinks throughout the day. Also the rooms are better.

The Meridien St Julian is a big but pleasant hotel. You just have to accept that even if you are very close to the sea sea view there is no beach. The staff is very dedicated. I would really recommend the restaurant Taro that proposes a refined cuisine. The breakfast at the Sirocco restaurant offers a very large choice. It was really peaceful and the staff was really nice. You can take a bus nearby the hotel that drives you wherever you want.

My family and I had the pleasure to stay the night at the newly refurbished and rebranded Mariot. I had stayed at the hotel under the previous brand Le Meridien and can say the refurbishments are amazing. The bedrooms are warm and the beds super comfortable. We would recommend the junior suite for that little extra room especially if you have a child or two. The Club Lounge has been moved a few levels above onto a newly constructed floor which offers superb views of Baluta Bay and the sea. Tea and coffee are on demand as well as juices and soft drinks throughout the day. The evening canap\u00e9s were freshly prepared unlike the deep fried alternatives I \u2019ve had at other Club Lounges and the alcohol selection was very good comprising beer wine and spirits. We decided to have morning breakfast in the main restaurant Market Place given the wider variety. The omelette was a big highlight for me as well as the pancakes. The staff were super friendly and always smiled. A great way to wake up in the morning. I could come back for breakfast anytime. In all the hotel feels super fresh and decor is very tasteful the staff were friendly and attentive the food and beverage experience very positive especially the breakfast. I will definitely return.", "offset": [1080, 1252], "date": "2020-02-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}]}
