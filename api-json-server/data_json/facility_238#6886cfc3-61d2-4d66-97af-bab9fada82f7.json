My wife and I enjoyed a babymon at this beautiful beachfront property the weekend after Christmas. The sunsets were magnificent over the Gulf of Mexico and the fire dancer added a unique touch. The three challenges we encountered were the expensive stone crab claws at Quins Restaurant smelled old and when we cracked them open they were a mealy texture instead of the firm flesh they should have been. The bathtub in the room had a sunken spot in the middle that was lower than the drain which resulted in several gallons of water sitting stagnant in the bottom. Finally the outdoor beach wedding on the property was very nice but the reception held on the lawn outside our 5th floor room blasted loud music for three hours Saturday night that disturbed us as we were resting to recover from colds. We were told the property is closing in summer of 2015 to remodel and rebrand to a JW Mariot.

We had the romantic week long escape we were looking for at this awesome resort. Our ocean front room on the 7th floor overlooked the sunsets and was spacious and clean. Most nights we indulged in room service to enjoy the view and time together. Add to that the long walks on a clean and uncrowded beach and you have a nearly perfect retreat. When the weather was too cold one of the days to spend on the beach we retreated to one of the pools and were pleasantly surprised. The pool was a comfortable temperature uncrowded and very relaxing. We were not happy though with the noise level of the maintenance equipment which was nearly constant throughout the day. They use tractors to take equipment out to the beach each morning chairs kayaks sailboats and to remove them in the evening or if the weather gets dicey. They are also used to drag equipment to clean the sand. If they used electric instead this would help tremendously. Power washing occurred early each morning and the use of leaf blowers. So keeping the balcony door ajar to wake up to the sound of the ocean was sadly not possible. The rooms are also not well sound insulated and doors do not close quietly so corridor noise disrupted our sleep frequently. Hopefully the scheduled renovations would address this. One night the neighbors got into a horrendous fight and we called the front desk within minutes they had put a stop to it and we did not hear a peep out of the neighbors for the rest of the week.

I told them I was not and that it must be a mistake or some other guest. They asked if I WOULD like a feather bedspread and I said yes. Later they delivered a feather comforter but only the insert for ME to replace the large cumbersome duvet cover that encases it. We spent most of our time by the pool and they had odd pool rules. I had my book and towel on my chair went swimming and returned with a tag clipped to my chair stating the time and reading my chair would be given away and my belongings stored if I did not return in one hour. When we arrived we heard other guests commenting on how expensive the food was and they were right. Single serving pizza and chicken potato dinner for my husband and myself was 96. All food VERY expensive with a 22 service fee atop of that. Also my husband and I are early risers and there was no coffee in the lobby. Each day we had to wait for the coffee shop to open. We were originally book for a 3 night say and extended our trip another day before we arrived. Day 3 we were told at the bar that we could not charge to the room cash only. Embarrassing.

I have stayed at both the Hilton and now the Mariot so I will attempt to compare them the best I can. If you or your family stay at resorts for amenities then the Mariot is the place to go. Also remember though you will pay around 300 for this resort. Hilton is around 175 and geared for people or families looking to stay at a basic yet nice resort and not spend a pretty penny. As far as the rooms Mariot is cleaner and newer but the Hilton is still clean for the most part slightly worn. Rooms are relatively the same as far as space. Pool grounds are somewhat comparable. Mariot has an adult pool and a kids pool in completely separate areas. Hilton has only one pool but it is a nice spacious pool. Unles you have kids either resort is fine for swimming. Mariot beach grounds are groomed noticably better than the Hilton. Staff and house cleaning are very nice at both resorts. Mariot has 4 restaurants cafe Hilton has 2 restaurants. When the renovations and upgrade to a JW Mariot are complete the Mariot should be spectacular. Bottom line. If you do not mind spending a pretty penny and want a lot of amenities then the Mariot is the place for you or your family. If you do not care about amenities and care more about price then the Hilton is right for you or you.

This would have been 5 stars if not for the construction. The construction areas are nicely screened but its still hard to miss cranes and equipment moving around. I have to agree with some other reviewers that mentioned the unfortunate placement of the temporary exhibit space on the beach. It definitely takes away the view of the ocean when sitting around the kids pool. Self parking was also a pain because the construction workers took up a lot of the spots. Now on to the good stuff. There is lots. Common areas. this hotel was spotless. The lobby was beautiful and has a great view of the pool and ocean. The shops inside have anything you might have forgot to pack. The store prices were similar to any other resort I have been too. Pools beach. With two kids ages 2 and 4 we spent most of the time at the kids pool. The zero entry area is awesome. There are spray features galore. My kids did not want to get out of it. We had no trouble finding chairs close enough to keep an eye on the kids. The food and beverage service polside was expensive but very convenient. Beach We spent most of the mornings on the beach. The beach is very wide and soft. Some people mentioned you needed to wear sandals or water shoes because of the shells. However we did not have any issues with the shells. The beach service hut was very helpful. Each morning we visited the hut exchanged our pool towel cards for towels and requested beach chairs and an umbrelapart of the resort fee. Within five minutes or so the umbrella and chairs were set up in a location of our liking. They even gave us extra chairs for some friends we had visiting for free. We utilized the drink cart a few times on the beachthink golf course drink cart. Room. We had a standard updated two bed room. The resort provided a pack and play which seemed brand new. The beds were very comfortable and had many options for pillow type. The bathroom was nice with the sink located outside of the bathtub shower combo and toilet area. I still do not understand why they do not put outlets in the lamps on the bedside tables. Our ninth floor balcony had great northern facing ocean views. It was nice to put the kids down and enjoy and evening drink on the balcony. Kids activities. The kids staff was outstanding.

We left Mariots Marco Island Resort looking forward to returning again perhaps with family friends to share the wonders of the place. We opted for adventure and spent our nights in one room with two king sized double beds. The beds were extremely comfortable and we all got some quality sleep. I always find time to appreciate the comfort of a bed as I truly value what a good nights sleep can do. If I feel renergised the next day it is a magical bed and I certainly felt renergised. The room itself was very spacious. It was one of their recently refurbished rooms so great stuff indeed. You have the balcony with a mini table and two chairs to catch the morning sun. We were not facing the ocean but if we peeked our heads out a tad we could see it. Anyhow the ocean is only a short walk away. As for inside the room itself there is a mini bar an extra fridge to keep your own goodies and drinks cool a desk for all the workers and writers and thinkers in the world and a large flatscren TV with a great selection of channels. The service throughout our stay was friendly and fantastic. Whether the valet out front bellboys cleaners front desk team concierge waiters and waitresses they were all very welcoming and friendly and provided a great and attentive service that was very much appreciated great service definitely makes a good holiday even better. Food. I will start with breakfast at the MAIA restaurant. You either have the option to eat a buffet for a fixed price or pick an item from the menu. We went with the buffet and there were no regrets. Fresh pancakes made in front of you omelettes made right then and there crispy bacon eggs bagels breads cheeses muffins French pastries cereals oatmeal fruits fresh coffee and juice brought to the table. The list goes on. For the first adult the buffet is buy one get one free. it is worth the 27 per person it is around that price range I believe. Also the waiters offer plastic bags in case you want to take anything along with you for extra fuel during the day. Onto lunch and dinner. We were not short on options to eat. The hotel has 9 different choices MAIA included and they all vary in taste. We did not eat in all but the ones we did choose to have a meal at our stomachs were quite pleased with such as Quins on the Beach tropical island food aka your good old hamburgers quesadillas fish and chips hot wings etc. consumed whilst listening to live music Pazis Italian food delicious pastas and tasty pizzas all freshly made and open for lunch and dinner so having a box of fresh pizza by the pool as you soak in the sun always sounds like a good idea Korals sushi and cocktail bar by the lobby and lastly Cafe San Marco coffee sandwiches and croissants. What I personally liked a lot was the Menchies frozen yoghurt shop by the pool. Chocolate vanilla pecan and all sorts of flavours to help you cool off. The facilities were great. there is a gym and an impressively large spa. We did not take advantage of the spa as we wanted to catch some rays outside but we walked through it and it looked amazing. As for the gym we used it a few times and were very happy with all the machines offered and the TVs that were on nearly all of them. Everything was very modern and up to date. There are two big and warm pools to get nice and lazy during the day and jacuzis too. Also another thing we came across that we really liked was a large machine provided by the resort to take either a group picture or a GIF or a solo picture or solo GIF if that is your thing which you can then send to yourself or share on other platforms. Pictures are certainly a lovely way to make memories and we had two funny ones to take back home with usNow onto the beach. Though we did not take a dip in the cool winter ocean we did relax by the beach. The crystal white sand is heavenly. They have employees helping you set up your sun bed and umbrella. We went on a walk on the beach several times and it was wonderful. Not too packed at all so it was really peaceful. Also they have a regular Polynesian fire entertainer who performs by the entrance of the resorts beach right after the sun goes down. It was great entertainment and generated a crowd of impressed vacationersThe only thing we were slightly concerned about was the noise from the construction that is currently taking place. I believe they are extending the resort. However not once did we hear a single peep even during the day. Surprising. Definitely. Did we complain. Nope. it is not even necessary to leave the resort for anything it is very much its own little world. We did however eventually go on a drive around Naples and it is indeed a quiet pleasant and ideal location to relax and unwind. it is safe to say none of us had any bad experiences at Mariots Marco Island Resort and we look forward to our return in the near future. I can imagine it is even better during the summer months. It has been a successful first visit and is highly recommended for families groups of friends or couples.

I travel a lot for work as well we personal and I always stay at Mariot. I have been gold elite for 2 or 3 years now. Why do I stay at Mariot. Quality and Customer Service. The JW Mariot at Marco Island was not quite up to my Mariot standards. Bad1. Our first morning I called the front desk to request a microwave. You see I have Crohns disease so when I travel I bring lots of things with me that I can eat this helps cut back on the stress of trying to figure out what my body can handle each day. The lady on the phone tells me that the hotel does not have microwaves but that room service might be able to help me. So she transfers me to room service. They ask if it is something that ordered from them and when I said no they told me they do not have microwaves. I hung up the phone with them and called the front desk again. I explained to the same lady that I just talked to that I have dietary restrictions and really need a microwave to warm up the food I brought. She tells me that people normally handle this before they get to the hotel and says something about a note from the doctor. Well here is the thing. from one day to the next I have no clue what is going to both my gut. Therefore I bring foods that I know will not bother me so that I can try and enjoy a few meals out while on vacation. I explained to her that it was not going to be very good if I could not eat food. She said sorry but she talked to a manager and they do not have microwaves on site. This is the first hotel that has ever told me this they usually at least have one in a lobby for guest use. I found it interesting that the suites at the hotel had microwaves but they do not have any onsite guess they do not replace them when they break. I got a call about 10 minutes later from Barbara who calls to tell me that she talked to another manager and they will have a microwave to my room shortly. BARBARA YOU ARE THE REAL MVP. 2. We were relaxing on the beach looking at the JW website trying to decide on something to eat. My husband decided on the mango daiquiri from Quins this menu was listed as Quins beverage menu. We walked up to the restaurant and he ordered his drink. only to find out that they do not have mango daiquiris and they have not in years. So he decides on the dragonbery mojito also on the menu on our phones. Guess what. They do not have that either. Oh the bartender let us know that the menu on the Mariot website is OLD. MICHELE worked her magic and made the tastiest blackberry margarita ever. Happy husband happy wife THANK YOU MICHELE. 3. We happened to be staying at the hotel at the same time as the Scentsy incentive trip. I am not even sure where to begin on this one. After talking with other non scentsy guests the verdict was clear. us folks that paid to be at the resort were clearly not the priority maybe even an after thought. I am attaching picture of the beach the day that Scentsy had one of their events. Those of us that paid big money to be at this resort were pushed off to the side of the beach and given about 50 75 feet for our chairs while Scentsy got the rest of the beach. There was even a cart bringing waters around to everyone but they asked if we were with Scentsy and would not give a water if we were not. 150 for a 10 oz bottle of water. Because there were so many folks with this incentive trip and most of them were given resort credits. On another day they rented jetskis and went on jetski tours right from the hotel. Many of them came back from the tour at once all parking the jetskis right in front of where the beach chairs were. I counted. THIRTY FIVE JETSKIS also attaching a picture. So the part of the ocean that was left for us to play in was where the parasailing boat came to pickup dropof customers. God1. The hotel itself inside and outside was very well kept. Our room was clean. While we did not have our room cleaned everyday the housekeeper on our floor 2 was a delight. Always friendly and willing to give us extra towels bags toiletries. I wish I had gotten her name. 2. We were invited to a Wine Down Wednesday at Ario. Very glad we went to this. Lexi did our wine tasting and was very very knowledgeable. While I am convinced it was a plot to get us all to eat at Ario I have to admit that it worked. There were 14 of us at the wine tasting and after hearing Lexi talk about the wine and food 10 of us were back within an hour to eat dinner. Lexi was a fabulous server and everything that she recommended was great. Our cowboy ribeye was delish. I probably would not order the lobster mac and cheese again. 3. Beach yoga was messy but a great addition. I really enjoyed the teacher. I wish i could remember her name. Monday evening beach yoga. I also took a spin class at the spa which was nice to have access to on vacation. We did not use the pools at all but they looked really nice. Lok into Sirene before booking. It did not pop up as an option for me for the days we stayed but it is 21 and older. They have their own pool and section of the beach. Wish we could have stayed there. Overall The place was very pretty and SOME of the staff went above and beyond for us. However it felt like the JW was more interested in making money than customer service. Giving a 4 star because of the property itself but I would definitely advise folks to call and see if there is a convention or a MLM incentive trip going on because if so I would definitely go somewhere else.", "offset": [4100, 4168], "date": "2019-06-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}]}
