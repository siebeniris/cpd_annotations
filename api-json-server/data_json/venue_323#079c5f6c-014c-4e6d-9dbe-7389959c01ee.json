This was my first stay at this hotel and it was chosen for it is location and reputation. This was not just a stay for me but I booked a block of rooms for a wedding party that included 30 rooms for two nights and some of the party arrived early in the week so more rooms were added. The original amount of rooms requested through the event planner was less so I had to add more to the block on more than once. The team of associates at this facility made it easy to make the increase even after our window of time on the agreement had passed. This was something that I found was consistent with how the team worked in every way to fulfill our needs in each and every way. This location the rooms lobby lounges and decor was over the top and very pleasing. I can not say enough about how much the team at this facility made this special event a great success. I will definitely return for business and pleasure in the future.

This hotel is within walking distance of the Midtown MARTA red line stop if you are the type of person who likes to avoid exorbitant taxi prices andor the inevitable gouging by rental car agencies and hotel parking garages. The main tourist stuff is not within walking distance from here so if you are looking to hit those centennial park sites on foot this may not be the place for you. It seems to be a more business friendly hotel. No pool. No frills. Just a nice modern room with all the amenities you will need for your convention stay. Staff was friendly and made a point to call me by my name. If you can find a price here for under 200 night you are getting a decent value.

The hotel bar does specials every week night in case you need to wind down after a long conference or something. And the rooms themselves are artful and clean.
