We stayed and the Atlanta W in midtown recently while in town for a concert. The location was great. Close to Piedmont Park and some great restaurants. The rooms were nicely updated and our room was on a higher floor with a nice city view. Staff was helpful when needed. The only two things that you should know is that parking in the deck beside the hotel is not included they do not have a contract with them. 20 a day is not bad but no in out access could be an issue for some. The only thing the room needed was a coffee maker but they do serve coffee downstairs till 10 am. The weather was not the best but the pool area was well taken care of and relaxing.

We recently stayed at this hotel for a conference. I was a bit nervous about staying at this hotel after reading the reviews but it was so convenient to stay in the hotel where the conference was being held. Heres my breakdown The rooms at the hotel can definitely use an update. Although our room was clean there was definitely a lot of wear and tear. BUT this was not so bad that I would not recommend staying there if you need to be in that area. Our room was on the 7th floor. A lot of other reviews listed the hotel as being too loud with music and too dark etc. I am in my 40s and it was fine to me. Yes it is a trendy hotel and there was music playing in the lobby on Friday night and in the elevators but I thought it was different and not overly loud. I also like that there was a lot of different places to sit in the lobby to hang out and just have a drink. We ate at Trace for dinner one night. My husband had the catch of the day and I had the burger. Both were very good. The drinks are priced on the high side but we are used to it being from NYC. We also ate at a restaurant called Mi Cocina on Peachtre Street. I would highly recommend this Mexican food restaurant. The food and drinks were amazingThe pool area was small but since it was October it was pretty empty 2 other ladies plus myself. It was a nice area to just sit get some sun and relax. A plus is that the hotel is connected to a small food shopping area Colony Square that you can go to in order to get some food for lunch and there is also a Starbucks there. Nice not to have to go outside to get to this area. The elevators did take some time to come but I think the longest we waited was 2 3 minutes. Not bad considering there were a couple of conferences taking place. The gym was small but had your basic machines weights. The machines were all in working order and it there was some nice Bliss Spa cloths to wipe your face body down after your workout. The hotel staff were VERY friendly and we never had any issues with them. I had to ask for some more soap and we were missing our Do Not Disturb sign both were brought up within 10 minutes of our request. I would also like to add that housekeeping on our floor were extremely nice and accommodating. So to sum our trip up I had say the hotel needs a face lift but I would still recommend staying at this hotel if you need to be in the area.", "offset": [1193, 1321], "date": "2015-10-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "043e548b-495f-4d86-a72e-57dfbabe78a1", "sentence": "I was just at the pool here and it was nice but drinks were expensive and the service was not too great.", "offset": [0, 104], "date": "2016-05-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "681d280d-ab7d-4a06-a6b3-24a9c119c556", "sentence": "Biggest complaint is the pool and amenities.

I was fortunate enough to stay at the W Atlanta Midtown for a quick weekend trip to visit friends family. I recently moved to NYC after living in Atlanta for 5 years I am so sad I did not know how nice this hotel was before. I definitely would have had a staycation here. Upon arrival I was greeted by the friendly staff given champagne to welcome me get my weekend started. Anywhere that gives me Champagne upon arrival is a great place IMO. Once I got up to my room I was so impressed with the decor size of the room plus the view overlooking Piedmont Park was amazing. You would think that being in such a central location the hotel would be loud but I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was. I met up with friends at the bar downstairs we had great servers both time I went Lorenzo Ronica were so attentive. I ordered the Aperol Spritz which I did not love honestly the lemon pepper wings which were great. I think the bar space would be an awesome place to host pre wedding festivities like a welcome mixerI also got to go to the pool deck for a pool party absolutely adored that space as well. The bartender was amazing made a great Strong Island Iced Tea.

First the gotchas. I booked through Expedia and there was no mention of the mandatory 40 night valet parking fee. That really jacked up my overall price. If you want to get anything from your car get it before they park it for you. Only the even floors have ice makers and the elevators are not super speedy so if you plan on using one requesting an even numbered floor would be a good move. Wifi is 11 which is a bit steep with so many other hotels offering it free. That being said the nice guy at check in said he can credit my room for it due to something about my credit card. I did not ask for that so it was a very nice move. it is a very nice modern hotel with very cool furnishings and decor in the rooms and common areas. The refrigerator is a touch small and is filled with honor bar stuff but that is easy to move if you want to put your stuff in there. there is a very nice pool on the 4th floor overlooking the street in front of the hotel. it is not a huge area so no tables but plenty of chairs and a portable bar during some timeframes. there is a cool bar on the roof that seems to be a hotspot on the weekend nights. it is small but has lots of open air seating. I went up for a bit but it was not really my scene so did not stay long. I can see how a lot of folks would like it though. If it were a touch less crowded I had likely had stayed longer. The location is great. there is a mall next door and plenty of walkable restaurants which is nice because traffic in the area is pretty nutty.
