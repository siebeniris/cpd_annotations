Hello everybodyPlease note that these comments are genuinely based on our personal experience at this hotel. I will try to stick to the facts. In march we stayed 2 nights at the Parrot Hotel based on a recommendation from a friend in Norway. My first visit to USA ever. All together we were 3 families10 people 3 romsnice rev. for the hotel so to speak. Just our room with only garden view cost around US 80 for 2 nightsThe hotel is categorized as a 4 star hotel. In my travel experience NO WAYThe room was ok but the bathroom. OMG. Mould loose silicon cracked tiles everywhere. Disgousting. A change of room was not possible due to full ocupency. No breakfast included at this price. Plastic cutlery at the restaurant tables missing furniture on the balcony and so on. The garden scenery though and the building itself is very nice and picturesc. Worth a visit but not for a stay. The 4 pools are cosy but small. No new towels in the aftrenon and not before 1001030 in the morning. The staff at the restaurant was friendly. The reception staff kind of repelend and stressed in my opinion. At check out we complained about the room and got a US 50 discount. An absolutely rediculous compensation considering the overall experience and cost for the stay but we let it go. That said we were not the only ones complaining that day. My conclusion. USA yes Florida yes Key West defenitely yes. But Parrot Hotel. No thank you I had my share. There are both cheaper and by far even more expensive alternatives at Key West you will find a place.

We left our luggage as they were going to take care of it and delivery it to the room. after several hours enjoying town we came back to find our luggage right where we left it. In the wide open. So we find our room. Room was suppose to have room for 5. It was described to have either a extra bed in room or pull out couch. You guessed it. neither. No extra bedding. So our son who is 67 slept on couch. Next day we showered and spent day by pool. Fire alarms went off but my husband was NEVER called in the room to tell him he needed to leave the room. There is NEVER a shuttle ready when you are. And the shuttle is NOT owned by hotel. There is a fee for it hidden in price though. They were rude and stand around but will not take people to town. Grounds crew was smart ass to us for our attire parothead week. We were wearing lais and looked tropical. Left for town at 50pm and our rooms were still not cleaned and restocked. Came back at like 1240 am to no fresh towels wash clothes shampoo or body wash and beds were not changed. We called and were told nothing could be done but would have fresh bath items delivered at 90am never seen anyone. So at check out my sister in law got a refund for cabs. does not do me any good. There was a special for Florida residents but they did not honor that either. Room prices were high staff had time to be on their phones for personal calls not friendly bathroom had long black hair in drains so probably not cleaned well.

For example our room was never serviced on one of the days that we were there despite having a phone conversation and in person conversation with the cleaning crew when we left around 130am. Around 6 pm we told them not to worry about coming anymore and to just bring us new towel sets. They never came. To avoid the situation again I called the hotel while we were out exploring on the following day and requested our room to be clean by the time we returned.

When we mentioned it to the check out staff all they said was Well next time make sure to get a waterfront room not a water view room. In the middle of the day somebody stopped by the room waking up my dad from a nap to ask how everything was going. Then a few minutes later housekeeping called to make sure everything was OK. We found that a bit intrusive and annoying. The walls between rooms are OK for being a soundproof. However if anybody went out back we heard them fairly loudly. Also the rooms were set up by numbers and letters. For hotel room number 18 there is an A room and a B room. The A room is upstairs the B room is downstairs. We had the B room and whenever the A room people came in we could hear them very loudly through the door and walls when they came in at 2 in the morning. The hairdryer in the room did not work and when we called the front desk to ask for a new one it took a long time for them to get us a new one. All in all we did not spend very much time in the room anyway so it was a nice room. However there were a lot of little issues that kept it from being a great stay.

Just WOW. What a wonderful 5night stay we had at the Parrot Key Hotel last week. We had a friendly welcome from the valet who immediately gave us cold water bottles and then Crystal who gave us sangria upon check in. We had paid for a 1BR suite and received an upgrade to a 2BR suite. It was a LOT of space for just the 2 of us but we loved it. Our living room overlooked a lush forest of tropical trees and plants in the courtyard. The bedrooms on the other side of our suite overlooked a green canal mangrove area and bay that adjoins the Gulf of Mexico. Both balconies had comfy Adirondack style chairs to relax in. You will see your neighbors on the balconies but it was low season so the resort was not full and it felt very private. The king bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The bathrooms were well equipped and spacious with plush robes provided. The master bath had both a shower and separate soaking tub. The toiletries are large pump bottles of what you need very eco friendly compared to all those little plastic bottles that some hotels just toss after one use. The kitchen had a mini fridge small sink a separate paid mini bar and a microwave. This allowed us to keep our own snacks and drinks in the room so we did not always have to pay for refreshments by the pool. Speaking of the pools amazing. There are 4 of them on the property 3 are rather small but just enough space and each one feels intimate. One is an adults only quiet area. On the far side from that is the more active one that has the bar grill so there is a comfortable option for everyone. Relaxing music is on at the pools from 100 100. Highlight. every seat has a buzzer with 3 buttons on it one to call the server to bring you food drink one to reorder another round of your last drink order and one to bring you your check. It was VERY easy to get spoiled by that feature. Food and drinks were very good but resort pricesAsk for a room on the canal or bay side of the property as it will be quieter and a better view than the other sides. Note. I am not sure that the rooms are handicap accessible as they all seemed to have stairs to their doors but there were handicap access chairs for the pools. Check with resort. Also our suite was located up a flight of stairs no elevatorOnce you are on the property you have NO idea that you are off a main road and literally across the street from a large shopping center with grocery store liquor store restaurants etc. there is also a 24hour Walgrens in the adjacent parking lot. So you can walk to many amenities. BUT you are not really walking distance from downtown Key West. No problem take a bike rent on site Uber drive yourself or take the limited hours hotel shuttle. Note that they ONLY have valet parking at the resort. Our package included it not sure if all rates do. You will enjoy the MANY hammocks and lounge chairs on their manmade beach as well as a lovely couples swing where you can watch the sunset. there is also a sunset pier to enjoy the water view as well. We did not use the small workout space and there is a place to rent SUPs jetskis etc. right on site. The concierge was very helpful in setting us up with a fantastic kayak trip ofsite with Key West EcoTours. We just can not say enough about this resort.
