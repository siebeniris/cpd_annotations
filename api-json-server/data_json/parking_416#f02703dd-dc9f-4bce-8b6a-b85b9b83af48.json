The Domain Hotel is a great and reliable hotel with pleasant staff hapy to help. Anything broken in the rooms gets fixed fast and with a smile.

Parklng is plentiful the rooms are quiet and provide a good nights sleep. The bathrooms are well equipped and everything works as it should.

This is a chic modern boutique type hotel and was perfectly suitable for my 2night stay while on business in the South Bay. It was not until I was checking out that I was asked if I had a car I did. and I was then told they waived parking. This was a nice gesture even if accidental since no one asked about a car when I checked in. Charging for parking is pretty lame there is nothing there that puts a demand on the parking situation. But it is also the Silicon Valley and they can get away with it I suppose. I can not lower the rating on this point since I did not pay for parking but it is still surprising they charge for this. On the upside I had a little balcony and could sit outside it is centrally located it is clean I had a pretty good dinner meal in the small bar there are snacks for purchase off the lobby the lobby is very comfy the wireless is free and they have sleep number beds.
