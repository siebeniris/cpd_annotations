In fact the info in our room listed previous guests as Michael Jackson Ronald Reagan etc. it is tastefully decorated and has an upscale restaurant inside.

If you try to take out a piece of anything from the fridge to place your medicine you will get an elaborate note that says if you do not put back the beverage in the fridgewe will charge you 750 day. When I called I was told that they can store medicine somewhere else. I travel frequently and stays in different hotel categories but I have never seen a fridge this full and never have to deal with things to complicate the simple and basic expectations. How can the CHEAPER hotels in the area afford to PROVIDE free iced water in the lobby and provide an empty fridge in the room for guests to put their perishable essentials but this hotel can not. My colleagues and I promised never to stay in this hotel again. If we stop patronizing this Hilton they will more likely change their ways.

Several people were very upset they could not get espresso or cappuccino. We should have been told we could get from the other food area as one guest suggested this but were told No we would have to pay to get our coffee from that area. The girl in charge that weekend did not seem to have a handle on what to do. There were dirty tables both Saturday and Sunday.

We sat on sofa and ate with our plate in hand since there were no tables and that whole time we were there no one ever cleaned or wiped down the several tables along the wall.
