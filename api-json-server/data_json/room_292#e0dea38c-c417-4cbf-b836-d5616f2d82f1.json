Recently stayed here with my daughter and my parents for 2 nights. The hotel is situated on a business Park so is not much around to do apart from a pub down the road about a 5 min walk. You really need a car or transport of some description if you want to venture out and about. Arriving at check in I could tell there was going to be an issue with my booking. I had arranged 1 night stay with a red letter voucher then booked an extra night myself via their website. I had notified the hotel that I had two nights booked and could I stay in the same room rather than changing. It took a bit longer than normal to get checked in but the girl behind the counter found it hard to understand my accent being from Cumbria it can cause problems further south we go. Nevertheless she managed to get my booking sorted eventually and got the room next door to my parents which was good and handy. The rooms were very nice stopped in a King size room. Everything was there that you needed. My only comment was that some of the tv and radio channels did not work but I was not that bothered as we were hardly in to watch listen one of them things I guess which would have been sorted if we mentioned to reception but I was not fussed. Also after the first night we left our rooms around 10 am and headed out for the day. When we returned we found that my parents room had been made up but ours had not. Meaning we had no fresh towels etc. When I mentioned to the housekeeping lady she said my room was checkout when I mentioned it was not they apologised and offered to come make it once she had finished her room she was in. I said that it was fine but could I have some towels etc. She was very apologetic and got what I needed. I confirmed with another member of housekeeping who could have been a manager that it did not need made up I got what was needed. Maybe worth checking with reception if you book using a voucher and then an extra night as the computer systems are obviously not that intelligent to work out someone is in there for 2 nights. We used the hotel pool facilities which upon arrival on the Saturday afternoon we were told we had to go back upstairs to our rooms for a towel as they did not have any for us. Once we got them we were in the pool for over 3 hours having fun most of the time to ourselves. Lovely and clean facilities throughout. The first morning I had breakfast included in my voucher deal was lovely no complaints at all. The 2nd morning my daughter wanted breakfast in the hotel again we proceeded to the breakfast area and gave our room number and we are seated. We did not have it included in price the 2nd time so knew we had to pay. My daughter is 9yr old so did not think we would be charged full price for breakfast due to her being a child and did not eat or drink much. When I come to pay I was charged for 2 breakfasts at around \u00a3 16 each I asked the staff at the time if I had to pay full price for my daughter and they said yes. So I agreed to pay it as we had to leave fairly quickly as we had a 5 hour journey to do. I would advise that you check if child breakfasts are cheaper or same price as an adults before eating breakfast in the restaurant in the mornings. as I can not imagine a 9yr old has to pay the same price as an adultOveral it was a lovely hotel with pleasant members of staff and very clean. Would definately return but I will be checking about childs breakfast prices and ensuring my room was serviced by housekeeping next time.", "offset": [1035, 1278], "date": "2015-08-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "5c28e41d-0a7f-4252-990a-7067df12612e", "sentence": "Know what to expect.
