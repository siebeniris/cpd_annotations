Asked housekeeper in hallway if she would please clean our room. We returned to our room at 10 pm after an evening out. Our room had not been cleaned. I called the front desk and Sandra Johnson Director of Sales Marketing told me everyone had left for the day and there was no one there to clean our room etc. I emphasized the late 10 pm hour and asked when someone could bring clean towels and clean our room. She did not know. I hung up the phone. I gathered our dirty towels and took them to the front desk. Granted I was not exactly pleasant at this point. A housekeeping night manager brought clean linens and towels out and we made our way back to our room. She offered to vacuum but we told her not to since the bathroom and bed were taken care of. Ms Johnsons response to my phone call was not appropriate especially since I had already asked someone to help me earlier in the day. The breakfast is not worth the 12 they charge. It is an expensive continental breakfast. The bathrooms are in need of an update and the carpeting throughout is old and worn. The wine offerings in the bar are of cheap wines and the atmosphere. Well let us just say I would not waste my time or money there. The lines at check in are very long approximately 10 to 12 people long so the wait time is trying. The so called business room is a joke. One of the computers had no keyboard. Really. Our bathroom was tight with only one sink and the cabinetry was in bad shape.

We again asked for someone to check on it they worked on it while we were out so we returned to our room at a chilly 65 degrees. Even after turning the system off the unit continued to run at 65 degrees until we again called for maintenance in the morning who had to disconnect the system. The office style chair at the desk was broken on one side so it sat crookedly.

The staff was wonderful and I hope they can get this hotel going because it is worth your money. Couple things1.

We stayed for one night. We checked into a room with two double beds. The room does not have a light on the ceiling so the lamps on the bed built into the headboard and the floor lamp are all ya got for lighting. Well the light in the middle of one bed and the two reading lights on it did not work. We even went under the bed to make sure it was plugged in. It was still did not work. So we went back to the front desk and requested a new room. All of these rooms are redone with modern sleek decor. They LOOK great. but the function stinks. Again another room with no ceiling light. so even with ALL the lamps on in the room it is still dim. That evening went to take a shower. no hot water. it is 10 pm so not like it is prime time for showering. Let the shower run for 15 minutes to see if the hot water would kick in. It never did. so I had to take a COLD shower. That is crap. Went to brush my teeth. the sink got hot water. but it did not drain. I made sure it the drain was open. but every time we turned on the water. the sink filled with water. Gross. Whatever it was one night. so I guess I will deal with it. Went to bed. You know. you have a schedule in your mind for the next day so you set your alarm accordingly. 813 am. the freaking maid knocks on the door. Are you kidding me. There had to be other rooms where guests had already checked out that she could have worked on. Instead she is going to come knocking at my door and wake me up. Just a very UNREASONABLE timeframe to be knocking at a guest door. I will not stay here again. Also they have a sign in the room that they want you to be happy and will take care of any issues. I made a point of stopping by the front desk when we left to tell them about the issues. they listened and apologized. But that is all they did.
