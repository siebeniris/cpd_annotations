I agree with other reviews that the rooms are definitely old and need an update but otherwise the hotel is top notch. The grounds are very nice the pools are a lot of fun. The overall amenities are high quality. The design and d\u00e9cor of the hallways and the rooms to an extent are probably the way they are because folks are coming and going all wet and sandy the hotel is right on the beach but yes some things could definitely use an upgrade like the bathroom. The AC unit was pretty noisy too.

After checking out of Destin West next door my family checked into Ramada to extend our stay at Fort Walton Beach by 3 days. During our stay we stayed in two different rooms a pool side room and an ocean front room. Both rooms were very clean and comfortable but nothing fancy. The property is in an excellent location within walking distance to the Boardwalk and Okalosa Pier. I do agree with many of the reviews I read that the rooms are in need of some updating as well as the hallways carpeting etc. The beach is excellent less crowded than the Destin beaches. My 5 and 3 year old loved the polside room because we could swim right up to our back door patio area. The downside to this is having other guests sitting on your patio without permission or lots of kids jumping off of it constantly. All of the staff members we came across were very friendly and the Maintenance and Housekeeping staff were hard workers. I do have to comment on the pool activity staff attendants. I am not sure if their title is lifeguard but it did bother me that the employees who sat by the pool in the chair with the umbrella were constantly on their cell phones. Yes it is the job of parents to look after the children in the pool but it looks very unprofessional to see these workers who are supposed to be on the job constantly playing on their phones. Just a tiny complaint but one I do feel should be addressed. I do feel the hotel is priced fairly high but it does have excellent amenities.
