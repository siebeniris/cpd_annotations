A large party of us booked afternoon tea in a private room at the Radison to celebrate a colleague \u2019s 60th birthday and we were really looking forward to it. However this experience certainly did not live up to expectations and the customer service on the day and since has been appalling. 1. We had paid extra money to have our afternoon tea in a private room due to there being a large number of us and as a way of making it more special. At no point on the day were we welcomed to the room by a member of staff informed of the procedure for afternoon tea. ie that the platters would be shared one between two which would have solved the issues below given any indication of the choices of tea or coffee available to us or informed of the menu items. 2. As we were not aware until the food came out that we would be sharing the cake stands and due to the fact that we had a mixture of gentlemen \u2019s and traditional afternoon teas there were certain members of our party who were not sat next to someone who they could share with myself included as I was sat next to someone who had ordered Gentleman \u2019s tea but I was also sat at the end of the table. To add to the staff \u2019s confusion I had also ordered vegetarian sandwiches but with a traditional afternoon tea. Everyone started tucking in apart from myself who had absolutely no food in front of me3. After politely enquiring about this it was a good 10 minutes after everyone got their food and was tucking in that I had a plate of sandwiches put in front of me but nothing else. When I asked where my cakes were I was very rudely told that the afternoon teas were meant to be shared. I pointed out that this was impractical expecting me to share my food with someone sitting at the other end of a very long table. Again a hand was put up to me and I was informed very rudely \u201c we are sorting it\u201d4. The next thing we knew was that a staff member went up to the other end of the table and snatched the food away from one of our party with no explanation as to why and took it out of the room for it to be divided up. Again when challenged about this later the staff member responded extremely rudely. It was a full 15 minutes after everyone else that I finally received my food. 5. Apart from the rudeness of the staff the other issue I personally have is that I was not given fresh food but was given food that had been in front of someone else. Surely there are hygiene issues here. How do I know that the food had n\u2019t been handled before it was snatched away and divided up and served to me. I had previously enjoyed an afternoon tea here a couple of years ago for my birthday but I certainly wo n\u2019t be rushing back after the treatment we received. 6. Once the food had eventually been sorted out we were very much left to our own devices no top ups of tea or coffee offered and we certainly did n\u2019t feel looked after in any way shape or form7. We did not make a big fuss on the day as we did n\u2019t want to spoil the special birthday party for our colleague but after raising the issues with various staff members at the Radison since the event we have met with a wall of indifference and in fact they are blaming the issues on ourselves and apparently not accepting that they are in any way to blame for our anger and disappointment. 8. I would also like to point out that on several occasions now and also in the management \u2019s response to my original post they have stated to us that they have been contacted by the organiser of our party to say how pleased she was and that she has even sent a \u201c very complimentary letter \u201d to them. This is totally untrue She has not and will not be sending a \u201c very complimentary letter \u201d to the hotel. The Manager also responded to my initial review with a comment that they had \u201c nothing further to add to our previous comments made to you personally \u201d and that they \u201c would not want any readers of this review to be misled \u201d. I can confirm that I have not had any previous comments made to me personally. You can draw your own conclusions here about who is trying to mislead who from this edited review due to the fact that I could n\u2019t respond to the Manager \u2019s comments on my original review.", "offset": [0, 65], "date": "2015-03-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "6fc3e463-ec56-4018-8167-cb8bf1d17b21", "sentence": "Made to feel very welcome.

From the start of of the booking to the finish this hotel gave me endless trouble. Now let me start from the beginning to describe how utterly disgusting the customer service is in this hotel and its staff. Hotel was booked for 2 nights for a special occasion first of all and stated in my email prior to turning up. On arrival we were told room was n\u2019t ready come back in an hour \u2013 this was fine as we were earlyHour later after lunch came back to the hotel greeted once again. I was asked to leave a card credit card I asked can I pay now just so I did n\u2019t have to mess about at the end He said no this will be taken from your card at the end of the stay. At no point did this staff member explain that the Radison also deduct 75 pounds per night for extras. This then gets put into a holding account until you leave. We then asked this staff member \u2013 is the room a nice romHe said \u2013. yes sir its beautifulSo he gave us the room key card we got into the room and we noticed a strange humming sound which was loud so I rang reception and told them they sent up a maintenance man. He came up 10 mins later and agreed it was odd he then got our room changed. So we moved rooms \u2013 please bear in mind this was a special ocasionWe moved rooms to a floor where work men were working literally just out side \u2013 for both days. this was very kind of Radison \u2013 thankyou for the special noise \uf04aWe put our things down and headed back into town. I passed my bank just to check everything was in order. To which I noticed \u00a3 408 was missing in the back of my head I did think it might have been the hotel but it seemed higher than the actual bill itself. So I rang THE FRAUD team of the bank. They said the Radison had taken it. So I headed straight back to the hotel and demanded to see the manager. The Manager I spoke too was a duty manager shy little man. I explained my situation he wrote it all down \u2013. did n\u2019t seem to care once about my complaint regarding the missing money. He went to find out what was going on. He came back with another Manager \u2013 rude arrogant man who then began talking down to me. I said I had spoke to fraud squad and that the hotel had taken my money. He was also extremely rude to my partner. please bear in mind it was a special occasion. It was only from this that I learnt the hotel takes an extra \u00a3 75 per night for extras also I paid on debit card so makes it more difficult as it takes \u2018 2 3 working days \u2019 for the money to go back on after leaving. Not that I did n\u2019t have any money in my bank I just literally did n\u2019t have a single clue to their policies AS NONE OF IT WAS EXPLAINED WHEN I CHECK IN SO THIS ANNOYED ME VERY MUCH. They like to talk down to you at Radison and they do not once live up to there beliefs and mottos. Which is teribleCustomer service should be viewed by a company as important as it \u2019s the basis of making a business successful. The \u2018 man \u2019 looking after all this clearly needs a lot of training in this matter not just having a Title. This goes for any of the managers you all got there for a reason do not let standards slip. Otherwise you will have complaints such as this one. I have never experienced such terrible service from a so called 5star in my life. So to go on we were told to go and enjoy our special occasion and he would make it better. LOLWe got back in the evening to find a bottle of proseco I immediately gave this back. I then took too social media to complain and also speak to the customers services in London. I got a call later by a real customer services manager who listened to my complaints and took everything I said onboard and he was very helpful. Next day we left I settled the bill. Now I assumed the money that was owed back to me from the \u2018 HOLDING ACCOUNT \u2019 would go back on to my card by Tuesday \u2013 it had n\u2019t I checked on Wednesday \u2013. it had n\u2019t During this time I was ringing and emailing manager at the hellish hotel who had caused me endless stress at a time we should have been celebrating. The duty manager who I dealt with \u2013 Alex was excellent very nice man and great customer service skills. By Thursday \u2013 the 4th working day money still was n\u2019t in the manager was doing what he could to get the money back in my account as it was a large sum. I spoke to my bank manager who told me what they needed from the hotel to release the funds. This was given to me on the Thursday afternoon and I was on my way. So as you can see a more in depth review of what I had to put up with by a \u2018 5 Star hotel \u2019. Too top it off is the disgusting comments and replies from Radison senior management. Thankyou for your warm \u2018 hospitality \u2019 Radison.", "offset": [710, 812], "date": "2016-02-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "57015d35-d7bb-4714-a461-804bff7db558", "sentence": "Food at Steak and Lobster was nice but for the price I expected better.

We booked this hotel for our pre Christmas weekend away having decided to spoil ourselves to the 5 star treatment. We really looked forward to our stay but were disappointed from the start. The room and facilities were very average. Not even a biscuit to have with my coffee whilst getting ready to go out and a rubbish shower. The room was too hot despite turning the air con down and the ice machine on the corridor was broken all weekend. Our friends room was not cleaned on Saturday and they had to call reception to have it done. We met in the Steak and Lobster bar and ordered 4 gin and tonics Gordons gin nothing exotic only to be told they only had enough for 1 gin at 630pm on Friday. We did not stay long. Saturday night we again met in the bar got our drinks and went to sit down only to be asked to leave as the table was needed for diners. There were no seats in the Opus bar. We did not stay long. Breakfast was disappointing for a 5 star hotel and no hash browns on the Saturday morning was poor. They also have the smallest jacuzi I have ever been in. There is nowhere to sit and relax after a night out as the Opus bar has very few seats for a hotel with over 200 rooms and the other is set up for breakfast. We have stayed in much better 4 star hotels throughout the UK this is definetly not the 5 star hotel we were hoping for.", "offset": [464, 556], "date": "2016-12-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "3042b434-1cf9-4bdb-88d0-e949bddc9e79", "sentence": "5 star yeah right.

Also I had left my laptop in the bedroom and the staff never contacted me \u2013 when I asked why I was told no one made a note of the hotel room it was taken from so they had no idea who it belonged to.

Let me start with the Positive very good location and excellent breakfast. Otherwise and according to all Standards this is not a 5 Star Hotel. I went there for 2 nights from Jan 3 2019 Jan 5. One reason why I have booked the Hotel was the Indoor Pool the Gym and the Spa. Upon arrival I have asked the Concierge about the way to the Spa and Pool. We were told the Spa AND the POOL AND the Gym are closed since 4 weeks and it might take another 2 weeks. This is totally unacceptable a significant share of the Hotel price are the facilities. Not telling the guest we found only a piece of paper in the room informing us about this is almost fraud at least to my understanding This alone justifies the very poor rating but there is more. On the day after our arrival we have left the room at 830 in the morning returning at 315 pm the room was still not cleaned. I had to call and the lady on the phone was not kind. Furthermore there was a plate hanging in the room because of environmental reason we should think about not getting the room serviced every day. Unreal in a 5 Star Hotel because the price would have stayed the same. Upon arrival nobody asked if we need help with the luggage and the service level as such was very poor. Our room was fairly small it needed some maintenance and the Air Condition was so loud we had to switch it off during the night. All in all a bad experience and we do not recommend this Hotel.

Amazingly attentive exceptionally engaged and determined to deliver excellent service in a friendly manner the reception staff and the concierge team are world class. Jony leads the young reception team with seemingly effortless aplomb and is always happy to help with any unusual requests whilst Vicky and her colleagues make light work of check in check out billing and administration. Gary and the concierge guys keep things moving around the clock and with Barnaby from Guest Relations multi tasking more than some people do in a lifetime you are never far away from someone who will go the extra mile. I can not recommend them enough. The hotel has recently undergone a multi million pound refurbishment in all areas including the spa which is a haven of calm presided over by the lovely Victoria. The new rainfall showers deserve special mention. And the pool is pretty awesome too even if it sometimes resembles an episode of Love Island on a Saturday afternoon.
