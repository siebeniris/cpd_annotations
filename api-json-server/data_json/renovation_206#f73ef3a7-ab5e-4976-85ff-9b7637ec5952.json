I did not get an upgrade which is the risk you take. The only issue I have is that the view 2 windows to a central roof exhaust area was simply disgusting. I wish I had known just how bad the view was so I could have reserved for at least a city view but it was too late none available. Word of warning these rooms are not worth the rate. Pros. Great location easy access to Central Park and subway. Bed was comfortable room was clean great housekeeping service although there is not a nespreso machine in the room and the club only has coffee for the breakfast service otherwise you have to ask for a coffee. Good size room 425 sqft and bathroom was large with separate tub shower and great amenities water pressure was ok. Offer afternoon tea in the club and it was lovely great English scones with clotted cream. The fitness center was clean and had what I needed for my workout. The staff was friendly. No problems with wifi but I am not a huge user during vacation. Cons Club The food presentations in the club were the same for all three days that we were there. They only have wine water soda and tea out for self pour otherwise you have to ask one of the attendants for any other drink including a cordial or coffee after dinner. Worst Ritz Club candy cart ever. We had to haul our luggage through the two entry doors which are heavy glass no bellman in site. No pool and one steam room in the spa. The relaxation room is immediately outside of the treatment rooms so it could be a little awkward going in out or possibly noisy if a couple chatty ladies are waiting. Our dinner at Auden Bistro was meh the sushi flatbread was good but the monkfish was a bit tough and really tasteless. I do not know this for sure but I am guessing that they are preparing for a renovation in the very near future. You get the feeling that they are just trying to get by with what they have and will not go out of their way to improve what is currently available. They may be a little under staffed. If you desire to have a luxury stay near Central Park I would have to recommend Mandarin Oriental at this time even though I am a RC fan.

I had first like to say that every employee we interacted with was friendly helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay special for our young daughter. This included things like a welcome gift blanket kids experiences Ritz Kids like feeding the horses at Central Park where she received a printed photo and stuffed horse etc. The property was in great condition and met every expectation I have of a Ritz Carlton property and luxury accommodations. One touch that we especially appreciated as parents is that every light in the room is dimable which meant that my wife and I could have some light available while our daughter was sleeping. Some of the service was unfortunately hit or miss. For example the person who walked us up to our room offered to have our refrigerator emptied. It did not happen and we saw him twice more throughout the week and he would ask if it happened and each time he would say that it would be taken care of. It never was over the course of our six night stay and we eventually gave up asking. The housekeeping service seemed to miss different things each time they came. I am not sure if they were trying to rush to not disturb my wife and daughter in the room but there were a few times where we did not have any shampoo or body wash and had to ask for it later. Fortunately there was always evening turn down service and we could get any issues resolved then without much trouble. One night we got a phone call at 9 pm that woke our daughter up to tell us that maintenance was outside of our room to install a missing second toilet paper bar in the bathroom. We did not request it I guess the turndown person did or even know it was coming and we would have preferred to have it addressed the next day when our daughter was awake. The highlight of the club lounge for us was the food. Everything presented was amazing the quality of ingredients detail and presentation were excellent. The personal service was also impressive. Since there were a small number of guests and staff they got to know some of my habits like what drink I liked in a to go cup each morning and would just have it ready as I left. The convenience for my wife and daughter who were near the hotel all day was great as well. One thing that was apparently miscomunicated to us when we made the reservation is that the breakfast is primarily cold. Especially for my daughter but for my wife and me also we like things like eggs hot meats potatoes pancakes etc. at least occasionally. This is just a personal preference but the person making the reservation set our expectations that we would get at least some of these and we were looking forward to them. Because of the miscomunication they did try to accommodate us but it is clearly not what the club serves and so the club probably just is not right for us which makes us sad because everything they did have was amazing and much better than comparable items at say the JW executive lounge down the street which is included with our elite membership since the club offers much more it is not included. The only other concern I had was that many things other clubs include were not included here such as a club floor on a high level there is no club floor here upgraded bath amenities private check in out in the club and hot breakfast. None of these were promised anywhere for this hotel but they are available at some other clubs and would have been welcome touches. At the end of the day we have a trip back in a month and we need to decide where we are staying. Overall we really liked the property for all of the reasons above but we are not sure that we can justify the cost of the club lounge when we will also end up paying for some breakfasts from the hotel restaurant or elsewhere. The alternative is something like the JW where the food included in the lounge is more our style but not at all as good.", "offset": [1470, 1647], "date": "2015-07-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "5fbc9377-12c4-44f2-a48f-b22e835ab80b", "sentence": "Most Disappointing Stay at Ritz On The Park NY EVER. Having stayed at this hotel many times I looked forward to a night in NY and booked a room. We were welcomed as warmly as always by Joe the Door Gentleman who began there years ago and whom I have come to know and respect greatly. The other greeters and Front Desk Staff were also friendly and helpful. I upgraded by choice for a suite with a Park view and wanted to have a special stay for a special business occasion with a person from Australia. I had suggested The Ritz. I asked if we could please have a telescope and they said that yes they had get one out of another unused room for us. Bags were brought up promptly and we were happy and felt at home as always whenever we stay here. We had a drink in the longs and the server was distracted and hurrying. We wanted to feel relief from the pace so it was what it was and we left tipped 20 anyway. Anyone can have a hard day. The room 1514 was dingy lifeless. The decor was tepid and unwelcoming. No spark nothing special. We were very disappointed. It was certainly NOT worth an upgrade. Housekeeping was terrific and collected laundry and had it back to us promptly the next morning cheerfully and we tipped with appreciation. Breakfast. VERY disappointing. We expect more from Ritz than this. Mustard in the Eggs Benedict was too strong arrived cold not on the side as ordered. Waffle was not hot. Fresh fruits were lovely. Even the coffee was NOT HOT. I had called for a NYTimes which did NOT arrive. The bed linens were fresh but turndown service never arrived. WHAT HAS HAPPENED. The telescope you guessed it it never arrived either and it is the reason we upgraded so that we could watch planets in the night sky along with the moon. I am a Ritz Club Member. This stay gives me every reason to consider The Four Seasons or The St Regis next trip. I have stayed here so many times that I can not count them. Upon departure employees were observably stressed too much so. They were working hard too. The Bellman was doing his best but the man in charge at the front door not Joe was barking orders at workers. This was rude and embarrassing for all. We left amid a chaotic front entrance and management was observably poor. What a waste of a suite here. The Ritz needs some major changes this was made clear to us. Note to management Happy employees happy guests. Get back on your game. I have NEVER written a review for Ritz that has ever been anything but complimentary. Bad stay bad food bad feeling when we left. Problems with Internet connection required the maintenance tech to come to the room and then it only worked until morning.

This is a great area to be in for shopping Rockefeller theater and fine dining not to mention Central Park. We are new to the Ritz loyalty program and I think the verdict is still out on that after years of being very loyal SPG people. We arrived around 315pm and our room was not ready. We were escorted to the lounge for a complimentary drink while we waited. I was hoping for a room upgrade which I always get with SPG but unfortunately not. We did however get a high floor and the room was awesome and roomy for NYC. Lots of nice amenities very comfortable bed and a fridge in the room. The room was also super quiet and we got 3 glorious nights sleep so the view was not really that important. The first night home after dinner we had a bottle of champagne chilling with a spectacular fruit plate and balloons for our Anniversary it was a very nice touch. I do agree with the place is needing cosmetic upgrades but our room was very clean and I know they have renovations in the works. We did have high tea which I highly recommend doing. The food was wonderful as was the service. Reservations are an absolute must. One evening we did come back to have sandwiches in the lounge. The food was not great and the service was not as you would expect at a Ritz property. The last morning we had breakfast in the restaurant which was delicious and the service spectacular.

We planned this trip to NYC for the parade early in August it was to be a trip of a lifetime. I had requested a room with two beds as there are three of us along the parade route. When we arrived we were told that the rooms along the parade route would be an additional 1000 per night. We were also told there were no double bed rooms available so we agreed to be in a room with one bed and a rolaway. We waited for three hours for our room to be cleaned and finally checked into our room with one bed on the park side. There was a strong odor when checked in our room due to a spray that housekeeping uses. The smell was so strong it was making us cough so we tried to open the window which required a call to maintenance. Unfortunately after maintenance left we were unable to close and they had to come back to close it. We had to do this every time we wanted to open and close the window. We were told we would receive a rolaway bed however after waiting several hours we were told there were none left. This meant all three of us my husband 10 year old son and myself had to sleep in one bed. In my opinion one of the best things Ritz has to offer is their bed. Unfortunately this was not the case. The bed was the most uncomfortable Ritz bed I had ever slept in due to a very large ridge in the middle of the bed. We were told there we would receive a rolaway bed however after waiting several hours were told there were none available. There were also several other maintenance issues. The sink in the bathroom would not drain and the light in the bathroom blew out which required another call to maintenance. The second night we were given a rolaway bed which made an already very small room much more cramped. My husband slept in the rolaway and I slept in the bed with my 10 year old as the bed was that uncomfortable. The third morning we were awoken by a phone call from the assistant manager Lindsay telling us she needed us to move to an inside room as she had someone that was requesting a park view room. I told her that there was no way we were moving after I finally got a rolaway bed and had everything in the room repaired. I could not believe how rude she was. I was not losing any more precious time in the city to pack and move just to convenience her. I could not even believe someone would have the nerve to ask. I asked to speak to her manager and he immediately said that we would not need to move. The assistant manager is definitely in the wrong profession. We had limited time to spend in the city as we were only there over the Thanksgiving Holiday. When I think of all the time lost due to all the inconveniences it makes me sad. I wish we could get that time back as there was so much we did not get to do.
