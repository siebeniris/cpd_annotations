Apparently they dun goofed pretty damn bad because 4 other parties in the lobby at that very moment are in the same predicament. From the looks of things there were even more that night. The night manager is very quick to claim it is not my fault and offers me a free stay at another hotel one that is 30 minutes away at 1 in the morning. I specifically chose this hotel for its proximity to my job site the next morning. I feel bad for the couple behind me who sound like they got booted to a motel and they did not even have a car. This shal not stand but it is late and I have to be at work in the morning so I have no time to fight it then. I reach the alternate hotel which is a far cry from equal or greater in quality to the original room. The replacement hotel had dirty sheets and pillows which caused itching and rashes the moment I laid down. The pillows were unusable. I had rather not know if the itching was caused by too many dust mites or the use of too much harsh cleaning products. I get maybe 3 hours of sleep only nodding off when my tiredness outweighs my itchiness. let us be clear I place the blame squarely and completely on Wyndham for sending me there. I return to Wyndham the next day to finally check into the room I should have had last night. I make my displeasure known to the front desk clerk who is once again quick to point out. I was not here last night I do not know anything about that and it is not my fault. it is true it really is not her fault and the front desk does not have anything to do with the hotels abysmal management but it is a little telling she immediately goes to that without me accusing her of anything. She calls her supervisor who is unable to provide a satisfactory explanation of why they did not have a room for me and offers to call her GM just wait in the lobby. I am done with work for the day so I felt I had time to burn making this right. I wait in the lobby for at least 15 minutes. One guy comes and sits down next to me also waiting to talk to the GM. Of course. Who knows how many people were screwed by this shady hotel in one night. And if that is just one night how about as a matter of courseEventualy the supervisor returns and tells me the GM will call me in my room. Smells fishy but I have things to do and surely they would not lie. Of course not. I take a shower go and grab something to eat and return. The rest of the night passes without a peep from the GM. Maybe he called when I was in the shower. Unlikely since I could hear the TV on low from the shower. Maybe he called during the 20 minutes I was out. Probability aside is this guy to incompetent to leave a message. Also it is 2015. We have things called cellular telephones now. I imagine both possibilities are equally likely this idiot does not know how to phone or it is a straight up classic dodge. I finish my job early and catch an early fight back. In order to make my plane I have no time left in the morning to agitate the issue further. It sounds like a great scam to take advantage of busy people business travelers or just vacationers with better things to do than fight back after being fucked in the ass. Of course I never met this GM. In my mind I am picturing the douchey guy played by Tim Curry in Home Alone 2 but that is an insult to Tim Curry. This place is terrible never stay here. The facilities themselves are fairly decent but the management are a bunch of clowns. One time when I was playing Monopoly I managed to legitimately build a hotel. Shit is hard yo games usually end via board flipping before anyone gets to place a legit hotel. I believe anyone who has ever managed to build a hotel in Monopoly is automatically better at hospitality management than these assholes.", "offset": [2233, 2371], "date": "2015-07-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "3a6c5b55-cf88-4ae0-ba68-a29e521aeb45", "sentence": "Very disappointed with room amenities. only got 2 towels daily even though we had 3 guests in the room.

NOISY. I booked and prepaid for the room using the Hotelscom ap and somehow there was a screw up and I got charged again by the clerk at the desk. I called down and they apologized for the error and the room fee was taken off within hours. However there was a 50 deposit fee they charged me that still has not been taken off my card and it is now 4 days later and I am very unhappy. I can not remember the last time I have been charged a deposit for a room and I book a lot of rooms and it definitely does not take this long to come off the card. Like I said I book a lot of rooms and there definitely seems to be something going on. I am convinced that when you book with Hotelscom the hotels give you the worst rooms deliberately. My room looked great despite having a tube tv in the bedroom huge and spacious. However whoever designed the hotel did it in a manner where the rooms surround the pool so until about 10 pm all you hear is noise from the people in the pool if you are in the living room area. Fine you say just go to the bedroom and close the door but oh no on the side where I was there was nothing but the constant roar of traffic felt like I was sleeping on the highway.
