Staff is very friendly helpful and accommodating. The beds were super comfortable as well. The reason I did not give a five star review. some of our bathlinens were stained and torn we had some issues at check in company paid for 3 nights we paid for an extra night and was somewhat of an embarrassment the way it was handled.

The room in general had not been cleaned well there was a pizza that had been left in the hutch by the room door along with paper plates and used paper napkins. There was also no hot water for our bath. The maintenance man did stop by and checked it and said the hotel pump system was not cycling correctly. After about 20 minutes at 10pm. he said he had fixed it. We had \u201c bursts \u201d of hot water but not enough for all of us to shower bath. Also more than a little disappointed the water features except pool did n\u2019t open until 100 and closed at 70. We were returning customers up until now and had not experienced these issues before.

JW Mariot was supposed to be family focused and focused on good food. FAIL on the GOOD FOOD target way overpriced RESORT charge of 40 per room supposedly to cover the Waterpark and internet. Most places provide internet for free. The Waterpark was not worth 40 per room per day. FAIL on the GOOD SERVICE at a FAIR PRICE supposed to be family friendly. Songs playing at the pool were uniformly CRUDE and not family oriented. Draft Punk song. Get Lucky played twice per hour at the family pool. Way to keep it family oriented JW Mariot.

We visited the JW Mariot San Antonio for a family getaway in the summer of 2018. Let me begin with the many positive things about this resort. First of all the place is huge and you can easily entertain yourself for days without leaving the property. My kids 6 and 3 loved the onsite water park. The water park features several large pools a long lazy river 2 body water slides and 3 tube slides. The tube slides were great of younger kids but the body sides looked pretty intense and were not for little ones. I also had a chance to play golf on both the onsite courses. Both were very nice but mainly because of water restrictions that were in place this summer they were not not quite up to the level you might expect from a PGA host course. Now to the few negatives things we experienced. For some reason they have placed a large outdoor BQ pit directly next to a major wing of the hotel and near what looked to be air condition intake vents. On the second day at the resort we went to put our youngest down for a midday nap and the smoke smell was alarming to the point my wife was concerned about a possible fire. When she informed resort staff they did not take her concern serious at first. Eventually they explain the smoke smell was from the pit and it was a common complaint. They moved us to another wing. If you family has allergies as mine does you could request a room away from the pit. The other big drawback is the price. This is a high end resort and the prices for everything reflect that. We requested an in room refrigerator and save some by eating one or two meals in the room. Finally the resort is pretty far from most other area attractions. If you really want to see the sites in San Antonio you might look for a more central location.", "offset": [765, 812], "date": "2018-07-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "8f134d75-9562-437e-a6ef-f6b97d6a2b3f", "sentence": "We stayed here because we heard all the hype about this place.

Its very sad when you pay for a 5 star hotel and get a 2 star experience.
