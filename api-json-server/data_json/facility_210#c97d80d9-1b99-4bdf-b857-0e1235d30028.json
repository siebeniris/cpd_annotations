Stayed 17th June to 23rd June. Arrived midnight. Unfortunately our room had a fairly high bath which I could not manage to climb into after having hip surgery. The manager quickly found an alternative room Number 67 which was very large with a walk in shower. Most comfortable bed very quiet. Staff were very efficient helpful. We had the breakfast buffet twice which was excellent. Had a look in at the Sky bar which had beautiful views of the city. Our younger members of the family enjoyed a few drinks there. We enjoyed the sauna pool facilities which was an added bonus. The staff members in the gym were most friendly helpful. First visit to Sweden to see our family who live in Solna. Very impressed. Gamla Stan is just a few minutes walk from the hotel. Would recommend the Bridges boat trip. It was very informative of the history of Sweden. Skansen outdoor museum is well worth a full day to visit also. We were fortunate to have three grandsons aged 17 14 10 who were so proud to show us around Stockholm having moved there from the UK 3 years ago. They bought us a 72 hour ticket which we used on train bus ferry. Great value. Look forward to another trip next year but need to do some serious saving as Sweden is expensive. Service is exceptionally efficient the Swedish people made us so welcome.

This hotel was not even close to 4 starlets se1 breakfast was terrible not much variety no good service. No one knew hot to get coffee from coffee machine once I got it could not drink it as it was terrible in taste2 I booked it because of swimming pool and when I went there no bath robe provided and was told by SAT reception that they are not part of the hotel therefore I have to get it from hotel.

Also they close Gym and swimming pool on Saturday 6 pm. which was not good enough3 restaurant in the hotel is useless as no good menu provided all in Swedish which I could not understand. Tasteless food. better eat from restaurant next door. There are a lot of good restaurant next to hotel. All in all I did not like the hotel being superior four star.

The counter staff appear uniformly pleasant and good. Rooms. Tiny yes I know it is Europe but we still do not want to walk sideways inside the room.

They think nothing of putting up a sign saying two of the three elevators are broken and will be fixed and they remain broken for a whole day. One stays broken for two daysGym. Timing sucks. They do not own operate the gym. So the gym is mainly available during the workday and a couple of hours before and after. The Scandic like other 4star hotels has its own gym. Breakfast. It is a zoo. The spread is OK but plates were not well cleaned. We often had to set aside a plate and look deeper in the stack. And oh like the elevator the cappuccino machine yes just one was broken one morning. So no espresso etc. I had to leave by 730am to catch my return flight poached eggs which are on the buffet. were not available by the.
