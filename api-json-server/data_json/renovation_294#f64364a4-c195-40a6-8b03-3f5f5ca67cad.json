{"reviews": [{"id": 0, "uid": "9aed8924-81b6-4826-8f1e-5ac48fae3c44", "sentence": "This is a decent hotel but not a grand resort. First Impressions This is a hotel and not a resort. The front of the hotel was crowded and disorganized no one really greeted you. A decrepit looking fellow asked if we were guests and I was not sure if he was an employee or what. Sort of creepy. We did not have a car but the valet area was lacking they were not too attentive when you stepped out the door. This area always seemed chaotic. Lobby front desk. Front desk help was okay nice but not overly welcoming as previous reviews have stated. We asked them to get us a cab one night a full hour before we needed it and that caused some confusion no one really took full responsibility if one was even called. Luckily after 10 minutes of waiting one did appear luck perhaps. I do not know. Lobby has potential but something was lacking. maybe the frayed rugs. Just did not have that really polished look. Lobby bathrooms were closed for renovation. Our room was not ready so I had to change into my swimsuit in the pool area bathroom. Tight fit for me and my carry on in a small stall. Ugh not the greatest first impression. Outdoor restaurant. Had our first meal lunch overlooking the ocean. Desi our server a few times during our stay was very nice and accommodating. It was very nice being outside and eating with the ocean right there several yards from your table. However at one point I looked up and saw bright red spots on the upper beams as well as some chipped paint. It was a lovely eating area so the ceiling upper beams should have been up to par as well. The rocking chairs nearby on the porch overlooking the ocean were a nice touch. Beach. The beach is pretty but very narrow. Whether it was high or low tide it really did not change a thing in the width of the beach. Once afternoon comes the beach is crowded with lounges everywhere. We were here in early January so this was during the least populated time for the hotel no doubt. The sand was lush and plush but so much so that it was rather difficult to walk in the sand. To do a short walk was quite a workout and I consider myself in good shape. Not worth the effort the sand was kind of like quicksand. In January and winter in general the beach gets shady mid afternoon. Something for sun worshippers to think about. The staff at the beach was nice and they are helpful and accommodating in getting you a lounge chair drink etc. The pool The pool was nice but it is not that big and I can not imagine it being very accommodating during a more crowded time. Personally I think the Lazy River takes up precious space that could be used for a bigger pool. Tanya was an excellent waitress server polside. The drinks are expensive and a 5 oz. cup of wine is 12. Again like the beach the pool has a good deal of shade during the winter months parts of it in the morning parts of it in the afternoon as the building itself blocks the sun. The room The room was nice enough I was surprised we had an adjacent living room with a couch and loveseat and small table for two. The front of the room by the bathroom had tile on the floor which was nice. The bedroom and adjacent room had thick carpeting. While nice enough there were some stains on the carpeting and I think the carpet traps in the smells of the surrounding area basically the ocean. The room had a strong musty moldy smell to it and I kept the door to the balcony open as much as possible for some fresh air but the odor still remained. I realize that the ocean air is part of the musty smell problem but gee can not we do something about that. The two plastic chairs and table on the balcony were very cheap which is okay I suppose abut the dirt and grey stains on them were NOT okay. I put a towel on the chair when I sat on it. A simple wipe down once in awhile with a good cleaner would solve this problem. Inside the living area the leg on the table had chipped paint as did the TV cabinet. Just neglect that could be an easy fix. The bathroom was decent although the water was usually scalding when you first turned the bath on. At one point I looked up on the popcorn ceiling and there were little grey dust balls stuck to it in some places. Bar and Gift shop The bar is nice enough. There is not much to do at the hotel that being said it is not a resort. The gift shop is small and this is where you would go if you want to have a quick breakfast on your own. They only offer English muffins and bagels both of which are no where near as fresh as they should be. You can also buy coffee no juice. Coffee SHOULD be complimentary in the lobby. Whether it is a hotel or resort. The gift shop has no cans of beer or bottles of wine. You are on your own to either drive or worse walk at least a mile one way big mistake to a 7 11 or Walgrens for such items. There is no mini bar in the the room either so if you want a drink you need to order it via room service or go to the bar. While on the subject of walking there is NOTHING to walk to outside the hotel. The hotel is in the middle of condos no stores nothing within a walking distance of a mile or longer. That was disappointing if you wanted to just go for a walk and explore. Housekeeping We were on the 6th floor and our maid was sourly and unapproachable. Room was never made up before 4 pm. Restaurant. We ate at Ocean 200 it was dark and there were hardly any folks there probably due to the time of year. It seemed very nice and the food was great. We sat overlooking the outdoor patio but it was dark and all I saw outside was a vent so congested with puffs of dust it was gross. There were several construction items lying about as well. Not a thing patrons want to see view and it was very dark out to begin with. I can not imagine seeing it all in daylight. ugh. Service We ordered a bottle of wine one night and we also had a problem with our safe. Both times we were serviced quickly. Sightseeing I would recommend going to Las Olas Blvd in Fort Lauderdale. It was very nice. We ate at the sidewalk cafe restaurant Big City Tavern which was very nice. Nice street to stroll on and have a dinner out about a 10 minute drive from the hotel. One night we ate at Shooters which was on the intercoastal and about two miles north of the hotel. It was a very nice place outdoor seating etc. just a fun atmosphere. Amenities I would give the gym a D. It is very tiny and has your basic two or three cardio machines and a few weight machines. Mirrors on the walls to make it look bigger. For this reason this place is not a resort. There is no spa which I could care less about personally. gym is poor not many areas to see roam around in at all gift shop tiny bare basics. Overall My review goes up and down. It was a decent place but I have stayed at better and it is not a resort in my opinion. With some tweaks and polishing it could be more upscale it has good potential as a nice hotel. The cons would be it is small for crowded times of the year can not accommodate that many people. and the beach is very narrow and hard to walk on that was disappointing. Everyone talked about the construction yes it was a pain but they are trying to update so what can you do.", "offset": [906, 949], "date": "2015-01-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "ccabbf30-99cd-4d4c-a9b7-b42bf113d192", "sentence": "Quiet spot with a beach. If you do not want to be in the center of town where the majority of the hotels are then the Pelican Grand Beach Resort is a good place to be. It is in a nice quiet spot. You can walk to town very easily. However they have the sidewalks ripped up right now for repairs. We had breakfast and dinner on the porch which was a nice experience. The waiters and waitresses are very helpful. Our room was nice but the rug was in need of a cleaning. Also the people who cleaned our room came so late we were getting ready to go out. They gave us clean towels but did not seem happy about it. The hotel has a nice cottage feel. We picked this hotel because it is right on the beach.

Construction. Construction. First of all I will say that on a GOOD day there is noplace else I would rather stay than The Pelican Grand Beach Resort in Fort Lauderdale. It has a great location right on the beach an Old Florida type of feel but the rooms are modern and the BIGGEST reason to stay here is the veranda with rocking chairs that looks out over the ocean. I am sad to say that this last stay the veranda was closed 1 evening for a private party and then again for 3 days worth of a painting project. Honestly if not for this veranda I probably would not pay the rates that the Pelican Grand charges which are equal to the Ritz Carlton down the road. It was so disapointing to arrive and be told that we could not use the rocking veranda. Not a single mention of this project on their website and the worst part is they were posting old photos on their social media accounts of the veranda without the scaffolding etc. only days before the trip. WowBeyond the fact that they closed the best part of the resort during one of the businest times of the year winter break for schools for renovation there is a construction project going on which encompasses the ENTIRE top floor of the hotel. This project features the entire top of the hotel being covered with scaffolding and black netting. There are cranes in front of the hotel as well. From 9 am until about 3 pm there was jackhamering and drilling on the roof. So loud it pretty much shook things in the rooms. We were on the 5th floor and practically jumped out of bed each morning at 830 9 am when it started. No sleeping late on vacation here. Another couple told us that they could hear it in their room on the 3rd floor as welThe fact that there is construction going on is one thing. but for the hotel not to mention this on their webpage or social media is not good. People were paying 500 for a room and coming to Florida to relax on vacation. The beach entrance on the veranda is covered with scaffolding and black netting which essentially cuts the panoramic view of the beach ocean in half. It looks like the entrance to a haunted house. The area outside of the bar that leads to the deck is covered in rusted metal scaffolding. Once the construction is done I am sure The Pelican will go back to being a magical place of relaxation and bliss. However it totally ruined our vacation. We came to relax and instead we found ourselves taking cabs to restaurants off premisis for lunch to escape the chaos or taking all day walks on the beach because we could not rock on the porch or stand the drilling jackhamering. This should not be the case with a luxury resort. Beyond the craziness and chaos you will like the Pelican if you are looking for an oceanfront resort away from the hey bro crowds of Fort Lauderdale Beach. Your fellow resort guests tend to be a classier group and when the rocking veranda is not closed I have met many people whom I still keep in touch with while staying at this resort over the last 8 years. The resort is seculuded off the strip which makes a cab ride off premisis around 10 each way. Not bad if you want to go to Beachplace or The Mai Kai recommended. The restaurants on premisis are expensive 15 mixed drinks8 beers add up. and the food is just okay. But assuming construction is done you really do not need to go anywhere else because the views are beautiful while eating. We had a great meal at Oceans20 ask for the sand dune tables by tiki torch listening to the waves crash. This was the best part of the trip. Partly because of the romantic ocean location partly because it was dark out so we could not see all the construction. By the time we left we had racked up hundreds of dollars in bar bills. those Pina Coladas add up. Normally I would not complain but we were not even able to drink them on the veranda some nights. Honestly this is the SECOND time since Noble Hotels took the property over that I have been bothered by construction while staying here. The first time they closed off the veranda for a painting project and took away the beach stairs for repairs. This time it is 2 years later and I ran into the SAME EXACT situation again with the veranda closed for painting. I come the same time each year. once in the winter and once in the summer. And twice over the last two years have I been extremely disapointed that the best part of the resort is closed. If I am going to pay luxury resort prices to stay somewhere. I can not take the gamble that this will all happen a third time. As much as I hate to say it maybe this will be my last time staying at the Pelican Grand because its not worth the gamble of being disapointed. This is a great spot to relax and have lunch but if you can not relax because you feel like its a hard hat zone what good is being on vacation. Sorry Pelican Grand but you ruined this vacation for me. The only reason I did not give 2 stars poor is because of the nice dinner we had at Oceans and for the great friendly waitstaf we had all week long.", "offset": [3989, 4098], "date": "2015-03-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "54bf8fc9-85c2-4bb5-87be-65d2a179d81b", "sentence": "Pelican grand under construction.

We chose to stay post cruise. We chose due to trip advisor ratings and its location on the beach. First I will list the positives. it is location is excellent. Very quiet beach area great for families. The staff is unbeatable. We called the morning of our return to see if we could have an early check in and the assistant manager accommodated us without question. He was very friendly and accommodating our request was wonderful. All of the staff went out of their way to make our stay great. The lobby is beautiful and the deck overlooking the beach is really a nice addition. The size of the room was a nice perk especially with two teenage children. Two televisions and a sitting room was great for them. The bathroom was very large also and the amenities were very nice. Even the staff at the beach and pool were over the top nice and helpful. You do not always see that the the service industry these days. Now the negatives. As soon as we walked in the room there was a very odd odor and it remained the entire stay. If we were staying more than one night I would have complained. They was a lot of construction going on which was advertised that it would be complete in May. The room needed a lot of work. The furniture is outdated and worn. The hotel has potential for luxury but is just not there yet. An odd aside that the ice cream parlor did not have vanilla ice cream and the prices there and in the gift shop were higher than normal hotelsIf it stays as is I would probably not return just due to the condition of the hotel.

The grounds were not maintained. On the lazy river there were no fewer than 8 plastic cups in the bushes the lights are all broken and crooked. It just was not the same as before. The resort fee is only worth it if you get to the beach by 10 am and get an umbrella. That made the beach wonderful. On the way out we reviewed the bill to find a 30 per night parking fee which I recalled being 20 something on the website. Sure enough I looked it up and it read 28. Well the front desk attendant said it was wrong and needed to be updated. No offer to honor it. I just feel that they nickel and dimed us to death with the tax added to the parking as well.

We just returned from a 5night stay at the Pelican. This was our third trip. We always visit late March early April and have had wonderful experiences the last couple of years. When we arrived we were told about the beach reconstruction. It did not bother us since we mostly sit by the pool but if we were looking forward to long lazy days on the beach I would have been very disappointed to have large noisy tractors moving all day next to me. However with that said the beach is MUCH larger and roomier than ever. The reason for my average rating is mostly due to the outside of the hotel. First the outside desperately needs some refreshing. there is a lot of rust on the balconies and the hotel itself could really use a paint job. The hotel pool is so over crowded. There are not enough chairs for guests and it is small so you have to be at the pool by 8 am to get a chair and all chairs are filled reserved by 9 am. The pool area itself was very dirty. There were drink cups and garnishes all around the pool leftover from previous days that were just never cleaned up. Additionally chairs were vacated for HOURS before the pool guys cleared off the towels and other guests garbage so to guests arriving mid afternoon it appeared as though chairs were occupied when in fact they were not. Last year the pool guys were more on top of the area and kept it very tidy and clean. Also most of the bases of the umbrellas were totally rusted out so on breezier days I was worried they were going to tip over and hurt someone. The wait service around the pool was inconsistent though we had a great server one day Wallace I believe was his name. Drinks and lunches are very pricey but we knew that from previous visits. As for the staff everyone is very nice. Colby checked us in and was super friendly. The valet guys were great promt as were the bellmen. Very helpful. The rooms are wonderful. Great views and very spacious and clean. For 60 per night I think management needs to address what is going on outside of the hotel. There is no reason for there to be so much litter and some decent pool staff could really help to manage the crowding issues and chair turnover at the pool.

Biggest changes this visit were the new menus overpriced restaurant menu lacking value and a chef who could not cook a steak correctly given three chances limited healthy choices on pool menu and a limited bar menu. Hope there are additional menu changes in the near future. Take a look at The Sun Tower lunch menu for better lunch choices and enjoy nearby restaurants for dinner.

My partner and I visited the PGB Resort for 4 nights in early October 2018. I am not one to post reviews but feel the need to share about our wonderful experience. If I could give it 45 stars I would. First of all our check in went smoothly. We had booked a combined flight hotel car deal through a 3rd party. We were warned that there were renovations occurring and were a little concerned that this might take away from our experience. It did not. I hope to return to the facility following the renovations to see the room upgrades. Our room was on the 8th floor. We had a king bed and the room was spacious and clean if a little dated. The bathroom separated the toilet and shower from the sink which was great for allowing two people to use the space at once. My only complaint was there was no door closing off the sink area from the hallway into the bedroom area. Hopefully renovations will fix this. We had a small deck that faced south along the beach and a large interior window that faced directly east. The view is beautiful. I am happy we asked for an oceanside view at a higher level. Definitely worth it to watch the sunrises in the morning. Hallways and much of our floor was under constant renovation but there was never any noise that disturbed us and the workers were friendly and respectful. My biggest issue with our room was the lack of storage space for our clothing there were no dressers to put anything in and the closet was small. Again hopefully this will be rectified with the renos. It is not the most pleasant experience to use ones suitcase for a dresser. The hotel grounds included a decent sized zero entry pool enjoyable lazy river for tubing and plenty of chaise loungers umbrellas and small tables to soak in the views of the beach the hotel bar the decking and nearby hotels and condos. My only issue with this area was the iguana poop on the decking surprisingly abundant but avoidable. We spent an afternoon in this area and enjoyed frozen drinks from the bar. Great bar service. Only thing that could have made it better is if someone came outside to take orders and deliver drinks. The lobby is a lovely area as is the piano sitting area adjacent to the bar. My favourite part of the hotel was the patio area with the rocking chairs outdoor restaurant seating and fire pit area. This is a beautiful and relaxing spot to spend time. We had a delicious continental breakfast with fresh squeezed orange juice and and also a yummy lunch cod balls and fries cuban sandwhich and unique mojitos and watch the scenery on the beach which included kite and wind surfers not to mention the beach itself. The water was very wavy the entire time we were there but this made it all the more fun to swim in. Seaweed was cleaned up on week days. Chaise lounges umbrellas and towels were provided. There was an outdoor shower and tap to rinse off sand and seaweed before heading back into the hotel. The beach was walkable in either direction for miles and miles. The gift shop offered good coffee and a diverse selection of morning hot drinks plus a decent selection of souvenirs and beachwear and accessories. There was a water dispenser in the lobby filled with lemons and ice water always. We used the valet service for our car rental. It was extremely convenient and efficient. I have very few complaints about our stay only a few issues that I specifically identified. The staff were extremely friendly and service oriented and were always available and helpful. We would definitely consider staying here again in the future.", "offset": [489, 573], "date": "2018-10-18", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "4f59ef11-084a-4a4d-ae69-74894dec03aa", "sentence": "Construction is not a good thing when you are on vacation.

Stayed at this hotel for my birthday prior to a cruise. Had read that some were disappointed that the reservationist had not disclosed that construction was going on. Our stay was early February and I confirmed on the website that renovations would be completed by the end of November. Shortly prior to our stay I rechecked the website and the completion date of late November remained. However when we arrived we were told the pool area and fitness facility along with a few rooms were being renovated and unavailable. The staff could not explain why the website had not been updated and advised me they could wave the cancellation fee and allow me to cancel my stay if I wanted to go elsewhere. Try booking a special room we had an ocean front suite during high season for a weekend stay on such short notice. Not. I was also told I could take a shuttle to a hotel about a mile away to use their gym I work out quite regularlyAfter much back and forth we got a discount on only one of our three nights. Despite my due diligence in picking a hotel and room for my birthday celebration well in advance we were disappointed that we were not advised that renovations had not been completed some two months past the date advertised on their website. The expensive room is not enclosed inside a building so that the road noise is readily audible through the large gap beneath the door. Towels against the door did not help. The ice maker did not work. I informed the engineer who had to visit our room a couple of times for a malfunctioning safe. He called someone to report this on his walkie talkie and I called the front desk as well. It was never repaired during our stay. The towels were thin and scratchy. But the ocean view was nice.", "offset": [406, 538], "date": "2019-04-12", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "80c254c0-97c5-47b0-b7e4-caf59b628bb5", "sentence": "A solid family option but not as great as we hoped for. On our family travel site alsetvacationscom we have a category for does it meet up to the website pictures and videos online. this one was complicated because in some ways it did and otherwise it did not. They just finished obvious renovation at least on our room. You can actually still see the pencil marks from the contractor in the bathroom. Lol. it is very much of a boutique style room as you can see from the pictures. The refrigerator is small and there is no way of heating up food if you do bring leftovers from a restaurant. And the refrigerator was actually fully stocked with their items which of course cost more. So unles you remove their items you really do not have a fridge. The room was just okay as far as size. We brought two kids with us and the pull out couch definitely made a difference but having a room with more space or a little privacy for the adults would have been much better. Maybe we are spoiled. Having to share space and one bathroom was pretty ordinary like other hotels. The view is outstanding and what you would expect from a ocean front room. the staff is exceptional. They cater to all your needs very quickly and there is constantly staff moving around cleaning up and making sure that everything is tidy. The beds were not comfortable. They were way too soft. So a good night sleep was not really part of the deal for us. Maybe it was just our room but nevertheless wanted to put it in the review. We also had an issue with the draft coming from the front door through the back door. If you do not make sure you close your door all the way and make sure it is locked you might end up with a door wide open when you come back like we did. So do not assume it is closed on its own. Make sure you pull it shut. however it might have been more than just the wind. I took the one picture when it was absolutely still and there was no wind blowing at all. You can check out our restaurant review on the restaurant site itself here on TripAdvisor but it got a four out of five as well. there are great fire pits fortnite time enjoyment and beautiful views from those fire pits and tables and The veranda is definitely the best. We enjoyed some incredible times as both just adults watching kids on the beach as well as as a family after getting ice cream from The emporium. The veranda alone would be a 5 out of 5. In conclusion this is one of the few resorts that is right on the beach itself like a traditional beachfront Resort should be. The geography here is a little different and if you go further south most of the hotels are up to A1A and not the beach. So this makes the pelican stand out. the pool is not as big as it might appear online. But it was okay. It was warm but pretty crowded on the lazy river is smaller than you would expect. all in all we would probably stay here again but we also will check out other hotels first.", "offset": [261, 320], "date": "2019-04-21", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "d7f89dc0-bee8-4b9f-8399-2ee21ad33b2b", "sentence": "Worst Hotel Ever Stayed At.

Garbage lying around the outside pool and lazy river. Garbage at the beach overflowing and staff not willing to empty it. Old pool chairs that look like they need recycled are at the beach. Pool staff and beach staff was very rude. The beach staff works hard but only if they are not busy on phones. You ca n\u2019t beat the location on the beach. But the hotel is not top quality. With valet parking and the fees for each day plan on additional costs when you check out. We have been to the property three times in the past and have seen a huge drop in effort by the staff.

Valet parking is fast and efficient and works via text message to make requesting your car simple and effortless. The bar has fantastic drinks and bites all the way up to 11 PM. The spicy tuna tacos are highly recommended amazingly fresh and enjoyable with every tantalizing bite. For dinner the sea bass or lobster risotto are hard to beat. In the morning treat yourself to a 7 AM swim in the ocean before everyone else wakes up followed by breakfast on the veranda. It really is the perfect start to a morning. The only problem I found is that if you are a Silver or Gold Hotelscom member the hotel may not be aware of the benefits you should receive ie a 40 resort credit. However if you ask for this during checkout they will be happy to provide it.

The hotel is beautiful and was conveniently located in close proximity to a lot of restaurants and things to do. The veranda was a beautiful place to have a glass of wine in the evening and listen to some live entertainment. Very relaxing. The only negatives were that the day we were there we were told upon arrival that the pool would be closed from 8 12 for some repairs. It was closed longer and even though we had looked forward to using it we were unable to. The only other negative was the morning of our departure we called room service to order breakfast so we could eat it in the room as we packed and got ready to leave to conserve time. Called room service and let the phone ring at least 20 times and no one ever picked up. We would have easily spent 40 on breakfast but instead drove thru a McDonalds on our way out of town. Not my first choice or even close by any means but it did end up saving us about 30 but at a loss to the hotel.", "offset": [494, 628], "date": "2019-09-07", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "39f66b2d-278d-4ae5-a36f-1bb05a5967e9", "sentence": "Overall.
