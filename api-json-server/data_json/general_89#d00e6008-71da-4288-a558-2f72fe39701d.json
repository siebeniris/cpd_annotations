Your staff were always polite and well mannered. However we found our stay somewhat comical and I have been meaning to email your staff team to make you aware of the events that we experienced during our stay. We stayed in the Burton Upon Trent Mercure Hotel as part of the Burton Brewery Tour Package. It stated as part of our package that we would receive a Free 3 Course Meal on the first night of our arrival. I wanted to bring to your attention that is impossible to have a 3 course meal within the \u00a3 22 per person limit that is set on the menu within this hotel. Naturally as I am well accustomed and experienced within the Catering business I understand the need to set a limit on such offers. But it is physically impossible to have a 3 course meal within this limit therefore I wanted to bring to your attention that your advertising of a Free 3 course meal on our first night of arrival was a falsely advertised. As we sat down for this meal it was very politely explained to us that we could be in for a long wait as the hotel had a large party in another room nicely done and understood. Breakfast on our first morning. Again we were politely told that breakfast could be delayed as the chef was not expecting so many people I am not sure how a chef does not know how many covers to expect in a hotel but again the waiter was very polite and we were in no rush so this was not a problem. However the Waiter was not busy on this morning and therefore I feel there was no excuse for the following. There were no glasses or plates to allow us to help ourselves to toast and juice and there was also a shortage of pastries the breakfast table looked to be very lacking. When our waiter came to take our order we were also informed that the chef did not have time to serve us scrambled eggs bizarre is it not. Especially when we were offered omelet as an alternative. We were also served what I can only presume were tinned mushrooms. And potentially microwaved bacon. So breakfast was Okay at a push certainly not that of a 4 establishment. Our experience of breakfast on the second morning was very similar. Although to be fair there were glasses and plates on the buffet table and we were offered scrambled egg. We were once again warned of a possible delay there was a lack of food available on the buffet table and when we received our long await scrambled eggs they strangely were not seasoned. This just added to the chuckle that we were having about the service within the hotel. We stayed for a very comfortable 2 nights at the Burton Mercure. However as we approached reception to check out the lady receiving us stated You just need to settle your drinks bill. As we checked in we had been asked if we wanted to add a card to our account for any such transactions or if we were going to pas as we go as it were. We selected the pay as you go option. The confusion came from our first night within the hotel. During our not so free 3 course meal we were sharing the dinning room with a large family table. Due to the delay in the service the children on that table had become quite irritable. After experiencing them playing hide and seek throughout our dinner my partner and I asked our waiter if we could retire to our rooms to finish our drinks. He explained to us that this would not be a problem at all. So we settled our meal bill including the drinks and continued upstairs. We can therefore only presume that the receptionist was trying to charge us for a second time for the drinks that were purchased on the first night. Fortunately as we were starting to explain this to her our waiter appeared in the reception area he confirmed the story and the receptionist apologised and we moved on. There are 2 things that would concern me about this if I was the owner of this hotel. Firstly you have a system in place that ensures your guest sign for any drinks that are put onto a rooms bill we did not sign for any drinks so this should have been investigated further before a paying customer was challenged. Secondly the waiter who we are very pleased came to our aid did not know that we had not purchased more drinks during our stay. And I have to say we certainly felt like our privacy had been invaded. We all appreciate the quick clean that your room gets in between your stay but for the cleaners to tell reception incorrectly that you have not been charged for drinks that had been sent to your room.

I am sure you can appreciate none of the above ruined our stay. We had a clean quiet room and with it an enjoyable stay.

There were three people at the reception. One was checking in another guest. The other two did not even say hello. It was late so we brushed it off only a small thing. When I asked about a room upgrade because I am a platinum member it seemed to come as a surprise and I was told the hotel was fully booked although there were only around 6 cars parked outside. I am glad I asked about it because it meant that the welcome drink was given to me otherwise it would not have been. The room was fairly clean but was outdated which was not the impression we got from the website. The bathroom specifically was like stepping back in time. The shower also constantly dripped after use. It was fixed when we arrived back so I assume this is an issue the hotel is aware of and fixes by tightening a visible screw when the room is cleaned each day. We were in room 201 and I can only assume it is under some major water pipes which run through the building. All day and all night there is a noise in the room similar to a water boiler in action. I understand the building is old but a constant noise like that is not acceptable when you need to sleep. I did mention it on check out but although the receptionist was friendly I did not receive an apology just a comment that they would have maintenance look at it. We ate at the restaurant on the first night which served good food. Zac who served us was excellent. He was only young but extremely polite and could definitely have a career in hospitality ahead of him. We specifically wanted to leave him a tip but were not able to there were some problems with getting 10 off the bill another platinum benefit which staff seemed unaware of but Zac waited by the table chatting with us whilst it was sorted. We hope that the 10 gratuity automatically added to the bill goes directly to him. The supervisor was also preparing for breakfast the following morning by laying out glasses cereal dispensers etc in the room. That would not be a problem if we were staying in a basic hotel with a simple restaurant but we were dining in a restaurant called The Brasserie and paying \u00a3 15 plus gratuity for a burger. On a positive note we did enjoy relaxing in the lounge area with a drink but overall we were quite disappointed with our stay especially considering that we specifically booked this hotel to receive the platinum benefits even though we were visiting an attraction 45 minutes away.", "offset": [1554, 1792], "date": "2016-05-16 22:14:45", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "16dec6b0-46af-4211-874e-a47d23c3b19b", "sentence": "My last 3 visits to the Newton Park have been very poor.

We were assigned room 103 which had little to no floor space and was very cramped. Understandably the hotels building is a listed 18th century mansion so the rooms vary in size and configuration but that aside it is disappointing that the hotel which appeared to be extremely quiet did not allocate us with a more comfortable room. Also be advised that the rooms do not have any air conditioning. Our other family members had a fan in their rooms we did not.
