This is the second time my wife and I stayed in Four Seasons Sydney. The first time was almost three years ago when we were not yet married. This time our stay was more relaxing. We found the bed so comfortable. The room is a bit small as to our standards yet the overall feel was very good. The management gave us as a bonus a bottle of sparkling to celebrate our anniversary. The location is on point near circular quay if one wishes to go to Taronga or to Manley Wharf. It is likewise near the Rocks Harbourbridge and the Opera House. It is also near the train and the bus stops to the CBD. Four Seasons Hotel Sydney has a satisfying array of breakfast items. I would like to try their room service next time.

Having been a fan of Four Seasons hotels for years this is one of those which should not be in the group as the rooms are not as good as most around the world. Part of the problem is that as they inherited the hotel and then rebranded many years ago from a Regent Hotel to Four Seasons which in Four Seasons terms this is a product in a very central location near Circular Quay. However some of the rooms look over the flyover and I know that they do their best to house people in the best ones over the harbour you only have so many of them. having said that the lobby function rooms and staff are as Four seasons as they come and as they ca nt do much about the rooms over the flyover its a trade off between location facilities service over View. In Sydney you can get views anywhere so I would not worry about looking out of a hotel room as how many people stand there and want to be there for ever looking out of the window. My advise is take the room do not worry about the flyover and enjoy the central location near the Quay.", "offset": [597, 803], "date": "2017-04-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "c3cf5851-0a16-403c-ad42-2bf324791351", "sentence": "No view.

Have stayed at this hotel a number of times and keep going back. Our regular room was booked so we stayed in room 1820 this time. The hotel is most conveniently situated in Sydney being just opposite and in walking distance of Circular Quays by the waterfront and the Sydney Opera house. The views are great. The room layout is convenient and the bar fridge nicely stocked. We were over tempted with the chocolate collection. Bathrooms are spacious and housekeeping meticulous. We made use of the pool area on this visit which we normally do n\u2019t do. They have a convenient gym which has the basics and is fit for the purpose. The hotel is in walking distance to shops and restaurants is convenient. Two blocks up to the left of the hotel is a weekly market which is open weekends. Don\u2019t forget to make a turn at the Grain bar downstairs. It was our regular stop off point after dinner to catch up on their signature cocktails. A good selection of drinks to choose from. I do think the service was slow at the bar this could definitely be improved on. You end up having to find the waiter who took your drinks as they disappear after the order is taken. Also the pretzel snacks are a bit overdone now and it would be nice for some variety. Good to see management so involved and looking after repeat customers. To Mr Barnet and his team the bottle of Bordeaux blend was a lovely gesture thank you.

A prime location and perfectly professional and courteous staff make this hotel a worthwhile stay. But in terms of its hard product unfortunately it falls in line with many other so called 5star hotels in Sydney which are in desperate need of a total refurbishment or rebuild. Do not expect a Four Seasons standard as you may remember it from other places. The standard rooms are on the small side and can be rather noisy you will know it when your next door neighbour takes a shower. The electrics are extremely dated there is no master light switch and if you are using an adaptor there is only one usable plug throughout the room and do not expect any mains by the bed to charge handheld devices. The bathroom is small and pretty basic do not expect a rain shower or similar 5star treats. On the plus side the king size bed is very comfortable and the air conditioning discreet. On balance though if it was not for the impeccable service attitude of all staff I dealt with there is very little that differentiates this hotel from say a Holiday Inn except for the room charge which is of course 5star.", "offset": [923, 1144], "date": "2018-11-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "83f70402-3b5f-4c42-ab58-ea42043bd366", "sentence": "Hard vs Soft. I just had a fine experience at the Four Seasons in Sydney. Sadly fine is not what I expect or usually experience at a Four Seasons. In all honesty they deserve a 35 but alas not an option. The problem here is their hard product. rooms hallways furniture etc. The hotel is in a desperate need of a renovation. I mean a serious one like close for a year type renovation. It is just not up to a 5 star standard as it is now. The furniture in the room is nicked and scratched everywhere. The shower temp handle came off in my hand. There were scratches in the paint all over the bathroom and dust and dirt coming from the vents in the ceiling. There was dirt or bugs caught in the glass of the overhead light along the mirror in the bathroom. The shower head was so low and close to the wall I could not use it as a 63 person. I simply could not squat in any way that got my head close enough to the spray. Finally I found gum stuck on the wall on the way to the elevator it was there for our whole 4 night stay. The sum effect of these details is to erase any sense of Luxury. It becomes and 3 4 Star hotel with 5 star service. Some of this could be addressed by better attention to detail in terms of housekeeping but a lot is just age and only a true renovation will fix it. The decor of the room just feels so dated as well. There were a few other issues like no combs in the mens locker room two days in a row and the in room towels were anything but plush which sadly is one thing I really care about. The good news is all of these negatives were somewhat countered by the incredible service we received. The hotel has a perfectly trained staff who demonstrate the high standards of The Four Seasons brand. In room request were handled quickly. Use of my sur name at most points of contact. Delicious breakfasts at the restaurant with wonderful attentive service. The bar Grain was wonderful. In other words the soft product Service and food was spot on. Another positive is the location. You just ca nt beat it. If they finally commit to a massive renovation I do not think a better hotel could be found in Sydney but until then I am spending my at either the Hyat or Langham I hate being negative but if I am not truthful what purpose does TripAdvisor servePS This is not new suggestion every guest we spoke to at the bar and most of the bartenders said they consistently hear the same type of comments about the hotel condition and that a supposed renovation is going to happen soon.

We recently spent 6 nights here during our 3 week holiday in Australia and in this hotel we found as close to perfection as is possible. I read that many reviews mention the location and they are not wrong Central Quay is one crossing away The Rocks for bars and restaurants is a few minutes walk and the Opera House and Sydney Bridge only slightly longer. When we booked our room many months before we requested a room with a view and boy did we get it from lying on my pillow in bed i could see both the Opera House and the bridge and out across the harbour spectacularand our room was only on the tenth floor. Our room itself was exceptional and had more than ample storage a very well stocked mini bar an excellent spacious bathroom with both a separate bath and shower cubicle as well as many extras provided if required. The bed was huge and very comfortable with amazingly comfortable pillows that allowed for a perfect nights sleep. We did use the restaurant on our first night due to our late arrival and found it very good although a tad pricey and minimal on portions. The bar on the ground floor seemed very popular whenever we called in and it is easy to see why it has a nice laid back feeling with a nice touch of class and the prices are very reasonable considering the location. We never took breakfast during our stay as there were so many Cafes nearby that offered this and at a very fair price. The staff in the hotel really were first class at all times and were excellent in assisting us with excursions out as well as train journeys and taxis nothing was ever too much trouble to them.
