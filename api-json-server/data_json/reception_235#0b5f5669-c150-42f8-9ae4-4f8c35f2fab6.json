My husband and three kids spent a week at Turnbery kids ages 14 12 8 between Christmas and New Year \u2019s. Here \u2019s the lowdown. The service is excellent and the food is excellent. The drinks are great and the pool is warm. If you have a good attitude you will have a great time. It was a crowded week and there were lots of pushy complainers. We stayed for a week at Turnbery on Mariot points so we had a good attitude about it but if I paid for each night plus a resort fee plus those exorbitant prices for everything I may be writing a different review. Yes every cost is gouging. We stay at Ritz Carltons frequently so we are accustomed to spending a lot on drinks and food. But I never feel like I am getting gouged at the Ritz. Here I felt gouged. We made our own peace with it by bringing in snacks from the local supermarket so that every time the kids wanted something we were n\u2019t paying 25. They do try very much to emulate the 5star experience and on many levels they succeed. Every staff member is wonderful \u2013 the phone operators are so knowledgeable and pleasant the housekeeping staff truly wants to please and the valets are stressed but very nice. We had lunch at the Corsair restaurant which had a beautiful view of waterfalls and the food was healthy and excellent. The quality of the rooms did not match the quality of the pool spa beach club restaurants etc. Like I said since it was \u201c free \u201d we had a good attitude about it. Our deluxe room had many positives great view spacious quarters even with one room for five of us very nice shower comfy beds and nice soaps shampoos etc. Other parts of it are rundown. There was a dankness in the room. The soaking tub looked very old and not very inviting. Outside the room the hallways are teracota floor that is sort of dirty or maybe it unfortunately collects crumbs and stuff that the carpets of other hotels seem to hide. There were two instances of bugs. They had to come and spray. I hate writing this because some people will write off the hotel for that but it is the truth. After they sprayed and they showed up immediately we did n\u2019t see a thing. One disappointment is that the events they describe on their website in no way describes what really takes place. Their \u201c Teen Lounge \u201d is a room with three couches. The cocoa and cookie event for Christmas afternoon had cocoa for sure but they ran out of cookies halfway into the event. And there are other such instances like that. Maybe Christmas week is so packed that it \u2019s difficult for any hotel to keep up. But I think they should have been more facilitating to get the kids to know each other. Bottom line we will go back to Turnbery. We had a great feeling when we returned home.", "offset": [1012, 1187], "date": "2015-01-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "0431ebf4-e3b2-4fe3-a267-dac323635e13", "sentence": "top notch.

Unfortunately front desk staff seems disinterested and over worked however the staff that greeted us at the front door and through out the resort were friendly warm and accommodating. Our room had a nice view of the golf course and was adequate for what we needed. It was nice but did not WOW. The pool was beautiful and so relaxing even with a handful of kids splashing around. We spent several days enjoying the lazy river pool floats and slide. Actually some of the best pool service and amenities I have experienced at a stateside resort. We had a couple problems with our lunch order by the pool but the manager and wait staff took care of it quickly and were attentive to our needs the rest of our stay. Drinks by the pool and through out the resort were a bit high. Plan on aprox 1420 for a adult beverage. They have infused water by the pool and resort entrance which is refreshing and free. Spa did WOW us. Outstanding amenities relaxing atmosphere and wonderful customer service. I received one of the Culture Massages The Ayurvedic Massage did not disappoint. It was one of the best I have ever received. I wanted deep tissue and it was perfect. Worked the deep muscles using stones pressure and tapping. Left me feeling relaxed yet invigorated afterwards. Resort location was great as it was within walking distance to the mall Publix and a fabulous 3 mile walking running and bike trail just steps from the resort entrance.

Turnbery Isle Resort is a well organized self contained resort with all the amenities most travelers want. The decor is elegant although it really needs a little bit of a face lift. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The bathrooms are equally well appointed. There are two golf courses which typical for any resort that appeals to snowbirds are renovated during the summer months. However the courses are well laid out appropriately challenging and well groomed. The central pool is spacious and comfortable. The staff is friendly and gracious. The food is very good but dinner choices in the evening on property are limited. The resort has two restaurants. The main one for dinner is the Bourbon Steak House which is mostly all beef. Patrons wanting healthier food choices or a wider menu have to go off property. In contrast to the rest of the resort the service here is arrogant and slow. The restaurant staff must think that they should appeal with snobbery. There are a few additional and less expensive choices in the spacious bar area but the cheerful staff there can not overcome the attitude of the serving staff from the restaurant where the food is cooked. I waited one hour and fifteen minutes for a hamburger which was finally retrieved by the bar tender in the bar. A waiter from the restaurant served a hamburger to another patron at the bar who ordered his some time after mine. When the bar tender noted to this waiter that my hamburger was missing in action the waiter shrugged his shoulders and left. There is another restaurant on property The Corsair which is only open for breakfast and lunch. The food there is creative healthy and a breakfast buffet is offered which is excellent. Unfortunately previous attempts by the hotel to keep this venue open for dinner have failed because of a lack of customer interest. Fortunately there are other good restaurant options at the nearby Aventura Mall and the hotel offers a free shuttle service until 10 PM at night. The spa on property is excellent.

If you have kids of are a kid at heart this is the place to stay. The rooms are very nice and the water park is outstanding. Sure the hotel is crazy busy during the holidays because everyone wants to stay here but the staff does a good job keeping everything in balance. The waterpark is better than most stand alone waterparks in the Northeast. Our rooms with our teens were adjoining and right next to the pool. They were really nice and spacious. This is not a hotel if you want quiet but if you want action and lots of it this is the place to be. My only gripe was with the breakfast where there was a wait given the crowds in the hotel.", "offset": [155, 300], "date": "2019-12-30", "cpt": "3", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 35, "uid": "9b21f25a-a003-4bcf-97a8-ad4c60cb1350", "sentence": "Everything is great until you get to the Valet Parking Payment Booth. Someone in management forgot to address this issue. I have two recent experiences. Had a 5person dinner with a 70 tab on Jan 24th. Came out to get my car and there was only ONE cashier at the booth even though it is a large resort with many guests diners and country club members. She was dealing with a customer who was having issues with his credit card and was not the least bit concerned that the line was building. I asked one of the many available doing nothing valet guys if he could get the car and he was rebuffed at the booth. Even tho it can take 10 mins to get the car there the valet could not be dispatched until the bill is paidthat is right we just spent 70 on dinner and the establishment is concerned that I am going to skip out on a 10 parking charge. Heres an idea. how about they let him get the car but not turn it over to me until I demonstrate that I am not a bad debt risk. OK incident two on Jan 31 not as bad as the first one but definitely indicative of the fu attitude by the staff. Again we had a 60 tab at Bourbon. This time there was no line but the woman was on the phone and appeared to be unconcerned about the fact that there is a customer waiting for her. I could tell that she did not like my asking her to process my 10 with restaurant validation valet ticket. When she did so she did not give me a receipt and sure enough I looked at my CC statement and she charged me the full non validated parking charge. Not a huge amount but just another fu indicative of the attitude and poor service that is inconsistent with the hotel or the restaurant. Remember managers you are only as good as your weakest link. Perhaps you need to rethink this part of the chain.", "offset": [1518, 1654], "date": "2020-02-03", "cpt": "3", "category": "reception"}]}
