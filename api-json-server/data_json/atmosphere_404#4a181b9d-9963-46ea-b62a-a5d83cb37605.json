My boyfriend and I were going to Vieques and stayed here for one night. The bar restaurant near the pool outside is very good and they make delicious drinks. I was really impressed with the daytime bartender who seemed to be able to make sure our drinks were never empty even though there were many other patrons. The frozen margaritas were just the best. The room was nice enough for my modest taste. Unfortunately something about the setup is a little off. For instance we went onto the beach only to be told that we needed hotel beach towels and wristbands which had not been mentioned at any point. We had to walk pretty far away from the beach to get them and then all the way back. It was pretty inconvenient and there were no signs posted. It seemed like they could have had a stand set up closer to the beach to make this more convenient. It is not a big deal but after all of the traveling to get there and finally setting up on the beach it just seemed like a bad way to treat paying customers. The restaurants and map were poorly labeled. I am sure if we had been there a few days we would have figured it out but we spent a lot of our day there walking back and forth after being told by the staff that there was something else we needed to do. Another instance of this is when we were leaving. We pulled up to the gate but were told we first needed to go back inside to have someone mark our parking ticket. We then had to park the car go back inside and get our ticket marked in order to leave. All in all some of my experiences left me frustrated and I probably would not go to this hotel again for that reason. It just seemed like there were too many rules for a relaxing vacation.

The first night we were here we had a drunk man BANG on our door at 3AM non stop until we called the front desk a great welcoming. The next day my husband called the front desk to complain about our first night here and they apologized and gave us a cabana for a day. The following days by the pool were spent trying to chase down the servers for drinks and food. Something I have never had to do at any resort. The restaurants here are overpriced and the food is TERRIBLE the only decent meal we had here was the italian restaurant which was expensive. Thursday through Sunday the resort turns into a complete party scene which is obnoxious for couples wanting a relaxing getaway. Not to mention you can hear the conversations clearly in the room next to you. We had fireworks go off at 10PM literally right outside our room which was very loud. At the breakfast place here they charge 25 P for picked over gross food. Not impressed. For the kind of money we spent on this trip I expect BETTER. Yesterday I tried calling the Spa to get a prenatal massage for stress releif and comfort as my doctor recommend and I had the lady on the phone laughing at me for wanting a doctors ordered pre natal massage. Horrified by the treatment my husband complained to the front desk who were extremely unprofessional as I spent the day crying in bed by my dissatisfaction of our honeymoon. The salon owner and hotel did not get back to us when they said they would so again we had to chase down the staff here. The salon offered me a manicure or a blow dry which I did not think was acceptable for the amount of distress it caused me. The salon owner apologized for the way I FELT. I have never ever had a terrible vacation before on the caribbean and this is a first. DO NOT COME HERE. My honeymoon is ruined after we spent 500 for wanting a relaxing vacation.

I joined my spouse here a day after his arrival for a conference. Because it was a work expense I did not know the price but later learned that it was around 40 night. YIKES. The hotel is very popular and at night between live music dancing and the casino a lot of locals come out which is kind of cool. There are also several different pool areas and late in the afternoon a DJ arrives and spins music all afternoon. Many people we spoke to at the conference were dissatisfied with their room. One person changed rooms three or four times. Our was only OK it had a modern style but there were many things about it that made it clear that there as minimal upkeep there was water damage on the floor and walls the framed artwork had soiled marks behind the glass the shower never had hot water there was rust forming on the bathroom door handle and the furniture in the room had stains and other marks on it. Attached to this review is the view we had from our room. Also because we are so close to the airport I could hear planes taking off and landing. I spent most of my time at the beach which was fine. albeit it is the beach of a large hotel so it was very busy. The music playing at the pool could easily be heard on the beach. In the morning and at dusk there are no see ums that will bite you be sure to use bug spray which the hotel has available at the bars for communal use. I think it had be much nicer if they gave each room a small container in each room as they do with other amenities. They set out a limited number of beach chairs which are free however they charge 150 for an umbrella. I thought this was sort of nuts but took the charge anyway. The food is meh and the prices are high. 710 12 oz of local berI did not complain to the hotel staff about any of these things so they were not given an opportunity to correct anything.

I was between this La Concha and the Mariot Stelaris prior to booking. I chose La Concha due to concern over the room quality here. Upon visiting this place I realized that was not a good choice. If you are seeking interaction with fellow travellers especially those from the US a good vibe and some nightlife you should choose this resort over the Condado options. This place has a better vibe the public spaces have more charm and character and the layout is more conducive to a resort feel. The pool area is large and open with an adjoining bar it leads naturally to the beach the beach is wide and sandy and there are jet skis and watersports options freely available on it. The casino flows with the lobby pool and nightclub in such a way that a warm and open atmosphere is created. The fact that the hotel is not in Condado and does not face Ashford Avenue is not a loss there is nothing to do on Ashford Avenue which is vastly overrated. At the same time the hotel is not too happening ie this does not feel like Vegas is not a scene or potentially upsetting for families or older people. it is just a nice mix for everyone.

Just spent three days in PR on business. This was my fourth time at the El San Juan but the first since the hurricane. Based on the conditions of the grounds building exterior and lobby there is little to indicate there was a hurricane except that the hotel is not fully open and it is very quiet. The property is in excellent condition. The casino and night club are closed as are some of the restaurants due to lack of business. That said I did not want for anything. The staff could not do enough for me. All of Isla Verde seemed quiet but it is off season and some other hotels such as the Ritz Carlton are not reopened as yet. The last time I was there the lobby was rocking with locals and tourists alike doing business during the day and dancing and swaying to a great Latin band at night. I am also relieved the hurricane did not destroy the lobby or that some designer did not convince the owners to remove the detailed dark woodwork for white Carera marble. The lobby is one of the items that gives this wonderful hotel its character. I hope when the high season returns the lobby becomes the social scene it used to be. Most of the hurricane damage along the waterfront in Isla Verde has been repaired. You can see some evidence of ongoing repairs but they have done a remarkable job of repairing and restoring the buildings along the waterfront. The beaches are in excellent shape as well. While the physical toll on properties is being restored the hurricane continues to take an emotional and economic toll on the people of Puerto Rico.

The exterior grounds pool area and the main floor lobby shops and restaurants feel very luxurious. Service is top notch with friendly front desk staff. Room size was adequate for our need. No upgrades per say as a Diamond as the property was sold out for the weekend. but the room offered still had somewhat of a view. Wifi worked well and was stable throughout the property. Bed was comfortable. Temperature control worked fine. Good size bathroom with good standard amenities. There was an awesome band in the middle of the evening playing in the lobby area and you were easily taken back to the 50s and 60s. The atmosphere was surreal.

This is a property that deserves the many 5star rating that it is getting from fellow TripAdvisor reviewers. That said there are a few areas that warrants some minor improvements. The AC system is doing a good job to control temperature but not humidity. The air was quite damp in the room and with time I would not be surprised to see this leading to mold issues. The one restaurant opened for breakfast was well over capacity the day of our visit. Long waits to get seated very slow service from staff and staff had trouble repleneshing items in the buffet. Also items were not clearly labelled and major allergens were either hard to identify or items were placed in a way that would definitely lead to cross contamination. The room assigned looked nice and modern but the style clashed with the very lavish experience from the main floor lobby. Finally you could tell that the room and floor renos that led to the conversion to Curio were rushed with some finishing touches lacking and a feeling of old that has been painted wallpapered over. All in I doubt that there is something much better than the Curio available at this time in Isla Verde area of San Juan and at the right price I would not hesitate to go back.

Considerations A 17 cab ride two people with 2 bags \u2013. taxis have a charge per bag and 7min ride from the airport if staying in the tower portion of the hotel ask for a room with odd numbers if you like to sleep in as the even number side rooms face East and sun is up brightly by 060 and you will notice.

I would recommend an early morning walk on the beach for a workout along a quiet and empty beautiful beach. If seeking a Casino a 7 to 10 minute walk or quick Uber ride gets you to a few places to invest. DO spend some time having a beverage at one of the Lobby Bars with the entertainment in the background going on \u2013 transforms one back in time to the way Old World Charm hospitality use to be.
