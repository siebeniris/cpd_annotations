We needed a place to stay for a few nights during our home renovation and wanted more than just a hotel room. This place was perfect for our family of 4. It was like staying in a little apartment complete with a full kitchen. Our suite had a loft with a full bath as well as a bedroom with another complete bath on the main level. Lots of space for all and the kids loved having their own TVs to watch. We liked the layout of the suite. The loft upstairs gave us lots of room so no one was tripping over anyone elses belongings. Lots of restaurants nearby at the Manhattan Village Mall or The Point. Also very close to the beach with more places to eat and shop. The bedding for the hide a bed sofa was well worn and in desperate need of replacing.

I have reviewed this Residence Inn in the past in detail. I have always been a big fan and have said so to those I care for at Mariot headquarters in Bethesda. I typically spend 1 2 weeks here yearly this year 11 days. I believe we stayed at the very farthest corner of the complex in 724. It overlooks a Toyota dealership and the parking lot which might not seem to be appealing but we were always out and about. The staff is friendly but many who knew us have left. The exercise room is great to burn off some steam. The breakfasts have a lot of the same choices as other Residence Inns but perhaps prepared better and with prompt restocking. Three nights a week there are socials. One is the BQ. There are several beer and wine choices. This year all the burgers were pre cooked in a bin and I have to say it was more fun the old way getting them hot off the grill. It was not a weather issue. The room we stayed in was nice and maybe newer than those we stayed in previously located closer to the pool. This Residence Inn is probably one of the most expensive in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas. They have updated their lobby and eating areas in the past as well as maintained the grounds. I have always felt the pricing given the location and such was in the range of reasonable. They recently added a parking fee of five dollars per night. If your family has a second car that is added on too. They added this fee after I had reserved my room and kindly waived it upon asking noting it had just started. I appreciate the gesture. My advice is just charge what you need to for the room and keep it simple. Sometimes extra fees just spread resentment. Certainly large resorts have lots of additional fees. This is not a resort. I hope they reconsider this fee which I know is modest. Otherwise as always I think families will enjoy their stay here.", "offset": [1127, 1220], "date": "2016-07-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "528fb017-685b-4dbc-ae07-aca37a1a0ef3", "sentence": "Good base in LA.

We only stayed the one night and it was fine. The room itself needs to be remodeled badly but even with that it was still clean and the beds were comfortable. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I asked for a room with two beds instead of one and they made it happen for me. The breakfast is decent. They do not have an espresso machine but the kitchen staff steamed up some milk for me for a latte. The breakfast is ONLY until 9 am and they were closing doors and cleaning up by 857 so be sure to give yourself time to get down there. There is no restaurant or bar but they do have a happy hour. We did not participate as it was not until 730 for whatever reason and we walked down the street and had a fantastic dinner at Manhattan House.

I checked in today and have been trying to find another hotel for the past 4 hours so I can get out of here. The room is a penthouse and the corner faces the pool. You can hear all the noises every scream from the pool and playground. The room smells and there are stains on the carpet and furniture. Everything is very very worn. Most of the electric sockets are stripped so I I can not charge my phone in the main room the plug just falls out. The caulking in the bathroom is separating from the bathtub and fixtures and the baseboards are pulling away from the wall in the bathroom. The windows are fogged and the internet keeps going on off because of the construction. They are apparently renovating. It is really gross and not a typical Mariot property especially for 325 per night. Maybe if you get a renovated room it would be better but this is one of the worst hotel experiences that I have ever had.

Have been coming to this Mariot property for over a year. Until this last trip they were an outstanding property. With the new renovation it is a big fail. While I love energy efficient units this one fails especially in the bathroom when the sensors turn off the lights every five minutes and the sensors do not work. There is no window in the bathroom so you are in total darkness. Waving your hand in front of the sensor does nothing so you have to reach over to turn the lights back on. Finally on day 5 of a 9 night stay engineering came by to install a manual light switch. There is hardly any parking available if you get back to the property after 6 pm. Did not know that they charge for overnight parking as I have not been charged on previous stays in the past year. This is the first time second according the Argel the manager that I have been charged for parking on my previous 8 stays or so. I had been waived the fee because of Platinum Elite status in the Mariot Rewards program. I suppose now with the merger with SPG and Ritz it does not mean anything. And why charge for parking when there is not any. There is parking at the Target but only had to do that one night. Expect to park far from your unit if you return late. Also the manager Argel states to contact him but he does not get back to you. Of course he apologizes when brought to his attention but why offer if you are not seriousThe positive notes of this property is it is location. But with the current management I will find another Mariot SPG Ritz property in the future. There is a Westdrift not too far and their management is much more responsive. Have stayed there twice to allow for the completion of the renovation at Residence Inn. it is just so unfortunate since I like having a kitchenette and full fridge always staying a week or more.

We recently stayed at this property with our Beach Volleyball Club Team One Volleyball Chicago. We were traveling with 14 of our players and 2 coaches. Donna was awesome to deal with for our group booking. She communicated quickly and clearly. This property was recently remodeled and was in beautiful condition. Each of the rooms were nicely done and we certainly appreciated having our own full kitchen and living room. This unique property is in a perfect location near most of the stores and right down the street from the downtown area. Property is kind of secluded from the street noise so that was really nice at night. They also provided us with a nice buffet style full breakfast this worked out really well for our hungry athletes.

The neighborhood is very walkable with plenty of restaurants shops grocery stores within walking distance. The beach is a little under a mile and a fairly easy walk downhill. You may want to plan on catching an Uber coming back since it is mostly uphill. If you use the \u201c ride share \u201d option it should n\u2019t cost more than 34. The staff is very attentive and the grounds are kept up nice. As Mariot gold member they usually upgrade me to a two bedroom two bathroom here which it honestly feels more like an apartment than a hotel room. Rooms are large updated and clean the included breakfast is good fitness room is more than adequate. The pool area looks nice although I \u2019ve never used it. There is a happy hour Mon Wed night and its great for grabbing a drink or two and appetizers. I \u2019d definitely recommend staying here over the hotels closer to LAX mainly because the location is much better and it \u2019s quiet. An Uber Lyft will run 10 14 to from LAX and the drive takes anywhere from 10 25min depending on traffic it \u2019s about 4 miles. On the weekends it should n\u2019t be more than 15 minutes.
