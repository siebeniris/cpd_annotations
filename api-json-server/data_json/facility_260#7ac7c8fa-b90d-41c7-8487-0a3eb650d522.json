In an effort to give the most comprehensive review possible I dusted off my review from May \u2019 14 and will add items I missed in that review here on this one. I had to pull that review down so I could post this one anyway plus there were some typo \u2019s in that review that were driving me nut \u2019s. This is a long review so I will give busy folks a short cut. Contact me through Trip Advisor with any questions you have I will answer anything you are curious about. We have been to Le Blanc 6 times now 40 days over the past couple of years across multiple seasons. I have also stayed at all the other Palace Resorts as well as some of the Hard Rock Resorts. I am also happy to answer questions about membership in Palace. I do not work for Palace nor am I compensated in any way for my reviews by anyone much less Palace Resorts. We are Palace members. These are my wife \u2019s and my opinions if I think something is poor I \u2019l say so if I think it \u2019s the best thing ever I will say that too. Le Blanc is the crown jewel of Palace Resorts and it is for a reason. It is also a 5 Diamond rated resort and 1 resort on Trip Advisor for the same reason and it is very justified. Other resorts including other Palace Resorts have Superstar Team Members Le Blanc is a whole Team of Superstars who work very very hard are highly trained seem genuinely happy to be there and totally understand the meaning of Customer Service. They are also the politest group of folks I have ever met. The Team at Le Blanc is the reason why Le Blanc is as good as it is they are clearly the heart soul of the place. They turn the hotel into a warm welcoming \u201c home away from home \u201d. There is a synergy that occurs here the ultra professional highly trained happy to be there staff along with a beautiful location and good facilities creates a world class wonderful experience for the traveler. I have never had a negative interaction with a member of the Le Blanc Team. This does not mean that nothing ever goes astray or wrong nor is everything perfection. What I mean that if something is amiss talk to the staff and they do their best to fix the situation. We have been there enough and have been lucky enough to have developed relationships with quite a few members of the staff. This is a wonderful situation and makes the overall experience even better. I look forward to seeing them almost like family. On this trip we found out about some of the perks that Palace provides to its Le Blanc staff and we were very happy to hear that the staff is appreciated provided food staff Chef facilities suggestion boxes ability to provide information direct to the Ownership and promotions from within. Palace bench marks other hospitality organizations and adopts best practices. Other hospitality organizations need to bench mark Le Blanc. In this situation I believe the \u201c student \u201d needs to become the \u201c teacher \u201d. I run a global team for a Fortune 50 Company and I wish I could dial in the high level of customer service that the Le Blanc Team performs at. I would love to get a copy of the training manual or sit in on some of the training. My wife and I both work high stress jobs and a stay at Le Blanc allows us to turn off relax and get to know each other again. On the surface Le Blanc is expensive however it is a value for the money when you look at the myriad of services available at no additional cost vs the cost of those amenities in an a la carte setting I do cost comparisons. Total Cost of Ownership studies for a living. I will be happy to discuss any specific examples off line this review is long enough. We spoke to some folks that stayed at the trendy new Zen resort at the opposite end of the hotel strip and I know I can defend my \u201c Le Blanc is a value for the money \u201d comment. Le Blanc has a couple of Aps. In the Aps you can see some of the amenities that come with a stay at Le Blanc you do not need to be a guest to get into the Aps \u2013. if you have trouble contact me I can detail most if not all of them. Other reviewers have pointed out many of them this is a long review and I \u2019l be happy to list off line to anyone who would like in depth details. Food There are 4 main restaurants International Mexican Italian Asian and French as well as a Pizza oven pool beach snack bars snacks in the lobby and a very elaborate 247 room service menu. The food is outstanding especially since it is an all inclusive. Some seem to think that adding hotel and all inclusive make it become a Holiday Inn Express attached to a Golden Corral not that either of these establishments are bad. Le Blanc does reach the 5 star levels with its food quality and variety. More on food variety if you do not see something you like on the menu ask for them to make something you do like. If it is not something off the wall it will show up with a smile. If you want Haggis or something like that they probably will not be able to deliver. My wife often orders special grilled shrimp or fish no problem it is a pleasure. Fork cut filets. Called beef tenderloin on the menus absolutely the filets are outstanding \u2013 no knife required. The gumbo is as good as or better than New Orleans. The polside cheeseburgers are outstanding this is actually harder to do than it sounds \u2013 it \u2019s easy to make a crappy burger add a side of Parmesan fries for the added wow factor. The food variety because you can request a special dish is endless. There are cook to order meats and seafood available every day for lunch and dinner. You can order veal giant steaks or lobster using resort credits. Honestly not sure why you would the menu offerings of both meat and seafood are outstanding. One thing I noticed this trip was more interaction with the chefs with them coming out and chatting with guests. This is really good. It is a pleasure to meet the folks behind the screen the ones who are making all the good things happen. Le Blanc does pretty well managing the hot items on the buffet during breakfast and lunch. I at one point in my varied career I was a Army Mess Officer and lived in this space. Keeping food hot and not overcooking drying out is a challenge art form. Le Blanc rotates and changes food out frequently. But again if a buffet is not your style the grill to order items should be perfect for you. One small thing again that I have noticed is the quality of the bread and pastries. Across the board the various breads rolls muffins and desert pastries are fantastic. There is a sundried tomato roll that is available at lunch and in the Italian restaurant that I am having withdrawal symptoms over \u2013 they are that good. Latte \u2019s and Cappuccino \u2019s and a high end tea service are available at any time in the lobby. In the evenings you can get a specialty coffee Irish Mayan etc. Try the Mayan Coffee. The show is as good as the treat it involves fire and alcohol how can it get any cooler. There are snacks and treats available in the lobby. The Asian Restaurant has been completely redone. The d\u00e9cor is amazing particularly the woodwork. oh yeah and the food is really good too. It and all the restaurants are very well managed. The staff is excellent and the management supervision even better. Their attention to detail is superb. Each room has a mini bar with bottles of various alcohol soft drinks and beer. Additionally snacks are provided including chips chocolate bars nuts and Ferero Rocher chocolates I never had these until I stayed at Le Blanc. Do you not like the brands provided. Ask your butler to change them out no problem it is a pleasure. There is a coffee pot in the room. It is a pressure brewer for you fellow coffee snobs out there it is more like a Tasimo machine vs a Keurig machine. It makes good coffee but alibi strong coffee which might not be to your taste. Room Service will bring you up a pot each morning if you do n\u2019t like the brewer just fill out the room service card at night and schedule the time or call room service or ask your butler. Le Blanc uses coffee from the Mexican state of Chiapas. It is very good coffee. One improvement Le Blanc could make would be to replace the powdered creamer packets in the rooms out with single serving Mini Moo creamers. Good coffee with powdered creamer is like pulling a plow with a thoroughbred race horse. Butlers. The butlers are a Le Blanc perk and they make things very nice. Each floor has two one day one night. They serve as concierges. They will take care of all kinds of things ranging from unpacking packing running baths making reservations both on and off site problem solver ironing shoe shinning local area Le Blanc information. They are Google Le Blanc Cancun. They all have phones if they are not at their desk you can call them. You can also contact them through the Aps. You can always get a hold of your butler if you say you can not you are not trying. Having a Special Occasion. The butlers will decorate your room set up a special dinner get a special cake set up run the Jacuzi no problem it is a pleasure are you noticing the trend of \u201c it \u2019s no problem it is a pleasure. You will hear that phrase frequently if you choose Le Blanc. I was skeptical about having a butler before we stayed at Le Blanc now I realize that the butlers are a unique and special perk that make the vacation much better. They are problem solvers and if you let them take care of the trivial details lost key as a example that you would otherwise have to take care of then more vacation for you. This past time our team helped with numerous small items which had they not been there would have taken time away from our vacation. You will be introduced to your butler after you complete check in. If you are new to Le Blanc ask for a tour of the facilities if it is not offered. Gym. Outstanding I have never used a gym that smelled like a spa before. The Weight and Cardio equipment is clean mostly brand new and well maintained. The facility is spotless with various waters scented hand clothes and fluffy towels provided. Various classes are offered from yoga to spin to Pilates. The aqua spin bikes in the pool is really pretty cool. Pools 2 big heated nice during a Dec Jan stay pools a smaller 3d floor pool not sure if it is heated and a hot tub insure you can find a quiet spot to relax. The Pool Concierges will set up your lounger get an umbrella put a bucket of ice water by your chairs and make you comfortable. Le Blanc recently added cushions to the loungers which make them very comfy. Polside wait service is outstanding. Le Blanc has added a bar at the main pool on the opposite side of the swim up bar that cuts turn time for the wait staff dramatically during high season. Bring sunscreen sunscreen prices in Mexico are 30 40 higher than in the US. thanks WalMart. Le Blanc guests have been leaving sunscreen as they leave. The staff has these at the towel hut in a basket for folks to use if they forget theirs. The pool beach towels are big and fluffy. Beach. The beach is big beautiful and clean. The Beach Concierges will set up your lounger and set up a beach umbrella in your optimal location. In the winter months the beach gets the most direct sun. The shadow of the building blocks direct sun at the main pool around 230. The sand is raked sea weed is raked up buried. There are cabanas available to buy for the day using resort credits. There is a lifeguard on station. Spa. The Spa is wonderful. Lots of options once again listed on the Le Blanc Ap or ask me. Prices are a bit steep but a portion of your resort credits can be used to offset the sticker shock. The quality is outstanding. Spa hydro therapy including hot cold Jacuzi \u2019s and sauna \u2019s are available to all even if you do not have a spa appointment. The Spa facilities are immaculate. High end shaving and hygiene products are provided. Resort Credits. Lots of misunderstanding with these this is a \u201c frequent flyer \u201d on Trip Advisor reviews usually negative. Resort Credits usually 150 for a week \u2019s stay lower if staying less than a week more if longer than a week can be used proportionally in the Spa on site 3d party jewelry store upgrade wines gift shop massive 22 24 oz. steaks tours tequila cigars and fancy beach cabanas. Mexican law though you have to pay 16 tax on what you spend in resort credits. This is a sales tax I checked it out. It is in no way shape or form a scam isolated to Mexico or Palace. It is the local government getting its due. If you feel this is a scam read a hotel receipt from the US or EU there is a similar tax there as well example. Chicago various taxes add up to a total of 18 on a hotel bill. If you do not want to pay the tax do not use the credits. If you do not like the prices do not buy the service. My wife and I used resort credits to have several 80 min couples massages for 67 USD ea the tax. You can not get a massage like that in a high quality spa for that amount of money. We were at Le Blanc this past time 16 \u2013. 25 Dec The hotel was at 90 occupancy. We never waited for a table a pool lounger or anything. There was never a shortage of staff there is a high almost 1 1 ratio of staff to guests. Tipping. yes I tip all the time. I tip not because I think it brings better service but we feel it shows that we appreciate the hard work the Le Blanc Team Members do for my wife and me. I wish to recognize and reward their hard work. It is not required. If you wish to have an eye opening event google minimum wage in the Yucatan. Rooms Le Blanc rooms are nice spotless and comfortable in a minimalist style. Alas it would be nice for every room to have full balconies only a couple of rooms per floor have a full balcony. I prefer the Jr Governor suites particularly on the lagoon side rooms ending with 24 or 26. These give you a view of both the ocean and the lagoon with a full balcony and a Juliet balcony. The lights of downtown Cancun Real Cancun are visible from the lagoon side. Around Christmas with lights on houses and hotels it is really a wonderful view. The upgrade is very reasonable for these Jr suites. Rooms ending in 26 have a couch that you can lie in looking at both the lagoon and ocean. Pretty cool. The higher the floor provides the best views. The Ocean view rooms get the sun rise the lagoon view rooms get the sunset. Both are outstanding. The king beds are super comfy with a nice comforter. The showers are nice really nice. The showerheads are actually above my head level I am 62. Each shower has two big showerheads with one having additional body soaker jets. The water pressure is excellent and the water gets really really hot. There is a Jacuzi tub in each room this is a Palace Resorts trademark. High end soaps and lotions are provided including toothpaste. A week \u2019s worth of soaps and lotions are provided they are not re stocked daily unles you ask. If you need more your butler will be happy to get you more. Your room is cleaned twice a day fresh towels are restocked twice a day. There is a nightly turn down service this is the 2d cleaning of your room and petite fours are provided. There is a flat screen TV with DVD player in every room. Your butler has movies you can borrow. Odd perk there is a TV imbedded in the mirror of the bathroom. I initially thought this was weird ok very weird and then it was pointed out that you could watch a World Cup game football game baseball game whatever while taking a bath \u2013 ok marginally less weird. There is a hair dryer curling iron iron ironing board. scale why a scale Le Blanc. and an umbrella in each room as well as slippers and robes. The robes actually fit a big person. There is a safe in the room. Le Blanc is an international hotel so you can find stations in Spanish English Japanese and German or French. Daily excerpts of the NY Times are provided. I have really grown to like reading this excerpt every day although the crossword puzzle tends to frustrate my wife. Wireless is outstanding. I had a better signal at the pool than in the room. We are not big drinkers but Top Shelf is available at the bars and in your room if you wish. Check out Extra Aniejo Tequila 3 or 5 year aged really nice sipping not shots drink. 3 fingers over a ice cube or two will put a smile on your face also proves you know a little something about Tequila. Nightly entertainment is low key. This is not a spring break party resort. The Cancun club area is walking distance away. If you are looking for a loud party till you drop wet t shirt kind of place do not come to Le Blanc. Around the holidays Palace has sponsored shows. Last year it was an amazing Cirque de Soleil show. This year it was Broadway on Ice. These shows take place at Moon Palace and are included with your stay along with transportation to and from. Shows this spring 15 are Classic 80 \u2019s rock bands. Palace has had some big names in the recent past including Shakira and Ricky Martin. The Arena at Moon Palace is a really nice set up. Shows and activities are posted on a board by the elevators and a hard copy placed in your room daily. We have not seen it but everyone raves about the Palace Michael Jackson Show. Palace Membership You will be asked to take the membership sales talk. As I stated before we are Palace Elite members. We agreed to the member update this past visit as the incentive was to allow all of the 200 USD resort credit in the Spa normally there is a restriction that you can only use about 30 of the resort credit total in the spa. Palace Membership is a personal decision it has good perks but again it is a personal decision that is not the best for everyone. If you are interested in becoming a member agree to the time you will receive some amount of resort credits the amount can be negotiated to a point or tours. The presentation is 90 minutes and it is a pitch from a very professional sales team they are good. They will ask you to go to another resort such as Moon or Beach Palace. In the past the requests to hear the membership talk occasionally was repetitive and got annoying. This was not at all the case this last visit and it is not showing up as a \u201c frequent flyer \u201d in recent reviews on Trip Advisor. We had a very very very bad meeting with the sales team in Playacar a couple of years ago thankfully the team that runs out of the Cancun area is very professional and pleasant to deal with. Again I am happy to answer any questions you have about membership just drop me a note. I noticed in one earlier review where the reviewer stated that member rates could be beaten on Expedia or Travelocity. I tried finding weekly rates better on Trivago Kayak Expedia and Travelocity and I could not find any so I \u2019m not sure what that reviewer was looking. I have found that member rates are 100 200 hundred dollars cheaper than \u201c off the street \u201d rates depending on the season. Membership also receives transportation to and from the hotel. At Le Blanc this is a private Lincoln Navigator. This is really nice after the hustle and bustle of the flight customs immigration and the chaos of the transportation area of the Cancun airport seeing the driver in the Le Blanc butler uniform of black with a white striped vest holding a card with your name on it is the blissful start of the relaxation. Le Blanc is about 20 min from the airport on the northern side of the Hotel Zone. Membership also includes a program that allows you to exchange Palace weeks for weeks at participating hotels world wide at a fixed rate through an organization called RCI or the new one II. We have not used these yet but plan to use it extensively when we retire. Other stuff Palace has a charitable foundation Palace Foundation supporting social welfare and ecological programs and a very active recycle reuse program. President George W Bush stayed in Le Blanc during a Latin American Trade Meeting during his time in office. Le Blanc is close to 3 large shopping malls two are walking distance or a short cab drive away. High end goods are generally the same or a little cheaper than in the US. You save money in tax if you are from a high tax area. Cancun does have a tax back program. It refunds a portion of VAT Taxes paid on items. You need paper work from the point of sale and you turn it in at the Airport just beyond Buba Gumps in the departure area. It takes a couple of weeks but the refund eventually is posted. Driving You can now rent a car from Palace. In the past you either had to rent at the airport or visit one of the satellite rental offices around Cancun. Palace offers Jeep products and the rate is better than 90 of the various companies in the area. This was a giant pain in the butt. The biggest benefit is there are no games \u201c requiring \u201d you to buy additional comprehensive insurance nor having to put a deposit down in the thousands range. The deposit at the cheaper rentals at the airport is 500 USD on your credit cardthink of the challenge to your credit limit. Palace is 500 USD on your credit card. In the other rental places renters are told that additional insurance is required by Mexican law it is not. Palace will bring your rental to Le Blanc and pick it up there. No need to use a microscope looking for damage on your walk around although taking cell phone pictures of all 4 sides of a rental is a good habit to get into. Driving in the Mexican Rivera is easy. There is a main road which runs from Cancun down to Playa De Carmen and beyond to Tulem beautiful sea side Mayan ruins \u2013 seen on many travel posters. MX 307 is a good well cared for road comparable with a State Road in the US. Signs are in Spanish but are easily understood. Distances are in KM. An easy conversion from miles to KM is double the KM number and divide by 3 to give you the distance in miles 11 KM x 2 is 22 3 is just over 7 miles. I have never had an incident with a Mexican Police Officer doing what is called in Chicago a \u201c shake down \u201d. There are many stories about friends of friends that had a bad experience but I have never had direct contact with anyone that it happened to. I have been driving in Mexico for over 30 years and never had a bad situation. I always drive the speed limit never ever ever drink and drive and always drive conservatively obeying the speed limits. Traffic even down town Cancun is easier than in Chicago for example. Driving is an easy way to get to the attractions such as Tulum Chichen Itza Xel Ha Xcaret or XPlor popular tourist attractions or Akumal a relatively shallow bay where you can swim snorkle dive with sea turtles without signing up for a tour at the cost of parking by the dive shop 40 pesos without having to conform your schedule to a bus schedule or tour schedule. If you are in trouble seek out a Federal Police Officer. They are like State Police in the US. Travel Tips. Traveling in Mexico specifically and Latin America in general if you \u201c Lead with a smile you will be be received with a smile \u201d then \u201c treat others as you yourself wish to be treated \u201c and finally \u201c connect with a person before moving to content \u201d usually brings win \u2013 win results. Your attitude drives the attitude of the interaction. Cancun is safe very safe data wise it has fewer incidents than the area around Disney World per capita. Cancun is easy to get to with most flights from the US less than 4 hours. There are lots of flights and they are inexpensive. It is cheaper to fly from Chicago to Cancun business class that it is to fly from Chicago to Antigua coach. The USD is very strong to the MX Peso right now so it is even more cost effective to travel to Cancun. Long review \u2013 thanks for reading it. Please feel free to drop me a note with questions or complaints \u263a. The first time you stay at Le Blanc can be overwhelming with so many sights sensations hitting you like a wave. We are at the point where we see the small details that all come together for the outstanding big picture. Note on recognition of Team Members It is tough to single out individuals when the whole team is outstanding. But there is an incentive program for team members that are recognized so take notes. I recognize employees in a separate note to Sr Schmidt. The management of this hotel should be commended for what they have built. They provide a truly outstanding travel experience. Thank You Le Blanc Team.", "offset": [3820, 3951], "date": "2015-01-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "90ba82ee-7eba-4547-92ee-9ea5c4875d84", "sentence": "Best. Vacation. Ever. This Hotel is the finest in Cancun but also the finest I have stayed in on any vacation ever. The service is beyond compare the amenities second to none the food was varied and outstanding and despite it being spring break week for college kids the tranquility was never compromised from the clamor in the nearby hotels. 6 star resort all inclusive and my apologies to my children no kids allowed.

Andy and I have just returned from our 2nd visit to this hotel we did not think that they could exceed our previous experience but they have. Staff are welcoming and friendly nothing is too much effort for them. it is the little touches that make all the difference like coming in all hot and sticky from a hard days shopping to be greeted by an ice cold flannel served up on a silver platter smelling of aromatherapy oils. Our thanks for great service to our Butlers Jesus and Juan to Javier Alexander and Victor waiters at the small pool bar. Alexander gave us a lesson in Tequila and what to look out for. The food is lovely especially the Italian Restaurant our favourite and the International Restaurant for breakfast and lunch. we were not so ken on the Asian but that is more down to our taste than the quality of the food. Rooms were clean and well stocked we even had a mini bar in the room which is included in the All Inclusive cover. Free wifi and surprisingly also free calls to the UK and other countriesWe did spend some time on the beach which has beautiful white sand and loads of loungers for guests to use but preferred to sunbathe around the smaller pool I think this may have been the Lagoon pool as it was quiet and easier to take a quick dip if you get too hot. And there is nothing like swimming up to the bar for a drink. You do not need to take any towels with you as they are provided in abundancethere is a well stocked gym which is a good size and there are also classes available. Andy and I both had a lovely massage each which was very relaxing. If you do get a bit hot and want to take a rest from the sun then you can just hop on a bus outside the hotel for 1 each each way. there is the La Isla shopping centre which is quite high end clothing and there is also the Kukulcan Shopping Mal for lower priced goods. Would definitely recommend this resort to anyone looking for a quiet relaxing getawaythere is only 2 things that I can think of that could be improved on and they are both minor1. The Spa should have a couples area for men and women to use together. At present they are separated so if you go as a couple you have to each use a different area which stopped us from using this facility2. Last time we went the TV had quite a few English speaking channels on it. This time they were mostly in Spanish which was a shame. there is not a massive amount to do in the evenings so it is nice to be able to sit in the huge Jacuzi bath filled with bubbles in your room and watch TVIt was a fantastic holiday and we can not wait for the new Le Blanc hotel to open up in Cabos so that we can try it next year.", "offset": [2121, 2257], "date": "2015-06-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "91fda115-7494-4068-9598-70eddf0a3839", "sentence": "Best Luxury Resort in Cancun. We have stayed at seven different resorts and visited several others in Quintana Ro Mexico and LeBlanc is clearly the most luxurious with the best service of any we have seen. When you check in you are assigned your own private butler who will do anything from book your spa appointments and excursions to unpack your suitcases. The entire staff re defines service. As an example when I asked for a towel at the pool the attendant insisted on helping me find a lounge chair spreading the towel over the chair and finding me a pillow to prop up my head. This resort is more quiet and relaxing than most with classical live music in the lobby each evening and a pleasant lack of loud music at the pool during the day.

My wife and I just recently returned from our Honeymoon where we spent 3 nights at Le Blanc. This was my wife and I \u2019s 3rd trip together to an all inclusive Cancun Resort. I proposed to her last year in Cancun and we thought it would be fitting to have our honeymoon in Cancun. Since it was our honeymoon we opted to stay at the so called 1 resort in Cancun. It was much more expensive that any other resort I have ever stayed at in Cancun but what the heck it was our honeymoon. Over my lifetime I personally have stayed at seven different Cancun area all inclusive resorts and never before have I had such a BAD experience as this last trip at Le Blanc. Upon checking in we were presented with a warm towel to go around our necks and a champagne glass of a milky rum drink tasted like Rumchata Liquor. My wife and I are living the good life at this point. Then the front desk employee states that our room is not ready yet and she would like to introduce us to another person that will discuss with us how the hotel credit system works. She explains that we get 500 to spend at the resort and all we have to do is pay the 17 taxes on whatever we spend of that 500 \u2026. So if we spent the entire 500 USD we would have to pay 85 in \u201c Taxes \u201d. At the time we were like \u201c ok we will keep that in mind \u201d. I will elaborate more on what a scam this is later in my review. Next the same lady that is explaining the resort credit starts showing us on a map all of the other hotels that are owned by Palace Resorts and said she would like to send us to one of the other locations for an \u201c hour and a half sales presentation \u201d aka \u201c Time Share \u201d. We stated that we were only staying the three nights at LeBlanc and questioned why would we want to leave the hotel to attend a \u201c sales presentation \u201d. My wife and I informed them We would like to pass on that. But the sales woman WOULD NOT take \u201c NO \u201d for an answer. She then stated she would pay for a car to bring us there and back we said \u201c no thank you \u201d \u2026. then she stated you know those hotel credits we just discussed well \u2026 what do you want. Spa Dinner on the Beach Lobster at dinner she would get it for us for no credits all we had to do is attended this \u201c sales presentation \u201d. We once again replied \u201c NO if we want one of those things we will use the credits \u201d. She then states that because she likes us she will pull some stings and get us into the sales presentation at Le Blanc tomorrow instead of at their sister resort. We still stated \u201c NO NO NO \u201d. but like I said she would not take no for an answer. As we were waiting for our room to be ready we walked around the hotel to check it out. We were really aggravated due to the unrelenting time share sales pitch but decided to have a drink with the intention of putting the horrible check in experience behind us. We finally got our room bags were already in the room. We had a great dinner that night at one of the three restaurants we did n\u2019t have to make a reservation for dinner like you do at some other resorts. Ah finally we are back on track to have a great Honeymoon. After dinner we headed back to our room where we were welcomed by the sound of extremely loud running water. We had the \u201c Honeymoon Hot Tub Room \u201d all of these rooms are on top of each other with a little bit of the tub andor plumbing extending into the ceiling of our room. It was loud and we could hear the people in it above us over the sound of running water and the water jets. I actually took a video of it because I could not believe what I was hearing. We ended up not even using ours do to the fact we did not want to disturb any other guests like the people above us did to my wife and I The following morning we were awakened by our very loud room telephone. I was still half asleep but I mustered up just enough effort to answer it \u2019s the damn Time Share people again stating that the next presentation will be in 30 minutes. I stated once again we were not here for that and that we told the lady at check in we would not go to the presentation and we ARE NOT going to it. I hang up the phone and try to fall back asleep. But now my blood starts to boil once again and I ca n\u2019t get back to sleep. So my wife and I about an hour after the call head down to have breakfast at the buffet. As soon as we walk though the lobby we once again are haggled about attending the \u201c Time Share Sales Presentation \u201d at this point I just about had it. We kept saying \u201c No No No \u201d maybe they did n\u2019t understand due to the language barier. oh wait \u201c NO \u201d in Spanish is \u201c NO\u201d lol For the last two days of our trip my wife and I did everything we could to avoid the lobby area of the hotel. We did not go on our honeymoon to attend a Time Share Presentation. After breakfast we head to the pool. We have a drink and are soaking up the sun when shortly after we are greeted by an employee of the hotel doing a survey. She asks if we had dinner last night in one of the restaurants and a series of other general questions regarding the hotel. But then she asks \u201c and how was the check in process \u201d we go on to tell her the story listed above and ONCE AGAIN it gets us mad just telling the story. She states she will make a note of it. Then while hanging out in the pool guests are either complaining about this check in experience or they were members of the Time share program. One person told me he had to buy in for 1000 USD and he has to pay a 200 maintenance fee a year but then he gets to stay for \u201c free \u201d for one week a year. Another told me that he did go to the \u201c sales meeting \u201d at the sister resort and they kept him for over 2 \u00bd hours and that he had to get very loud and mad in order for them to allow him to leave. Speaking of the pool the first day they had relaxing new age type music playing throughout the pool area the next day NO music. Without the music we got the pleasure of hearing frequent jet noise from above constant tour helicopters going by the beach as well as the small planes pulling banner advertisements NOT very relaxing. On our final full day we finally ran into our hotel \u2019s floor butler. He asks us how our stay is going I reply \u201c good \u201d. He then goes into more detail questioning \u201c did you have dinner in one of the restaurants last night \u201d. but then he asked THE question \u201c and how was you check in experience \u201d \u2026. So we once again have to tell the story of our awful check in experience just to hear him say that he \u2019s sorry and that he hears that a lot. During our 3 night stay we noticed how run down this hotel is and how it is in need of maintenance. Please refer to my pictures. Here you will see the filthy bottom of the pool with black mold growing throughout the tile. It is all over the entire pool. It was disgusting to walk on and was easily removable with just a pool towel and minor scrubbing. Also empty glasses from the bar were left on the pool ledge for hours. While at the pool I started off ordering beer but after the first two came and were maybe a degree colder than room temperature I switched to frozen drinks. We also noticed holes in our blackout drapes as seen in my picture and at first I was like \u201c that \u2019s weird \u201d but on the second day I believe I found the culprit. Our room had moths as seen in another one of my picturesWith the hotel motif of all white the hotel needs to do a better job of keeping it all white. We noticed dirty white drapes though out the common areas. Even the palm trees look like someone painted the bases white about 10 years ago and the trees have been subject to many years of hurricane damage. a quick paint job could fix thisWhen entering the hotel from the upper pool area there is a door that has a handle that comes off when used. I could n\u2019t believe it the handle just was hanging there for who knows how long. as seen in my picturesAlso in my pictures check out the great paint job around the shower in our room that we had the pleasure to stare at whenever we would use the bathroom. Looks like a 6 year old painted it. Also the shower vent was broken. On one of the nights we got to see a Michael Jackson Impersonation show. I believe this was the same show my wife and I have seen at another Cancun Hotel. But at Le Blanc I felt really bad for the guy. They had him perform in a little bar at the hotel that did not even have a stage. So the poor guy is performing and we all had to make a half circle around him. The music for the show sounded like it came from the house sound system in the ceiling speakers with no bass at all. The show was very poorly lit with 25 lights you could probably find at your local party supply store. The Hotel Credit System We go to dinner and learn we can add a 6 oz lobster tail for 90 all we would have to do is pay is the 17 tax that comes out to a little more that 15 USD for a lobster tail you can pick up at your local grocery store for about 7 \u2026 Or you can get a fancier bottle of wine and only pay the taxes. Who gets these taxes. From what I saw everything that you would have to pay 17 tax for was still more than you should have to pay for something. Why nickel and dime your guests. If you are going to give them a credit give them a credit do n\u2019t charge them for using it. RidiculousThis Hotel is FAR from a five star resort. In my opinion it is more like a run down 3 star hotel trying to act like a 5 star resort. If for some reason you still decide to stay at this hotel let the iMac computers in the lobby be a foreshadow of what to expect at this hotel. The iMac \u2019s are running Windows software. They are trying to be something they are not just like Le Blanc is pretending to be a five star resort. One last thing if someone books the Honeymoon package like we did maybe it would be nice to acknowledge it with a card or something stating \u201c Happy Honeymoon we hope you enjoy it \u201d. But no NOTHING at all was done the only thing we received for that higher priced room was a loud hot tub. The only thing holding me back from giving this a 1 star rating is the fact that the dinners we had were nice and we did like the fact it was adults only. But we will defiantly NOT be returning to Le Blanc or any of the Palace resorts. Absolutely NOT worth the money. My lesson learned is that if something costs more than all the rest it definitely does not mean that it is the best. My suggestion is try ANY other resort than Le Blanc or it \u2019s sister hotels. and you will be better off or at least saving money.", "offset": [4305, 4455], "date": "2015-07-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "a984fbcb-5f22-49fa-8f6f-e571e2858600", "sentence": "Excellent resort tremendous service one of kind. Romantic getaway for couples. My wife and I visit LeBlanc every year this is our fourth visit and we have contemplated visiting other locations but the combination of the location amenities and frankly the service bring us back to Leblanc. There are other hotels in Cancun and I am sure some have tremendous infrastructures but there is a reason Leblanc is rated the best in Cancun the reason is the staff and the service. Our stay in Leblanc was marked as always by the staff working to make us happy in every regard. We had an issue during check in regarding our room being upgraded and Fernando Rojas front desk Mgr. took care of the issue without question. I commend him for his professionalism and prompt service. Now if you are going to LeBlanc I recommend you ask for Tomas as your butler. Tomas was amazing he took care of everything from pressing our clothes spa and dinner reservations to printing our boarding passes before we left. I can say Tomas is one of the reasons we book our trips yearly to Leblanc and he should be commended for his excellent serviceWeding RenewalWe renewed our wedding vows something we do yearly and the team starting with Elizabeth the wedding coordinator were amazing. We had our favorite Pastor Pinto and had a very romantic ceremony on the back pool gazebo at sunset. We had booked a romantic dinner on the beach and the wedding team on their own. asked if they could do something special for us. We agreed and they set us up with a private dinner facing the ocean with rose petals lining the floor special lighting and our own waiter Fausto who by the way was spectacular. It really touches us to think they would go out of their way to do something special without prompting. FodOriental is amazing sushi taste great soup basically you can not go wrong. The chef worked to make our meals special and the restaurant has had a makeover which is very romantic and tastefully done. Antonio the mgr. really works hard to please you and his joy shows by how his team treats you. ItalianThis restaurant was good very beautiful the quality of the food was on par to last year. FrenchThe French restaurant was one of our favorites. Please remember you have to make a reservation to dine there. I highly recommend upgrading to the lobster and combining it with the filet mignon. The desert is one of the highlights of the meal enjoyMediteranean The food is really good I recommend asking for something that is not on the menu aka something really Mexican the chef will take care of you. Marcos the mgr. overheard me saying I really wanted something Mexican and he went out of his way to get a special dish made. Gustavo is an excellent waiter if you are there ask for him he will take care of you. Any issues in the main restaurant see Pablo and the chef Serviano will serve you up something special ask him for his shrimp special. he is a tremendous chef look him up. Now please understand this hotel is for couples and really laid back if you want something fast paced with a lot of activities do not book here you will not like it. If you are looking for a relaxing environment where you can bond with your significant other and meet other couples who are there for the same thing then this is for you. I truly believe this hotel offers the best of both worlds you are close the action if you want to go to the clubs shopping etc. but when you enter the hotel it is peace relaxation and the best service you can imagine. The spa is amazing you can do the hydrotherapy which I highly recommend. Claudia in the spa did a great job for us as did Carina and Laura by the pool is one of the nicest hardest working people you can meet. You will read about Guilermo at the lobby bar stop by and meet him you will understand what a gem he is. Xiomara in the spa is your go to person if you have an issue with reservations etc. see her she will get it done. I have read other review and I am curious as to what happened to some of those guests trust me at the price point of this hotel you should place tremendous scrutiny in the reviews. I can tell you the service staff will work with you and tips are from your heart it does not define them they are all thankful and gracious to the customers. Es un placed it is my pleasure. is there catch phrase and they mean it. Here are our two critiques. The membership presentation has become over the top and we are members. The presentation was too pushy. One of the sellers named Alex even asked us to sign a paper telling us we would n\u2019t get the deal again when we did n\u2019t upgrade how silly is that. Why do we have to sign a paper. It is insulting to use this tacky and ridiculous ploy which of course we declined. I voiced my concerns to management and informed them how the presentation could sour a potential member \u2019s opinion not only about joining but about the resort as a whole. Lastly they were upgrading guests from their other hotels which is unfair to those who paid the extra amount to stay at LeBlanc. We expressed that to management team. All in all it was amazing as always if you want a special vacation in an amazing five star resort with once in a lifetime service this is the place for you. book it get spoiled and enjoy.", "offset": [3717, 3821], "date": "2015-08-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "34e8e5cd-8f5a-40a8-822b-542eb69f3558", "sentence": "Can Paradise be improved on.

If you have the 150 resort credit for your stay I suggest you email their vacation planner at least a week before your visit at marketinglbcleblancsparesortscom. They will send you the detailed spa excursion programs where you could book all the things you want to do before you arrive. That will save you a lot of time. Please note that you do have to pay 16 tax out of your pocket when you use the resort credit. That is 240 extra should you use up the 150 resort credit. The resort will send their marketing guy to attend their sales presentation about how to become a member of the resort. They are very persistent and will call you look for you continuously which can be very annoying. Since I know there is no way of getting around it I arranged to listen to the presentation on my second day. Get it done and get it over with so you can enjoy the rest of your vacation. The sales presentation takes 90 mins and make sure you time it or it can really drag on. After the presentation I was given a complimentary tax included Romantic Dinner for two which was supposedly worth 500 if you use the resort credit. You are seated in a cabana near the beach but unfortunately it started to rain when we were having our entree. The rain went through the top cover and into our food. No one came to tell us what we were to suppose to do or offer an umbrella for us to get inside the resort. We were wet by the time we abandoned our ship. I mentioned to the concierge and he was apologetic. I do not understand why they did not place an umbrella in each cabana as the weather there can be very unpredictable. That was quite a romantic evening. Be sure to check out and use their Hydro Facility which is complimentary. Let the staff guide you through every step of the way to fully enjoy the facility. This is one resort that you really do not have to leave the facility except of course the beach. Forget about the shopping strip outside the resort which was very rowdy and crowded.

Let me tell you our trip was over the edge absolutely amazing. It was even better than our Diamond adventure. the only thing missing on this trip were our diamond friends. Private transportation to from the airport and in car check in perfect. They even arranged for our welcome drink of choice to be waiting for us. While our room was not ready. yes we had an early morning flight that arrived early. so it was not unexpected. Still the room was ready BEFORE 3 the promised time. and I received an email letting me know it was ready. I could say so much about so many and I know I will leave people out. It was really unexpected but the Diamond Concierge Roger actually remembered us. He was one of the first people we saw. Even though we were not traveling as Diamond he welcomed us and always acknowledged us when he saw us. That was a really special touchAny one who knows me knows on Vay Cay I always workout. The gym is amazing. Amber and Yasel are so kind. They start their day and 6 and they are there at 6. I would do my morning TM run and then follow it up with Paddle Board Yoga in the main pool and then hit Aqua Spinning in the other pool. After that it was total RR for us hanging out drinking the drinks and eating the food. we have done the shopping and done the trips so pool side we just were in veg mode. Our spot was ready for us. Laura is the go to pool girl. She is a total energizer bunny. We were serenaded pool side for our anniversary by pool server Jorge such a kind soul. Mayra was a fabulous waitress as well. We did get to meet Naomi in public relations. No matter what happened she wanted to make sure our stay was ALWAYS perfect which it was. But she was fun and engaging and not intrusive. At the pool bar there was a young man who is was a trainee he had an interesting name but just said call me Billy Joel. He was learning how to make MY drink the frozen blueberry. One of the waitresses Jeanete so sweet talked him through how I wanted it made. So the lobby bar if you want a fabulous Martini just ask Francisco. The reset of the crew is amazing. I have never given a shout out to a spa reservation maker vacation planner but Marco was awesome. He did what we needed but he did it quickly and he was fun and nice and was great to work withAs I said. this was our second trip the the food is over the edge amazingly so much better. We attended the Chefs dinner and were able to meet and speak with Chef Vilafana such a likable guy. he is all about organic fresh fodWe did the French restaurant twice. Absolutely amazing both times. Loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well. Our first night waiter Rudolfo everyone ask for himAlex was the in charge guy at the Italian restaurant everything is top notch there. And Alex you have a great guy who will be up and coming Jesus. He was greatSadly I did not take names at the Asian restaurant. but both times we were there we loved itOur room was perfect. Our concierges Joel and Alex were attentive without being overbearing. They are there for you however you want their assistance. Massages and facial great as always. As far as a deep tissue massage goes ask for Marta she knows exactly what she is doing but be prepared to breathe. She will get the areas that NEED to be worked and find a few more.

They came by often to ask if we wanted anything to drink and we also were able to order lunch on the beach. The vendors walked past us on the beach without bother. Antonio our butler was helpful in answering our questions and the nightly turn down service was very relaxing after a nice dinner out. We ate at each of the 5 restaurants.

During our sales presentation we were offered special discounts discounted weeks to the new Le Blanc Los Cabos a free week at Le Blanc Cancun etc. Needless to say my wife and I were excited to return as soon as possible. I started calling their Elite line to make my reservations in November to make a reservation. It is now January and after 20 hours of effort on my part emailing calling and attempting to make a booking on their elite website I have finally given up and disputed the charges with my credit card company. Their website does not work at all. When you try and make a booking using your special discount it fails to complete the booking and then freezes the discount for 24 hours until the system magically corrects itself. Even if you call they will tell you there is nothing they can do. Calling in I was even more frustrated. They told me that I would have to pay 150 extra to use my free week at Cancun despite an addendum stating that we got it for free. They even sent us an email to offer us the same addendum we had already signed like they were doing us a generous favor. When I tried booking for Los Cabos instead the dates were magically not available anymore. When I revised my dates I was told that my discount did not apply. Today when I spent an hour and a half on the call trying to get the situation rectified they finally agreed that my special discount did apply but they could not honor my preferential rate. My preferential rate was somehow higher than the price offered on their website despite the contract saying that it was 20 off of the final price on their website. So my preferential rate is less than what I get on their website. What a scamI could have been on vacation for 3 days instead of spending 3 days stressed out by the Palace team.

My wifes favourite restaurant in the evening was the Asia which was brilliantly run by supervisor Antonieta. On our second visit the staff all lined up to welcome us and escort us to a prime table laden with rose petals followed by a special meal served by chef Jonathon. The waiters Rubicel German Luis Angelica and Alejandro all played their part in making us feel welcome and special never had such attention before in a hotel. When we arrived at the entrance to Asia hostess Corina always made us feel welcome with her warm and friendly greetings. For us Antonieta was a star and epitomised the level of service we received at Le Blanc. I am sure she will progress within the organisation. The International French and Italian restaurants all provided similar experiences and made evening mealtime a pleasure. There was a good choice of drinks in the bars the one exception the lack of a good brandy which was only available in the restaurants. ALL IN ALL A GREAT HOLIDAY experience thanks to you all.", "offset": [2032, 2152], "date": "2018-04-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "7b14cda5-f68f-42d6-a66d-92868fa4a175", "sentence": "Le Blanc is an absolutely outstanding resort.

If you are looking for total relaxation 1 on 1 time with your travel partner this is the place. If you are looking for activities go elsewherePros Space. This 260 room resort felt un crowded at full capacity. Service. Le Blanc has a high ratio of staff to guest offer service with authentic smiles Layout A variety of comfortable lounges seating areas are arranged so you feel you are in your own private space Shade. Lounges by the pools on the beach have umbrellas canopies trees for plenty of shade Sol Pool Elevated on the first floor provides a nice Ocean view breze Fitness Center. Very well equipped with a variety of machines free weights foam rollers balance balls etc. Towels water snacks are provided. This is one of the nicest gyms I \u2019ve seen at a resort Room Our Royal Honeymoon Suite had the configuration we wanted with the tub NOT in front of the window the room was one level. The room was nice not huge not small plenty of space for our stuff good A C good shower pressure plenty of electrical outlets USB chargers. The bed was a very comfortable Tempur Pedic foam matres Meals. No crowds no waits no reservations except for 1 restaurant. The food was OK to very good. Vegetarians may need to make special requests the chef will be happy to make adjustments Spa. Free guided hydrotherapy is a must do if you like saunas steam rooms whirl pools relaxing loungers. The spa itself is very relaxing with sounds lighting. The layout can be tricky for those with walking impairment. Treatments are way overpriced. I used the 250 maximum allowed resort spa credits towards a facial which made my out of pocket fees about what I would normally pay for a facial Ocean. The colors are beautiful the water is warm crystal clear when there was no seaweed. The ocean floor is soft sand there can be waves to body surf. Alcohol. The Lobby Cavo bar will have most any top shelf drink you desire. Cons Activities. No water sports no pool games no beach games no disco. You \u2019re on your own Entertainment Evenings in the lobby bar was a singer or duet 1980s era live or recorded music in the Cavo bar. Luna pool On the lagoon side it was lovely but the air had a foul odor from the lagoon or a septic system. The aqua spin class is held here but it was too smelly for me to try it Ocean. Cancun has serious seaweed problems that come go. Tractors clear the beach every morning but some days the seaweed is non stop. The surf can be rough the ocean floor has sudden drop offs. If you do n\u2019t have years of ocean swimming experience it can be very dangerous Resort Credit. You get \u201c resort credits \u201d for your stay. You are charged a 16 out of pocket redemption fee. Amenities eg spa treatments or beach cabana are ridiculously over priced but once you apply resort credit your out of pocket fee is what you might pay for such a thing at home. Why not have reasonable fees to start out with. Obviously this marketing game works to their advantage. Summary. In my younger days I craved activity day night I would have been bored to tears at this resort. If you crave an up scale quite service oriented vacation you \u2019l probably feel you got your moneys worth staying here. It is a very nice resort.", "offset": [745, 925], "date": "2019-07-21", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "8d9b5d1a-972f-4076-a037-f4ea66479370", "sentence": "Service food location accommodations. all amazingly fantastic.
