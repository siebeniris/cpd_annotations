We had a terrible welcoming experience at the Holiday Inn so we googled and found this hotel for only 70 dollars more. Itwaswortheverypeny. The hotel is located in perhaps the best spot in DC. So many great restaurants and shops around and a good 15 20 minute walk to the White House and the National Mall. My family and I never really minded the walk because the stay was so great. Upon check in we were given warm hand towels to refresh our hands. The front lobby service was amazing and so were the doormen they were all incredibly sweet and more than professional. Definitely a warm ambiance. The hotel room was beyond amazing. The floors in the bathroom are heated and the beds are real comfy. We had a great nights sleep and were never disturbed by any noise. they have a popular bar restaurant that is always packed but you can never hear the noise from your rooms. They provide bathrobes and slippers as well. The housekeepers do a FABULOUS job at cleaning your rooms and leaving your stuff neat and organized. They are very thoughtful and swift with any requests that you might have. Overall the aesthetics of the room and the hotel itself were lovely. Mind you I have been to DC over 6 times and this beats all the other hotels I have ever stayed at. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great experience.", "offset": [110, 228], "date": "2015-03-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f98b3966-7d10-4805-b498-45bceebe5e25", "sentence": "Short city break.

My daughter and I stayed at The Dupont Circle Hotel while visiting town for college tours. Having never stayed in this part of DC I booked a good rate. Front desk staff and doormen were very pleasant and helpful. Our room was not quite ready so we went to lunch and received a courtesy call when the room became available. The room was quite small and the door nearly hit the bed when opened. Room was clean and functional and at the rate we got was worth it. However make sure you ask for a higher floor. We were on the third floor facing Starbucks and Kramerboks Afterwords Cafe. Besides street cleaning not complaining DC is quite clean. food deliveries must have commenced between 430 and 5 am Noisily too. Being a light sleeper this was quite a hassle. Unfortunately the lobby fireplace had a fire and we had to evacuate until the fire was put out and the fire department gave the all clear. We were escorted up a staff stairwell with an iPhone light to our rooms once we were allowed in. Not sure we would have been able to find this again if we had to re evacuate.", "offset": [627, 685], "date": "2016-02-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "86a65be7-50ab-4b5d-872c-1903803dfcec", "sentence": "Travel Surprise. Checked into a Room Already Occupied. Let me start with a positive note this hotel is in a great neighborhood. Now on to more colorful travel tales. My experience here started by getting a room key that did not open the door. Not a particularly good omen but no matter one should give a second chance especially when every other hotel room in DC is booked. Returning to the front desk I was informed that I was given the wrong room and then given the room next door. Imagine my delight when I put in the room key and got the green light to enter. Delight turned to dismay however when I noticed a pair of fluffy socks on the bed and a suitcase already in the corner of the room. The only thing that could have added to this scene was a naked person emerging from the bathroom alas fortunately both and I the occupant of this room were spared that encounter. Back down to the reception desk. Third time was a charm and the service was much more pleasant with this new person now working the desk. Finally got settled in my room which was comfortable and was delighted to find heated floors in the bathroom and nobody else in the room but me. Next morning I met a woman in the lobby who complained to me that she hardly slept because light poured in through the blinds at daybreak. She complained to the hotel of the poor design of the blinds and told them they should provide eye masks. She also complained of the damp smell in the lobby and she did have a good point there. All in all it was OK at this hotel and I survived to write this review. However a couple of week later I received surprise 2. The hotel charged my credit card for my stay. This was after I had already pre paid for my stay through Expedia. I called Expedia and they were able to remove the charge after a bit of time on hold.", "offset": [696, 874], "date": "2016-07-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "62f78bb4-f580-41f6-910b-60a05b8917e1", "sentence": "1 Choice.

We chose to park across the street at the garage which was 38 for full weekend overnight a full Sunday. If you are out by 9 am it is cheaper. We went to lunch and the hotel called me informing me they had like to deliver a gift but my DND was on. I gave them permission to enter the room and arrived later to find they had gifted us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries complimentary.
