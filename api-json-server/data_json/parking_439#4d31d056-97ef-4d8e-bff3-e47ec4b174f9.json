There \u2019s a nice sized gym with good working equipment and outdoor track and also outdoor basketball and tennis courts. Room was smaller than I expected but very comfortable quiet. Location was perfect for our needs as Marta is literally across the street. We appreciated being able to leave our car in the parking garage and travel across Atlanta through Marta. The Cons Parking lot fills quickly and is expensive 30 a day on top of paying for your room. There \u2019s no pool which is hard to believe for a hotel this size. No one will tell you that. We had to ask after failing to find it. Elevator wait times can add up during busy times. Rooms were on the high size relative to size and what you have to pay for parking. Bottom Line.
