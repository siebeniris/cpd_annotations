We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for 2 weeks with our Pipe Band while playing at the Military tattoo that is held in Basel. The complex was spacious and had everything we could need. Lovely free breakfasts included was awesome for us. The pool and saunas were just ideal as we were having a heatwave and it was great to swim each day. However being part of a healthclub caused some problems with the regular goers who got in to wim lengths as we were there to enjoy and not be hard out swimming. However the pool attendants were very good and told the other health club people that as we were paying guests we were entitled to use it as much as they were. The rooms although not overly large were well equipedthere were over 40 of us and it was a bit of a rabbit warren to find everyone in the maze type halwaysthe only downside was on arrival we were all asked for 70 Euro bond each and most of our young guys did not not have this to spare. We have travelled extensively as a couple round the world and never been asked for this before. Luckily our tattoo consultant got this reversed for us as she guaranteed us.

I booked this hotel for a one night stay on a business trip. Although I travel often to Basel I usually stay in one of the hotels that is near the train station.

Note also that guests are not allowed to wear bathing suits in the sauna or steam bath which are not not unisex. I never complain about the size of hotel rooms but I must say that this was the most crowded room of any four star hotel I have ever seen. The king size bed literally took up virtually all of the room. There was no closet for hanging clothes only a bar with clothes hangers in the room. The \u201c desk \u201d was a small fold down table from a shelf on the wall. And there was a very small chair to go with the desk. When the desk was \u201c open \u201d it was very difficult to get from one side of the bed to the window on the other side without climbing on the bed. If there were two people staying in the room with a big suitcase it would be simply impossible to walk around in the room.
