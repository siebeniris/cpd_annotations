I stayed here two nights on business and had a good stay. The hotel is located in a nice business park area of Fairfax and is close to the mall restaurants and even a couple fast food places McDonalds and Chick Filet just down the street. For the Fairfax area the rates are very reasonable and the self parking is free. I stay in a lot of hotels on business and rate them as I would a similar hotel in its class ie a Hampton Inn could be 5 star against other Hamptons or in this case this Hyat I would rate 3 to 3 12. if they had that designation hence 3 star against other Hyats resorts excluded. The hotel looked modern and upscale from the exterior however once going inside my first impressions where that this hotel needed a facelift ie major refresh. The entrance is a bit strange you actually park and enter from the backside of the hotel. Arriving late at night the first nightI was confused if I was in a legal parking space as there were no space markings only faint diamond shaped markings throughout the parking lot indicating a space. I actually got out of my car and went over to a sign to make sure I was legally parked. No problem though I figured it out and went thru the back entrance to check in. The back and MAIN entrance are not the most convenient for a person with a couple pieces of luggage however and although there is a ramp to the right for wheelchairs and wheeling your luggage up for a main entrance it seemed a bit lacking in convenience even if it was only 3 or four short stairs. There was no Bellman or other staff to open the door for you either. Not that I needed assistance with luggage but there were a couple luggage carts in the hallway which I saw other guests using to self service their luggage to their rooms. This was at 1030pm so maybe there are no bellman at that hour again lacking for a full service Hyat Hotel. Still I did not see any Bellman or Doorman my entire stay at the Main back entrance holding the door for you or offering assistance. Check in was quick and efficient at this late hour and I had a nice room on a high floor with views overlooking the office park area of Fairfax. On the way to my room I thought the hallways seemed a bit dull and drab and the carpet old. My king bedded room was quiet however and the bed was comfortable. The internet was a bit slow at times to downright little to no service but fortunately I had my work hotspot with me. While the room and hotel was good it just had an aged look and feel to it inside. My room had the old fashioned chain link lock which you slide in the door to fit something I have not seen in years as most hotels have a swinging bar type mechanism for easy use. Not a huge deal of course but it does show the lack of updating as with the carpet and curtains in the room which were dull and weathered. I did not use the restaurant or lobby lounge so can not comment on those. And while I did not use the health club down the hall on the first floor I did have a look in ok but not very big even that was a bit strange the fitness center in the middle of the first floor of guest rooms. The indoor pool however did look nice. The area the property resides in is nice however so if you want to walk around the area or take a jog there are tree lined sidewalks to do so. I would stay here again if only for the convenience of location. I did not have a bad stay it just does not seem to be up to the standards of other Hyats business locations. I have stayed at so do not go in with high expectations for a luxurious property it is average at best.", "offset": [3167, 3205], "date": "2016-03-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "612d1036-1cff-474b-9248-8191edebb06f", "sentence": "1 Bad service.

Dunkin Donuts is close by as well as a Starbucks. The room was very nice and spacious though I did notice one room door on the 8th floor where we were staying was warped at the bottom quite a bit. THAT room probably was not the most eficientThe hotel had free WiFi and it was fairly quick and responsive. The pool was nice but the hot tub was a little cool the lifeguard told me they kept the pol at 85 degrees and the hot tub at 90 degrees. It was hard to tell a difference after swimming and then going into the hot tub. The exercise room had a nice layout and the weights and machines all seemed to be in nice order I did not try them all. The business center was OK but they charged for usage time I did not use it but it was inexpensive 5 for 30 minutes or so. They did have free printing of the airline boarding passes which was nice. They are within 12 hour of DC except during rush hour of course. which is nice if you do not want to be within the beltway where the prices are higher.
