Great location in downtown Clayton but has seen better days. Small jerky elevators that take forever to arrive when the property is busy.

Club lounge has gone downhill since our previous visit in 201. Really not good value anymore. Evening Club lounge supervisor. Demory 314 was wonderful. She had a cheerful smile for everyone and apologized profusely because the front desk staff was misinforming the guests of the time for evening presentation and drinks. She was constantly in motion asking to guests if they needed refills and did a fantastic job. Conversely the breakfast supervisor was almost surly when guests asked when additional food would be coming out. She was not a credit to the experience.

My only complaint is that there are only 3 elevators and 1 is a service elevator. We had some long wait times especially trying to checkout and found ourselves using the stairs a lot during our trip.

My wife and I stayed in this hotel for a family members wedding. We arrived on Tuesday and the check in process was fairly easy. We made it up to the fifteenth floor where were entered into our room. The room was clean with a nice king bed. I later realized that the room was a handicap room. The bathroom was huge which made the room small. I noticed the thermostat on the wall was pre set at 68 degrees which would normally be cold but the room still felt hot inside. I turned it down to 65 degrees where it finally felt cool in the room. We had requested a crib for our 11 month old child. Once inside of the room I noticed there was no crib in the room. I called the front desk and the crib arrived shortly thereafter at no extra charge. I also had called ahead of our visit to ensure there was a fridge in the room for medication that has to stay cold. There was no fridge in the room at the time of our arrival. A second call to the front desk and the small fridge was delivered shortly thereafter also at no additional charge. There was no microwave in the room but there is a coffee maker. We ate at the restaurant on the morning after the wedding and I felt that the selection was pretty slim for a buffet French toast sausage bacon. potatoes biscuitsgravy oatmeal fruit yogurt cereal and Oj. apple juice milk and coffee. Pricing for the buffet was not bad 14 dollars and the lady did not charge us for our five year old son. I learned that on the weekends you can only eat the buffet and can not order off the the menu. There is a bar located just outside of the restaurant. While waiting on our group to gather in the lobby my wife order a Pina Colada and was told by the bartender that the hotel does not have a blender. The pool was huge. Water was brisk upon first entry but felt good after I had gathered up enough courage to just jump in. There were ample amount of towels and padded lounge and patio chairs around the pool. This hotel does not have a spa. There was a large outdoor sitting area for sun bathing that we never used. There was also a small fitness area that I also did not use. The three cons of this hotel for me was the lack of free WiFi. The hotel wanted 10 dollars a day for WiFi. The parking was 14 dollars a day for self parking and 22 a day for valet At final check out parking was charged as stated. Lastly I had to change out my room key card three times during a five day trip because I could not access my room. I spoke with other family members who were also staying at the hotel and they were experiencing the same issues. The elevators 2 were fine on the weekdays but seemed to be extremely slow on the weekend especially at check out as everyone was trying to move there luggage to the lobby and parking garage. The hotel service elevator that the general public was not supposed to use but after waiting a while to move the bell cart downstairs I pushed the button and was able to go directly to the parking structure without any other stops. The hotel does have an Enterprise rental car on property but the office is not open on Sunday. The hotel is within walking distances of numerous restaurants and the metro station. The last thing I would like to stay about this hotel was that ALL of the staff was very friendly. Whatever I needed the hotel staff did there best to accommodate my needs. Also being on the 15th floor in an east facing room parking structure side you can see the Gateway Arch.

I gave it a two star because the bellman Tim who met us upon arrival was excellent and went out of his way to assist us. We checked into a one bedroom suite our son was with us for one night before moving into a college dorm.

He also served as valet and because we had a car full of our sons belongings he promised to park our car in a secure spot. The new room was worn out the couch was dirty and the carpets were in need of replacement. The second star is for a comfortable bed and good shower pressure. Then it got worse. After a long day we returned to the hotel at 1015pm that night to find out that they have no one to valet park after 10 pm something we were never told. The had one person at the desk with another person also upset about no one to park her car. We were paying and extra 7 a night for valley parking. I parked my own car and we went upstairs to find that our room had not been cleaned. We were gone from 930am to 1030 pm and no one cleaned our room. We called to find out what happened and were told that because we had the do not disturb sign on our door at 90 am the maid would not return. She was cleaning the room next to ours when we left so we assumed she would clean ours too. So other than Tim the service in this hotel is as bad as I have experienced. Even the staff in the buffet breakfast were of little assistance. We knew other parents who were staying in this hotel who had the same experience.

We cancelled that room and for the same price thankfully found the Sheraton Clayton Plaza. Immediately upon walking through the doors we felt good about our decision. We were greeted warmly and provided keys to our room ominously room 91. Thankfully the room was clean and comfortable and all that we needed for a great night of sleep before we had to be up early the next morning for the race. We enjoyed the staff recommendations for dinner that night the free parking proximity to the MARTA public train transportation right into downtown and the quiet of our room. it is not a 5 star hotel but I am amazed it has the same 35 rating as the hotel we left behind. There is no comparison between the two this is a palace by comparison. If you need somewhere to stay and the downtown hotels are booked or too expensive stay here. it is worth it.
