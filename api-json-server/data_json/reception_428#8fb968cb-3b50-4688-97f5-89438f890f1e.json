We choose this getaway based on recommendations price and spa. The Miramonte is a smaller resort which was just what we needed. We arrived on a Wednesday after Memorial Day which is basically the end of their high season because of rising temperatures. There appeared to be no one else at the resort literally. When I walked into the lobby there was no one. No one at the reception desk no concierge no one in either halls. I walked around and looked and kept coming back to the reception desk. After some time a young woman came out from a back door. Her attitude was a bit of why are you here. While I had been standing there by myself I had read the sign on the desk of how the hotel would be placing a 100 charge on my card that would not be removed for 5 7 days after my departure. That made me wonder what type of problems the hotel had been having but I also never saw the charge on my account. The check in clerk did give me 2 25 discount cards toward spa services which was nice since I was already scheduled for the Spa. Our Estate room was large and well appointed. There were details that could use attending to but chalked it up to being the end of the season and beginning of recovery time for the hotel. The pool was large and quiet. Only one other patron was enjoying the pool. The coping was missing a large chunk in one section. There where 4 skimmers in this large pool although it appeared none were working as the surface was covered in an assortment of insects on Friday when more visitors came a grandmother mother and daughter ended up leaving to go to the Hyat across the street due to cockroaches floating around the pool. We pushed the insects aside and saved more than a few bees over the next few days and enjoyed the air and water temperatures. The Well Spa had fabulous treatments with very professional technicians that did not spend time pressuring you into purchase high priced cosmetics. I was given a list of items used during my treatments upon my request. On Friday more people checked in and we discovered how thin and lacking in installation and weather stripping our room was. Friday was also the beginning of restaurant week in the area. We had made reservations for The Grove Artisan Kitchen at the hotel for 7 pm. It was busy when we got there. No hostess the manager sat us at a table for 2 directly in front of the open kitchen. At 1st I was not thrilled with the location because it was very loud but as it turned out it was good that is where we were. A very hard working bus boy came and filled our water glasses and then we sat for about 20 minutes. During this time we observed that there were only 2 waiters the bus boy and the manager with far to many people to service. People were visiting and mostly relaxed but after so long a time of no one coming to tables they began getting up and catching the main waiter. When the 1st person said no one has been to the their table the waiter was defensive stating they were very busy. A waiter never came to our table it was the Su Chef seeing we only had received water came to our table and served us personally not only the food items but running to the bar across the hall for our wine pairings which he comped us even though and maybe because we never complained we had no where else to be. The food unfortunately paid the price for the lack of management preparation for the evening. All of my items were overcooked. The hotel has a gem in their polside bartender for his customer service ability. He was a hard worker. I would return to the Miramonte especially mid week during low season just for the peacefulness of it all. But the resort does appear to have some management and customer service issues to work out.", "offset": [3450, 3530], "date": "2015-06-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "420f3979-0713-4c7f-9e3c-68e1b35f1959", "sentence": "Location and shuttle service to the Indian wells tennis garden.

The Miramonte is a beautiful venue in Indian Wells. It was large enough for us to have multiple events Welcome Party Hindu Ceremony American Ceremony Cocktail Hour Reception Brunch. all in different locations. But it is intimate enough that we felt we had the entire resort for ourselves. The mountain view background can not be beat. Our photos look like a fairy tale. The resort was recently acquired by Hilton for their Curio collection. And they underwent a HUGE renovation just before our wedding. We were a bit worried but everything was done in time. This resort is wonderful as it does not feel like a huge corporate hotel. Felt intimate and special. Can not say enough about the venue and location. The d\u00e9cor is modern clean and gorgeous. The food Outstanding. We had several catered events Rehearsal dinner Welcome party Reception and brunch. and the food far exceeded our expectations. Chef Paul is FANTASTIC. Our guests are still raving about the food. We also ate at their newly renovated restaurant several times and the food there is fantastic. The bartenders also make wonderful specialty cocktails. You can dine outside and watch the sunrise or sunset. Really can not be beat. If we lived in Indian Wells this is a restaurant we would go to even if we were not staying at the hotel. And a HUGE shout out to Alan who coordinated the staff throughout the weekend. Like we said we had multiple events. Two weddings Hindu and American a welcome party with Mehndi henna rehearsal dinner a lunch a cocktail hour a dinner and a brunch. And the staff did not miss a beat. And they were incredibly friendly. We do not know how Alan coordinated everything the way he did but he is a magician. Someone please give this man a raise. Truly fantastic. Our wedding was a beautiful experience 5 STARS. Something to note we had outside catering for religious and cultural purposes. The resort allows this exception if you speak to them in advance and caterer has all their paperwork. But there will be very high fees if the outside restaurant does not provide flatware plates etc. Make sure you negotiate everything in writing well in advance so there are no surprises.", "offset": [847, 929], "date": "2018-02-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "2d7cfef1-b14d-4275-9721-9d5a39023ab3", "sentence": "Pretty quiet relaxed.
