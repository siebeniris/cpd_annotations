I also visited the spa there is a discount as part of the privileges from the imperial club and the massage was great. we did a boat trip in the palm island and went to the dubai marina also great. we booked this service in the beach you have to ask for the discount. it seems to be like a tradition in dubai. they always offer a high price and then make a discount.", "offset": [346, 387], "date": "2015-04-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "ca69b3d5-67e9-4cf8-9bbe-21ba9c4cac69", "sentence": "Fantastic aquarium water park pools in hotel.

We booked on line via the Atlantis website and choose Palm deluxe room without any meals. Booking was smooth and I had emailed the Atlantis staff on a couple of occasions with queries which was answered promptly. Took a taxi on the day of check in and arrived at 2 pm. Bags were promptly picked up and a luggage tag given to us. There was not really a huge rush for check in we waited only for about 5 mins before reaching the counter. Mr Fathy at the check in counter was extremely good. He gave all information with eagerness and provided very valuable advice on how to make our time useful in Atlantis. He also explained the benefits of the Imperial club and assisted us in the upgrade at a very attractive price. Trust me Imperial club is worthy the extra money you pay considering that breakfast lounge and kids club facilities come for free not to mention the better room on higher floors. Our room was on 13th floor east wing with an amazing view of the gulf and the palm islands overlooking the down town where you could see Burj Al Arab and Burj Khalifa. This was directly above the Lost chambers aquarium and from the balcony you could see the Aquarium from top the mono rail and Aquaventure park. Amazing views and the silence that comes with being on higher floors. Room itself was spacious with enough areas to store things. The Imperial club room comes with Coffee Tea makers a chargeable mini bar complimentary bottled water bath accessories Iron Safe TV and air conditioning. Bathroom was extra spacious and clean. A Complimentary fruit basket and a box of chocolates added to the Imperial club experience. It also helped us being in east wing as the Imperial club lounge was on 12th floor just one floor below our room. The lounge has all day cookies chips coffee tea. But if one enters the lounge between 5 7 there is a mini buffet with wide variety of food along with complimentary drinks. The lounge also has a outside seating area which is good to relax and unwind with the view of gulf and down town Dubai. Staff are extremely well trained and professional. They are always present to help the guests and take care of their needs. There are plenty of eating options. We had breakfast in Kaleidoscope and enjoyed every bit of it. The buffet spread is huge. Kids club facilities allow you to drop the young ones in a professionally run kids club where they are entertained via arts crafts games colouring etc. while you can enjoy other facilities of the resort. The resort has a huge swimming pool business centre where you can get a SIM card for free for international calls kids club and many other things we could not explore. Together with the Lost chambers aquarium Aquaventure waterpark Dolphin and sea lion parks this is truly a destination on its own which is highly recommended for all types of travellers.

We booked this to celebrate my wifes 50th birthday. Her birthday was in may but owing to our son doing his GCSEs we could not come in may. We decided to come in October when it is cooler. However we used our life savings no exaggeration to celebrate her 50th albeit belatedly. With this in mind I emailed ahead to make sure this occasion was noted. I wanted it to be special for her. We booked 2 interconnected rooms one king and one room with two queens. We have 2 teenagers who would not want to share a bed hence why we booked two queens. We arrived midday and went to check in. I have never encountered such a frosty reception. The lady called Svetlana did not even smileShe asked about my wifes birthday obviously having read a note on the booking and I explained it was in May but this is the first opportunity to come on holiday to celebrate. Svetlana waved her hand as if to dismiss the birthday as if it was irrelevant nowthat is the whole reason we came on the holiday. Anyway it went down hill from there on. she told us the only interconnected rooms available were 2 king rooms. I said my two teenagers will not share a bed and she shrugedAnother member of staff came and offered an extra put you up bed in the room. My wife started to cry. We did not blow all our savings for thisWe reluctantly went into our room it was 1430hrs by now. and my wife was really upset and in tearsOur teenagers were upset because of all the upset and they felt we were wasting valuable holiday time. Eventually at 4 pm I decided to be more tenacious. I could not see my wife upset on this much looked forward to holiday I contacted reception and again asked for the room combination which we had booked. a different member of staff arranged a change of room to the correct booking and by 170 we were in our correct room. By this time we felt we had wasted our first day. There was no point in going to the waterpark because it closes soon. the kids were disappointed. In addition I had emailed ahead re my wifes 50th there was no recognition at all. Svetlana obviously decided it was not relevant and this was an added disappointment. some flowers or card would have been a nice touch. Also no recognition of the fact they let us down with the room situation. I felt let down with their customer service. The rest of the stay went well the kids loved the waterpark food was delicious and hotel grand. The whole stay was spoiled by lack of customer care that first day. I wanted my wife to be made a fuss of for her big birthday. and I feel we wasted a day which was entirely their fault. but which we paid alot of money for. We will not be able to afford a trip like this again. so it has left a sour taste. I would recommend staying in a nearby hotel and visiting the waterpark as a day guest.

I stayed at the Atlantis Hotel on a work trip and from start to finish it was fantastic. Only a 40 minute drive from the airport a 20 minute drive to Downtown Dubai where you can visit the iconic Burj Khalifa and Water Fountain Show at the Mall of Dubai. We had upgraded to imperial club members and if it is luxury you are after this is the perfect thing for you to do. The VIP check in was a lot easier than the standard check in and you had access to a whole lot more at the resort including a private restaurant for breakfast and afternoon tea. The rooms were great very spacious and had everything you needed for a relaxing holiday including a huge bathroom. There are plenty of things to do in the day I would definitely recommend visiting the Aquaventure waterpark which is perfect for all the family. The Aquarium in Atlantis is also really worth visiting and on Friday mornings you can do Yoga in there which again was incredible. The gym facilities at the Atlantis are second to none. Every piece of equipment you could ever need for a good workout. There is also a sauna steam room and spa. Nasimi beach is great for groups of friends with live djs and cocktails whilst watching the sunset it is not one to miss. I would also recommend visiting Yuan the Chinese restaurant and Osiano the underwater restaurant. the service and the food were both outstanding. One word of advice do not get in a Lexus taxi in Dubai as they charge a lot more than an average taxi car with taxi sign on the top as they will try and get you into a Lexus first. As we were also a large group of girls I would say that make sure you abide by the correct dress code at the mall and in public areas.

Myself and my family of 4 and my sister in law and her family visited to celebrate both my own and my brother in laws 50th birthday. Both families stayed in one of their 2 bedroom Imperial Club Suite rooms. The pick up service from the airport which was included within our room was a little slow it took 2 and a half hours from landing to actually getting into the hotel lobby. However the guy ordered a bigger car when he saw that the car he had selected was going to be a bit of a squeeze. The rooms are beautiful in the Imperial Suite there is plenty of space and wonderful bathrooms. The cleaning staff are superb they tidied up after my messy teenagers on a daily basis. They really could not have been nicer. We had superb service in the Seafire restaurant by Karam who was both charming and wonderfully attentive but sadly in other areas this was not the case. It is a real shame that a 5 star hotel does not give 5 star service consistently. Karam you need to give the staff in other bars restaurants some lesonsThe weather was overcast all week which left us a little cold at the water park. However the water park is fantastic for all ages. It is well supervised by the Atlantis with life guards at very 510 metres and those guys were wonderful always happy. I do agree with other reviews about the service provided along with the cost but for me the water park is so good that it adds that extra edge that other hotels can not offer when staying with children.

Firstly we requested a non smoking room but the room we were given was absolutely stinking of cigarettes from the previous guests Even the bed pillows and everything reeked of cigarette smells. I have stayed in quite a few hotels in this region and it was bad. I think it is not fair espeicaly when I have 3 kids and Atlantis should really look after them. When we requested new room they said none was available but sent some people up to spray the room with deodorant. TO me not satisfactory at all. More chemicals for my kids to sleep through and it soon disperses and your back to the cigarette odours. Secondly my little boy was terribly disappointed because most of the rides in the theme park were closed. I understand but we should have been wanrned when we booked. It broke my heart when I saw his face after he got the news. He was so excited all week especaly about the park.

We were at the water park most days in the morning and then headed back for the kids naps and some time either at one of the pools or beach. The water park is amazing and the kids area where we spent all our time was perfect for our two kids 4 and 2. I have to say the lifeguards were all amazing. They put my mind at ease. They were everywhere and so friendly and attentive helping the kids when they needed a hand laughing and joking with them but still doing their jobs one even got his rubber glove on and wiped my boys nose. Way beyond the call of duty but I was v grateful. The buggy service to the water park was great and really useful. There are life jackets at the water park beach and pools which we used for our little girl and it was really handy to have these available. She swam on her own and could n\u2019t be prouder of herself. The fab pools were a great way for my kids to develop their confidence in the water they have come on so much during this holiday. We ate at most of the choices for half board and they were all great. We only paid a supplement twice for bread street kitchen which was a lovely treat. We went to the fan zone twice to watch the football. Again it was great and the kids activities there meant that they were occupied and happy which makes our life a lot easierWe had a one bedroom suite which was great.

Housekeeping left plenty of water in the rooms which we greatly appreciated. Waterpark entry free it was good we were not in high season though not sure i d like it busy or consider it worth it. Tips Go out of season just imagining this place at high season gives me anxiety. It was only \u00a3 60 80 to upgrade to a palm view room personally worth it slightly bigger room also. Have breakfast or meals included. do not stay here if you want to explore a lot of Dubai the location is not good for that. Conclusion. This hotel is past it. Far more luxurious and private hotels on offer if that is what you are looking for.", "offset": [1467, 1584], "date": "2018-10-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "df0d1242-61c4-4e9d-ad76-5c7f93cc8c15", "sentence": "I visited aquarium inside Atlantis.

The aquarium was probably the best the hotel has. Check in and out experience was very disappointing long queues of over half an hour and an average of 15 minutes to to complete the formalities food and beverage options were limited for breakfast we had no options but the all day dining which cost almost 20aed per person and there were queues. Front office tried to hard to cross sell and upsel to the point it feels disturbing. Lack of overall healthy snacking facilities would be great to offer a sort of all day bistro bakery with quality sandwiches and salads fresh smoothies and fruit ice lollies instead of sugar laden drinks made of syrops and unhealthy fried fried optionsIn the water park.

Very nice hotel and park. However it is way overpriced especially for every kid activity. 1000 per family to swim with a dolphin no thank you. We wanted connected Queen rooms but they were not ready. Staff found connected King room Had to go back down to find Queen rooms and ended up with far apart rooms. Also paid for 6 guests total but when we registered the added 6th guest who joined us later they lost her info and we had to go thru a great deal to get her wrist band for the park each day.
