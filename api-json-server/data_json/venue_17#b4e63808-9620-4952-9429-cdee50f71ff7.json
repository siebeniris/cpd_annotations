I planned a Sweet Sixteen party for my daughter in April. The staff was great from my first meeting with JaiLita Joy Ezel. She helped me with selecting the menu and gave me some great ideas for decorations. The day of the event everyone was very helpful. When I needed an iron to steam out the table clothes they brought the iron and ironing board down to me. When I had trouble attaching a skirt to the candy table they gave me tape to secure the skirt. They brought me whatever I needed to help me complete the decorations before the guest arrived. Throughout the party there was always someone there to make sure the food and drinks were replenished and dirty dishes were always removed in a timely matter. Later that night the birthday girl wanted to go to the pool. Even though the pool was closed the front desk allowed her and her friends to hang out at the pool for a few hours. That really topped her wonderful party. The next day as we were checking out they gave us a complementary breakfast. Our server Colita made sure the birthday girl had a hot breakfast with a nice side fruit bowl. I wish I had written this sooner while I still remembered everyones name.

We were looking for a venue for an event on a tight budget and this hotel filled the bill nicely. There were some hiccups along the way but the overall experience was a good one and we would definitely come back. My only complaint was that our mattress was hard as a rock. However we worked so hard and long hours that once my head hit the pillow that really did not matter. The location is great the breakfast is good but overpriced unles it comes with your room rate but parking is crazy. You have to park all the way up a steep hill and hope you do not roll all the way down after you park your car. The stairs are not immediately easily marked when you are headed back to the hotel. And if you have back knee issues you should probably stay elsewhere. I have had Hiltons breakfast in other Hilton properties and this is the best so far. Beats even the Hilton across from Disney Springs in Orlando. Location. you are less than 5 minutes from Perimeter Mall and shopping dining at plenty of great places. you are 5 minutes from the Perimeter Dunwody MARTA station that can take you to the airport and all points downtown in Atlanta including Lenox Mall Buckhead. I would DEFINITELY come back to this hotel again if I were staying in Atlanta for any length of time. Also since it was a property included in my credit cards rewards plan it was an extra bonus. Overall good experience even considering the minor snags we had with our event. The staff did rectify those little issues in a timely and polite manner too.
