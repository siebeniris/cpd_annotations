We stayed at The Reach for a week in March 2016. The Hotel portrays itself as a luxury beach side hotel and charges accordingly. While the accommodations were satisfactory I was not left with the impression that we had stayed at a luxury hotel when compared to other similarly priced accommodations for example in Hawaii or Cabo. While we were there there was no beach side service for refreshments or food and the beach bar closed at 4 pm so that as an employee explained it would not compete with the restaurant. Location is excellent and the sandy beach is nice not all hotels in Key West have direct beach access. Breakfast service was exceedingly slow a 30 wait for food after we ordered they should not be surprised by a surge of breakfast diners at breakfast time. The fitness room weight machine was not well maintained. These issues are admittedly a bit trivial overall it was a nice stay but just not the luxury experience expected for the price and not enough for me to unequivocally commit to The Reach on our next visit we had probably look at another beach side hotel just to compare.", "offset": [551, 653], "date": "2016-03-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "eae8c663-b4c0-4b72-89ca-56f00fa0c896", "sentence": "Nice property nice location Was a bit hesitant to stay here after reading the mixed reviews but we were pleasantly surprised.

The breakfast servers brought your food but could not be found afterward for other needs. The rooms were standard at best for example our headboard was missing pieces out of it and the chairs on the balcony were really showing the weather. As was the handrails outside around the complex. The pool elevator was a mess the carpet was uneven and the ceiling panel was half black and half light. could not figure out if a bulb was out or something worse. I am aware that they had effects from Hurricane irma last September but that has been over a year ago.

Any request we made was granted. They even texted us a couple of times to be certain all was well. The pool and grounds were immaculate. The beach did have some seaweed but the staff went above and beyond to keep the beach as clean as possible. They have little control over mother nature.

Those sheets were the best sheets I have ever slept on or under. The towels and chair covers at the pool and beach were always clean and smelled fresh. Spencers never failed to please no matter what meal drink or snack. The little shop on site had some great muffins croissants fruit cups etc. Oh and the nespreso machine in room.

Our stay began w a call 2 days prior to confirm details I spoke with EJ and he assured us all was good. He was on staff when we checked in and took care of everything we needed He is your GO TO GUY at the Reach. Thru our entire stay he was on top of our everyone needs. Our room 317 was a nice standard double we are not able to get a diamond upgrade this stay it had a good view of the courtyard and decent view of the ocean from the balcony. The rug had a curl at the corner which became a trip hazard but we learned to manage it. All rooms were revamped and decorated nicely w hidden touches related to the area. Beds were very comfortable cozy. Adjoining room doors are thin so voices carry from other rooms so note tone. Did not hear anything from above or thru walls just door noise. Bathrooms are a bit small so keep in mind if you are a person of size like myself 65 wide shoulders. shower is tight. really no issues with rooms but rug all have refridge and safes.

Everyone remembered our names made us feel so welcome Daily. additionally EJ called the CM one night to make sure we could be seated at the sister property for the Nat Champ game and drove us over in their shuttle. Beach staff daily was always ready to get lounge chairs umbrellas and towels not to mention beach wait staff bringing drinks and complementary Italian ice pops while sunning. Breakfast daily was great discounted if H Diamond never disappointed. There is a local bus you can get on fro free two blocks from hotel little deli store half black away 3 blocks from Southern most point Buoy. only minor issue we had was at check out our travel companions had some accounting issues with regard to room charges but it was remedied properly and all was fine.
