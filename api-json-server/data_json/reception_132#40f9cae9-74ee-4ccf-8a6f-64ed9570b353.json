This remarkable spacious hotel has the ability to accommodate large groups several hundred attendees and maintain a comfortable ambience and atmosphere for all.

Not only did I receive a room at the end it was a corner room on the 20th floor with the best view of the waterside. dragon boat races departure of cruise ships down the marina and Amalie Arena during one of the Tampa Bay Lightnings hockey playoff games.

We stayed at this hotel thankfully right after the July 4rh holiday rush so it was nice and quiet. A big plus at this hotel is the Tampa Bay River Walk just outside the lobby doors. A great way to get some exercise and see part of downtown Tampa at the same time. The pool was nice and large with a lot of lounge chairs but the water looked like it needed to be filtered several more times.

I have been visiting this hotel for several years on business. On some occasions my wife accompanies me. This is her favorite hotel. My most recent visit was a quick two night stay. My first outing since having knee Repacement surgery. Although the hotel was full because of Stanley Cup playoff and conventions the valet team was excellent and fast as usual. Emily assisted with a quick check in and provided a great King Sized Chanel View room although they had blocked out a double room on the reservation. Room was terrific roomy with a great view of harbor. Set on balcony after work and enjoyed the view. The concierge lounge on the 24th floor is a great place to relax in the evening and to enjoy a quite breakfast in the morning. Carl Fuller always has a good spread of food arranged for breakfast. He is always pleasant and professional while performaning food replishement etc but he always makes time to insure each person is welcomed and is accommodated.

I selected a 2 rating to show my overall disappointment. Typical of Mariot the higher up the hotel level you go the more you pay and get less. let us break this down. Building Beautiful atrium and great if you were with the large conference group since the large group had several private functions that closed off parts of the public areas of the hotel. I was attending a small group meeting and was not able to utilize the full service of the hotel because of the large group. Consider this if you are not attending the primary conference during the stay. Building the spa and change rooms for the pool were closed for construction. You could also see a large number of rooms had been guted and were being renovated. Meeting room. The room itself was fine but the construction seriously impacted our meeting with a jack hammer rattling the walls for over 2 hours of our 8 hour meeting. Mariot made no mention of construction nor provided any discounts because of it. Food service room service was excellent quick hot good quality and plenty of food for the price. Service staff 100 positive. bent over backwards to be of service. top quality except housekeeping failed to restock the K cups after the first night. Sleeping room quality was great except for door to balcony was stuck. Engineering came up right away and was able to open however potential is there for guest to get stuck outside on balcony with no way to notify staff. Ice machines are only on even number floors. I was on the 23rd floor the ice machines on 22 and 24 were not working. I was able to get ice from the 26th floor. Got to know the stair way in my search for ice. Internet worse than Poor especially considering Mariot charges higher than normal for internet. first issue was 5 out of 11 people in out group go the same guest info does not match our records error preventing log in. To resolve the problem guest services repeatedly connected me to a no longer existing Tech Service number. After the 4th go around with guest services they gave me a special code which worked. However once on line my connection was a very slow 06 mbs download and 002 upload. Most pages took 3 to 4 minutes to load or timed out and returned a not available error. I ended up using the internet in the lobby to conduct business on my computer. Again considering the price for a room this is 100 unacceptable. Pool and Pool area very nice.

Seeing the reviews here it seems the hotel has some service level issues with housekeeping and front desk they have not fixed and if you read my review you \u2019l see it \u2019s just getting worse. This is my review. If you care about your safety read on. Every one of your departments basically failed us except valet Check in we did n\u2019t get the booked room and were basically over charged for a downgrade. The front desk guy said he would take off 50 for each night but they only took off 64. Weird but a big indication of service. the room service to go is a new experience for me and being asked to come down and get it or pay 5 for it to be brought up seems tacky but whatever. However missing half our food the oatmeal was another misstep from f and b Then The BIGGEST issue I \u2019ve ever experienced housekeeping cleans our room around 3 and leaves the deadbolt on. So we came to an open room at midnight and realize our door was left unlocked for hours for anyone to go in and help themselves to what we had. Not to mention someone could have been waiting in the room. If you \u2019re a female this should concern you greatly. The room also had a dirty hand towel left on the made bed mind you. We call down in a panic. The front desk guy was very apologetic after we realize nothing was missing we went to bed. He gave us 10k points right away for the trouble. We wake up and take the elevator up and it gets stuck. The door opens 4 inches and stays like that for 30 60 seconds. Feels like a lot more at the time but it was quick. It went back down and we got out So we went to the lobby restaurant good experienceWent to our room and checked out shortly after and just spent more time at the airport than the hotel as we felt it was n\u2019t going to go any better. At check in we were given 50 off a night for basically being downgraded we booked a live well king bed room with a balcony. Only a lower level room was availableAt check out I asked the woman who checked me out if the 50 a night was applied and she just yes\u2019ed me I went to verify it on the ap I saw only a 64 discount was applied. Shady practices or poorly trained employees. I say the latter which shows more of this poor service level. Rooms are real nice. Bartenders were great. Location was good for us. But the open door and the fact we had laptops and expensive shoes and purses in the room. If someone went in to take stuff it could have been thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars taken from usConsider this security lapse before choosing a location. What would you do if half your stuff you take on vacation that does n\u2019t fit in the safe is stolen. The other reviews complain of the same thing poor service and one side of the hotel does face construction curentlyIf you \u2019re not having a big convention or party here I assume you \u2019re given the construction side of the hotelI would have never wrote this review but I checked my bill. Went on the mariot ap to ask the hotel to adjust the bill and I got a response the the 64 was the adjustmentThey wasted enough of my time and I let a lot pass by. The response on the ap was the end for me.

Had previously stayed here several years ago for a convention and was impressed so when my girlfriend was coming to town for business which she often does I suggested the hotel because it was close to the hockey arena where we had tickets for that night. Her business requires her to be on TV and she used her hair dryer that blew out because of the poor electrical connection and it was ruined. At the same time the refrigerator did n\u2019t work and all the food we had in there was ruined as well. Needless to say neither of us were happy. Went to the front desk to speak to manager to get it resolved and when I advised that his initial monetary offer off the bill was insufficient he came back and offered one night off plus the same amount and to grab lunch and a drink which at the time I found acceptable. When I went to check out the next day they refused to honor what was promised and went back on their word and while gave the room now said the room credit would not be honored. Until I got agitated the manager in duty refused to come out and then he Stefan Riter could n\u2019t be any ruder. The long and the short he tried to offer a lease amount and said I had an over priced lunch anyway burger and a drink for 41. that I would n\u2019t have ordered if it was n\u2019t for the offer of the manager. He refused to honor the agreement and at the end of the day has lost a customer forever for this hotel and a good chance Mariot as well.
