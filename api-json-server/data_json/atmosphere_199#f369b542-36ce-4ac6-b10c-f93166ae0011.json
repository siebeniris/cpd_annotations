I travel to Miami for business quite frequently and normally stay at either the JW Mariot or the Intercontinental just across the street from the EPIC. I have heard countless rave reviews about the EPIC and finally gave in to give it a try on my most recent trip. Although it is not the hotels fault but the construction around the property makes access very difficult. It took me around 30 minutes from the Viceroy to turn into the hotel and that is a distance of about 1 mile. Checkin was quick and unremarkable. The staff were nice but did not offer the level of courtesy I receive at similarly rated 45 star properties. While the amenities at this hotel are indeed top notch. the room itself was disappointing. Mine had two queen beds more like doubles and one of them had a massive depression on one side of the mattress making that bed impossible to sleep in. The sheets were coarse and over starched the pillows there were only two per bed were filled with lumpy synthetic material not the down you come to expect at top notch properties. Indeed I struggle to recall a worse bedding set at any 4 plus start property I have ever stayed at. The room did not have a coffee maker which I have come to expect as standard. Again I do not recall the last time I stayed at a hotel that did not have a Keurig in the room. Here I had to ask for one to be brought. It took 30 minutes and the coffee maker was delivered on a busted up tattered tray that should never see the light of day let alone at a property of this caliber. My TV signal kept going in and out so I could not watch the news. The bathroom lacked the details I come to expect at similar properties. Just shampoo conditioner body wash and soap were provided. At other properties I am used to also getting mouth wash a shower cap cotton rounds and q tips. I understand that these are not necessities but these are touches I really appreciate at other properties and they were missing here. I ordered room service which arrived a reasonable 30 minutes after my order. Again just a lack of attention to detail made this a disappointing experience. No water was brought up with my meal. The sandwich was not accompanied by any condiments like mayonnaise or mustard. They gave me two of those foil pouches of ketchup like the ones you get at fast food restaurants. It was not enough ketchup and the presentation was off putting. I am used to condiments being brought it little glass jars not in fast food restaurant packaging.

I \u2019ve never wrote one of these before and I want to start it off with something positive the hotel was beautiful and the doormen were so friendly. That \u2019s really about all I have good to say. Now let me tell you how their parking service completely screwed up our vacation. We received a pleasant surprise when we arrived and were told it was 45 a day to park at a hotel we were paying very well to stay at but we dealt with it. Little did we know the parking service would later ruin our trip. They recommend you call down 15 20 minutes before to request your car which we did every time and every time we were forced to wait 25 35 minutes. Over our anniversary vacation this made us late for a parasailing appointment which we were later charged more for because they had to reschedule us for an afternoon appointment that cost more then our early morning appointment. We were also late for a dinner reservation which forced us to wait 20 minutes for a table to open up. Lastly on our last day we checked out at 5 AM and I requested they bring the car down at 450 AM. There was not a single person outside requesting for their car that early but they still managed to take 30 minutes to bring ours down. Because of this we made it to our airplane as they were closing the gate. A minute later and the Kimpton Epic could have epicaly ruined our trip. We were also made aware that part of the hotel was under construction but we were not made aware that our room needed construction. Every time the shower or sink was turned on the walls sounded like a baby goat was being sacrificed within them. I \u2019m not sure what \u2019s wrong with their plumbing but this is not expected from a 5 Star Hotel. My final disappointment as if the first few were n\u2019t enough. When we arrived to check in their computer systems were down and we were asked to fill out a form with our credit card info personal info etc. My fianc\u00e9 and I were celebrating my birthday and our anniversary and I made the reservation under my name. When we arrived my fianc\u00e9 asked the front desk clerk if she could use her IHG rewards account for the stay. I used my card to pay for the room but she is also on the same credit card account. The very nice gentleman said that was no problem at all and that he would simply change the reservation name from mine to hers. In the process of writing down our personal info and credit card info for check in he also wrote down her personal info and IHG account number at the top of the form. He just asked that we check back down later to ensure it was added when the system was back up and running. Very nice guy. 2 days later on our way out to dinner we did in fact stop by the front desk to confirm it was updated. However this time we received a different front desk lady who was not inviting and pretty firm and direct about how we can not use my fianc\u00e9 \u2019s IHG rewards account even though she was staying in the room as well and we used a credit card that both of our names are on. At this point we were so disappointed by the bad information we were given and taken back by this new front desk clerks rudeness in delivering this information that we simply said \u201c Ok \u201d and went to dinner. This was our first and last time staying at the Kimpton Epic. Possibly our last time staying at an IHG property. Which really sucks to be honest because it was a beautiful property.

I stayed here for a few weeks for business and generally had a very pleasant experience. I have stayed here many years ago and the hotel is still well maintained. The rooms pool and gym were all nice and clean. All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. I brought my dog along and she was treated very well. Despite being here for business the nice pool and location of the hotel made it easy to have some fun as well. The one critical issue was the valet parking. Pretty much every hotel in Miami has valet parking only which is fine. Most hotels in Miami also have very slow valet parking which is annoying but expected. Now the Epic had hands down the worst valet parking experience I have ever encountered. I used my car several times a day for several weeks. so I got to experience the valet parking staff many times during my stay. I did not have a single positive experience. I waited between 30 minutes to 1 hour each time I requested my car which is pretty unacceptable. The wait seemed to be the new normal there since nobody ever apologized for the delay. The icing on the cake is returning to the hotel to have 5 7 valet parking attendants standing around doing nothing while incoming cars pile up and block the driveway. As I mentioned all the other hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Maybe they could help train the valet parking attendants. The lack of service and professionalism was pretty ridiculous considering they charge over 50 per night for the service I would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat for future business travel if it were not for the consistently terrible parking service.

For our 10th anniversary I wanted to do something special. so we went to St Lucia. So what we \u2019re talking about The Kimpton Epic Hotel here but since our journey home from St Lucia wad a nice 27hour layover I was keen to enjoy Miami a little with my wife who had never been here. To be honest I was 10 years old when I last came so it was definitely going to be a different experience this time around. Check in 710We got to the hotel at around 830pm so we \u2019re keen to check in and head out to grab some proper non plane food. There were 2 staff members addressing customers so we just enjoyed the wonderful lobby which was very grand in a modern fashion. Eventually after about 5 8 minutes we were called over and went through the check in process which was very easy. We were n\u2019t given an upgrade but I did n\u2019t ask for one either since we were already in a nice water view suite. The guy was very friendly and helpful. We told him that we did n\u2019t know the area and were hungry for some authentic food to which he sent us over to CVICHE 105. Great choice and I highly recommend it. in fact I reviewed that restaurant on my flight home. Anyway we checked in and were ready to head upstairs or at least up in the elevators since we were on the 30th something floor. We got to our door which was a little bit of a task since our roller luggage was dragging in the very plush carpet used between the elevators and guest rooms and then I tried getting into our room but both keys did n\u2019t work. That \u2019s always frustrating. So down I go and back to the front desk to get them reactivated. Done and done and back up I go. This time they both worked. Room 810After having stayed at a lovely place for the past week I also wanted this night \u2019s stay to be enjoyable. It was. We walked into a nice long but open hallway with the bathroom somewhat open plan and with a faux window to the bedroom. The bedroom itself was very large and had nice furniture with a table and chairs by the patio doors. These doors when almost full width of the bedroom and looked out to the south with views of the city and water to the left. There was a little bit of building construction work going on a few buildings over but we did n\u2019t hear any noise from this we could just see the huge cranes being used. We had a pretty big balcony too but it was so flipping hot and muggy that we were keen to stay inside with the doors closed and a c on. That being said when I was outside I noticed that we were only a few floors above the outdoor bar area which was pretty well populated and had a live DJ. With the doors closed we did n\u2019t hear much of anything from outside. Bathroom 610The furnishings in the room and also this bathroom was really very nice. We had both a walk in shower and a bath tub along with a double sink sit within a nice marble countertop. The one thing I was n\u2019t keen on was the sliding door to the toilet. I did n\u2019t appear to close properly and once inside it felt quite dark cold and echoey. The bathroom supplies were of a nice quality so I was sure to take home the remaining supplies. Since I do n\u2019t get to enjoy a bath too often I was keen to try this one out. It was definitely not suitable for 2 people. Either way trying to figure out how to close the drain took a little bit of time but when we did and started filling up the bath we noticed that the water was turning lukewarm after barely 13 the way though so this was boding well for a nice bath experience. Needless to say I got bored waiting and tried out the lovely looking shower. This worked perfectly and had a nice big shower head for complete body coverage. Conclusion 2130For the most part we just wanted a nice place to rest our head since we were going to head out into the city to try some local food and then again in the morning we would go out for breakfast somewhere along the water. So realistically we were not in the room at that long but it is nice to have good space and nice views. As in another recent review I am right in the middle of 3 and 4 for scoring and since some of these issues are intermittent issues I am going to be more positive and go with 4. The location was really good we walked or scooted around very easily and there was a good buzz around the hotel.
