We decided to take our three children to the Dallas World Aquarium for the weekend. When we arrived at the hotel the staff at first was very friendly. However when we went to our room it was nothing what they had listed. We were supposed to have two queen beds with a sleeper sofa that was not the case. We recieved two standard beds and that was all. We contacted the front desk to discuss that this is not what we reserved and were advised there was nothing they could do. We contacted expedia about our complaint unfortunatly they were able to help us much either. Expedia did credit us for a future reservation but we were still stuck with the room for the next two nights. Since our room can only acomodate 4 people we had to make a mad dash to get bedding for one of our children to sleep on. Our trip to the Aquarium was amazing. There were so many birds animals and aquatic life it felt like we were in a mini rainforest. The entire facility was well designed with many nooks and cranies having exhibits tucked in perfectly. After our visit the kids wanted to do some swimming and i wanted to soak my feet in the hot tub. To much of my dismay the hot tub was a flower garden. After swimming with the kids for awhile we decided to head back to the room. The pool towels were just mere bath towels. Needless to say our trip was a little of a bummer but had a blast at the aquarium.

I \u2019m a platinum rewards member which just means that I spend too much time on hotels. I was thoroughly disappointed with my stay at the Dallas Mariot Las Colinas this week. While I was told I had an upgraded room my overall experience felt like something close to a 2 star hotel night a full scale Mariot. When I entered the hotel I immediately wanted to walk back out and find another option but I was too tired from traveling. I appreciate the attempt to remain operable during major renovations but the lobby is a complete eyesore. Everything is stripped in preparation for renovations. I do n\u2019t know about you but I do n\u2019t want to pay or even have my company pay standard corporate rates to see stripped down walls and construction type curtains hanging around. As I continued to check it I asked the check in rep for a bag of plain chips while most Mariot \u2019s would have just handed me the chips free due to my status this rep took about 2 3 minutes trying to figure out the code to use to charge me all the while I \u2019m in the lobby feeling like I \u2019m on an HGTV rehab series. I had no problems paying fir the chips but do you really want to hold up your customers trying to figure it out. It was being added to my bill anyways lol but she did not release the chips until she successfully was able to \u201c charge me \u201c Finaly I headed towards the elevator more stripped walls and long construction type sheets hanging floor to ceiling. I was concerned that the elevators would not work properly due to the overall look of things. My elevator made scary thumping noises but I finally made it to my room. The renovations done to the room are actually nice but the smell of old carpet or something ruined the new room vibe. I \u2019m honestly not sure what the smell was exactly but it appeared to come through the vents when the AC was blowing. My lake view was nice. In an effort to not totally bash this hotel because I do like the Mariot brand it took days to figure out if there was truly a valet option. After the second day of self parking my coworker and I just dropped our car keys at the front desk and told them we needed our cars parked. One more minor thing the upgraded rooms still have the 190 style phones. I think those should be removed immediately. I know most people do n\u2019t use hotel phones but I noticed it immediately when entering the room and then trying to use it to call for services. One last thing. this was the first Mariot that totally ignored my list of requested items that I entered during mobile check in days before. My standard list is an extra pillow an extra blanket extra towels and water. The extra pillow and blanket made it the other items had to be requested again. I will be in Las Colinas area for a few months during the week so I \u2019m trying a few other hotels even if they are further out.

My husband and I chose this hotel for our anniversary because we had stayed in this area at the Omni before and really thought it was nice. I booked the reservation online and I requested a king room with a balcony and a water view. In the notes I put that I wanted to have the highest floor possible. I downloaded the ap and went in the ap to find that they had changed it to a king room on the lowest floor available. I called the hotel to find out why it said that and they were not sure but said that they would book me on the 10th floor which was the highest they had at that moment. He said that we could see if there was anything higher the next day when we checked in. I put on the reservation that we would check in at 3 PM. We arrived at 330 PM and went to check in and I told them that I would like to see what the highest floor was available and they told me that it was the ninth floor. I told them that I was booked into a 10th floor room the day before and they told me that they did n\u2019t do that. it was the reservation agent that did that. I explained that I did not call the reservation line I called the hotel direct and they then said that the 10th Floor room was not yet ready and was still being turned. I asked him why it was not ready as I had informed them that I would be arriving at 3 PM. They told me that they could send a message to have the room expedited if I wanted to wait. We had Dinner reservations so I wanted to get checked in so that we could start getting ready so we opted to just stay with the 9th floor even though that is not what we wanted. When we arrived in our room we looked around to find that the room was very average. It is your basic bed and desk with a TV room. The balcony was large with a table and 2 chairs which was nice. We noticed that there were no robes or any other amenities that were listed on the website. Nothing was going the way that it was planned. When I asked about the robes I was told that they are something that they do not offer to everybody and that they have to be requested. On the website these amenities are listed as a room amenity it does not say that they are upon request. At this point I was truly frustrated and just not wanting to stay at this hotel. I went downstairs to let them know that I wanted to check out and just cancel my whole reservation. They informed me that if I did cancel that I would still be charged. The supervisor came over and was interested in helping make things right. She found a room on the 10th floor that she expedited to have cleaned and she had all of the amenities that were missing delivered to that room. She also went above and beyond and sent additional amenities to our room for our trouble. She definitely wanted to make sure that we had a good experience. We went to the room on the 10th floor only to find that it had a very small step out balcony. There was not room for a single chair much less a table into chairs which is what were in the other room that we had. I called downstairs and another agent answered and I asked if our original 9th floor room was available and I was told that it was not. I was told that the 5th or 6th floor where the highest floors available at this point. I went downstairs to speak with the lady that was helping me and she said that the 9th floor room was available. She gave us the keys to that room which is where we stayed for the night. Again the room was very average so if you \u2019re looking for a luxurious room then you will not find it here. It has been updated and it is modernized but still average. We stayed at the Omni three years before and it is very nice and luxurious at that hotel. I do not see us going back to this hotel but I do appreciate the efforts that were put forth to help us have a enjoyable stay.", "offset": [3544, 3603], "date": "2019-07-29", "cpt": "3", "category": "renovation"}]}
