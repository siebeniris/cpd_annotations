Thank you Holiday Inn and particularly the very pleasant mini bus driver who collected us from the airport. Of course we had no intention of staying hereThe George Bush Airport management need to try travelling through their airport to experience the hell we intercontinental passengers have to contend with. We arrived on a surprisingly sparsely populated flight from London a ten hour flight on which we were able to lie across three seats each we thought we were lucky. In retrospect it seems other travellers have learned the lesson from experiencing what we were were just about to endure and found alternative routes. Plodding the long route to \u2018 Immigration \u2019 brought us to a large hall with in the first stage we were confronted with probably 20 modern state of the art passport reading data collection machines. It is apparent from 95 of incoming passengers being directed to the queue with a CROSS on the resultant print out. illustrates that these state of the art machine were as much use as a chocolate tea pot. I estimate that there were 300 passengers in the queue line for immigration and only two of the desks were open. 2 hours later we emerged from this inefficient utterly farcical process to rush to baggage reclaim to retrieve our luggage for onward travel. All the carousels were stopped little in the way of a clue which group of off loaded bags might be ours. 10 more minutes wasted. Off to check in our bags to be told that out flight 2130 was \u2018 delayed \u2019 until tomorrow morning. This is not any definition of delay with which I have been previously aware the flight was cancelled cynically categorise as \u2018 delayed \u2019 without any regard for the inconvenience to us United Airlines customers or for those who were travelling to meet us. It is fair to point out that after queuing for another 40 minutes we spent a further 40 minutes being processed allocated a room and food vouchers and a flight for the morning.
