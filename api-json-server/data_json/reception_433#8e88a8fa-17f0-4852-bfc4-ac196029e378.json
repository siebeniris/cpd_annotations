The hotel although small was beautiful and very well looked after. The staff were extremely attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are cleaned twice daily and were always extremely clean and tidy. No matter how much of a mess you left it in your room would always be spotless by the time you came back to it. There is also lots of activities to do at and around the hotel for families and couples. The variety of water sports is brilliant and Ryan and the rest of his team looked after my siblings and I very well. They taught us how to sail a catamaran and once they were happy with our newly learnt skills we were able to sail it by ourselves. They also took us to feed and swim with turtles which was breathtaking. no need to go on an expensive boat trip to see them when you can do it for free at this hotel.

My review of the Fairmont Royal Pavilion be divided into sections room restaurant amenities activites customer service and overall summary. The room was to be expected \u2026 spectacular. All rooms have an ocean views with a large spacious balcony. The room was larger then standard hotel size with a kid bed two side tables desk vanity side chair chaise etc. The built in closets allowed for plenty of cloth storage. The bathroom was not so spacisous but had everything you need stand alone stone shower tub toilet single sink with large vanity. The room included an alarm clock with lightning charge dock iPhone two telephones mini fridge which was TINY and fully stocked hair dryer from the 80 \u2019s I believe etc. We bought some local mango juice and had to really move things around to find room in the dryer fridge. I suppose they are trying to discourage people from buying things off the resort but I felt a little cheated. Also would recommend bringing your own hairdryer and the one in the room is old and not very effective took much longer then my own at home. Overall you can really see they put a lot of money into the renovations even if just from a d\u00e9cor standpoint. I estimated the room d\u00e9cor to be worth around 8k. The restaurant on site was called Taboras. They served breakfast lunch and dinner. They offered breakfast and lunch buffet options as well as a menu to order from. They definitely push people to do the buffet 1 it \u2019s more expensive then ordering from the menu 2 you do it yourself aka save of staff. It would be worth it if you had coffee tea juice omelet toast fruit and yogurt. If you are a light eater like me you \u2019re better off ordering from the menu \u2026 even though it takes longer and the server usually do n\u2019t notice you because they assume you \u2019re doing the buffet. We had to flag down server a few morning after waiting 30 minutes after being seated. Another breakfast tip be very clear when requesting how you like your eggs done. Mine were wrong 3 times. Dinner service was often supplemented with soft atmosphere including local musicians singing or playing steel drums. For dinner some nights they have feature menus. We ate at the West Indies night which is more like local food then another lots of spices hints of curry etc. You can expect to pay 150 200 USD per couple for dinner 1 ap 2 mains 1 desert 2 drinks. Service was good but I was a bit disappointed as I really expected amazing. The Fairmont name comes with a lot of prestige and quality I felt it lacking a bit here. We also noticed the chef or manager would sometimes mingle around and ask tables how everything was going. Our table was often skipped. I would prefer not to jump to conclusions about discrimination of ageism however we were the youngest couple by far staying at the resort and I ca n\u2019t help but feel it played into how we were treated and served. There was a large list of included activities and amenities that the Fairmont offered. Afternoon tea was by far my favorite. From 4pm5pm daily tea coffee and some biscuits were served in the Taboras. It was a nice way to end the day at the pool or beach before heading to the room to get ready for dinner. Afternoon tea service was wonderful. I also like the swim with the turtles which I would say is a must do in Barbados due to the large nesting turtle population. We were lucky enough to see two sea turtles the day we went out. Simply fantastic. You could also use paddle boards and kayaks. The customer service at the Royal Pavilion was good. Above average but not amazing. I would say I have had better service elsewhere which really pains me to say. I did have higher expectations for the money we were spending. Maybe it was just us as you could clearly see other people really pleased. There appeared to be a small group of \u201c regulars \u201d who most of the staff know by name. Our room was always very clean and if you were staying by the pool or on the beach someone was always walking by every hour to check if you were good or needed anything. However I felt the restaurant lacked a bit. This might have to do with outside factors but again I ca n\u2019t help but feel like we were treated differently then other guests. My overall impression was the Fairmont Royal Pavilion was a wonderful prestigious resort with ample amenities and beautiful rooms. The resort is small and intimate whilst still having everything you need. I feel the service could be improved for the restaurant staff but the rest of the resort staff were excellent including room concierge front desk etc. Do I think it \u2019s worth the cost. Not really but let \u2019s face it \u2026 if you \u2019re staying here you really do n\u2019t have a problem with your finances. You are paying for the Fairmont name and reputation as well as location which was fantastic. I wish there was more life around the hotel at time but this also provided the quiet and private atmosphere and you simply can not have both. I would consider staying here again and would recommend it to those looking for a private luxurious getaway.", "offset": [29, 168], "date": "2018-02-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "62dc2ee8-a103-4f2d-8a4b-439c178aeada", "sentence": "Great location great room great staff. A little lacking in atmosphere particularly in the evening. My wife and I very much enjoyed our first visit to Barbados 1 8 March 2018 and the location of this hotel and the lovely room one of the Beachfront Junior Suites were key contributors to that. In addition most of the staff we encountered were very friendly and welcoming. Breakfasts were great good quality food plenty of choice good service and a nice relaxed atmosphere. However we were on a half board basis and we were extremely disappointed with the offering in the Taboras restaurant in the evening. The menu choice was very limited and the restaurant was virtually deserted and hence lacking in atmosphere. Maybe a more extensive menu would have tempted more clients which in turn would improve the atmosphere. We had two evening meals in the Palm Terrace restaurant both of which were of good quality. the buffet offering on the evening of the Managers cocktail party was surprisingly good but again we felt the restaurant lacked real atmosphere. The tables were spaced quite far a part and it was fairly sparsely occupied on both occasions. We chose to eat out on the other evenings of our stay and so effectively lost the benefit of our half board package. After dinner there was nothing happening in the hotel and the bar area was completely dead. We stayed at the bar with 2 other couples until about midnight one evening the night of the Managers cocktail party and we were literally the only guests there. Some form of music or entertainment might have encouraged a little more activity around the bar during the late evening. A big disappointment for us was the non event of having our own butler. We were looking forward to this experience and from what we had seen and heard of butlers at other hotels around the world expected it to add an extra level of enjoyment to our holiday. We met the lovely Curtis on check in. He showed us to our room and he told us he would be looking after us during our stay but it was two full days before we saw him again and then only fletingly as he was passing our seats by the pool. I did not expect or wish to be waited on hand and foot but it would at least have been nice had he checked with us once a day to see I there was anything he could do. In the end when I did need something I had to send a message via another butler and even then he did not respond until the following day. You make a big thing of the butler service as part of the offering in your Beachfront Junior Suites. Based on our experience it is service that added little or no value. I can not believe that is your intention. Curtis was not even in evidence when we came to check out. The General Manager Tom very pleasant and appeared receptive to our brief comments about the food offering we said that we would not opt for half board if we were to return to the hotel. We were also very grateful for the speedy and unfusy way in which he responded to our request for a late check out thank you. The setting of the hotel is wonderful and the maintenance of the grounds and the standard of our room was first class. The personalised toiletries were a nice touch. The staff were generally very friendly. Sorry I can not remember names but all the Concierge team were helpful as were most of the Reception staff and all the restaurant staff waiters and managers were always very welcoming. Housekeeping was also at a high standard and the pool guys and beach attendants were friendly and helpful. The wi fi was as good as any I have known in any hotel and the complimentary Press Reader service was appreciated and worked well. Unfortunately due to the prevailing sea conditions for the majority of our stay we did not have an opportunity to enjoy any of the water sports offered by the Beach Club. We would love to return to Barbados and would seriously consider a return to the Royal Pavilion possibly bringing our adult kids ages 19 22 24 but we would have a concern about the evening food options and particularly the lack of any entertainment and hence atmosphere in the bar area in the evening.", "offset": [3230, 3414], "date": "2018-03-14 11:52:24", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "cfed90db-a9f7-4080-9c2c-0fe15b41db62", "sentence": "Staff is friendly and food is on time but presentation was tht pretty.", "offset": [0, 70], "date": "2018-05-07 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "246c457d-fbb9-4c2a-943e-ccf664c5034f", "sentence": "Barbados total relaxation.

However although it was a Sunday the reception staff were able to make some changes and we were allocated an acceptable room. All this was a surprise as we had booked a year in advance and the hotel was by no means full. Our room lived up to all expectations as we had already seen the upgrade last year. We spend most of our time around the pool and as always we were well looked after by the staff. However in previous years we would have a cold towel in the morning and a cold smoothie in the afternoon. This year there was a mixed service. Sometime we had both sometimes only one there did not appear to be any plan. Lastly and probably most importantly although we enjoyed the food in both the Palm Terrace and Taboras we would not describe dinner as five star which we would expect in such a hotel. I am sure that if such a facility existed people would spend more time eating in house.

Afternoon tea was complimentary for one night of the stay and quite tasty5. Food in the restaurant is of a reasonable standard and fairly pricedNEGATIVES1. Emails to the hotels advertised web address to advise of our arrival and departure details failed to receive answers for more than 2 days2. Despite requesting an early check in as a benefit of both Platinum status in Le Club Acor and FHR the hotel denied receiving this request and we had to wait an hour for the room to be made available3. Once we arrived at the room despite booking a beachfront suite we found we had been downgraded to an oceanfront room. Initially the front desk staff tried to pretend the room was indeed what we had booked. Eventually they agreed it was a downgrade. It was lovely but definitely not the suite we had booked. We never received an explanation for the downgrade and can only imagine the hotel had overboked. They did agree to reduce the room rate to that of the room rather than suite but that is a minor consolation for the downgrade and the least we would have expected. On this point we have still not received the refund for the rate difference between the pre paid oceanfront suite and the oceanfront rom4. The minibars in the renovated rooms are not working. Instead there is a letter stating that items may be ordered through room service with a supplemental delivery charge5. We received a letter advising of the services of our butler to include packing unpacking complimentary pressing ice wake up with tea coffee as well as evening canap\u00e9s served in the room after 530pm. We never saw our butler during the stay and equally never received any of the advertised butler offerings. Equally we did not receive the promised bespoke amenities including the beach bag etc 6. We had pre booked the hotel car to take us to the airport the morning of our departure and reconfirmed this the night before. However the car did not turn up for our transfer. When the front desk called to find out what had happened the taxi was at the airport waiting for us. The hotel had booked our transfer FROM the airport instead of TO the airport despite knowing we were in house guests. In the end they booked us a regular minibus which was far from the standard of the luxury car we had booked and was included in our rate. To date we have received no apologies from the hotel either for the involuntary downgrade to a room lack of early check in being set up lack of butler services nor the mishap over our transport to the airport. Additionally we have not received the promised refund for the price differential between suite and room. The hard product since the renovation is very nice but unfortunately let down by a lack of good customer service. Staff smiled and appeared outwardly friendly but that is where it ended and certainly there was not the proactive service you expect in a Fairmont or any other 4 or 5 star hotel charging greater than a 1000 per night. How do you maker sense of the disconnect between reviews of the hotel some give it huge praise and 5 stars. Others like myself encountered major customer service failings. Part of it may be cultural in the sense that the Caribbean way of life is laid back but that should not result in staff being less attentive or slap dash. I think if you luck out and everything goes clockwork with the stay you will really enjoy yourself. But if mistakes are made by the hotel do not expect them to admit to it or apologize and they do not seem to know the concept of service retrieval in the same way North American properties do. If you decide to stay here I suggest you double check everything before you arrive including room type services to be expected and ground transfers. However to be safe I would suggest you consider other options on the Island until the hotel management can get the customer service aspect of the the hotel up to 5 star standards.", "offset": [1271, 1358], "date": "2019-04-02 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "96eff42e-3db5-4445-809b-675322b6f979", "sentence": "The most relaxing holiday in the Caribbean.

Carbonara does nt use cream or onions and used panceta not bacon finally the use of nutmeg is correct but not in the excessive quantities used all i could taste was a very strong over powering flavour of nutmeg. The response was that my understanding of a carbonara was like a true italian carbonara the fairmonts version as i was told was more like an alfredo although alfredo was a seperate dish on the menu so not sure how you would differ or why you would call something carbonara on the menu if it was nt carbonara. The gesture to remove the dish for the bill was correct if we were nt on half board. Breakfast. Some mornings we had to wait an extended period to be seated as no staff was at the desk. We assumed was just a buffet as a la carte was never offered. However website research prompted us to ask one morning and to our surprise found it was offered. Anything served on the buffet hotplates was lukewarm at best. Whilst we were there it took 3 days to fix the lid on the fresh fruit so that it did nt fall off backwards onto the floor everytime someone tried to access the fruit. Beach Club. i was expecting a different lunch menu here to that of the main restuarant however it appeared to be the same. Missed opportunity for another differentiator. Additionally service was slow for most of our lunch only one member of staff was operating. having to disapear for periods of time to collect food orders. Beach and Pool Service outside of the ritual morning smoothie i think it was supposed to be icecream or sorbet service was significantly lacking. One member of staff appeared to be working both the beach and pool areas to serve drinks but was rarely seen to make requests and rarely proactively approach us to ask if we needed anything. Afternoon Tea I m just glad it was complimentary. Sandy Lane is a destination for Afternoon Tea drawing in locals and tourists from other hotels. I ca nt believe anyone would come to the fairmont for Afternoon Tea. Someone needs to find a new scone recipe. What was served resembled welsh cakes. No napkins were provided and the only cutlery supplied was the butter knife on each slide plate. We were two adults and a 2year old however no additional plate was offered for the baby despite her being sat in a baby seat at the table. a very wobbly table that split tea unles i held my foot on one of the table leg feet. Finally upon checkout nobody asked if we had enjoyed our stay simply asking if the bill was right and taking payment. I find it shocking that despite knowing that we paid for half board but only ate once in the hotel that no one questioned this or asked about our stay. I wonder if our experience would have been any better re food if the Palm Terrace Restuarant was actually open but we were told 2 days prior to our stay that this would be closed throughout our stay. I was shocked that the hotel had no backup generators for power as we found out due to experiencing a number of power outages on the island. Aprecaite that you ca nt control the electricity supply as a 5 star hotel it s expect preparation for such events. Sadly a number of other guest we talked to throughout our stay also expressed disapointment with the food so i know it s not just us. I would like to say that this is the first time i ve felt so strongly about my experience somewhere that i ve had to complain. We wo nt be staying at a fairmont again and am currently planning our next trip to Barbados next year at one of your competitors.", "offset": [0, 85], "date": "2019-11-29 15:08:52", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "4931e88b-46b6-4287-bfbd-efe5279c6dbe", "sentence": "The bedroom was lovely poor service in all FB outlets. This visit was our 3rd to the Fairmont however the title really says it all. Great room with all the amenities you could wish for and lovely views over looking the sea. The service from Reception and the Front Hall Porters was very good and no real complaints regarding Housekeeping either. That \u2019s where the good news ends. The service in Restaurant for Dinner was very poor although the food when it did arrive was good. The Bar service was no better either with the drinks and wine taking an age to arrive. Most of the staff were complacent and appeared uninterested in serving guests and spent much of their time chatting to each other. Breakfast was poor in terms of variety of choice and looked unappetising at best. Service again was very poor as each morning we repeated had to ask for our coffee tea. We ordered a sandwich at the Beach Bar and after 45 minutes we enquired as where the sandwich was only to be told they had been very busy Rubbish. When we arrived all had been serviced with just a group of 4 waiting for their lunch. The waitress told us \u201c the Chef had just returned to the kitchen \u201d which begs the questions as to Where she had been. We cancelled the sandwich and left. After saying 4 nights with you we went to Coral Reef for the remainder of our Holiday our 10th visit here and the service was absolutely excellent as always. We ate in various Restaurants over our 9 days stay on he Island all with the exception of the Fairmont was superb. We do like the Fairmont group and have stayed at many in our time. We are planning to celebrate New Year at the Fairmont St Andrews Scotland as we have visited this this Hotel on several occasions mostly over New Year. and we know the service will be extremely good. Sorry for the poor review however on speaking with other visitors both at your Hotel and on the Island many to commented that they either experienced or had heard that the service was generally poor.

We had a most memorable and magical vacation staying at the Royal Pavilion Fairmont. We were welcomed with open arms from the minute we arrived and left with big hugs when we left. So fortunate to have Chantel there for us upon our arrival 2 days early. She was most kind finding us a superb room with every possible comfort. Jason at the reception was so great with us as well. And of course Michael Sealy. Such a pleasure to deal with them and others of course and share laughter as well. In the dining room we had the pleasure to meet Nicole Tyrisha Brittany Tiffany and Sabrina and so many others. Always so attentive and full of smiles. The breakfast was wonderful. So much choice. Later in the day do nt miss the flying fish burger. Delicious. Kevin the bartender was great and very kind. Peter who took care of i believe delivering special gift baskets among other things such a wonderful person to chat with Cynthia who cleaned our room among other sweet ladies was very kind to us and ensured we had anything we needed. On the beach side and pool side the team of guys were great to us especially Michael and Ryan. Simon Julian in charge of recreation was very helpful and knowledgeable. Of course we were so happy to be welcomed by the management at the super cocktail party. It was a pleasure to meet Jean Christophe Martinez and his super team. Pauline the assistant manager and Robert Food and Beverage Manager. We felt like family and enjoyed their company. We can not thank them and all their competent and kind staff enough. We would love to mention everyone. It was so special to spend Christmas with them all in Barbados. It will not be forgotten. I would recommend anyone to go and experience such a paradise. The beach is pristine and beautiful beyond words. The grounds magical with the entertaining green monkeys. Nightly entertainment. Tennis. Catamaran and other activities. We loved it all and wish to go back soon. Thank you everyone so very much.
