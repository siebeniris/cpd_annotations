I must say I was disappointed given all of the great reviews. The food was good the rooms were spacious with nice views it has nice grounds but the hotel was definitely understaffed to handle the holiday we had a few minor issues with our room. 1. Our room smelled of dust actually was a bit dusty. There was only one wash cloth the shower leaked like crazy. 2. For breakfast we had to wait 15 minutes for someone to take our order at the restaurant then another 15 minutes for the waiter to verify our stay for breakfast room rate. 3. At the pool after 3 hours no one came back with our food and drink bill to sign or to see if we needed anything else. I could not track down our waiter anywhere but I had given him my room number when we ordered. We went back up to the room since we have a small child and she needed to get out of the sun for a bit. Got a call in the afternoon that we still had an open tab at the pool and the guy asked me to meet him in the hotel lobby. I have no idea who he was or where he was. I trekked through the whole lobby and both pools and could not find anyone and no one knew who called me. On my way back I found our original waiter he said he was not the one who called. He did not remember our order had to redo the bill. Luckily I was not billed twice on my final invoice which I was concerned would happen but still really annoying. Good food spacious rooms nice grounds covered parking lot About 4 miles away there is a mall and some good restaurants. More staff to handle the holidays.

We arrived for a 4 night stay at the JW between Christmas and New Years with 4 adults and 3 kids. Overall it was an outstanding stay with a few notable highs and lows. PROs. The Property is large with so many fun things for kids to do and see like mini golf several pool options a basketball hoop swans birds in the lobby flamingos and of course the boat rides around the lake and to the restaurants every evening. The guys that drove the boats were all super nice and gave little facts about the property during our rides. The hotel had nice Christmas decor and everyday they had a different treat in the lobby that the kids loved. The property has several on site restaurants and we tried them all and there was a full service Starbucks as well. As a platinum elite with Mariot I got a free continental breakfast for myself and a guest and so each day we ate at the on site restaurant the RockWod Grille. We upgraded to the full buffet a few days for just 8 more and both options were solid. The kids menu had a great assortment of options and really reasonable prices. We ate both inside and outside at the Rockwod and both were great. We had dinner at both Mikado the Japanese restaurant and Fishermans landing and everyone was happy at both. We ate at the polside restaurant one day for lunch and had snacks and dessert in their lobby bar area too. every place had something for everyone and the kids especially loved the Donut Tree dessert offered in the Lobby Bar. The rooms were both a pro and a Con. Our rooms were way delayed in being ready at check in so they gave us a temporary room to change in and the room was an outdated room with old decor and furnishings and a popcorn ceiling. When our rooms were finally ready we were fortunate enough to have a remodeled room which was much more contemporary and nice. CONS. The hotel is Noisy. There is a giant opened lobby which is great but if you have a room that is facing out onto the big lobby like we did it can be so noisy at all hours of the night and early morning. The hotel did not seem as prepared as they should have been for a major holiday period. Our rooms were so late in being ready but in fairness the hotel offered to make it right and I was very satisfied by their response. Parts of the hotel felt dated like some common area carpeting and other areas but if they renovate them as they are doing the rooms the hotel has the potential to look and feel really nice.

Just spent 4 days here. Typical JW Mariot resort property. First this place is huge. We were lucky that we hit it during a time when there was not a large conference going on. Clearly the resort caters to large scale events and while the core facilities are substantial I would think the public areas might get a bit stressed. Location is great a short drive to all the restaurants and nightlife on El Paseo. Also a quick ride to Palm Springs. The grounds are absolutely stunning and very well maintained. The pool areas are large and we never had trouble finding a place to sit under an umbrella. Again if there were a large event this might not be the case. Room. I asked for a newly refurbished room and was given one. I got the impression that they are trying to keep guests out of the areas that are under renovation because I got a warning that they worked 8 am to 6 pm every day. And they did. But since we were planning on being out of the room all day we had no issues. And I would say the newer rooms are very nice well worth asking for. The only real con was what i would consider some inflated prices. I get that resorts are going to make you pay for convenience but the JW took that to a new level. Just be prepared for a little sticker shock if you plan on lunch and a few drinks around the pool. But hey that is what vacation is forAl in very happy.

I am an Elite member of the Mariot rewards program and therefore have stayed at numerous Mariot \u2019s all over the world. I stay at the JW Palm Desert Springs location often and enjoy the lush grounds and the interior space of the hotel. IT has been always a favorite until now. I was placed into one of their newly renovated king bed rooms with a balcony and found numerous issues with the room and this latest design effort. The biggest was the lack of water pressure even if you tilt the rain water shower head out the water just dribbles straight down. My wife choose to try a bath instead after seeing this yet after \u00bd hour of running the water we got maybe only 6 \u201d of water in the tub. The bed was rock hard vs what used to be soft and comfy plug ins next to the bed did not work we got one robe vs two you ca n\u2019t use a floor mat at the shower entry as the door only pulls so you have to be very careful upon existing the shower so as not to slip on the marble floors the bathroom is not insulated which in doing all this work one would have thought to do this and there is a \u201c strange \u201d table desk arrangement that takes up a lot of space in the room. A 3 \u2019 round table with a large chair is placed in front of the desk area blocking access to it. Not sure why or how this works frankly.

I said I did n\u2019t care about the views. I was assured that we were in a renovated room. We walked in and it did n\u2019t look new but we shrugged it off. Later that night I had to ask them something at the front desk and asked if we were in a renovated room and was told no. The next day we asked to be moved and was. The old beds felt like sleeping on a wooden board. I have no idea how old they were but definitely need to be replaced. The new beds were much better. The problem with the new rooms were the wood or laminate floors on the perimeter of the room carried a lot of residual sound on them from the floors above. Someone was walking on the floors above at 6 am and it was very loud and woke us in our room below. Installing cork would have reduced the sound from the room above. We work in property management and own and operate multiple vacation rentals. I think the hotel is way below the standard for the price they are charging. In addition if Bonvoy is reading this your merger does not offer the same value in awards or value as when it was just Starwod.
