These were very prevalent in our corridor which meant that we could not have an afternoon nap. We also found that there were no safes in the room nor anywhere to hang wet towels. Although it seemed like our room had recently been renovated the building standards were shoddy at best and some of the fixtures were poorly installed.

After pointing out that this is not really how a 5star hotel operates there was only a shrug of the shoulders and an indication that there would be an effort to find the barman. After waiting for about 15 minutes I went to reception but found it empty. I also knocked on the managers door but there was no response. After a while more we were eventually served by a very surly barman although the drinks order was correct. At dinner we were horrified to discover that some of the food was just warmed up leftovers from previous days especially noticeable with the roast potatoes and desserts. However some of the food was actually quite tasty but the service was also pretty poor by some of the waiters. The next morning we reported a blown light bulb and found it in the same state when we returned from our day trip that afternoon. Also while trying to make tea we had to move furniture to find the plug and discovered a pile of dust which did not say much about the attention to details of housekeeping. The shower was a lukewarm affair and for a change dinner did not seem to include warmed up leftovers although it seems no one knows how to roast potatoes in that kitchen. The service was also much better on the second evening due to different staff on duty. At breakfast on our last day we again found that the usual pastries were stale at least a day old if not more. At checkout the credit card paypoints were not working which was an issue for us to settle our bill.
