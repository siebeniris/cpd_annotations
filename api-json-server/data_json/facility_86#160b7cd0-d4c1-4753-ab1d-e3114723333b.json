From Katrin who saved the day when we had a pet emergency that required us to postpone our trip in February to the last good bye from Makala in the Club Lounge on our 5th day it was an unforgettable experience. The people are amazingVance Daniel Anna Shirley Penny and too many others to mention it was clear their number one priority was to insure we had a memorable visit. We generally stay on the CLub Level at The Ritz and this was the nicest Lounge with the best variety and qaulity of offerings we have seen. It is more expensive but well worth it. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable with the usual Ritz amenities very well done. The beach is very nice but did get a little crowded at times but the beach staff was always helpful when needed. The water sports equipment is included in the resort fee and it was nice not to feel nickeled and dimed every time we wanted to do something. We played a lot of tennis and it was great. They have two omni courts artificial grass and sand that are very easy on yhour body. The courts could have been in a little better shape but were very playable. The only real negative of the visit was the the tennis pro who visited every couple of days. Not friendly had not interest in trying to arrange of match find other guests who might want to play etc but the hotel does not hold itself as a tennis resort. The gym is very nice and the spa is wonderful.

We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas staying in an oceanfront queen bedroom. With Bon Voy Ambassador status and previous Ritz stays my expectations were high but tempered by recent reviews and understanding that they are still recuperating from the hurricanes. However we were extremely disappointed with the consistency of service offered. We take this special trip every other year and were extremely disappointed with our stay. From the beginning we were not able to reach anyone at the hotel via phone or email to answer questions related to the reservation. One time that I did talk to someone it took over an hour on the phone to attempt to change our room type. After leaving several messages and emails for a concierge no one ever responded. Eventually our Mariot Ambassador was able to confirm everything for us before we arrived. While the check in process was simple through the ap and the welcome lovely after several calls to the front desk we were told that we would need to pay an additional 350 night for access to the Club Lounge regardless of the lifetime status. We made several requests at the concierge desk the pool deck and over the phone to reserve a pool cabana and never received any response. Half of the time when we would call for reservations or room service no one would answer the phone at all. While lounging at the beach the service was spotty and inconsistent at best. There was an issue with the Sails kitchen which prompted a very limited menu for lunch and food being prepared next to the pool beach on grills under a tent. I was not expecting just one restaurant on property to be available for meals. Our room was on the 5th floor of building E and with only one elevator on the other side of the building I would not recommend this hotel for anyone with mobility issues. There are stairs everywhere throughout the main building to and from the pool and the beach etc. The construction of the family pool was very disruptive. It was visible from every room and the hotel attempted to disguise with music that started early each morning on the pool deck with the same playlist each day. The construction definitely cuts into the pool deck and you need to reserve your pool loungers early in the morning if you want a place to sit. At the beach you need to reserve a chair early in the morning if you want to sit in the front row. The attendants were friendly but not helpful even with tips. There just did not seem to be any focus on the customer experience at this resort. A couple of staff members were very friendly Lisa from in room dining was a delight each morning but not able to hold the rest of the resort to the same standards.", "offset": [1893, 1989], "date": "2020-01-29", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "f32ad2ce-4993-47b5-8a10-8d65178c5feb", "sentence": "Service not up to par for a Ritz Carlton property. We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas staying in an oceanfront queen bedroom. With Bon Voy Ambassador status and previous Ritz stays my expectations were high but tempered by recent reviews and understanding that they are still recuperating from the hurricanes. However we were extremely disappointed with the consistency of service offered. We take this special trip every other year and were extremely disappointed with our stay. From the beginning we were not able to reach anyone at the hotel via phone or email to answer questions related to the reservation. One time that I did talk to someone it took over an hour on the phone to attempt to change our room type. After leaving several messages and emails for a concierge no one ever responded. Eventually our Mariot Ambassador was able to confirm everything for us before we arrived. While the check in process was simple through the ap and the welcome lovely after several calls to the front desk we were told that we would need to pay an additional 350 night for access to the Club Lounge regardless of the lifetime status. We made several requests at the concierge desk the pool deck and over the phone to reserve a pool cabana and never received any response. Half of the time when we would call for reservations or room service no one would answer the phone at all. While lounging at the beach the service was spotty and inconsistent at best. There was an issue with the Sails kitchen which prompted a very limited menu for lunch and food being prepared next to the pool beach on grills under a tent. I was not expecting just one restaurant on property to be available for meals.

My fianc\u00e9 and I are frequent Ritz Carlton vacationers this was our first time at the St Thomas resort and sad to say it will be our last as well. After reading reviews we understood that the hotel is just starting to come back together after the huricane renovation. Upon arrival to the hotel our check in process was very strange. We were kind of brought around to different areas of the lobby until we were sat down and someone came over to help us. It seemed like staff was unsure what to do with us. We did not like that our bags were sitting in a pile of other peoples luggages outside the hotel until our room was ready. Mind you we absolutely love the Ritz located on cayman island and all their other properties. Our hotel tour guide was great in showing us around and answering general questions. The view from the resort is stunning in itself. It was pouring our first day so we were looking to browse the shops at the hotel do anything however only their jewelry store is open all the other shops are not yet ready. To my knowledge there is no arcade or really much else to do besides lounge at the pool beach activities and excursions. Calling concierge the staff was not very knowledgeable on what stores are open which surprised us. Also we were being called by the wrong last name our entire trip do not know what was up with that. We had club access where we spent a lot of our time having drinks and munching on snacks which was nice. Our first night we ate at Bleu water restaurant the atmosphere was bland decor was lacking it came across like more of a family restaurant less of a romantic feel we were trying to go for being a steakhouse. Our food took over an hour to come out. However our food was tasty. Our next day we reserved a cabana by the pool which was nice. When we got to the pool area I let staff know we have a cabana reserved and we were told oh no they are all reserved I let them know I reserved mine a week before our trip then I was led to my cabana which was not set up yet. It was 11 am they rent out from 9 am for the day. Service was just ok. The beach is not the most enjoyable due to all the coral sea grass. This is definitely not a pure white sand beach Incase that is what you are looking for. Only one pool is open right now so everyone is congested into one area. There is a slide being built which looks fun for the kids. I highly recommend taking the ferry over to trunk bay beach in St John it was the highlight of our trip. That beach is beautiful pure and memorable. Pros. Staff was very very kind. They can drive you anywhere via golf cart should you choose not to walk. I truly feel bad writing this review because staff is so so nice however they were poorly trained lacking guidance. The room was clean and newly renovated. Bathroom was extremely spacious perks for water toilet having its own door. The property was beyond beautiful and everything is just a close walk away. Cons besides everything I mentioned already bathrobe was dirty with makeup smears. Food not good. Served raw food twice on our trip. Overall we love staying at the Ritz properties we love being club level. however there are nicer Ritz caribean locations than st Thomas they still need to get their act together here a bit to say the least. Nothing to quite rave about just yet. Food options could be better. Service at coconut cove was very strange my food was raw food is not Ritz Carlton quality. Room service food quality was not good plates came dirty and food did not look pleasant to eat. A Ceasar salad at the ritz should not be salad from a bag with bagged shredded cheese soggy pieces of bread serving as croutons and bottled dressing. Our room service chicken fingers were completely raw pink. My husband got sick. The kids can get sick this way. Where is the ritz quality. This luxury hotel giant is going down hill. No longer luxurious ritz Carlton.

I travel 6 months out of the year travel the world over. In most place \u2019s that have a Ritz it \u2019s my number one choice as I know what to expect I have never had a bad experience in all my stays. I know about the hurricanes yet after calling was assured I would not be disappointed. To start checking in was very confusing took some time. They explained nothing to me just stating how to get to my room. I was not given a map which is needed for the property nor was there one in the room. The phone systems buttons were not working after a long flight being very tired getting a busy signal from room service for 3 hours I called the front desk to be told the phone buttons do n\u2019t work to just dial 0 for everything. Nothing in the room stated that or anything about the hotel. Room service took an hour was one of the worst meals I ever had. I tried it 2 more times with things you ca n\u2019t mess up yet everything was bad extremely over priced. I tried the free breakfast in the restaurant once yet people had to wait 20 30 minutes to pay or to sign for the free breakfast they were getting mad at people who were getting up leaving. I would call ask for items without anyone showing up. The walkway to get anywhere in the hotel from where I was at was covered in mud at a work site never cleaned up even after I said I almost fell saw 2 others fall at the same place. There is no check in desk I never received a receipt in person or email of my stay as did the people in my cab I as they could n\u2019t find anyone to checkout. The TV basically never worked the whole stay even though I reported it as well. The worst thing was I called to have my bags picked up by 9 am to make my flight. They never showed I called. 945. they said they would be right there. 1020am I took my bags walked up the long hill to the front of the hotel sweating profusely almost passing out. I am disabled Rooms are about 100 per day yet with the service of a cheap hotel. The 890 NewYorker hotel I stayed at before. after my trip there had 100 better food service. I book most of my hotels as this through \u201c AMX platinum fine hotels resorts \u201d this hotel is nothing close. Ritz Carlton I pay expect get better food service at your hotels resorts I have till this trip \u201c always \u201d gotten it you need to fix it. I am going back to the Virgin Isles next month yet not or ever staying at the ritz again. I talked to several people that were having the same experience. In the 35 hotels I have stayed in the last year non were even close to as bad as this stay.", "offset": [523, 750], "date": "2020-03-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}]}
