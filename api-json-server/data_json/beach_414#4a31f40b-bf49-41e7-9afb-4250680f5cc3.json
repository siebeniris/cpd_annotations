My wife and I have been to several all inclusive resorts and this was by far our favorite. We went here with a group of 4 couples and had a fantastic time. The staff are really what makes this place so great. Jonathan and Rafael at the Excellence Club Beach Area were awesome. They were both very friendly and outgoing. I can not imagine either one of them ever having a bad day. These guys went out of their way to make sure that we had everything that we needed and our glasses were never empty. They even brought snacks around every once in a while. They definitely went above and beyond for our group. Marlo was really great too. He did a water aerobics class that my wife loved. We also hung out with him after hours after having our dinner. I would have given this place five stars but the food was pretty average inconsistent and the restaurants could be very crowded and slow. Breakfast at the buffet in the main house was great though. Try the red sauce at the omelet station. One other thing. They keep the place spotless. There are guys raking the beach by hand everyday.

The towel attendants Wilmy and the little girl on the far beach concierge sorry I do not remember her name but was a hoot trying to teach us a new word every day. They were so congenial made us laugh every time we got new towels. Beach towels were wonderful. They were thick and unlimited. Here is where I need to state that we did not do the Excellence Club. We just did not spend the additional not to say you should or should not it you are into that perhaps someone else can speak to that. But our trip was wonderful without it so you decide for yourself. The French Resturant was our favorite. Chateaubriand seemed to be our groups fav. Oh and the Crembrule simply to die for. We also enjoyed the Italian. Watch the portions here because they are huge. We opted for the appetizer size and it was more than enough. The Grill was neat as we ordered the different meats and they were all very good. Barcelona was ok not our favorite but that might have been a poor choice of the menu. We also enjoyed the Mexican and the Oregano. The deserts all over were scrumcious. The service was top notch. We enjoy our evening meal so it was a dining experience every night. They put on a large buffet theme every other night so we did that for Dominican Independence Day. They certainly go to a lot of work to make your vacation all you want. Seriously if you want something ask We stayed in building 12 our room was spacious service was impeccable. And although it was a little walk once we got our bearings it was just fine. We traveled with 2 other couples and we did not have to wait more than 15 minutes at any other the restaurants and they were able to put us in the same building. Beach chairs were no problem to get in the morning and in the afternoon at the pool we were always able to get a home base and someone was able to find a floatie to act as bar. This is a good time to talk about the pool. The main pool stretches from the lobby to the eastern end of the resort. Sort of winding there is an activity area with volleyball at one end. The swim up bar is in the middle and it gets shady there in the afternoon then you go to the other end and it tended to be a little quieter. The pool was not so wide that you could talk to someone on the other side without yelling. Then at the far eastern end it gradually get shallower to walkout. There is also the cascade pool over at the western side. We went over there a couple time to check it out but did not stay to long as it was a little more crowded. Check out the sports bar. it is hidden over by the tennis courts but really a neat place for an ice cream fix. We found the beach wide and expansive great place for a walk along the water. The current and waves are strong. Red flags everyday. But if you walk to the point you can wander out a ways in the ocean without getting blasted by waves. The breeze was welcome as we never had issue with mosquitos until we got back to the room and left the door open at night. They do fog daily but there are no screens on the door to leave it open. The grounds are wonderful very well kept. Love the big palm trees and it will be something for them to contend with when the new Excellence opens in the fall.

This proves to be a challenging review and rating so I will attempt to segment it so as to be more specific. Note I paid for the club upgrade at the time of booking my reservaton. Let me begin with the positives. Grounds view reserved club beach and room were spectacular and I would give an Excellent rating. The room was spacious with a glorious view of the pool and beach. A lovely flower arrangement and swan towel display awaited me upon arrival. The mini bar was quickly restocked according to my preferences. Turn down bed service and house keeping were excellent and they did a very nice job of tidying the room while I was out so as not to disturb. Desk staff at the concierge club room and on the reserved club beach were fantastic Excellent. I simply can not give them enough praise for going over the top in greeting me anticipating needs providing options arranging a massage at the spa and even helping me procure a few specific souvenirs. Service in the upstairs club area where snacks and beverages were offered was hit and miss. One lady in particular seemed to be consistently having bad days and only cheered up and became attentive to guests when a supervisor happened to walk in one day. The other challenge was with the snack offerings. I have to maintain a 100 gluten free diet due to having celiac disease and only once was someone able to confirm the ingredients so I could enjoy a bite of the prepared dishes it was a chef who happened to walk in at that exact moment. The fragrance inside the club was overpowering in my opinion and gave me a headache on several occasions. I had to sit outside on the balcony just to avoid the strong scent. It was a pleasant smell but needed to be toned down big time. The club beach itself was so inviting clean and relaxing. It was exactly the get away I was hoping for. Again though food snacks was a challenge on the beach as no one really understood the need for gluten free despite my broken Spanish and showing the Spanish gluten free translation card given to me at the club in addition to a celiacs gluten free Spanish card I had brought along. So I took my own snacks that I had brought with me on the trip. Every day during my trip I observed that swimmers were not allowed to go out more than hip deep. I was told this was due to rip tide dangers and pretty much always the case there at the resort beach. The food overall in my opinion was a tremendous let down. Breakfast I believe the restaurant was called the Tosca was the best selection I could find for decent food and gluten free. Despite showing my two Spanish translation gluten free cards and conversing in broken Spanish it took visits over several days for someone to finally find a chef to walk me through the buffet and point out what dishes would be gluten free. Before that I stuck to the fresh fruit buffet juices raw vegetables cheese and egg. The Italian restaurant servers were familiar with the Spanish gluten free dining card and offered gluten free bread as well as a gluten free pasta although I opted for a lighter dinner entree that was naturally gluten free. The food did not wow me but I was grateful for the service and communication to the Chefs about gluten free and the need to avoid cross contamination. Breakfast at the Lobster House one morning offered a lovely view of the ocean great coffee and a yummy mimosa. They had a limited understanding of gluten free and produced an omelette with veggies. It was so so but I was glad for the nutrition and ate all the veggies plus some of the egg. With these meals I did not get sick or glutened. Dinner at The Lobster House and a lunch at the adjacent restaurant were complete disappointments. The service was excellent both times but the seafood was terrible. I can cook better seafood at home. I got horribly sick glutened mid trip after a meal and was in the bathroom nearly all night. I stuck to my room most of the morning and missed being able to book the included horse back riding on the beach for fear of not having immediate access to a restroom. I forget which restaurant I had dinner at the last night but the waiter came across as very condescending when I showed my gluten free card and explained it was for a diagnosed medical condition. He recommended only two entrees perhaps that is all they could do gluten free I am not sure and insisted it was gluten free. Whether it was the dinner or the seafood luncheon earlier in the day either way I became violently ill glutened again. my last night there. I have never been so sick and kept wondering if I needed to go to the hospital but if I did I would surely miss my flight and chance to get back to the USA for medical care if necessary. The next morning I nearly missed the shuttle to the airport as I was rushing to pack in between still being sick and having not slept. In room dining was very limited as gluten free needs were not understood despite me again conversing in Spanish with the translation cards. The single cup brew coffees in the room were also questionable as one mentioned containing cereals which could indicate gluten. I did not try any of them after that and would only have black coffee in the restaurant. Based on my dining experiences I would actually rate Terrible but because of the other Excellent aspects I have selected Average for overall rating. I have traveled abroad and throughout the USA a great deal and by far this was the most challenging food trip ever. I missed out on enjoying some of the amenities included in my club up sell purchase and have never been so incredibly sick twice no less and that is even considering I have been sick from food water in a third world country where I was not at a safe resort. If you are not celiac and not a huge foodie then I would highly recommend a stay at the Excellence Punta Cana. It was absolutely stunning gorgeous pools clean relaxing beaches and warm hospitable service with fun evening entertainment. If you are a foodie and especially if you have celiac or are gluten free due to a medical condition then I can not recommend this resort. it is great that they hand you a Spanish translation gluten free card upon check in at the club but when minimal staff and restaurants know about it or what to do with it to care for a guest then it is pretty much useless. My hope is that the management and executive chefs will do a better job of training and educating the staff and provide more safe delicious gluten free options for guests with a medical condition in the future.

We are a young couple aged 28 from London and it was our first trip to Punta Cana. We were pleasantly surprised with this resort as we had booked two one for each week and this was our more cost effective resort. However the service and amenities were first class. We were greeted with big smiles and a glass of bubbles. We had the friendliest guy take our luggage to our room and he remained a friendly face who would chat with us for the next week. The staff here go above an beyond to make you feel at home and also keep up the fun atmosphere of the resort. BedromThe whole resort feels natural as there are plenty of trees and planting throughout. Our room was very clean and spacious with a view looking into a courtyard. Air con was great and barely any bugs or mosquitos about. The bed was big and very comfortable with the extra luxury of choosing from the pillow menu. The shower was large with a huge rain shower it was amazing and large double sinks. The jet bath tub in the room was also amazing. Every evening we were given the itinerary for the next day which was helpful along with a spa offer of the day which changed everyday. Drinks FodThe beverages at the bar are okay. I love cocktails and was disappointed with a lot of their cocktails all too sweet and made from syrups which made them taste artificial. However their Coco Loco is so good. They do not have the most premium liquor but they still have a great selection. The buffet food is good but a bit average. We enjoyed the chef stations where you can have fresh meat fish or pasta cooked for you. The Japanese restaurant had great sushi and I was told the hibachi was really good I never got to try this as you had to book in advance but we were disappointed with the hot main meals. Average meals you would find in takeaways. The Lobster House is absolutely delicious. The French restaurant was our favourite. Really good food and tastes very authentic. The Steak restaurant is also our favourite. Large portions which we were surprised at. There was also a Dominican Night where we ate on the beach being served local food. This was delicious. We did not get the chance to try the Mexican or Tapas. We ate dinner around 6307730pm so we never had to queue. However from around 8 pm onwards there was a bit of a wait. Only one evening we had to wait for 1520 minutes for the lobster house. AmenitiesThe beach is gorgeous. Comfortable beach beds all along the private beach and a lot of guests seem to respect the no reserving beds rule. We got the comfortable double bed most mornings. Our next resort was awful for this. The sea is clear and the sand is clean. There are staff working very hard in the heat every single day to clear the seaweed from the beach. There are beach huts at either end where you can rent body boards and other water sport equipment. 3 Bars located across the beach pools and various locations for toilets so you never had to walk farthere is even a cade where they serve nice coffee delicious shakes and ice cream which is not great more like iceThe games during the day were so much fun. Either near the pool or on the beach. The staff are skilled at encouraging people to play and making all the games funny to play and watch. Each game had a prize for the winner which is an extra treat. I won a voucher for a complimentary hydrotherapy at the spa which i will explain laterthere is are outdoor games areas which are great. The mini golf needs a bit of TLCThe pool was great as this stretches along the resort so you can find a quieter area if you wanted to be away from the pool games or pool bar. POOL BAR. Loved it. The spa was really nice. Using my complimentary hydrotherapy voucher I really enjoyed the experience. I wish I had purchased a spa experience here but I saved it for the next resort. Night LifeWe loved loved loved the night entertainment. The live singers were mostly great I think only one did not impress us. The theatre shows were fantastic. Glitzy costumes and mainly acrobatic dancing singing. As we were there for 7 days we got to see all 7 different shows however these seem to repeat every week so we are glad we did not stay for more than one week. There is not much you can do if you are not in the theatre area other than the beach bar or sports bar. It would be nice if there was another bar area with background music playing. The staff were always picking guests to dance with and walk around and sit down for chats. This made the resort feel friendly and more interactive. TipingDo it. The staff work 1214 hour days with 7 12 days on saying on the resort grounds away from their family and children and a couple of days off then back again for 7 12 days. They get paid very little and the extra tips goes a long. Local Dominican currency is fine if you are not American tipping with American Dollars. We took both currencies with us after reading reviews that they prefer dollars. There are staff constantly attending to the resort at all hours making sure it is clean and perfect everyday for guests to enjoy their holiday. We went on the buggy tour excursion to Macau Beach where we passed a lot of local children. I wish I was more prepared and made small bags of treats for them of toys sweets money. They line along the tour paths begging for money. The Buggy Tour was fun. We chose the half day one. I would advise going on a full day excursion to make the most of it as the activities felt quite short. Quick trip to the cave for swimming in the cave for 15 minutes then to the cacao cigar huts nearby. We witnessed a strange dance routine by kids and we expected to to learn about Cacao and cigars but were not really told or shown anything. Just a quick 5 minute explore of the shop where we could taste the different cacao drinks. Then a 15 minute stay on the beach. Likes DislikesOveral we loved the resort itself atmosphere facilities games staff and the beach. All of these felt first class for us. We had a bad experience with one of the excursion agents situated in the hotel separate company from the hotel. when he told us that the bus came at 8 am and to be ready in the lobby at 750am. We were there for 750 waited for half an hour and it turned out the bus had already arrived and left. But the agent was wrong and the pick up time was 750. But the bus still left early. We cancelled and re booked the same tour with a different agent in the hotel. I tried 23 times to attend the beach morning yoga sessions stated on the itinerary but there was never anyone there and the concierge did not know where this was either. I was really disappointed with this as I was really looking forward to it and got up early to be there for 8am. Punta CanaI was told there were a lot of mosquitos so I stocked up on everything there is. We did not get bitten once apart from on the excursion. I was worried as June is supposed to be the hurricane season but it only ever rained in the evening for short spells of 20 minutes half hour. One evening it rained for a few hours fairly early at 830pm ruining the Dominican Buffet Night on the beach. One evening it rained heavy all night with thunder.

We stayed in a Junior Swim Up Suite and would definitely do so again. Just a few steps from our private patio with cabana and into the pool. The staff could not have been friendlier and more helpful. They were also fluent in English. We usually had breakfast and a few time lunch in the main dining area where the buffet is. The area is large beautiful air conditioned and the food is not only delicious but there is a seemingly endless variety of options. When I booked online there was a place to indicate if you were celebrating anything special so I advised it was our 40th anniversary. There was a tray of chocolate covered strawberries fresh fruit and a bottle of champagne in our room when we arrived.

The huge dinner buffet one night on the beach with entertainment was an unexpected pleasure. The pools are large and extend through most of the resort with bars polside as well as a swim up bar. I only visited the swim up bar once because there was a polside bar on the opposite side of the pool from our suite. Waitstaf would take your drink orders and deliver them to you in the pool. It could not have been easier or more relaxing. There are hundreds of covered lounges and chairs both polside and on the beach. The beach is large and clean and yes there is bar service at your lounger on the beach available also as staff would come around to ask if there is anything you needed.

The Kitchen buffet provides a lot to enjoy but the emphasis is on efficiency and expediency. lingering if you are close to close time is not an option understandable but jarring when on vacationCraving real espresso capucino etc. go to Aroma the coffee bar and you will find your delights there. The SPA is amazing well worth it if you are up for a splurge the prices a bit high for the venue are almost justified. The staff and facilities are definitely fantastic just weird to see the same prices as US State side Four Seasons and the like in this environment. On the beach you will be tended to very carefully by the attendants who bring drinks towels or whatever you may be needing. Around 1 pm daily someone comes around with snacks and you can tell the goal is to keep people happy. Be prepared to tip it will impact your quality of drink and vibe of service. In a country where the average worker makes about 300 a month it seems a reasonable exchange to feel like royalty. We came with several 1s and 5s and tipped when we felt the service was excellent not as a habit. The shows are entertaining and better than nothing at all. You are not in Vegas but the effort to give guests a pleasant and distracting experience is there. We never made it to the disco but thoroughly enjoyed the Silent Disco on the patio experience one night as well as the Fire breather dancers. We highly recommend you purchase or get a prescription for CIPRO as about 30 of people we interacted with came down with some kind of serious stomach flu. My better half had a rough last two days because of it. I escaped unscathed. Nevertheless stock up on Pepto Imodium Ibuprofen and the like as the gift shop charges highway robbery for it and do not forget the sunscreen 30US for a bottle if you run out. Yup no joke but understandable if you think about it. The transfers which we ordered separate from the hotel were excellent totally work the 180 for a private Escalade going rate for taxis is about 70 to and from PUJ. If you do not mind being on a bus making multiple stops you can get to and from for cheaper but we did not think it was worth it. On arrival or return remember this is not a normal US European destination the airport is a bit chaotic. Arrival was easy pezy but departure somewhat disorganized and frustrating. It did not bother me because the context of the location is a normal factor but some folks got really upset. Pack a lunch so you can munch while in line stay hydrated and wear comfortable clothing. You may find yourself having to run to make your boarding call as we did. Southwest did a great job can not imagine not flying direct though. Bottom line we would go back but better prepared. The beach can not be beat the service we received in the Magna restaurants as well as all the dinner places was amazing and it was probably our favorite vacation ever. We plan on returning just not sure when. A special thank you to Hendrix on the beach Yazmin at the pool Dolores in Lobster House and Ebenezer and Katyia in Magna Anderson in Spice they all did what they could to make us comfy and happy. If you like the coco loco drink make friends with the bartender or waiter to make sure you get your quota put aside coconuts run out. As gross as it sounds the Dirty Banana is a delicious drink and the planters punch with extra ice will make anyone a fan of a sweet cocktail but they will make whatever you want. adventure it is vacation.

We went for our 15th wedding anniversary with friends who were also celebrating theirs. When we arrived our rooms were quite musty smelling but the staff worked hard to correct the problem with dehumidifiers and it did get better. The resort pool is amazing and extends almost the length of the whole resort. The ocean water was rough all week with red flags for rip currents and lots of seaweed. But you can\u2019tbeat the beach and beautiful view and the entertainment staff especially Luz and Felix made it so much fun out at the pool that we did n\u2019t miss being able to swim in the ocean. We played water volleyball Bingo trivia games and even a special Karaoke afternonThe resort was beautifully kept and we found it very clean. Everybody works so hard there and are very nice. The food at all the restaurants was great. We did n\u2019t have a bad meal at all. Our favorite server was Delores who served us at Oregano and then again at the outdoor Dominican Party. We took an excursion Sailing Adventure that we highly recommend. They took us out on a catamaran and we snorkeled and tried Snuba by the reef for a while. Then they took us to a sandbar where we relaxed and had drinks in the water. Finally we came back to shore and they had a delicious local meal prepared for us. My husband and I also tried the spa. I got hydrotherapy and we both got the couples massage. So relaxing. We worked out in the gym as well and they had plenty of equipment and space very little wait time. The shows were fun especially the Michael Jackson show. And we really loved the Silent Party such a cool idea. We walked the grounds where they have beautiful gardens ponds and wildlife. Excellence Punta Cana was exactly what we needed. A perfect getaway for couples to relax and forget their troubles.

Excellence Punta Cana. EPC. 28Aug5 Sep 18. I really had higher expectations. The resort is a good resort. A 35 resort. There is a big language barrier for English speaking travelers and Spanish speaking staff at the resort. I \u2019ve visited some Sandals property and loved that they offered personal butler and concierge rooms who check on you frequently and make sure your experience is memorable and make you feel special. Different variety of room categories. Excellence resorts have a club level upgrade that offer a couple of extras from others like Magna restaurant and private pool bar for club level visitors. Some of the staff are not as friendly or as customer service oriented as I have experienced in Sandals resorts. It could be the language barrier issue. The resort Beautiful grounds. well manicured. One of the best things about the resort is the scenery. The ocean is there to view but the waves are to rough for swimming so you are kind of restricted to the swimming pools. Some days the ocean was bearable but enter water at your own risk. Pool closes to early. Plenty of Restaurants Pools Bars and a Gym and Spa. Gift Cigar jewelry shops a little pricey. bug spray off is 20bring your own you will need it. Doritos 7. Red Bull 5The rooms. A little dated. Couch had some stain spots in ulpostery. Needs a make over and deep cleaning. Like the shower size and rainfall shower head but it does n\u2019t have a complete full closure just half way with opening. The jetted tub is in living area near TV and balcony. Water toilet closet have a glass sliding door. Had issue with air conditioning after changing rooms it seems to be better. Turn down service every night. They forgot to do turn down two night. Had to call for fresh towels. If celebrating an occasion Decorated towels and rose petals and balloons with chocolate were nice touches on a couple of the nights as well as mini treat tray. Thanks. Balcony average size. Get an oceanview or go for the swim outs club level. If you booked the oceanview rooms get the 3rd floor some of the views are just partial. I had Club oceanview but I would have preferred Club swimout. Amenities in rooms some American speaking chanels movies some sports channels. Call for service if on a tight schedule because cleaning service gets behind. The resort would be great if they put just as much emphasis on the food as they do the grounds. Some restaurants met the mark while others fell short. Room service taker 30 40 minutes. Kitchen Table buffet for breakfast lunch not bad I normally ordered items that have to be grilled so it \u2019s hot. The Oregano was terrible we could n\u2019t even eat the food. The shrimp was frozen not fresh old and mushy and over cooked. Oregano service was good. Food fell short. The Grill was great loved the steak and salmon. Seasoned to perfection. Service was excellent. A must try while you are there. Went twice. Magna today Ecxelence Club Members Only breakfast and dinner only. Freshly baked breads for breakfast we call them cake in the states that \u2019s how good they are. Decent menu the go to spot when other spots do n\u2019t satisfy but you must be a club member. The Las Olas hotdog nachos burgers and wood grilled pizza. Lunch snack. The sports bar has the best wings the hot spot for late night snack. Ordered without sauce Fresh to order. The Spice you have to book the same day at 30 for dinner show hibachi. but it fills up quick. I only seen one hibachi room they \u2019re may be two but they should expand to service more customers. You ca n\u2019t book in advance which is ridiculous and no priority or exceptions for Club Members which is insane. If you want without hibachi show they take walk in I \u2019m told. Closed on Wednesday and Saturdays. The hibachi show and food was great. Set menu. Chicken steak shrimp calamari rice vegetables for main meal. Lobster House breakfast was decent has a wait list sometimes for dinner lobster is previously frozen so ok no reservation required. Most seafood here is frozen. Did n\u2019t get to try French restaurant but I heard it was decent. Note men have to be in collared shirts and long pants closed toe shoes for most dinner places. Collard and Bermudas shorts for some. Some flexibility with shoes some wore tennis shoes but no flexibility on collared shirts. We brought dress leather sandals for one husband only wore closed toe dress sandals did n\u2019t wear the open toe dress sandals. Women no issues. Check dress codes on their site. Entertainment they have some great shows. Every night at 930 you will definitely enjoy them. Best I \u2019ve seen in awhile Excellence shows outshined Sandals shows. Best show Brazilian Fire Show Circus Micheal Jackson and Disco. You will receive newsletter nightly for events next day. Events repeat weekly. We stays 9 days seen Micheal Jackson twice but they changed it up which was actually better than the first showing. Karaoke after shows and Night club after Karaoke. Decent night club but no air I could only stay in there about an hour or so closes at 1 or 2 am. Too hot. DJ plays from Request and bar inside. They have a location near gym outdoor games that has pool tables tennis courts archery darts Tennis table mini golf basketball courts. Hit and miss with equipment to play games and someone manning area in room but room stays open we were able to get some equipment but they need to replenish equipment. Games are in the public main pool areas water aerobics poker bingo volleyball etc and the pools are larger instead of at the club pool. So day entertainment is limited if you stay on the club side. I was able to play darts on club sideWish the had more events at club side. Club level has small pool jacuzi private bar. No issues on either side for lounge chairs no need to try to reserve plenty of chairs and towels available. Covered lounge chairs on club side near ocean and bar service at times. Older crowd on club side. The gym. Love the gym. One of the best gyms I \u2019ve seen on the resorts I \u2019ve visited. Variety of equipment. Fresh fruits nuts water infused with fruit chlorophyll. Plenty of towels and bottled water. Concierge Services. The people are really nice and very helpful. You can make inquiries on phone in room or in their office. Marie Leo Sully Gabriele and Tony are wonderful. We even spent some time with Leo Sully and Gabriele when they were off to see some of the countryside. They worked hard to ensure we have a good trip. We were traveling with my sister and brother in law. Note Each department has their own supervisor so you will have to work with them as well for any issues in that department but inform the concierge service and they will expedite the issues and get resolution quicker. Bars Hit and miss. Certain bartenders you must find the ones that work for you. Mrs AltaGarcia thanks for the great Mai Tais. Magna bartenders. Mixed Drinks were n\u2019t as good as other resorts visited but they were ok and each bartender made them different. Premium drinks Henesy Crown Royal Johnie Walker. absolute so mixing with chaser or on the rocks no issues. Dry wines available. Closest sweet wine was Chardonnay. I normally drink Stella Rose. Excursions. Variety Available. The boogie adventure was great muddy but fun. A must do. Went to Wild Tiger for excursions booked through agency on resort. Worked at counter. Could have gotten cheaper but lesson learned. Will book other excursions from different company than hotel for cheaper prices. Booked ATVs Adventure Boogies with Expedia on the resort great deal. Macao Beach was calmer on excursion. Caves on excursions had blue water to take a quick dip in. We went slower on ATVs than the boogies enjoyed boogie with Wild Tiger a little more. They allow other venders to come on weekend and you can make deals. When booking online just ensure your hotel is one of their pickup and drop off. I took recommendations from TripAdvisor for vendors especially transportation to and from airport. I used Dominican Airport Transfers DAT great service and half the price of hotel transfer I had a Cadilac Escalades 4 travelers. and they also have Suburbans. Our driver was Jean Carlos he was great. Look for a deal. Also did a countryside church mall tour with Rodriguez company the food on economy is great real fresh shrimp and seasoned great. Spa. The hydrotherapy wow you ca n\u2019t leave the resort without experiencing it. Included in package. From the sauna to the steam room to jacuzi to warm massage bed massages only the head and neck area not full massage but it was so great you will love it. Full massages are available as well they will put coupons in you room so do n\u2019t pay full price. Candlelight dinner included in our package. Nice set up on the beach. Dinner. 4 different set menus to choose from. I had lobster and beef Rainbow. It was good but not great. I would n\u2019t pay the price that they request for it. Photos taken. The photo counter wanted 25 per photo are they crazy and not even printed out emailed on WhatsAp and CD or they try to offer you a packages that is a ridiculous price. The excursions used WhatsAp and CD and definitely cheaper and in motion photos. Download Ap it will be helpful. Ice cream coffee shop some of personnel were nice but one guy was very unwelcoming like we were bothering him ca n\u2019t remember his name but if you are serviced by him you will know no customer service skills. All and all good trip will try to go back to DR in a year or two but trying a different resort for a little more excitement with relaxation. Heard AM Resorts in DR like Breathless or Secrets are a little more upbeat. Has anyone visitedRecap Grounds are beautiful Entertainment shows great Concierges were wonderful and very accommodating but limited to what they can control. Food Bars hit and miss. Rooms cleaning service are decent. Occasionally Decoration was great but only if celebrating an occasion. Language Barrier issues.

EPC is an amazing hotel perfect location on the beach. Beach cleaned every day with more than enough beds all with shade. The sea is too rough to swim in though. Red flag everyday.

Pity about the idiot who could n\u2019t handle their drink and filled one of the hot tubs with shampoo. Restaurants very good. No booking required. Only once in two weeks were we sent away with the bleper. Plenty of mainline spirts in the bars. My only gripe with the drinks I think if you \u2019ve upgraded to Club you should receive a higher class of drink at the club bars. Maybe a half decent single malt scotch. Better wines and a better choice of beer. French Italian Mexican Asian restaurants very good. The Grilwas good but the service not so good. Coffee house and sports bar very good. Our room in building one was awesome. Great view over the pool and the beach. A small hiccup with the wrong room on day one but the Club staff sorted the problem very quickly with no fuss. All the staff we found to be courteous and friendly. Eco gardens are well worth a walk around. A lovely touch to the hotel. I \u2019m not sure if the cigar shopIs a run by the hotel or is an outside affair. Anyhow it \u2019s a rip off. The cigars are overpriced to the point it \u2019s crazy business practice. You can buy Cubans cheaper at home in the UK. Also the duty free at the airport sells cigars 13 of the hotel shop. Finally Thomas Cook. Never again will I use you.

Just got back from a week long vacation at Exelence Punta Cana. Let me just say that I was looking forward to this vacation and this hotel was recommended by a friend. I did read reviews and they were mostly positive or I was only reading the positive ones. so I thought that this stay would be wonderful. Wrong. Should have read more neutral and negative reviews because believe me they all are true. I wish I listened to them but its too late for me. Check in was quick and easy and the guy who transported our luggage was nice and friendly and very helpful. We paid for an ocean view room the location was great and the view from the room outstanding the beach is breathtaking. The room was spacious and bright the bed was comfortable. No bracelets was a plus. But that \u2019s where all the positives ended. On close inspection things were different indeed. We have traveled all over the Caribbean and I know the humidity can make rooms damp and musty and it \u2019s expected but this was a whole new level of mustiness our room smelled like mold. Their air conditioning system does not remove moisture from the air it actually felt like it added to it. The reason I am saying this is because my sun hats that were dry became fully saturated with water by just laying in the room. Also there were weird bugs crawling from the vent every night see pictures attached. We did asked for a dehumidifier and it made little difference. Also when I became sick and spent a couple of days in bed I have noticed that when my husband would leave the room AC would shut off a few minutes later so when you are out the room is not being ventilated. In 7 days our room was cleaned twice and the cleaning was inadequate. Cleaning lady did not even pick up a washcloth that was on the floor in the shower at all. it \u2019s their policy to leave towels that you wish to be changed on the floor. The floor was swept but not mopped the toilet not wiped. A glass door in the bathroom had fingerprints even before we moved in and remained untoched until we left. A window was white from the salt of the ocean and was never cleaned. Sheets were changed only once which was fine but pillowcases had stains so we just flipped them over. The couch in our room had all kinds of stains so we were never brave enough to use it. I had to call for our room to be cleaned too. After a while we stopped asking and my husband would just call for fresh towels and water. Also note that we left a generous tip for the maid restaurants and everyone we came in contact with and it made no difference. I have to say that the resort itself was clean and it did not make sense that the rooms were so dirty. Also they redid the whole resort in 2017 but it does not look redone inside the rooms they are dingy only two hooks in their shower area no counter space for toiletries a dirty shower half glass wall. Dust and grime on baseboards and all corners in the bathroom. I do n\u2019t know about you but for me cleanliness is very important especially in publicly used places so I am not just being picky. Being a medical professional I fully comprehend what sort of microbes are crawling on unclean surfaces in hotel rooms. Another source of aggravation was no real irons in the rooms just steamers. I did read that they provide them upon request nope called twice never got it. But I was kindly offered to be shown how to use a steamer. So we walked around a little wrinkled especially my husband in his dress pants which were required at dinner places. Food was mediocre not a lot to choose from and overcooked bland and no buffet at night was a negative. Long wait at the restaurants one night we waited 1 hr 40 min to be seated at their French restaurant. I have to add that the French and Asian restaurants were the only half decent ones. do n\u2019t even bother with the rest. The worst thing about their food was food poisoning that I got on my 5th day of stay with nausea vomiting and terrible body chills and fever. I come fully prepared for this kind of event so I did not have to go seek medical help. My husband became sick on our way home and still being sick with the same symptoms three days since. Please note we only ate their cooked food no salads or cut fruit we only drank their bottled water and brushed our teeth with bottled water too. I am hoping to get well soon without going on antibiotics. So far I feel better but Montezuma \u2019s revenge is in full swing unfortunately. Also service at their buffets and restaurants was painfully slow and tipping did not make any difference. Upon entering their buffets hostesses show you where to sit and you can not refuse. One time I asked to be seated by the window but she said no even though there were plenty of empty tables there. Why it \u2019s like that does n\u2019t make any sense at all. It \u2019s a buffet and you should be able to choose where to sit what \u2019s the big deal. Some employees had bad attitudes especially a hostess at their French place. She rudely informed us the first time we went there that she can not sit us and unsure if she would be able to. Excuse me there is no buffet at night and I definitely would like to know if I would be fed dinner since I paid for an all inclusive resort. At our last night \u2019s visit there which was on 1292018 I witnessed her giving her own personal card and asking a couple to write a good review for her in return she promised to sit them the next day without waiting. I wanted to report it but after reading many reviews here I knew nothing would be done anyway so I saved the aggravation. It seems that the hotel manager replies with a canned message that their customer satisfaction is important to them and they have high standads but I beg to differ it is a shady place I might add with no hope of improving based on reviews. Another thing I found to be strange our safe box stopped working 4 hours before check out it just turned off. I was wondering that if someone was planning foul play or what. Not trying to be paranoid here but according to reviews theft is not unusual at this resort so we decided to be careful and took our money passports and electronics out to the beach which was inconvenient. Their beach is gorgeous and huge the ocean is choppy but they do have a great pool wich was enjoyable. You can have as many towels as you would like but only early in the morning. We never had a problem finding a beach lounge but we did reserve them at 7 AM. The seaweed was not a problem but was only cleaned twice in a week. They seemed to be cleaning better in their club area and we were just regular second class guests lol. When I compare it to Mexico this place is sadly lacking service is outstanding in Mexico people are friendly and happy to serve you. Here it \u2019s apparent that the visitors are not welcome. Also the atmosphere is different very sedated and no happy vibe at all. Their night entertainment is cheesy like for most resorts but it \u2019s not a deal breaker the other things are. We ordered room service twice and the food was hot delivered on time and the server was very nice. This is my honest review and experience. I would like to add that if you spend your money on five star all inclusive do n\u2019t waste it on Exelence Punta Cana it \u2019s definitely not a five star resort not even a four star. We visited Iberostar Grand Bavaro a couple of years ago in Punta Cana and loved it this one does not even come close. Iberostar was spotless nice smelling and the food and service was outstanding. Read all the neutral a negative reviews and believe them do n\u2019t make the same mistake we made. I most definitely will not return to Exelence Punta Cana and definitely would not recommend this place to anybody. I am giving it three stars because of their huge beach nice pool and the beautiful surroundings everything else is one star. So there you have it. if bad food lack of cleanliness and bad attitudes are positives for you then more power to you. If not find anoher resort.

Hello everyone. So its been about a little over a month when my mom and i visited Excelenve Punta Cana. Some background leading up to my selection for this hotel and obviously my own personal opinion since everyone is subjective to their own experiences. I visited about 5 other all inclusive resorts throughout Mexico and the Caribbean. Never been to punta cana or anywhere in the Dominican Republic. I am fully aware of how these type of resorts operate. My mom and i decided to take a trip right after the Thanksgiving holiday. Weeks leading up to our planned days off i did extensive research on where to go. We decided on Punta Cana because neither of has been. I knew i wanted to treat my mom to an all inclusive resort because our goal was to relax and be as stress free as possible. I am in my early 30s my mom is in her 50s. I knew that since i was taking a trip with my mom i wanted to book the best of the best. I looked through trip advisor for travelers ratings and Orbitz for booking. I was torn between a slighty higher rated resort Zoetry punta cana and Excellence Punta Cana. The decision factor of ocean view led me to select Excellence Punta Cana. Zoetry unfortunately had no choice ocean view left. Excellence had a few ocean view left but they were only honeymoon suites ocean view. One regular and one excellence club which is a More VIP experience. Of course i chose the option for Excellence Club not an add on but actual room. I booked via Orbitz because they had a promo that took off 150. Which was great. Although after this trip i may need to reconsider booking through Orbitz since the hotel treat you differently when booking through third party. I was skeptical even before the trip because i usually rely on the reviews i do not like surprises especially with our room or service AND because this was my time to impress my mom. I contacted excellence directly for questions but after the first response it took them 8 days to respond to any other questions such as booking a massage package in advance. I contacted them via orbitz messenger Facebok email twice their website form and Instagram. At this point we were a few days out from our trip and i could not cancel. They finally responded 15 days before our trip with confirmation. Talk about a nerve wracking experience. Communication was horrible. We arrived to the airport PUJ fairly easy to navigate. We preboked the Dominican Aiport Transfer DAT which we highlu recommend. It was inexpensive and it was door to door transportation. It took about 40 45 mins to get to the airport. Once we arrived we were greated with champagne. Since we booked an Excellence Club honeymoon suite room we were told to wait to be escorted to the private check in area. Once we were escorted we had to wait again since check in was a bit busy. We confirmed our check in and i asked if we could check out late since our transportation was going to arrive at 15pm. She mentioned that it depends on the availability on that days check in and to check back with them that morning at 9 am. I asked because it was one of the perks of booking an Excellence Club room. But she also suggested that we check out at 1230pm regular check out is 12 pm. check our bags at the front and grab lunch and by the time we were done our transportation would be ready great idea. We finally got our room and the bell boy helpef us bring our luggage to the room. Thr excellence club check in was in building 12. Our room was 14. Not knowing how the buildings are divided between excellence club and regular rooms we trek through all the buildings until we got to building 14. Which was the very last Building. I made a comment to the Bell boy and said this was pretty far. He said you got a good room. I said yeah i booked excellence club proudly smiling. He then responded confused saying exvelence club. They put you here. I asked where all the excellence club was he said all the way at the other end building 1 area by the check in. But obviously he reassured me that it should not be such a bad walk. Not knowing how horrible this would be during our trip i just nod along. He showed us around our room. It definitely did not look as described and pictured on trip advisor. The tub was not clean and had that pink moldy look. The room was spacious but very dark. But since we were there for 3 nights i did nt want to complain or give any impression to my mom that i some how messed up. So basically we had the honeymoon suite with Excellence club amenties in our room but the excellence club area was on the other side of the resort. I feel like i mind as well booked a regular ocean view room. The room was not fully stock we had to call for robes and water. Dining was ok like all travelers mentioned. We definitely took advantage of the no reservation restaurants and ate at most of them. Bottom line is that Chez Isabel was the best restaurant and probably would only eat here if we knew about it ahead of time. We did try the exclusive Excellence Club only restaurant our first night but it took about 35 mins to be seated 15 mins to order and another 35 40 to get our fodThe night before we left the front desk called and ask what time to send the bell boy to pick up our luggage. We said oh 1230. since that was suggested to us during check in. she was confused and said no check out is 12 and that we could not check out at 1230. I was upset and restated that i was told 1230 would be fine. She paused and put us on hold and came back annoyed and said it would be fine. Jez. Our VIP service definitely declined as the days passed by. This is another reason why i do nt think excellence club was worth it for our trip. I am not saying we are entitled to the best of the best service but i expected more when paying additional for this service. Anyways we were told we could go to the front desk rather than the private Excellence Club room to check out which made sense since we were so far out in building 14. Pros. Selective service depending on who you speak toExclusive beach area not needed in NovemberCoconutsCons. Wait staff are hit or misYadilsa was the rudest person we interacted with. While waiting we saw how poorly she treated others as well. Leaving them with rolled eyes as they walked out thr restaurant. I had to get her name because i never met anyone in this type of hospitality as rude as her. Rooms farthest away from excellence club areas are not as well keptOveral i should have taken the non communicative interaction as a sign and cancel my booking. The trip was a 6510 in my very own opinion. Sure all inclusive is always great. Gives you the instant gratification and service since you re not consitantly taking out your charge cards. I would consider other resorts before checking out excellence punta cana or at least go with non Excellence Club especially during November.", "offset": [5999, 6102], "date": "2018-12-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "918d52ae-d57c-4654-ac8d-5036de8df991", "sentence": "We just spent 10 relaxing days at this lovely resort. There were so many aspects that we loved. The staff are outstanding without exception. Of course we had our favourites but I have never been to a resort with such happy helpful and friendly staff. We upgraded but still are not really sure if it was worth it although we did enjoy being on the quieter east end of the beach. We were in 3025 and the view an oblique one of the sea actually looked over an area that was a bit of a mess beyond the resort perimeter. I think it might have been nicer to overlook a garden space. The room itself was fine. There is a jacuzi which we did not use. The bed was comfy and the sheets were crisp and clean. The couch looked quite worn. The rain shower was lovely. The bar is well stocked although we preferred to go out to have a drink. The beach was wonderful and we did not have a problem finding a quiet spot to lie out. Having said that my hubby went out there every morning to reserve our spot which we kept all day by leaving our gear there. The sea was wild this week and twice we saw people who had ventured out too far being rescued after ignoring the red flags. The lifeguards were vigilant. The beach staff were great at bringing drinks and food. The restaurants were a bit hit and miss. Mostly the quality was excellent however it was often quite a wait to get a table. We always had a coffee and ice cream at Aroma the little coffee shop on the square and ate breakfast either at the buffet or at Magna. Lunch was usually the buffet. Our server was amazing and had our champagne ready for us every day thanks Lederkis. Dinner we really enjoyed Chez Isabele Magna and Agave. We did the hibachi meal which was a lovely way to chat with different people. The chef was ok. He made some weird comments about Asian people as well as about using condoms. Bizarre. We did not eat at the Lobster House as the wait was always too long. The entertainment was good. Michael Jackson and the Cirque were by far the best and definitely worth watching. We also enjoyed the eco garden. it is a bit hidden away but worth looking for. We walked for an hour along the beach in both directions.

I scheduled this trip two weeks ago and had my mom join me. I am currently writing this review from my lounge chair facing the ocean. From the moment you arrive onto the property you are greeted with a warm welcome and champagne. Then you walk to the front desk and I was greeted by Carmen. She is AMAZING. She was able to change rooms from where we were going to stay to a room with an ocean view and in the Excellence Club. Carmen even showed me the room before they cleaned it to see if I wanted to spend the money this was upon my request because I wanted a better room closer to the beach not once was I pressured to upgrade. Carmen went above and beyond in assisting even when there was a minor mishap with the light in the room which was taken care of that same day. Being greeted with a warm and friendly smile and hug and she cares that you have an amazing time. I love when the staff makes you feel at home like family. The staff in the Excellence Club on the beach and bar were amazing too. In\u00e9s I hope I spelled her name right and Roberto both accommodated my request every day for a front view ocean spot one with shade for my mom and one with sun for me. We did n\u2019t come early so they also made it work and I loved my spots every day. The staff over all were amazing. FABULOSO. Every encounter was friendly and I got to practice my Espa\u00f1ol which I loved and they did too. Thank you for helping me with my phrases. They treated you with the utmost respect and always willing to assist. The Excellence Club was worth the extra money for me because I love my beach and the room was right there and it gave you access to the exclusive beach and two pools. The room was excellent. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. The view was amazing and yes it is not brand new but the hotel has done a great job maintaining its excellence. The food was okay but i am not a big food person. I loved The Grill probably the most. The drinks on the resort was never shy of alcohol so if you like to drink they know how to do it right.

My wife and I stayed her in February 2019 for a week. We booked semi last minute because of changing plans three weeks ahead of arrival and ended up in a very nice room facing the beach on the third floor. I think because of the late booking our price was actually very good. The airport pickup with Seasons Tours was seamless and a welcome way to get to the resort about 40 minutes from airport on a busy travel day in February. The ride was a little scary in spots mainly the last few kilometres which are a two lane road and some tight passing took place. The welcome was easy friendly and put you immediately at ease. You are handed a glass of chilled champagne and your bags are taken care of. You walk through the beautiful open air lobby to get to your room. If you have a room reserved which faces the beach directly I would not take the Excellence Club option as there is little benefit. because your regular experience will be so great. If you are in a building only 1 or 2 I believe which are behind other buildings and therefore do not have direct view access to the beach then it may well be worth it. The rooms are spotless as is the entire resort very well appointed with a comfortable bed great air conditioning nice deck mini bar with beer and soft drinks unlimited and free. The resort was apparently extensively renovated in 2018 and it shows. The beach is beautiful. There are TONS of loungers on the beach or polside with permanently fixed thatched roof umbrellas shading them. This was a great feature. There is no need to run down at 6 am to put a towel and book down to reserve anything. We would drop by and put our stuff down on our way to breakfast around 830 or 90 am and there was always a great variety to choose from. Loved that. The surf is pretty high further out at this time of year and although it was easy to swim close to shore it would be hard to do any water sports. But we walked on the beach either direction for 1 2 kilometres several mornings. There are 8 restaurants to choose from with a 9th if you are in the Club section with a variety of cuisines. Breakfasts and lunches were amazing with an endless variety of options. Mimosas every morningf. For dinner the options were also good and we enjoyed them all. Aroma is a little coffee bar that is open early in the morning and late at night for high quality lattes or a gelato. With a lovely patio just outside to sit and enjoy it. We golfed two days in the nearby Iberostar and Hard Rock courses about 20 minutes away. There are fancier courses but they are 40 50 minutes away. I was going to book on line etc but went to talk to the concierge and Victor made these good recommendations and booked everything including transportation in 5 minutes. Super easy. There is a VERY good modern and well equipped gym on site with a wide variety of elipticals tread mills weight machines and free weights. It was actually impressive. We kept a couple of dollars with us to reward great service with tips sometimes but otherwise this is truly all inclusive. There are no wrist bands or cards to show when you are done with a meal or anything you just get up and walk away. Drinks by the pool or beach are delicious and always available. I would highly recommend this resort for a very relaxing get away. The Dominican people are very friendly and this place is extremely well run in all aspects.", "offset": [1965, 2045], "date": "2019-03-02", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "9ff70b41-e017-405f-a2ef-db4da857c474", "sentence": "We Made It Back to Excellence. Three years ago we visited Excellence Punta Cana and when we left we hoped and dreamed to return. We made it back in March 2019 and we were just as happy or happier than we were the first time. From the arrival Welcome home. you are made to feel special and most definitely like you are on vacation. If you are looking to party this is not the place. By the pool or beach the music is low key background music. it is a place to relax and read. I do not think I saw any beer pong tables. That does not mean you can not have a good time or find fun if you want to do an excursion booze cruise or nightclub outing. But that was not for us. For one week our biggest worries were what and when to eat or drink or whether to relax at the beach or by the pool. We got on a good schedule beach until mid afternoon then the pool. it is never difficult to find a comfy lounge bed or chair either. No need to stake them out or save them for hours by leaving your belongings on them. On both visits we stayed in upgraded Excellence Club rooms. In 2016 we had a swim up room by the pool. This year we were in an ocean view on the first floor. It was different to not step our and into the pool but we did not mind it. I had say we were in our room less because it was a little farther from the pool. Things have changed since our first visit. The Excellence Club has been moved from one end of the resort to the other and it offers an even more exclusive experience now with two reserved pools hot tubs two bars a restaurant and the Excellence Club office itself not a place you want to hang out but good spot to grab some late day snacks and always cold bottled beer if you get sick of draft or tropical cocktails. On our last visit we would venture around the pool areas and travel to the swim up bar a few times but this year we really felt at home in the Excellence area and stayed either on the beach or in the cascade pool in the courtyard area. Also good to know there is always some sunscreen bug spray and after sun lotion in the Excellence Club pool areas. in case you forget yours or do not want to go all the way to your room to get it. There have been lots of other renovations at the resort including a major upgrade to the Sports Bar I never got there much but if you need a break from the sun or want some traditional pub food like wings or American beer like Bud or Cors Light this is the spot. If you like to be active there are nice tennis courts a good gym along with basketball courts archery mini golf and more but we were all about relaxing. We saw some old friends from our last visit Hector is still here and Dionel Jhon and Luis. And they remembered us too. We met lots of new friends too Omar was our friendly bartender at the Cielo Bar along with Yohana and Wilmy. We met a wonderful waiter Joel at the outdoor lunch barbecue place Los Olas. We made a point to go to the French restaurant one night and asked to be seated in his section. At Magna we had awesome service from Adan one night and Elizier another night. Oh also new this time around was the travelling spa team who made the rounds occasionally offering free samples of back or foot massages. Included in the Excellence Club visit is a one hour hydrotherapy session for couples. Our friends went first and reported being baked in a sauna then showered in cold water and even rubbing crushed ice on one another. Sounded like torture but it was excellent. If you want a worry free week Excellence is the place. it is a beautiful spot with delicious food and drink but the people really make it. Enjoy. I will the next time I get back.

Staff. The staff at Excellence PC strive for perfection and their concern for your satisfaction is obvious from arrival to departure. Most everyone was friendly courteous and helpful making the overall experience exceptional. Transportation I recommend taking a private taxi from the airport as I suspect this made things a bit smoother and avoids some of the aggressive transport services. Resort. I also recommend paying a bit more for club level service. The extra attention is worth it. We were greeted on arrival with champagne and cool washcloths introduced to the concierge and shown to our rooms. The grounds are beautiful the pools are kept exceptionally clean the beach is raked each morning of weeds and up kept well throughout the day. The lounge chairs beds cabanas at the multiple pools and on the beach were plentiful. We were never without a place in the shade or in the sun which ever we preferred which changed for us from day to day. There are pool tables ping pong tables fosbal tables putt putt golf a wildlife area shops bars restaurants a spa essentially we were never without something to do or place to relax. The only thing that I would recommend to change about the resort would be possibly to move icemakers away from the guest room doorways. We had one directly across from our room which was quite noisy at times. Service. this is pretty much covered above \u2026. But I wanted to mention the following. We had a mix up with our beach dinner essentially they overboked for the number of couples that night and I \u2019l admit to getting quite upset having planned that day \u2019s schedule to accommodate it. However Neomi more than rectified this by having a secluded table prepared for us at the restaurant of our choice Chez Isabele. When we were seated the table was covered with flower petals. we were pampered beyond belief with special champagne amouse bouche aps entrees and desserts etc. This was followed in our room by rose petals all over our bed and bathtub. That dinner so much more than made up for our beach dinner that I passed on the offer to do the beach dinner the next night we also had friends with us and wanted our last dinner at the resort to be with themRestaurants The reviews led me to believe that I would want to eat most of my breakfasts at Magna available to club level members only which we did the first morning \u2026. And it was very nice. However we found Lobster House to be our preference for breakfast due to the open air the views the service the menu and the coffee all top notch. For dinner in order my favorites were Chez Isabele The Grill and Lobster House with all three I recommend to get there early if you can as there is usually a wait. however if you are in line for a table they give you a buzzer that worjs anywhere on the resort to give you a chance to wander or sit at favorite bar while you \u2019re waiting. For lunch it \u2019s hard to beat the kitchen for an enormous buffet with exceptional food and desserts but we did also dine pool side a couple of times and the burgers nachos fries etc were also good. This is probably the longest review I \u2019ve ever written \u2026. Ca n\u2019t say enough good things about this place.

The service is great the hotel grounds are gorgeous room is always neat and tidy and the whole place is very clean. They have a wonderful spa with great treatments and the breakfast bufe have everything you could ever be in the mood for very fresh. The beach is really nice but very windy. We did a diving tour one day whitch was caotic. They put way to many people in the group I believe we were 11 or 12 divers with 2 guides normally you have 3 or 4 divers on every guide they kind of lost people under the surface and they later re aperad 20 30 meters away from the rest of us at the end of the dive. They have a great wine selection and a very profesional sommelier who always went above and beyond to serve us. We are very interested in both wine and food so this was a plus. However there is one major problem with this all in all beautiful hotel. The food is terrible. If not considering the food the hotel would have our highest rating but the food. Oh the food. Some of it is eatible like the pizza and pasta. oregano. But WHO in the world could possible make pizza disgusting anyway so it does not count. But the rest. I do not even know what to say. It is compleatly tasteless and there is no finess anywhere. Everything is just wrong texture seasoning all of it. The worst we ever had was new years eve at Chez Isabele. It was a set menu special for new years eve. The first dish they served was foie gras they said. It was absolutly horrid. To this day we still swear by our great gransmothers grave that it was a piece of cat food. I know you are laughing but we are not joking around. Next up was the soup. Roasted corn soup with king crab. It tasted like water mixed with flour and watery canned sweet corn. The main was pork rib and lobster I do believe the chefs might have starded to boil them somewhere around late august 18. I do not recall the dessert. The stylish midelaged couple next to us during the dinner had very tight faces and low voices during the first dish cat food and when they tasted the soup the woman actually burst into tears when she tasted it. I Kid. You. Not. Actual tears sobbing while covering her face and her husband trying to comfort her. Thank god for champagne.

Shame about the Casino. This was our fifth stay at the Excellence over the past 15 years. It really is a magic place with some improvements over the years but sadly we missed the casino. On previous visits we always budgeted 20 each evening after Dinner. This year we searched in vain but sadly it has been closed down. This loss of amenity was made a bit worse for us as there is a lull after dinner with nothing to do. The early evening entertainment was a singer or musician who started at about 630 we dined at about 7 ish and when we had finished we returned to the bar area where nothing was happening. The evening entertainment did not start until 930The food was very good and varies dramatically from place to place. The French which was always the star has slipped and has been overtaken by the Grill. The lobster still fails to meet expectations. However overall we dined very well with exceptional service and very nice house wines with a generous top up whenever needed. We particularly enjoyed the Asian. Beds on the beach and in the pool area are plentiful which saved me having to get up early to reserve a bed every day loads of choice. We often moved mid afternoon for a change of scenery. There were special outside meals arranged one was for Thanksgiving. They do however insist on having tables for 8 or 10 which seems to please the Americans who ca nt wait to engage in conversation. For us more reserved types a table for two would be much appreciated hence we dined inside on these special nights.
