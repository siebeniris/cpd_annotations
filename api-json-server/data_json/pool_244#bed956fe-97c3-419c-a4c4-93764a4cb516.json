We have stayed at the Grande Colonial several times over that past 5 years and always felt that it was a great hotel where staff went out of their way to provide great service but that was not our experience on our last visit. It started when we arrived at the hotel a little before 20 to check in and our room was not ready. It was a Monday afternoon and not terribly busy but OK. When I asked the woman checking us in if there was an estimated time when our room might be ready she replied that Check in is at 40 and there are no guarantees before then. She did not really seem to want to deal with people which is not great for someone who works at the front desk. The hotel says that they just completed a major renovation and while carpet draperies linens etc. have been redone the bathrooms at least the one in our room have not been updated and are definitely showing their age. Worse the bathroom when we stayed had an ant problem. The hotel website used to also talk about the fact that they did not charge a resort fee which made sense as the Grande Colonial has a very small pool that is 3 feet deep. However they now charge a 20 hospitality fee I was told for wifi and passes to a gym up the street if you askUnfortunately since our last visit a year ago service from staff seems to have declined and the experience at the Grande Colonial was mediocre at best.

Good location. Poor service. My wife and I love La Jola. We travel there frequently to take in the ocean and relax in an upscale suburban environment. This past month we tried the Grande Colonial for the first time. The location is excellent just a few blocks from the ocean. The physical plant is nice. It apparently went through a recent renovation. Also they have absorbed and renovated some adjacent properties. The food at the restaurant was good. However we were underwhelmed by the level of service particularly given its price. We upgraded for an ocean view which we certainly got but also had a view dominated by a bird poop speckled asphalt roof and multiple HVAC units. Fortunately they moved us to a nice room. One odd thing about our 2nd room was that the TV was mounted on the dresser facing the couch but that was 90 degrees from the bed and the mount appeared bolted in a fixed position on the dresser. Basically watching TV from the bed was impossible. We had looked forward to lounging by the pool with wait service. Much to our chagrin there was no wait staff to be found. I went to the front desk and they said there was a phone to call for service. I used the phone it rang about 20 times I got placed on hold for another several minutes and finally was able to ask for wait service. Unfortunately as we hung by the pool for another hour and a half no one came. We were just relaxing and reading but it would have been much nicer if I had a drink in hand.
