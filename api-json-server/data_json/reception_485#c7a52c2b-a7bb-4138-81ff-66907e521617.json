ONE working elevator. This is an attractive hotel with newly updated rooms and public spaces. But it has an Achilles heel only 2 elevators. There truly should be 4 at a hotel this size. This lack of foresight became painfully obvious during my recent 4 night stay when one of the elevators was down for maintenance and I never saw it being worked on. To make matters worse the residential floors are inaccessible from the stairways for security reasons otherwise I would have been happy to take the stairs to my 6th floor room. So what happened is that there was the ludicrous situation of people boarding the UP elevator in order to go DOWN knowing that there would be no room for them if they waited on the down elevator. I suggested that management open up the service elevator for guest use but that idea was rejected. I also had problems with housekeeping not wanting to do their work perhaps because of understafing I am not sure. But that issue was resolved by the friendly front desk staff. So assuming that the elevator will be fixed and no one on the staff seemed to know when that would occur I suppose it is an ok place to stay but my particular visit was quite unpleasant for the reasons mentioned.", "offset": [1010, 1222], "date": "2018-03-20", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "1f24177d-dcfd-43cb-8615-e4e931845e31", "sentence": "Okay Stay.

I was staying with my friends this past weekend for Camp Fangamer expo and we checked our bags at the front desk at noon on the last day of the convention. I had to leave early so I picked up my bag from the front desk. We were told there was an issue with accessing the safe and we would have to wait. But other than being slightly inconvenienced we gave it little thought. When I got home later that day at around 630 PM I discovered that my Nintendo Switch along with five games and the carrying case they were all in had been stolen. Additionally so had my bottle of cologne. While it can be argued I should have packed the items more securely how can I do be blamed for leaving my items with the hotel and having them disapearthat is nothing to say of the fact that the lock for the pool area was unlocked or the slow restaurant service or the fact the stairs are unkempt and located far in the back with only access to the parking lot and nothing else. These were issues I could otherwise overlook if I felt like my items were safer in the hotel than the trunk of my car.
