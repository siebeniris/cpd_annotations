We stayed a week in an ocean front cottage room and loved EVERY minute of it. I have read a few of the recent very detailed reviews and many of them are helpful while some of them are just too damn picky. This is a resort on a small island with beautiful surroundings incredible manicured grounds a fantastic beach and the most incredible spa location I have seen in the world and I have seen quite a few. This is a five star resort in a remote location so it is going to be expensive. If you are going to nitpick over the cost of a breakfast brunch just do not go. The people that work here are just fabulous and genuinely try their best to make sure you enjoy yourself. The location is superb so relaxing and feels like a private community with park like grounds. The grounds are manicured and kept quite immaculate. There are trade winds in the BVIs and as a consequence some things blow around a bit. We loved the grounds we felt absolutely safe all of the time note that you can lock your room when you are in it as some reviews have noted that you do not lock the doors actually there is no need to during the day as the grounds are secure and patrolled by security day and night. It feels pretty much like a large private park with the buildings all well spaced out and lots of greenery everywhere. The beach is excellent. It is not a huge wide beach like South Beach in Miami. It is a very nice and pleasant private beach. There are chairs and cabanas located throughout the property. Even with a lot of people there it felt so uncrowded. If you are adventurous the resort boat will take you to a deserted beach elsewhere on the island. The room was just excellent. The bed was fantastic and everything in the room is in neutral earth tones to fit in with the surroundings so relaxing. I never heard a tv there are not any in the rooms or a cell phone so niceThe spa is just fantastic. Get a couples massage and ask them to open the door and turn off the AC. The surf pounds on the beach below the spa and it is so relaxing. The spa attendants were excellent. The food was just wonderful. It was not perfect but everyone tried their best to make it that way. We were asked our opinion of the food and the service on each occasion that we sat down for dinner. We enjoyed it immensely and found the menu variety wonderful. The servers are very professional yet a lot of fun. Great peopleFor nearby dining we highly recommend Coco Maya absolutely superb food. A nice blend of Asian largely Japanese influence with latin. Their location is also unbelievable. The service throughout was just superb. Every person we came in contact with was extremely pleasant. This is one of those resorts where all the staff say hi to you and come to know your name very quickly in a genuine sort of way not phony. There were people of all ages at the resort but we never heard an unruly child and there were quite a few kids thereThe resort shuttle boat is amazingly smooth in the water. It is a catamaran that cuts through the waves and chop like nothing I have seen before. We flew direct to Virgin Gorda from San Juan but tok the resort shuttle to Tortola when we were departing very convenient. We loved it and will definitely go back. This was our first visit. This is one of those resorts that leaves you with a good feeling as it was just a superb visit and everyone there tried very hard and were very friendly.", "offset": [2210, 2309], "date": "2015-03-12 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "62f76088-fb6c-4b5b-9d51-646d4c2677b2", "sentence": "Great resort but you are paying for it. This was our second stay at a Rosewood property in the Caribbean the other being Jumby Bay. so naturally we came in with high expectations. I would like to say that overall the resort did not disappoint. Pre trip they were relatively efficient in arranging off site dinner reservations and air charter through Fly BVI a great charter option btw. They were not instantly responsive but generally got back to you via email within a day. We flew from NYC into St Thomas and then took a 15 minute flight into Virgin Gorda then a 5 min taxi ride so overall despite the relative remoteness of Virgin Gorda the total travel experience was pretty smooth. Check in on arrival was very easy and a complimentary refreshment rum punch or non alcoholic punch was on offer along with a cold towel. We stayed in a tree house suite which was a great sized room maybe 90 1000 sq ft and was right behind the beach maybe 200 ft back. The pull out couch in the living room had a very nice mattress and was fairly spacious making the room perfect for a small family. Other room features were an outdoor shower and a wrap around deck facing toward the beach. The main bed ensured restful sleep. You could hear the waves crashing at night even with the windows doors closed. That being said you could also hear golf carts backing up as well so pros and cons to the lack of soundproofing. Another nice feature is not having to deal with room keys as the doors only had a lock on the inside. A safe was available if you were concerned about valuables but given the private nature of the area we did not have much concern. The room comes stocked with a complimentary bottle of rum and a few mixers coke diet coke ting and bottles of water daily. The tap water was fine for drinking though was pretty flat they use desalination there. On to the resort itself the beach is very narrow but is fairly long. You should not have a problem finding an open seat. The water is clear and fairly shallow. The bay is protected by a reef so the waves are minimal. Perfect swimming for young kids and with the free snorkeling gear provided you can see some fish close to the shore or swim out to the reef and see a lot more. The beach itself is fine sand and the bottom is sandy everywhere aside from one small section of the beach that has a rock formation right at the waters edge. Definitely a top beach for the Caribbean. And if you want some variety and waves the resorts boat will drop you off and pick you up from a handful of other beaches on the island. Non motorized water sports are inclusive hobie cats kayaks etc. I do not think they allow jet skis in the bay so the waterfront is generally quiet. While technically no beaches are private on the island this is as close to a private beach as you can get as it is book ended by rocks. There are a few restaurants available all of which are pretty decent for the Caribbean. Not world class but very serviceable. Pricing is of course on the high end but there are meal plans available as well not sure if they are a good deal or not especially if you want to sample some of the other options on the island also the meal plans do not include alcohol. We did not use a meal plan. The breakfast buffet was great with lots of options though it tended to be almost the same each day though you should definitely try and book through a travel agent as they can usually get it included for free otherwise 35 p. If you eat every meal at the resort you will probably get bored after a few days so I would recommend getting off property. Coco Maya is a great option as is the Trehouse and Hog Heaven amazing views and good BQ. Cabs are easy to get at the entry to the resort but it is recommended to have the concierge reserve them in advance if you do not want to wait around. They are however quite expensive and seem to be quoted on a per person basis. A 15 min trip will run you 20p one way and even a 3 5 min drive will be 8p or so. oh and most of them are pick up trucks with seats in the bed and an awning. Keeps the cool breezes flowing but might be a little disconcerting for some folks. Spa was good not amazing but good. Views from the area were great. Diving is available quite easily as there is a Dive BVI shop right on the resort. They are very professional highly recommended. Overall friendly service though things move on island time so do not be in a rush. wi fi was provided but it is quite slow basically good for email only but it stayed connected the whole time which was nice and blankets most of the property. They also have a bunch of tennis courts a decent gym and a very nice kids club that is inclusive of the room rate aside from evening service which is 20 kid I think. Overall this is a great resort and I would consider staying again if I was in this area. However you are paying for it. As with all Rosewoods they are not really value options but they are uniformly excellent properties if you do not think about the bill. At least when we went at the end of March there are a lot of families with kids mainly in the 6 14 yr range. A lot of these families seem to come back year after year. For couples that are not kid friendly I would probably recommend staying elsewhere though there are plenty of secluded places to go if you want to avoid children.", "offset": [3464, 3587], "date": "2015-03-31 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "f84a40c8-a6a8-4722-a3cf-0e3787f8b972", "sentence": "Amazing beach and even better staff. The trip advisor reviews is what lead me to little Dix bay. The raving of previous stayers is what really stood out. do not make the same mistake as us arguing and searching for days you found what your looking for just get the credit card out. My girlfriend and I mid 20s were looking for a Caribbean vacation that was not in Mexico DR or Jamaica. No disrespect to those areas but we prefer to stay in an area that does not need to be guarded by a military type of defense or have high crime rates. Our previous stays were in Turks and Caicos so we had a little bit of material to compare LDB too. do not listen to the reviews about the resort being run down. The grounds are as close to pristine as possible. The plants trees beach and garden are routinely cleaned and manicured to perfection. I would say the best part of LDB is the scenery and view. They really do own a piece of heaven at the Virgin Gorda. There was constant attention to the grounds and never once did I feel like it was being abandoned. The tennis courts are gorgeous and we loved playing. Their workout facility is top notch and better than my gym back home. For the most part 95 of the employees were attentive and super friendly. I would say that is a great accomplishment for a resort that employs so many people. We would like to personally thank Khrystine the supervisor in the front office and Monique for their dedication to making sure we were comfortable and our experience was 5 stars. We had a few concerns about service and they both addressed the issue and handled it. You can not ask for a more attentive front desk. We even made a friend in another employee Denver a server at the pavilion. We recommend sitting in his section for friendly smiles and laughter. Nicholas at the spa was so kind and always smiling. He gave us a wonderful tour of that area and we ran into him many times on the grounds. De andre at the non motorized activities area was a huge help on the beach. He taught us how to paddle board and sail. He was just a fun person to be around and we thank everyone previously listed for their kindness. They are truly assets. Customer service oriented personalities like those above are not often found in Turks let alone in general and we felt the BVI love for sure. Even with great employees there are still areas of opportunity. The food is just OK. Breakfast is absolutely acceptable the buffet is worth it. I felt at dinner there was too much effort to be gourmet. I love gourmet as much as the next but on vacation sometimes it is nice to have those classic comfort options. I am not always in the mood for pumpkin risotto or red tail snapper over grits. So I stuck to surf and turf. The surf was the biggest let down. With stringy lobster 3 out of 4 times. In my opinion dinning leaves a lot to be desired and on future trips we will not be purchasing the meal plans. Many other guests we met loved the dinning options so this may be more of a personal issue. We recommend doing the sunset cruise. it is 2 hours really affordable and great cocktails snacks. We easily drank 65 worth of alcohol alone. it is also fun to mingle with fellow vacationers and crew. Manager cocktail hour is also worth attending. Lol do not get me wrong drinking with my boss does not sound fun but you get to meet each area manager as well as the resort director where concerns or praise can be expressed. Plus if they are offering up free mimosas and snacks we are there. The resort is family friendly but I never felt like I was a high chair for kids. The grounds are so large and the beach has enough chairs to dodge the little ones. I like privacy as much as the next guy and this would be a fine spot for an adult getaway or honeymoon. As many have mentioned be aware of resort fesacomodation tax and included gratuity. This can easily add 17 to room rate then another 18 for gratuity on food and drinks. I get why they do it and knew this going in but seeing the bill does not make it any easier. My recommendation is stop wasting hours finding the perfect Caribbean vacation. If you can afford their property and service just DO IT. I debated even writing this review because I do not want to share LDB.", "offset": [3433, 3499], "date": "2015-04-09 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "f1481edb-4283-41c3-9ae5-c45fb9a1e4e7", "sentence": "Laid back Island Paradise. This is the 2nd trip for my wife and myself to Little Dix Bay LDB. We convinced some relatives to visit LDB several years ago. They liked it so much that they arranged for a larger group to make the journey this year 2015. We were a party of 17 in 7 different rooms along the beachfront. Our travel agent the New York City sales staff and the local management made it a memorable visit. LDB remains the most relaxing vacation spot we have ever visited. When we sit at home and say We need a vacation we need to get away we automatically think of LDB on Virgin Gorda. It has its own long sandy beach in a protected cove. There is a long coral reef not far from shore. We saw a dozen or more sea turtles when we kayaked paddle boarded sailed lounged on rafts snorkeled and swam in front of the hotel. The highlight was seeing an octopus. There is a relaxing well staffed spa with an infinity pool and gorgeous views at one end of the property. There are tennis courts and a fitness center. There are 3 restaurants on property. Spanish Town is not far away bars restaurants and a grocery store. You can fly directly to Virgin Gorda eg via Cape Air flights or fly into Beef Island Tortola and take a boat ride to the boat dock on property. You can arrange for free drop offs at nearby beaches with a beach umbrella and optional lunch. You can arrange for a fee fishing trips sunset cruises and trips to nearby British and US Virgin Islands. The one thing that prevented me from giving an overall Excellent rating for LDB was the restaurants. When we first arrived the only place open for lunch was the Beach Grill. If you arrived in the middle of lunchtime you could expect to wait at least an hour to be served your food. Our group had a 2hour lunch one day. The Property Manager recognized this problem and opened the Sugar Mill restaurant for lunch to alleviate the wait. However the Beach Grill just does not have the infrastructure to serve everyone in a timely manner for lunch. The wait staff remains calm cheerful and helpful but they are in a not so good situation. A few times the fish was overcooked at the Sugar Mill Restaurant and Pavilion Dining Room the other restaurants on property. Generally the food was very good. There was a good variety on the menu and especially at the buffets. You could order a bottle of wine at dinner good selection not as expensive as I would have thought. If you did n\u2019t finish the bottle the staff would save it for you for another dinner meal. The breakfast buffet at the Pavilion Dining Room had an extensive selection. You could get an omelet made to order along with pancakes and French toast. There was a table with local foods that I visited every morning. One of the staff made fruit smoothies to order. My wife and I splurged and got the Couples Retreat treatment at the Sense Spa. It was a very very sensual experience applying a special mud treatment to your partners body get a couples massage in a room with a view and relaxing afterwards on a private patio with fruit and water a shower and hot tub. Be sure to come early and relax in the infinity pool 2 levels that overlooks Drakes Passage or the outdoor hot tub. You can climb the hill at the spa pass by the large platform for yoga and descend a short distance to a lookout point with 2 chairs. it is the perfect place to go in late afternoon with a bottle of champagne and see the boats go back and forth between the nearby islands and then watch the sunset. Very romanticWe had a ground floor ocean cottage room. The beach was 40 50 feet out the back door. We had a table chairs and lounge chairs just outside the room. The room was spacious with a large walk in closet. The bathroom was spacious as well with double sinks a shower and a tub. The bed was comfortable. There is an overhead fan. The room was serviced twice a day. Wherever you walked on the property you were greeted with a smile and friendly hello by the hotel staff. You could call and arrange for a golf cart to pick you up outside your room and take you to the dining area or to the spa. You can even arrange to be taken to the edge of the property and walk 5 10 minutes to get to Spanish Town. Once a week LDB held a BQ picnic celebration at nearby Spring Bay. The winner or their parents of the limbo contest won a bottle of champagne at the picnic. There is a weekly managers reception with hors doeuvres and drinks at the swimming pool area it is a chance to mingle with fellow guests and hotel staff. There are other organized activities such as hikes and snorkel tours. For some variety consider going into Spanish Town for dinner one night. There are several nice restaurants some right on the beach. The taxi fare is 4 US per person each way. You can be as busy or as relaxed as you want at LDB. There are lots of options. The sun is warm. The water is inviting. you are on island time. Enjoy and relish the memories because you \u2019l want to come back.", "offset": [2425, 2514], "date": "2015-04-12 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "9814955e-c6c7-4b4d-a975-0114c2318154", "sentence": "Rosewood \u2019s Little Dix Bay in no sea of competition.

Rosewood \u2019s Little Dix Bay Resort on Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands is a beautiful well kept property celebrating 50 years since its inception by Lawrence Rockefeller. The grounds are lush with a variety of palms and other trees flowering Bougainvillea of several beautiful reds purples and occasional pale yellow. The main road along the various accommodations is lined with pink and white oleander that provides a constant fragrance at this time of year. The property is also heavily infested with mosquitoes. I read but did n\u2019t detect any effort to control them other than the presence of cans of Off in the room at the bar and at all the restaurants. It was quite a shame indeed as no matter who much I sprayed I was bitten repeatedly. There were some mosquitoes at times in Canel Bay but nothing this bad. There is only one long beach at Little Dix Bay Resort but the hotel will take you to neighboring beaches on a beach drop with 4 drops and pickups each day. There \u2019s no extra charge for this service and if you can bare the sun and lack of \u201c personal accommodations \u201d the beauty of these beaches ca n\u2019t be ignored. The staff as one would expect at an expensive resort is friendly very attentive and gracious. They are truly interested in your enjoyment of their property. I found the caliber of food offered at the breakfast buffet to be almost exactly the same as the one offered at Canel Bay. Not surprising since they were sister properties until a couple of years ago. I did however find the lunch grill at Little Dix to be superior in many ways to that of Canel. First the view ca n\u2019t be surpassed. Right on the beach in the cooling breezes you wo n\u2019t be bothered by attacking seagulls but you will encounter aggressive small brown birds that will watch your every move in hopes you \u2019l leave a bit for them. The rooms have clearly been updated within the last few years. The bathrooms are quite nice with Travertine tile throughout the shower and floors. The showers are roomy and modern as is the entire bathroom layout which is a huge improvement over the condition of the bathrooms you \u2019l find at Canel Bay. We stayed in a first floor ocean front room that was no more than 40 feet from the water and literally at the far end of the property. We enjoyed a lovely patio with a view of the sea. Ice was regularly replaced which was not the case at Canel Bay. However Canel Bay provided each room with an ice chest that was filled each morning that made our beach time much nicer as we could keep our drinks cool. There was greater frequency of beach service from the bar at Little Dix so I never felt worried about getting a cold beverage. Snorkeling equipment is offered without additional cost but if you stayed close by the snorkeling was a waste as there were almost no fish except an occasional \u201c white \u201d fish no larger than the size of small woman \u2019s fist. I did spot a sizable barracuda while surveying the dock while at lunch one afternoon so there must be something in there. My wife also stated she saw a turtle \u2019s head pop up a couple of times. Little Dix kept the Pavilion and Sugar Mill restaurants open each night we were there and offered special buffets on a couple of occasions. Overall I would have to say that not including the recent addition of ZoZo \u2019s at Canel Bay the food was somewhat better and the service more attentive at Little Dix Bay. Additionally we had music at dinner on two occasions. After the Monday Manager \u2019s Reception the steel drum duo played outside the Pavilion Restaurant and we enjoyed a local balladeer on another night well after dinner was over. Canel Bay stopped offering music except at the Manager \u2019s Reception party. The Manager \u2019s reception party at both Little Dix Bay and Canel Bay are much looked forward to. It \u2019s a chance to get to meet the senior staff gather information about what to do where to go off and on property and the like. I found both to be approached very differently however. At Little Dix Bay \u2019s manager \u2019s reception the food offering was much more regulated. There were a couple of canopies offered by servers and some homemade potato chips put out on a bar height table. Canel Bay put out much more of an elaborate spread including a carving station. Adult beverages at both were similar. The one thing I did find a bit off putting was the staff \u2019s use of this function as a sales opportunity. They were really pushing the spa services to the point of making people uncomfortable. I saw a couple who booked a couples spa which I later overheard they canceled. They blamed each other for not just saying no. I also felt trapped into scheduling a spa treatment massage. Now I frequently get massages at these resorts anyway but I did n\u2019t schedule it on my terms or when I would have wanted.

We visited Rosewood at Little Dix Bay during the last week of June 2015 celebrating our 20 year anniversary. In short it was the best vacation either of us have ever had and we have been a lot of places. For the last year leading up to our anniversary my wife and I had been mulling over options of where we had like to spend our 20th. We knew we wanted tropical white sand blue water etc. we have been to Hawaii which is easy for us to get to from CA but did not want to do that again. I had been around Virgin Gorda as a kid when my dad chartered a sailboat and we sailed the Virgin Islands for a week back in the 80s. I remembered a place with giant boulders leading into the ocean The Baths and thought that might be a fun place to go. A little research and soon we booked seven nights at the Rosewood hotel at Little Dix Bay. Doing my research I heard the following comments regularly about Rosewood. Staff was incredible absolutely true. Everyone bends over backwards to help be friendly say hi etc. did not have one bad experience with service the entire trip. Quiet and peaceful absolutely true. We would often times walk from our cottage 121 awesome by the way over to breakfast and not see another person until we arrived at the restaurant. Beach was tranquil absolutely true. We are accustomed to going on vacation and having to wake up at the crack of dawn to get a couple of lounge chairs. Not here. In fact we joked more than a few times that our most stressful decision of the day was which of the 40 or so lounges we should choose on any given morning. Talk about first world problemsThe resort and actually the whole island is very quiet. So if nightlife is what you are after you will want to pick a different island. We were looking for quiet and relaxing and Rosewood was perfect for that. They did have some kind of music at the main restaurant most evenings which was just enough entertainment for us. We ended up doing just about everything we wanted to. I had gotten my scuba certification the week prior to our visit and ended up doing three dives. Absolutely awesome. Not only was the scenery incredible highly recommend diving the HMS Rhone a 300 foot steamship that sunk in a hurricane in 1867 but the staff at BVI which is on property were awesome. True professionals. While I was diving my wife went to the spa on property and had some treatments massages. She loved it. They have a great infinity pool and she spent the afternoons reading and looking out over the bay. Not sure which of us had a better timeWe also rented a jeep one day and covered the island. Went to The Baths an absolutely MUST. Recommend going early even before it opens around 8 am I think to beat the crowds. Do NOT go on Wednesday. That is cruise ship day and they end up shuttling 100s over to the island to visit the Baths. Continued the drive to the abandoned copper mine. Interesting but no more than 15 minutes worth. We then drove to the other side of the island and ended up eating at Hog Heaven. Another must. Great view cool breeze friendly folks working there and some of the best pork ribs I have ever had the owner has his own farm that supplies them. Plus a heck of a lot cheaper than at the resort but I will get to that. Drove back on the other side of the island back to Spanish Town and had a beer down at Yacht Harbor. Spanish Town sounds more interesting than it was. Very sparse a couple of restaurants only a few of which I would consider eating at. Not really a place you want to spend any time in. On to food. We ate at three different restaurants off property while on the island. Already mentioned Hog Heaven so I will skip that one went back for dinner by the way it was that good. Trehouse a restaurant literally nestled among the treetops. Felt like Robinson Crusoe eating on a deck with the most incredible view. We got there at 6 pm and were the only ones up there for maybe 45 minutes. Was truly amazing. Food was very good but the view is worth the trip alone. Next restaurant was Coco Maya. Amazing. Right on the beach great ambiance and really great food. More of a tapas type of restaurant with smaller plates they had some entrees too but small plates seemed like the way to go. Wonderful food and actually relatively inexpensive. Based on all the great reviews I was prepared to pay a lot but it actually was pretty reasonable. We went there last night but wish we would have gone earlier as we surely would have gone back a second time. Now on to eating on property at the Rosewood. If I look back on the vacation this might be the only thing I would rate as anything less than excellent. Everything is SO expensive. In most cases the quality was very good to excellent and at a resort like this I expect to pay a bit for good dining but I guess I did not think it would be as high as it was. They have three restaurants and we ate at each of them. Had breakfast each morning and a couple of dinners at the Pavilion which is their main restaurant. Breakfast was great each morning staff was very cheery and attentive. They had a station where you could get eggs to order or fresh pancakes or waffles. Also had a huge spread of fresh fruit very high quality. Also had a smoothy station which was great. For that however you pay 35 per person plus 18 service charge which is added to all food and drinks. We were fortunate to have booked with a travel agency that was part of a network where they got certain benefits at Rosewood and so our breakfast was free. That was a very nice perk. Dinners at Pavilion were very good but not out of this world great. They had a few nights with buffets but we always ended up ordering off the menu. On the Saturday night we were there they were having Lobsterfest which was a lobster themed buffet. I think it was 95 per person but I figured for lobster that was not too off the charts. Then I saw the menu and noticed that it was a lot of different items that incorporated lobster but you were not getting lobster tails. For that you had to pay 145 per person. Thanks but no thanks we ordered off the menu. That particular dinner I was somewhat disappointed with. I ordered the surf and turf for around 58 a lot cheaper than Lobsterfest. The half lobster tail was good maybe a tad overcooked. The steak was not great reminded me of something you had get at Sizler for those not familiar with Sizler it is not good. That was my only so so experience with food quality. Ordered lunch a few times on the beach and that came from the Beach Grill which is down by the pier. Had a couple of salads which were also very good and had the benefit of being served to you by one of the staff that walks up and down the beach asking if you needed anything. About 18 23 per salad I think. We then ate at the Sugar Mill on our anniversary. Had a wonderful dinner and here you eat right down near the beach. Very romantic and we had a table right next to the beach and lighted trees that grew in front of the restaurant. Great service highly attentive and just a great experience overall. With a bottle of wine think we finished at close to 300. But it was our anniversary and we were very satisfied with the experience. What else. Snorkeling in the bay was fun although it gets a little dicey when the tide is low as the reef becomes so shallow you can not really snorkel over it and you end up trying to carve a path around it so you do not accidentally beach yourself on the corral reef ouch. On the last day my wife and I were snorkeling and saw a couple of rays and then saw a large turtle swim right towards and them past us. My wife is a huge turtle fan and we were hoping we would see one up close. While laying on the beach you will often times see their fins pop up out of the water as they eat the sea grass. Highly recommend the beach drops too. We did two. The first was awesome to an island called Great Dog. Had an entire beach to ourselves with only the occasional passing boat in the distance. They packed us lunch and we just laid there enjoying the peace and quiet occasionally diving. Second drop was to Long Bay. Nice also but there were a few boats anchored there so not as private. Still a great time. Played some croquet on their course that was fun. They have a great gym and tennis courts we did not use either. Had the best of intentions but something about laying around on a quiet beach seemed to be the better decision most days. Went on their evening cocktail cruise once which was a lot of fun. 65 per person for about a two hour cruise down to a place called Saba Island on the other side of the island. All you can drink and eat small appetizers plus a twenty minute or so stop on Saba Island to walk around drink more if you want before the return back. The catamaran they take you on is designed to break the choppiness of the ocean so it does not rock at all. My wife can get pretty seasick and she was fine the entire cruise. Good chance to talk with some of the other quests you are all pretty close on the boat and great view of the island and sunset. All in all a wonderful trip and highly recommend.", "offset": [6107, 6163], "date": "2015-07-07 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "71133ba9-16a9-401c-908e-9ed75421c1ed", "sentence": "When In The BVI. This was our 3rd trip as a family in the last 6 years and we are planning to return in 2017. Once again this was the perfect blend of relaxation and fun in paradise. The staff the grounds the food the drinks the beach the pool the other guests all came together to make it very difficult to leave. I can not say enough about how much we just love this place. Kudos to Nesta Hyacinth at the Beach Grill Jimmy Granvile serving up drinks on the beach. Rubel at the pool Anthony at the Pavilion and of course Loreta at Rosebuds. Plus do not miss out on a drink at the bar with Mice. Rented a 4x4 jeep wrangler through Mahogany Car Rentals great way to drive around and see the island. do not miss Hog Heaven for ribs and the view. Mine Shaft Rock Cafe Chez Bamboo Coco Maya. Each one great in their own right and offers up a taste of the local cuisine. The Spring Bay picnic is well worth it a unique beach and a good way to meet other guests. Savannah bay and Little trunk bay are worth the visit. Mountain trunk has good snorkeling but very hot sand. Just a thought or two Island time is a real cultural aspect to all the islands. Things move slowly complaining and whining only sours the mood for those in earshot. It is important to remember that we are only visitors to this beautiful paradise and we should adjust our own needs to best experience all that the resort has to offer. The staff is trained to provide the best possible service. Example I asked the beach server for a couple of apples for my 3 year old. How many. red or gren. he asked. Less than five minutes I had two apples on a plate plus a smile. does not sound like much but it made my afternoon. If you feel that taking a small boat to a remote beach drop falls short of luxury or if your drinks water do not arrive in a timely fashion or if walking under the evening stars on a five or six minute walk to the restaurant is an inconvenience. or if your children need to entertain themselves at the dinner table with iphones and ipads then seriously reconsider coming to this resort. There are very few places left that provide an environment where using your imagination and living in the moment trumps all electronic entertainment. Having no TVs in your room no room key no phones no texting no emails is the healthiest way one can spend a vacation. There is no perfect hotel and there will always be room for improvement but LDB comes pretty close to paradise not just for our family but for all the other repeating guests.", "offset": [1567, 1631], "date": "2015-07-14 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "68509779-9269-4731-8c5b-9916dd3bab67", "sentence": "Trip of a lifetime. My husband and I leave today from spending a week at this resort. We flew from San Diego and all 13 hours of travel were well worth it. I searched for a resort where we could get away from the Corporate grind and truly relax. We definitely found that here. Room. We got a beach front cottage. It was perfect for my husband and I. It was steps away from the beach where we had our own private lounge chairs and shade. Steps away was their restaurant bar on the bay and the place to get your snorkel gear for the week. I think all of their rooms look great but we stayed in 20 which was close enough to the lobby and restaurants but far enough away to feel completely isolated. We never saw a neighbor but I do not think this week was very busy. We did have the power go out a few times on us but that is to be expected with the storms on an Island. Service. Everyone was really great. There were a few people that seemed a little lazy but overall we loved the local people. Instead of the first class fake service here everyone is really just genuine and kind and friendly. I think the guys and gals at Sugar Mill really had service down. Some of the morning breakfast crew could use a little nugde and were not as on top of it but we loved them all. We felt the Caribbean relaxed vibe. Tereik sp was awesome the general manager was nice to talk to Dev was a sweatheart Terry. was an awesome server who we really enjoyed talking to. Traveling to here. We went from San Diego to Miami on a red eye. Miami to Puerto Rico Puerto Rico to Tortola Beef Island. and then we had Rosewood pick us up with their boat and take us here. Just call the hotel directly and they will do all of the arrangements for you when you get to Tortola. We really liked that. It took us 13 hours and was a bit long but well worth it. You can also fly to St Thomas and then here. Food. We bought the meal plan for Breakfast and Dinner did not do lunch because we knew we would eat plenty. My husband basically had lobster every single night so we got our money worth on the meal plan. but if you are a light eater and do not want a buffet half the nights I am not sure if it would save you money. We did the breakfast buffet every morning which I think was 35 person and then at night we sometimes did the buffet around 85 person and sometimes did the lobster 65. So all in all it was well worth it to not have to worry. Alcohol. Wine by the glass is fine but they had plenty of good bottles to chose from. We usually just got a bottle. Their malbec glass of wine was good for the price. They left a bottle of rum in our rum for when we arrived. That was a nice treatGeting around. We tried to stay active the whole trip so we did a lot of walking. We walked into town a few times maybe about 30 minutes. It was a nice walk just to be in the local town. We took a cab to The Baths and we walked all the way back about an hour. We took a cab to Gorda Peak as well. I was not impressed with the prices of the taxis though. Felt like we got ripped off once. It cost 8 to get into town Coco Maya etc. Then when we wanted to hike Gorda Peak when the cab dropped us off he charged us 30 one way. Mick. So he waited and we paid 60 tip for a short little hike that quite frankly was not our favorite thing to do. They sub contract these guys and I wish they had a little more regulation here. The guys seem to just charge whatever they want. Boating. We chartered a boat from Dive BVI for the afternoon and we went to Coopers Island and snorkled had rum at the rum bar and shopped at the cute boutique. It was the highlight of the trip. Jef one of the partners was great and I highly recommend doing thisHouseKeping. LOVED these ladies. They are so sweet. So on top of it. So kind. Our room was impeccable the whole trip and they did a great turndown service. Music. They always had nice music during dinner. One time a band of 3 and another time a guy that had been playing here for like 20 years solo on his guitar. We really enjoyed this. A few other things. There is no TV. You can rent one for 25 day and it plays DVDs. Although my husband really loves TV we did not miss it and we finally shut off. It was awesomeThey have a tennis pro and a gym trainer both are sub contracted and both were really great guys to talk to. Very personableWe hiked to Savannah Bay it was a highlight. We snorkeled over there for a few hours and the boat taxi picked us up. We just told Dave when to come and they came. We took a free boat taxi to Mountain Trunk for a few hours. Loved our time on that beach. Very private and very relaxing. Again it was well worth the money we spent. It was not a cheap trip by any means but we were happy to spend that and look forward to trying another Rosewood hotel in the future.", "offset": [1878, 1980], "date": "2015-11-22 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "1df1a044-6bc0-46a9-ae06-d02232a4473b", "sentence": "Top Luxe Resort in Virgin Gorda and BVI excellent location. Little Dix Bay Resort is the best experience in the BVI and the upscale British BVI version of Canel but with a totally different layout much longer and larger main beach. The resort closed for renovation in summer 2016 and hopefully re opens on schedule in late 2017. Little Dix has had some development added on the mountain for old time purists not bad but more buildings in last 10 15 years with swanky hotel villas packed along ridge on this large 70 acre estate. I would have preferred Rockefellers approach of natural looking integration of buildings. The Spa is superb with a new pool and tiny hot tubs on cliff gardens overlooking BVI and a steep staircase to a 2nd private hidden micro beach. Development can have positives too. HOW TO GET HEREI first visited in late 1980s via the Canel Ferry when Canel and Little Dix used to be sister resorts. The boat trip between St John and Virgin Gorda is spectacular on a sunny day. Today it is possible via a private charter 70 or day tour boat 99 p from Cruz Bay to Virgin Gorda Spanish Harbor. Spanish Harbor is run by Little Dix Bay Hotel. Hotel is 5 minute taxi away. Or fly to Tortola from San Juan and Little Dix will take you to the resort by their private ferry with lovely sundeck and rum punch. SCUBAThere are hundreds of incredible diving spots a mile or less off the hotel. One dive that comes to mind descends huge undersea boulders and canalsencrusted with endless tubes and sponges. Numerous tunnels and doorways descend to a vast tarpon fish feeding ground. Very unique. THE BATHSThe Baths have endless spectacular beaches and are the main attraction and I recommend you visit them multiple ways. By boat and by land. Noon and afteron have different feels so enjoy them more than once. Also go after 4 pm and the crowds are gone the sunset is gorgeous at 6 pm and you might see 10 people the rest of the afternoon year round. BTW at the top of the Baths there is a restaurant. For those daring there are plenty of tidal pools to swim and snorkel in the currents and there are many places to climb the ridges of boulders. Also to jump amid huge rocks or to climb up chimneys and tight passages. Just remember you might have to go back the way you came in so pay attention to your precise route and reserve some strength to get out backwards. Climbing a chimney in 85F is certainly a test to know you still got it. The waves are loud and after 4 pm there is no one around so bring a climbing buddy and a phone. NORTH SOUNDAn unexpected feast for the eyes lies ahead. Rent a Jeep at Little Dix and head left following the left coast of Island. Note the gorgeous slinky beaches stretching next door. When the road splits in 1 mile head left and follow along the steep mountain past a variety of small lookouts and small resorts. Grab a drink and enjoy the viewing deck at Hog Heaven Restaurant. In the distance are Eustatius Prickly Pear Necker Islands and Anegada further. Continue along the road and turn left onto the main road. Pay attention turn left and head to Leverick Bay and the pool near Pusers Rum Bar for a drink and check out the pier local shops and mighty super yachts and red British phone booth. From Leverick turn left and head down steep cliff road to the North Sound Ferry depot. Park here and grab a complimentary tiny boat to the famous Bitter End Yacht Club for drinks and to check out the vast grounds restaurant shops. Note the over water sun deck is great for a snooze and to watch the pelicans. When it gets near dinner time 7 pm take a sunset tiny ferry boat from Bitter End Yacht Clubs pier to the tiny Saba Rock for dinner and drinks. Make sure to ask they are going to the Restaurant. The many fish in the vast North Sound will be swimming to the Restaurant underwater lights. It is incredible sight for kids and adults. And to feed the fish that jump and fight for food. They also have a huge lit tidal aquarium filled with eels lobsters crabs and tons of fish. There is also an interesting shop selling pirate treasure real heavy silver bars etc. The atmosphere dinner food quality lively bar and on the water views sea life illuminated lagoon tiny boat ferries coming and going from this restaurant and boutique hotel is unique and unmatched in the BVI or USVITHE BVI WAYNote these islands have a more dressy and formal culture no Texas red necks here and are relatively quiet compared to other Caribean islands. The hotel development is minimal there are large stretches of tropical vegetation and the main attraction is the nature the sea and the land the gorgeous views. You will not find any world class discos night clubs or wild bars or restaurants like Puerto Rico St Martin or St Barts. This place is for peaceful days and nights relaxing with a rum cocktail and some wine. Little Dix Bay has some dinners with live music band and dancing but it is hotel scene with patrons from 20s to 70 80s.

Again it did NOT negatively impact our stay but might be worth noting for future travelers. The beach menu was the best in my opinion. Breakfast at The Pavilion was wonderful. The buffet breakfast was excellent. We only ordered a la carte two times during our one week stay for breakfast. While we were there lunch could only be had on the beach in room or at The Sugar Mill. Dinner could only be had at The Pavilion. I enjoyed the dinners we had at The Pavilion however I would note that there might not be enough familiarity if you are looking for more classic European or American fare. that is just my observation. Not a negative thing. Apologies for the long review and lack of eloquent writing. I just really wanted to leave the resort a five star review and see them get back on their feet after a long rebuild as we truly did enjoy our stay and would recommend Rosewood for anyone interested in a truly pampered experience.", "offset": [3150, 3192], "date": "2020-02-15 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "fc9126b6-e621-45a8-b7ea-69e072237971", "sentence": "We understood the resort is just getting back on its feet however we felt with the Rosewood brand the training could have been a little bit better. To start on a positive note the resort was beautiful our room was amazing. We loved the decor as explained on the website. However no extra pillows in the room in the closets unles that was a over site on our end. We did not ask for more due to anything we asked for took very long so when it was time for bed we just wanted to go to bed. We told our butlers before and at check in it was our anniversary not once was any special thing in our room or at dinner for us. This is strange we travel to amazing resorts and this is a norm in high end facilities. The first night at dinner was a cluster at Pavilion from just getting flat water to our table to a cocktail. The servers seemed so confused to be honest just not trained enough. Things with the servers totally slipped through the cracks. Someone would seat us ask us what we would want to drink we would order does not come at all then our server came literally 30 min later asking us what we would like to drink and if we want break. Not Hi I am Sara welcome to Little Dix Bay good evening may I get you a cocktail. It was Godnight what most said we figured it was a local thing no bid deal we caught on. want bread what do you want to drink. Then I waited for my margarita no joke over 20 min and there were only about 15 tables in the restaurant with people this also happened each breakfast and dinner another night. We had better service at the beach and at restaurants off property. We rented a Moke and waited and waited for our butler to get in touch with the people who own the things. so that sucked up lots of our time that morning. The spa was wonderful we had a great experience we loved that. The snorkeling was wonderful with the sea turtles and fish. At the beach when we came down and pushed our buttons the attendants were prompt getting what we would ask for except not putting our towels out for us. Again at a high end resort I m totally ok with putting out my own towels no problem at all. But shocking when they just put them down. The servers where wonderful Donna or Diana she has a twin sister that works there too Jalen and shoot a young guy with braids beautiful eyes and has a new son. He was great. Klara at the restaurants was so happy and lovely to see and happy to be working. Our trip was restful and lovely my score is based off the Rosewood not training up to par for opening. But we will definitely come back. We of course want you all to know so you can better assist your employees for the future of your guest. Also there was a bad communication with our butler and departure time with the boat. We were almost late to the airport thank goodness our flight was delayed. But again lack of communication was poor.", "offset": [2334, 2414], "date": "2020-02-16 01:52:40", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "b9404932-d35a-46e2-b529-2b9986c9f464", "sentence": "One Of The Best Beachs Ever.

The Beach drops offs with a picnic lunch are a real treat and should not be missed. The water is perfect. The history of the resort is fascinating.

We were less than pleased with the butler support and in fact our butler failed to tell us that our flight had changed and we had to race to the airport and hour and half early and almost missed our flight. Also the butler line on the phone was never answered other than by the front desk. The butler said it was the airports fault and that they had not told her but we do not believe that was the case since the service was erratic throughout and the airport confirmed that they had reached out. We also each day heard as we sat on our balcony. one of the housekeepers berate people over the phone for the lack of linens etc. and had to leave our balcony and she kept saying that this was not really a 5 star resort. Not a good impression to give. We will definitely come back because we enjoy the property but hope that some of the kinks of reopening in terms of the quality of service throughout the resort will be resolved. Thanks.

Had never been to the BVI and obviously not the fabled LDBRosewod has done a great job with rebuilding after the storm. it is next to impossible to replace what a major hurricane destroys. The overall property looks great and the room was wonderful though there a couple of small things that could be tweaked to make the stay a bit better. The disappointing part. The staff overall was great hardworking well meaning and friendly. There were two notable exceptions. First the butler who was assigned to our room was simply missing in action. On the day of our arrival we were greeted by the butler. She escorted us to our room and asked about dinner. We said 7 pm at the Pavilion and she said she had make the reservation and come by about ten until 7 to walk us over. She never showed up so finally at ten after 7 we walked over to the Pavilion by ourselves. And there was no reservation. The next day she again asked about dinner reservations and we said 8 at the Reef House. We arrived at 8 and there was no reservation. They were able to fit us in so it was not a significant issue. And from that point on we started going directly to the front desk to make reservations and the only problem we had there was on our last night we requested dinner at 8 at the Reef House and when we showed up there was no reservation not the butlers fault. We had also asked the butler about arranging a car rental for Tuesday. We went to the front desk area at the time we agreed on 11 am and the butler was finishing up with someone while we waited. She then excused herself to check on the car and became clear after about a half an hour that she had dropped the ball again but was able to arrange for the car. On the afternoon of our last day we returned to the room after being at the beach and found a bucket of ice on the table. We had not ordered it. My wife ordered some room service and when it was delivered she asked the woman about the ice. She said that the butler was supposed to be providing it everyday. When my wife told her this was the first time we had received any ice the woman said something along the lines of somebodys been slacking. So our overall experience with the butler service was not great. The second disappointment was with the dining service. And we both basically agreed that the servers had simply not been trained properly. We do not know if that is because there was a rush to open the resort and there just was not time or if this is as good as it gets in the BVI. Hopefully the former. One quick example. The wine service was sloppy. The the server finished pouring a glass he she just pulled the glass away dribbling along the way. And because the tables are mostly wooden slats there were several occasions when the wine dripped through and onto our feet fortunately never hitting our clothes. As I said the staff seemed well meaning but they just did not seem to know what to do. I do want to add that our housekeeper was great and the young man Devon. who served us on the beach was also wonderful. And the spa was also a great experience. Beyond the staff issues the food service itself left us unimpressed. There were a few good dishes but by and large the food was just not what we expected. One example was the eggs Benedict. I had it three times and it was consistent. The muffin was so over toasted that it took a fair amount of pressure to cut through it. The bacon was paper thin. The egg whites were typically translucent not cooked enough. And the hollandaise not a sauce but more like a dollop of sour cream glopy. And this is just one example. So is this a training issue or is there just a skilled labor problem that is part of life in Virgin Gorda and throughout the BVIWe also felt like the menu offerings were a bit strange trying too hard to do something different but then falling short on execution. And the wine list particularly by the glass across all three restaurants was too limited. No opportunity for each restaurant to express itself. I assume the resort has a sommelier that could work with each location to create separate wine lists or at least have a couple of unique offerings per location. The beach food service could probably be expanded a bit more finger foods. And the distance from kitchen to the customer makes it difficult to deliver fresh and not food. I do not know how you solve that problem other that to add another kitchen facility further down the beach or cut back on the foods eg French Fries. that require hot delivery. Just before we left for the trip I read some of the reviews on TripAdvisor and I told my wife I do not want to be one of those people. I think private feedback like this is more appropriate and is hopefully more helpful. We are looking forward to a return visit post CoronaVirus. in a couple of years and we hope that things will have stabilized with respect to some of these issues. Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback and let me know if you need any more information.

This is a difficult review to write as we wanted our experience to be truly outstanding. In some respects it was but in too many areas it was not yet up to Rosewood standards. Part of the problem is that the hotel opened up only two months before we arrived after a multi year renovation and much of the staff was still learning their roles. While I am only giving the hotel an average rating we will likely come back if we see that the ratings on TA improve. Positive aspects. the grounds and the beach are truly beautiful. The beach staff was fantastic and delivered first class service. The ocean view suite we had was spacious. I did not like the furniture as. it was low to the ground and not comfortable for a person like me who is 64. I felt like I was in munchkin land. Negative aspects Room service was spotty. We had breakfast in our room each day and during our 8 day trip 3 of the breakfasts were not right. They had either the wrong or incomplete order. Very frustrating to get coffee but they forget to bring coffee cups. Restaurants. The hotel has three restaurants. Our favorite was the Reef which is at the end of the pier where the boat docks. We had a few meals at the Pavilion but we did not find the food as good as the Reef. Another problem with the Pavilion is that most of the dining chairs are too low to the ground. Again not comfortable for a person of my size. Butler service. This is something new to me where literally everything you do in terms of meal reservations special requests breakfast orders go through this one indivdual. Personally I did not like it. Much prefer the old way where you have a concierge desk. etc. Also in our case we were going back to the USA on a private jet from the Tortola airport and I asked our butler where the private jets leave from. He told me to go to the main terminal and our pilots would find us. Fortunately on the way over we checked with our van driver who took us from the LDB boat to the airport and he took us to the FBO which was before the main terminal. Had I not checked with the van driver we would have been let off in the wrong place. Last point. We had an ocean view suite but did not realize at the time of booking that this would be on the second floor of a two story building. My wife who is physically challenged had a very difficult time getting up and down the stairs especially since there were no hand rails. In the future we will insist on a ground floor room. I truly hope LDB gets their act together as we would like to return.", "offset": [1441, 1597], "date": "2020-03-17 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}]}
