I bought the groupon deal and hoped for the best. I was greeted by a very nice man at the registration desk who pleasantly checked us in early. Room was supposed to come with free WIFI but it constantly went down. WIFI is crap. When I got to the room it looked decent but the bathroom was not very clean. There was a wad of hair on the floor and baseboards looked like they have not been cleaned in years. I do not exactly have high standards for cleanliness but this was gross for even me. The beds are so uncomfortable. It feels like a thin pilowtop on a concrete bed. it is so hard. Who wants to sleep on a thin pillow over concreteIn the bathroom water dripped from the ceiling light from the floor above. This freaked us out as we thought the whole ceiling could collapse if a tub above was overflowing. When we called to report this the front desk offered to change our room. However did not care if the water was overflowing because there was no maintenance person available. So in our California drought did not care if water was continuously running or if it damaged their hotel because they just did not care. I would not stay here again.
