I understand that the website mentions that its closed on weekdays however there is a mention that it may be opened in March so I called on Friday before the arrival and was told that yes it is indeed open. I asked on check in on Monday whether it is open and was told yes it is certainly open. Turns out it was not. The front desk manager apologized and assured me that it would be opened on Wednesday. Wednesday comes around nope it will be opened on Thursday. 2. Surfcomber pool option. No choice but to go there on Tuesday it worked out fine I actually enjoyed their pool and service. Go Wednesday guess what. Pool is closed for a private party you can not even go through to get to the beach. Must go around on the street to walk to the beach. Two chairs are complimentary but umbrella is 20 extra towels are extra and. because of the private pool party there is no drinks service to the beach and food menu is limited to 3 items. If my business is not valued I go elsewhere so we left3. At check in was given a room with a ceiling that had a water leak entire carpet was soaking wet. Room was changed without an issue. The front desk manager decided to offer me a 100 credit to the Area 31 for the room and the pool mix up. Turns out that this never materialized. Area 31 did not see it. On the check out it was not reflected in the bill and when I asked the person checking me out had no idea what I was talking about4. Construction around the hotel is loud. Seriously loud.

Only to find that any Tom Dick or Harry can access the pool area on the 16th floor. They can bring their picnic lunch bought at Walgrens and lounge about for free when we had stumped up just under 300 for the night before so we could. We brought it to attention of management to address with the non residents. Which they did n\u2019t. We brought it to there attention again a number of hours later and were told contradictory info and it still was n\u2019t addressed. The shift manager we complained to actually said to us \u201c what do you want me to do about it \u201d. We had to suggest to her what we thought was suitable as a offer to satisfy our complaint. That was a free breakfast. We then headed to our room on the 18th floor only to find we could n\u2019t hear ourselves talk due to the constant drilling from the construction site right outside. There was no pre warning on their webpage or directly to us prior to arrival to advise of possible noise and dirt pollution due to this building site. We complained again and were moved to the 29th floor. Where said noise could still be heard. Also there was paint on the curtains from recent renovations and the balcony door was so heavy getting it open was hard work. When we did it only opened enough to shimmy out sideways. Then just to finish off we decided to lounge around the pool prior to departing. Two issues here. We had checked out and we got chased down by the receptionist who broadcast to use and the surrounding guests that \u201c we owed her 8 \u201d. not \u201c sorry there had been a mistake with your change \u201d. etc. It \u2019s a tad embarrassing to approached that way in public. It was her mistake but it made us feel awkward. Then a few minutes later I was booted out of the only area that had shade in the pool area because the public area was being shut for a private function. A function that has a little sign saying the pool area was being closed at half three. Yet I am typing this from reception at 1350 hrs.
