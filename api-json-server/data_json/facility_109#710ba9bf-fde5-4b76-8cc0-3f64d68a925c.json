When my new husband and I returned to the room after we got married the place still had the food we ordered for lunch while the brides party were getting ready.

Management only seem to be spending money on functions with big money spent of lobby face lift and new convention center and rooms. We stayed last year around the same time for a week and it was a completely different trip more catered for familys had pims bar and chill area and inflatable adventure course and decent food at the grab it and go and pool bar. Most restaurants outlets are shut or only used for functions or run with a limited menu. Pool bar only served fish and chips or chips Grab it and go menu is the same as the bar restaurant except with kids meals and was overpriced the in house movies and tv is also well out of date and had been the same since I was young. The amount of buggies golf carts utes and other assets sitting around was amazing but none where is use. It seems as a guest that the hotel has just cut all services and we ate most meals of site which was a shame as it used to be a place you could come and not need to leave also on the main website page they still have pictures of the inflatable course giving the impression it is still there the kids where crushed on our first trip to the pool and lake to find its just not there. This place used to run so well and the activities they had would keep the kids and us busy on our trip it now has a dream world feel now where everything is worn out and old and shutting down but they do not spend any money and still charge you more than before as an acor member very disappointed for the value for money and for the first time in my life would advise people not to go there. The car park is not allocated to room numbers and as you allow the public in its near impossible to get a park near you room and if you leave you will be driving around for 20 mins to find another one and have to stalk people leaving just to get a spot Acor card gave me no value or savings on the trip and we could not use our free nights we have been members for years and have never been able to use our so called free nights as they always have an excuse why you ca nt redeem them. This time we where told on no you have to do it when you book even thou there is no clear way to do it I took it up with a staff member in the lobby upon arrival and was told not we had to do it when booking. This is quite clearly an money grab as you have no intention of rewarding your club members as you wo nt part with the and only allow them to use them in non peak times in winter. The staff are the only thing keeping this place going as there service friendly nature and helpful ness almost make you forget about the other issues.

This review will be long for fairness. Tldr not accessible friendly long rambling design makes it easy to get lost repeatedly. Staff are magical elves. I am an injured person unable to walk long distances or up down stairs. My husband and I booked in for my birthday weekend. Check in took over an hour due to the long queue at 2 pm 20 minutes but staff were lovely and inviting. We were informed on where to park our car and given a room upgrade we are Acor Plus members. The next 40 minutes was spent walking in circles dragging our bags as we passed other new holiday makers who were also as lost as we were. The signage at this resort is deplorable. An example does an up arrow mean continue on straight or go up stairs. Another example sign saying day spa and gym are straight ahead but when you get to the spa there are no further signs to the gym. We did ask a friendly cleaner where to go and she was n\u2019t sure so pointed us to a vague \u201c over there somewhere \u201d. So after spending 40 minutes trying to find our room we realised it was going to be upstairs. My husband went back to reception and stood in line again to get our room changed even though we had not even found it yet. They upgraded us again thank you very much to a one bedroom which was on the far end of the resort. The room was beautifully appointed the king bed was incredibly comfortable and although dated the unit was clean and serviceable. Fabulous air conditioning and sound proofing. The walk from our room to the pool felt like 4 kms but was probably only 300 metres. Either way doing this several times a day to use the pool or go to the restaurant was incredibly difficult and exhausting. There are no elevators anywhere. The staff knew of my injuries when they moved our rooms and to be fair to them there is little they can do the rambling design means that to get from the pool to the deli cafe directly behind it without using stairs is an additional 70metre walk using ramps. This resort is one of the most inaccessible places I \u2019ve been to. I can not imagine how hard it would be for those in wheelchairs. You can not access the lagoon no ramp or the day spa we could n\u2019t find a way in and there was no obvious way to enter their Acor Vacation Club building. Even the pool was hard to access. Golf karts abound here but for use by the staff only. There were a LOT of holiday makers here even though it was deemed low occupancy. The pool in their photos looks enormous but is in actuality smaller than shown and we bumped around in amongst the other people there. The low occupancy meant that the Nouveau restaurant closed after the Saturday night for two weeks until Valentine \u2019s Day. Your other eating option for dinner is Sola which is overpriced and uninspired 15 for a bowl of hot chips. There are many lagoon facilities for those staying here provided you can access the beach which I could n\u2019t but the Lagoon Fish and Chipery remained firmly closed and activities were limited during our stay. This Novotel really struggles with its identity somethings are labelled Novotel Twin Waters like their email address yet our resort wristbands were stamped as Novotel Sunshine Coast Resort. While this may seem like a trifle this lack of unification seemed to underline the feeling of the whole holiday experience everything is hodgepodge and tacked together with duct tape. It was as if the Novotel is trying to exude 4 star quality in a 2 star building design. Whilst we admit that we chose our accommodation poorly due to my injury it is sad that such a great opportunity for a restful break turned into an exhausting and painful experience. But in area of staff the Novotel once again shines like the diamond it \u2019s chain is known for. The wait staff at the Nouveau restaurant were particularly incredible and I sent an email directly to the food and beverage people letting them know how fabulous their dinner staff were. All of the staff were friendly and obliging and this helped turn my birthday holiday into something stellar. If you are looking for a 2 star resort this is a 4 star experience.

There was not a whole lot of vegetarian or vegan options and I feel vegetarian options were really recycled and not fresh. The seafood buffet was not much of a seafood buffet I was really hanging out for some healthy choices but there was not unfortunately. The breakfast buffet was very average as well the fresh fruit was not fresh it was old and we found flies in it again not a whole lot of vegetarian options not even mushrooms but you had three types of eggs. I felt a lot of the food was Superdry like he had been out for a couple of days before hand on the buffet it did not feel like it was fresh at all. I felt like there was a lot of processed foods to make it easier for the kitchen. I want to say a big thank you to the kids club as they were amazing what a fantastic lady Helen was with my children and what a wonderful facility you have their. Everything else was amazing it was a great stay for our wedding anniversary of 12 years it would have been nice to stay longer then one night. but hopefully next time we can stay longer. Hands down staff at your facility had genuine customer service and you do not find that too often. The refurb that you have done in some parts of the hotel I was looking amazing hopefully you can carry that through the rest of the hotel as you have done an amazing job with the bar and the reception area through to the bathrooms inside. Thank you guys for making our stay wonderful.", "offset": [2043, 2141], "date": "2020-03-03 21:59:41", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "c1d723cf-9b22-4453-8a5d-45164f120897", "sentence": "Disappointing. What a beautiful entrance and foyer and what a disappointing experience for the money charged. Friendly and helpful staff at reception redeemed our experience but will choose another place to stay next time.", "offset": [15, 109], "date": "2020-03-04 06:56:18", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}]}
