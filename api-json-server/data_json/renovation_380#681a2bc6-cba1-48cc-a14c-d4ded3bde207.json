This is a very nice hotel with good service. It is located very close to popular restaurants and bars and quite close to the capitol building. The hotel restaurant is expensive but there are other more inexpensive options within the hotel and adjoining building complex. There is a charge to use the computer in the business center which I found odd. It did not matter since the computers kept shutting down since a person in an adjoining office was using a space heater and tripping the breaker. The maintenance staff had to change the breaker to fix the problem. I was there for a conference a friend had to change his room due to close proximity to maids closet and elevator so avoid them. Parking the hotel garage is expensive. You can park in the garage right across the street for almost half the price. Great views from the rooms.

Hotel could use some attention. I stayed at the Omni over a weekend for a friends formal wedding. The hotel was nice but could use some upgrading especially in the rooms my sink was cracked the bathroom vanity was cracked etc. Additionally when I checked in I found some stray hairs that did not belong to me in the bed and in the bathtub. That was made worse by the fact that the hotel never cleaned my room on my only full day there Saturday the night of the formal event despite the fact that I was gone from 930am to 130pm and when I left for the event at 430pm the cleaning crew was tending to the room directly across the hall from mine and SAW ME LEAVE.

Day two Saturday. Jackhammers seemed directly above us no way to get away from the vibration and noise. Got invited to club no 24 hr anything at the club no coffee no espresso. lackluster. Club opened up at happy hour small plate complimentary wine and beer soft drinks nice but not extra special. no real lobby to sit just 4 chairs in one area 4 chairs or so in another. Starbucks in lobby under supplied for breakfast foods as they ran out of basics. Waited for 12 minutes for restaurant to boil some eggs. Excellent restaurant staff very nice.
