We just returned from the Melia Nassau Beach Resort yesterday March 31st and though many of the reviews had me a bit nervous our trip was still a nice break from the snowy east coast. do not let the website fool you I had booked this reservation because of the all inclusive appeal. I work at the only 5 star hotel in Vermont and we are by all means all inclusive. Prior to booking our reservation I even contacted the Melia to confirm what was included at which point I was told all of our meals and beverages as well as activities. This was not the case at all and had we been told that right off the bat we would have chosen another resort to enjoy our honeymoon. Prior to arriving I had requested a room with a great view and inquired about a possible upgrade upon arrival. Not only did our room look out over an array of condos not on the property but the balcony was wedged off at an angle that did not allow for any space to relax and take it all in. Though our check in was quite effortless the woman never smiled and when I asked about upgrading and adding on an additional 2 nights she told me we would have to talk to reservations. We were on the 6th floor and the elevator by our room was broken as was the lock on our door so every time we were essentially locked out of our room we had to walk through multiple hallways just to get to an elevator to get to the front desk and then wait in line one time over an hour for everyone else to get checked in even though we just needed a key that worked. One time it took us FOUR trips up and down and after almost wetting my pants waiting for security to try and open the door I literally went into the room next to ours that was open for housekeeping but no housekeeping was present and scaled across the outdoor landing railing from their balcony to ours at 6 stories up mind you just to get into our room in time for me not to be forced to pee in the hallway. The key still did not work and so on our last day night there we had to change rooms which meant spending what should have been a romantic afternoon on the beach packing and unpacking all of our belongings with no assistance from anyone at the resort. I must say housekeeping was amazing always friendly and always smiling and the polside servers were great. It seemed like anyone working behind the bar or on the floor could care less if we were happy in fact more often than not we felt like we were a burden to them. The grounds are beautiful and the beach is great. The beach chairs are in dire need of repair unles you enjoy sink holes and bars lodged into your back. The food was despicable from high end to late night bar food we found ourselves filling up on microwaved breakfast sandwiches from Starbucks. Imagine paying 14 for nachos that consist of stale chips and gas station cheese not even melted shredded cheese but yellow goop and forget about any veggies or salsa. Some lucky couple did take advantage of us buying what was obviously a night out charged to our room but never ordered or signed for by us. Since there was no real way to prove this we were told we would have to pay for the charges. We were really excited for golfing but the golf course is currently out of commission and the wind surfing that we had hoped to enjoy was going to be an additional 175 each so we did not get to do that either. I have been in the hospitality industry my whole life and would be mortified if my guests ever treated the way that we were especially with issues that were out of our control. On the total flip side if you are looking for a great family escape I would imagine that this would be ideal it is a safe and entertaining environment if romance and dining are not at the top of your priority list. Room Tip Get on with a key that works. And not next to the broken elevator.", "offset": [3145, 3354], "date": "2015-01-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "adea4515-c4e4-401d-a1b5-03051f9cd7fb", "sentence": "You Get What You Pay For View From an Experienced Traveler. Bottom line great beaches reasonably priced good food average service average rooms. After a lifetime of world travels and a well researched perspective on the Melia below is a more detailed discussion of our 5 day4 night anniversary trip to the resort God1. Price I recommend all inclusive do NOT stay here if you do not do the all inclusive experience. The Bahamas imports 95 of its produce as such the food prices are outrageous ie more expensive than NYC. Other goods and services are comparable in price to that of major US cities. 2. Beaches after traveling all over Europe to Asia up and down the US coasts this was the most beautiful beach I have ever seen Cable Beach. The turquoise waters and sandy beaches are breathtaking especially during low tide mid afternoon. Many local vendors WILL try to sell you stuff on the beaches so be prepared to just say NO. Not as bad as other Caribbean islands but still a nuisance after the 20th vendor comes to your beach chair asking you to buy a shirt necklace. We were a bit afraid at first to leave our belongings at our chair while in the water due to the number of locals roaming the beach3. Food. the food was better than what my wife and I expected above par for the price. Absolutely make reservations at the resort restaurants. Nikei Aqua Cilantro. Although my wife and I experienced a mild food poisoning after eating at Aqua steak we would still go back there although not to eat the steak. The tapas restaurant in the lobby Esta Vida was a great date experience in a great location but the food was the worst in the resort at ridiculous prices if you are not doing the all inclusive. All the food tasted microwaveable did not look nor taste fresh. The Marketplace downstairs is a must breakfast and lunch were amazing. The outdoor burger joint near the beach was also quick and delicious4. Alcohol the service was a bit slow at times hard to get used to Island time but the fruity beach drinks were amazing. Definitely nothing top shelf. Jack and coke is a no go so is Baileys. I highly recommend the pina coladas5. Starbucks not included in the all inclusive but a definite advantage although this was by far the most expensive Starbucks I have been to 795 for a mocha. 6. Outside the resort if you have a few extra days and feel adventurous I recommend venturing off the resort. Take the 10 bus outside the Melia to downtown Nassau 15minute ride for 125. Downtown is worth seeing but be prepared for dirty conditions barred windows and litter everywhere not quite a first world country. I also recommend taking a 4 ferry vice a 5 taxi to the Atlantis. there is not much to see unles you are staying at the Atlantis or on a cruise the Atlantis bars you from entering their property beyond the casino. Apparently the Atlantis and the Melia are in stiff competition and many of the Melia guests are denied entry entirely. 7. Location you are a 15minute taxi bus ride from the airport. A huge plusBad1. Construction DO NOT STAY HERE UNTIL THE BAHA MAR CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE. The multi billion dollar resort being built next door funded by the Chinese and to employ over 120 employees bigger than the Atlantis made the resort look more like a workplace and less like a resort. Hundreds of construction workers project managers businessmen eat in the restaurants drink at the bars hang out outside and walk the resort daily. I felt like I was back in Washington DC at times. It was even awkward seeing so many construction workers outside checking out the women on the beach2. Service. I rated service as average because although there were times of great service the majority of the time I felt that the staff resented us for serving us. A general sense of discontent overwhelmed the majority of the staff. The check in check out staff was not friendly at all probably due to the hundreds of construction workers checking in checking out. And do not try to rent a watersport activity when we tried signing the waiver form at 10 am on We d March 17th there were four workers talking to each other in the hut completely ignoring us. We ended up walking away after a few minutes. The reservation ladies Clara Pamela were very helpful. There needs to be more staff like them. The bellhops were also friendly. 3. Activities there is a void in the amount and quality of activities available. The included water activities are worth it but the social environment of the resort is lacking. We had a vocalist one night which was amazing. Since there is nothing to do immediately outside the resort you have to take a taxi to downtown activities are a must. But if you are fine with relaxing on the beach during your entire stay then ignore this comment. 4. Rooms I would put rooms in the average category because not all rooms are ocean view like many posts have mentioned. Our room room 137 faced the back of a service hut. We could not see the ocean. Not a huge deal if you plan on spending most of your time outside the room though5. Comparison to other resorts if you have had good experiences at other Caribbean resorts you will likely be disappointed at the Melia. If you are willing to pay more I had recommend staying elsewhere. it is definitely no SandalsIf you want additional details about our experience or further recommendations please contact my old secondary email account cjwy8cumkcedu.

I read every review on here in preparation for our stay at Melia Nasua April 4 April 9 2015. Our group consisted of 5 adults 4 TODDLERS and 1 infant. So you know. chaos potential. In the end we had a great vacation and the property is an amazing value for the money. I recommend upgrading to a Level room. it is not that much more money and you are treated very well. Service for us was attentive and friendly. You get what you give people. If you act like an a why would anyone be nice back. We came prepared to tip heavily and we did. We smiled at everyone and they smiled back. The staff was super sweet to our babies and relaxed with the toddlers. The property is an old Sheraton and in some areas it definitely shows its age. That might be a turn off if you are expecting new construction. We booked Level rooms and were immediately guided to the Level lounge for check in. Adrian at the Level desk was funny helpful kind and patient. He made sure the kids had snacks booked all of our dinners for early evening and in private dining rooms genius. to accommodate the toddler factor. We arrived at 1PM ish and our rooms were ready within 30The Level lounge is a great amenity. My 3 year old tells me the lounge was the best part of his vacation. With the wide variety of free soda premium bar and finger foods plus guest iMacs and a beautiful view of the property who can blame him. The main lobby is chic and modern the decor rivals any W or Kimpton boutique property out there with Jonathon Adler inspired accents and violet up lighting. Same with the restaurants food was far above average for an all inclusive. Nekai and Esta Vida were our favorite. Cilantro was good too. The guacamole was fresh and the desserts inspired. The Market buffet offered variety with fresh healthy options but plenty of indulgences. You can tell they have a chef on staff. The beach is beautiful. Plenty of chairs. Towel service is a bit of a cluster. Drink and food service can be slow on the beach but it is not that far to the bar if you are that annoyed. Lots of free non motorized water sports. The Kid and Co club has baskets of sand toys for the kids which they loved. Level Romance Suite was spacious with an ocean view and upgraded toiletries which I appreciate.

Being my first time in the Bahamas I spent 3 nights at the Atlantis followed by 3 nights all inclusive at the Melia. I found myself very disappointed in the Melia for a number of reasons with my main grievance being the staffs lack of urgency to correct items in disrepair on the property which included wifi service. My experiences On a Wednesday I checked in at 11 am early I was told my room would not be ready until 3 pm which was understandable so I had bellman hold my one bag. At that time I was given my wrist band and I asked for the wifi password but that was denied me until 3 pm when I checked into my room. So I had 4 hours to explore the property. At Atlantis despite there being 12 pools on the property there was not a SINGLE HOT TUB for guests most likely because there was a casino on the property and like Vegas pools are closed at night and hot tubs not offered to keep the guests in the bars and casinos. But I was aware of this ahead of time so was very much looking forward to using the hot tubs that the Melia offered. Well I learned right away that one of the hot tubs had been broken for 6 months and was covered with a tarp and the second tub had broken down that day and would continue to be out of service for the duration of my trip. To make matters worse the water in the pools was so damn cold I never swam during my stay. When I did go outside to check out the grounds and Cable Beach I was disappointed. It was a long stretch of beach but there was absolutely no current whatsoever no shells nothing. It was like sitting by the edge of a lake. I could have gotten that by traveling 4 hours to Lake Tahoe and not spend thouands and an 8hour flight to vacation in the Caribbean. Last year I visited St Thomas and St John where you are talking about a lush landscape featuring over 30 beaches each with its own character and most with some degree of current the same goes for the Florida beaches many rich with shells for shelling. In that respect I was very disappointed that Nassau Island did not offer a beach with a current. There was a beach at Atlantis that had some character and waves I longed to be back there once I got a look at Melias Cable Beach. Also was not thrilled with the hotel granting the locals license to peddle their wares on the beach. I do not like relaxing on a beach only to be constantly bombarded by sales pitches. I can get harassment like that from the homeless in San Francisco back homeWhen 3 pm did roll around I picked up my bag and checked in at the front desk. Again I asked for the wifi code and I was given the pascode on a slip of paper. The room was v contemporary with nice furnishings and linens and view however hallways were in desperate need of repainting and touch up repair. As soon as I got in my room I unpacked all of my things and then proceeded to check my internet. The GUEST wifi was down. I went downstairs to front desk to inquire. The girl asked me if I put in the right password. I said yes. Then she asked me if I had chosen the right network. I said yes. then she FINALLY mentions It could be because the wifi is down. Assuming it was a temporary thing I said So it should be up again soon. She said Yes. So I proceeded to go to a lobby chair and waited 15 minutes then tried my laptop again. Still no wifi. Suddenly a guest seated across from me asked Oh did the wifi come back up. I said No. Then she says to me it is been down the whole time wev been here due to some poor weather they say knocked it out and we got here 4 days ago. She told me that while the Guest network was down the staff network was operating how CONVENIENT for them and that guests were being directed to check their email using the Concierges spare PC at her desk. So that is what I used for 24 hours while the wifi was down as I was very fortunate that it did come up by 1 pm next day. So essentially the FRONT DESK STAFF WAS FULLY AWARE THAT THE GUESTS WIFI NETWORK HAD BEEN DOWN FOR DAYS BUT CONCEALED THAT FACT FROM GUESTS CHECKING IN. That is INEXCUSABLE and UNETHICAL. For I can guarantee you if I had learned this upon check in I would have gone back to Atlantis and I am sure I am not the only one. and I am SURE MELIA KNEW THAT. TOO. HOWEVER. it potentially gets worse. It was since suggested to me by a friend who used to live and work in Vegas that likely the staff of the Melia may have very well disabled the Guest network in an effort to see that guests spend their nights in the hotels CASINO and bars as opposed to being other wise occupied by the internet in their rooms. Apparently this used to be a common practice in Vegas hotels and I would not be surprised if the tactic was employed during my stay at Melia. How does the WEATHER manage to knock out the Guest network for 5 days but for the staff network it is business as usual. Very suspicious. With the hotels closing before 7 and the hot tubs also being inoperable and no other forms of entertainment within walking distance of the resort the only thing left to occupy the guests time at night is the Casino and bar. I do not gamble and I rarely drink and as a woman I travel alone so except for using the gym or watching the hotels HBO I depend on my internet at night. I actually need to check my email several times a day for my business so wifi is imperative. if this practice of shutting down the wifi was employed by Melia I was NOT impressed and would suggest that other BEWARE. I enjoyed the Marketplace buffets and the all inclusive price would have been a fair value if the pool water was not cold and if the hot tubs were operating for that cut down on my amenity use significantly. Another smaller concern I had was in the rooms. There is NO phone book OR hotel guide in the room and no directory of any kind on the phone even so if you need information on hours of operation of any of the restaurants in the building or hotel services or local business addresses and phone numbers you are out of luck. And if you have no wifi you are screwedAlso. the printed out television channel guide was of no help whatsoever as the channels did not correspond with what is actually on the tv so that requires updating. All in all because of the Casino influence dominating at the Bahamian hotels I do not plan to ever return to the Bahamas. The people are generally very kind and hospitable and of course the local cuisine is fabulous but I think I will stick to the US Virgin Isles Cayman Islands etc when it comes to returning to the Caribbean.", "offset": [5076, 5229], "date": "2015-06-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "ba9e79f5-2dcc-40b1-a3b2-e4765699e4dc", "sentence": "For the most part it was nice.

We were in The Bahamas during a freak winter storm and there was construction going on at Melia right outside our room \u2014 so this is not an unbiased review. Regardless the unseasonable weather kept us indoors so my wife and I became well acquainted with the hotel instead of the beach. First of all this entire hotel has seen better days. The faint sour smell of its smokey casino past permeates the entire property and peeling wallpaper and worn carpets are everywhere. So I hope that the construction that was taking place during our stay extends to a complete renovation of the corridors and rooms. The staff were good but nobody really went out of their way for us. With mandatory concierge reservations for meals at most restaurants perpetual lines at the front desk and the bars my guess is that procedural overhaul is necessary to raise their standards. The hotel spa was the worst overpriced and with completely inept personnel \u2014 not trained therapists. It was great to be right on the waters edge in Nassau but if you decide on this hotel go for the beach or pool views \u2014 our city view room looked out into the back yards of various hotels where staff took smoke breaks and hauled rubbish. We were told that Melia was fully booked and our room could not be changed. The pools were usually busy and getting a lounger in the sun was often a competitive riddle amongst vacationers as was obtaining a coffee from the on site Starbucks. Lots of hotel activities and many families resulted in a constant hubbub \u2014 think flea market outdoor Zumba class and soccer game at the bar \u2014 which is not great if you are looking for serenity or relaxation anywhere other than your room. I do not mean for this to be a negative review of the hotel since our room was large and adequately stocked and the food at the restaurants satisfied a broad palette when you could get into them. There is a lot to do and the breakfast buffet was pretty well run. But if you are looking for a restful enlightening luxurious Bahamas experience this probably is not the place for you. PS.

Getting There. My family of 4 wife two young adult children visited on 1 13 16 when our Carnival cruise ship docked in Nassau. Day was slightly overcast and chilly but as we are from Ohio it was still summer temps to us. As the ship was offering a excursion to the Hilton that sold out I researched several other cruise blog sites and came across Melia. I believe at one time this was Sheraton property but is now a part of Melia Resorts. We did debate whether or not to go based on the recent advisory issued by the US Embassy in Nassau dealing with the crime issue they are having right now. As seasoned cruisers we knew that if you follow some basic common sense practices Nassau is actually a fairly safe place especially near the cruise port and beach resorts. We sort of gambled on the fact that we would not need reservations due to the weather and we where correct. We departed the ship at 9 am and was able to quickly find a friendly taxi driver Note We only use cruise line approved taxis in the Caribbean these are the ones allowed into the main fenced port area. there are many who are assembled near the outside gates but traveler beware we had a horrifying experience in Jamaica once by trying to save a few bucks who agreed on the price of 50 roundtrip for the family Melia is about a 10 15 ride from the port. Taxi driver gave me his card and agreed to pick us back up at a preset time which he did. Only complaint with taxi was the front passenger seat belt was broken as the driver asked me to hold the belt over by shoulder until we passed a traffic officer. He was very apologetic and promised to have the belt fixed when he returned which he did as well. Cost Melia is a beautiful resort with a grand covered entrance expected of a property with it is star rating. We were able to walk right into the main lobby and we immediately assisted by the very friendly concierge who was standing in the middle of the lobby assisting departing guests with bracelet removal and taxi service. When we told him we were getting day passes he informed us that the surf was rough but that all pools and hot tubs were open. Was directed to the Main Desk were we were assisted by a very friendly clerk who charged us each 35 US for the day pass which included access to all public areas of the hotel and pool area the private beach with lounge chairs and umbrellas at no extra cost and the shower and changing rooms. Additionally a Starbucks in located in the main lobby a full service location not a lobby kiosk as you find in some hotels. Also included in the 35 per person fee is complimentary beach towels so do not worry about lugging ship towels with you. After paying with a credit card we were given bracelets plastic cards to redeem for towels at the towel hut by the pool and directions to the steps leading to the beach area. There are motorized and non motorized beach activities available such as kayaks but snorkeling is the only activity included in the price of your day pass. Wave runner rentals were available as well. And of course for my kids the best free perk of al strong complimentary WIFI that can be accessed even at the beach. Amenities The pools were clean but cold and the hot tubs both needed a good scrubbing but were sufficient. I believe that there are 5 6 pools as well as waterfall areas. The beach is clean and the loungers and umbrellas are in excellent condition. There are beach vendors that sit near the waters edge and will approach as soon as you make your way unto the beach area. I do not know this for fact but it appeared there was an unseen line between the resort and the ocean that the vendors did not cross. Once we politely declined they left us alone the rest of the day. The beach and ocean area are private to the resort and simply breathtaking. This is the pictures you see in the brochures even on a gray windy and overcast day. Surf was a little up but not bad. What actually made going in to the ocean difficult is how steep the beach is. Combined with moderate waves this created a very strong undertow so after just getting our feet wet we decided that the pools were a much safer option. Food Dining Starbucks is your best bet as they offer all the pastries and light sandwiches normally available here in the States. There is an outdoor buffet available for guests hotel is all inclusive but day passers will pay 40 per person for food that did not look at all enticing. The resorts guests we talked too all complained about the food available on the buffets and told us that the quality items are in up charged restaurants on site. 3 Italian Steakhouse and Mexican. We are not drinkers even socially so although there all many bars located throughout the resort I can not report on the service or pricing. Overal A good day for a inexpensive cruise excursion especially is you want a laid back beach experience. I was able to take my family of four to Melia for less than the cost of one beach access ticket at Atlantis. Staff was hit and miss with the exception of the Starbucks personnel. I kinda got the vibe from the resort folks that day trippers are kind of like second class citizens to them. We had one issue in that the desk clerk told us that all non motorized beach rentals were included when in fact they are not only snorkeling equipment but that was not enough to keep us from returning on our next trip.

After I had booked this hotel I came across a lot of negative reviews and it had me pretty worried. I know I should have gone with my gut and not paid any attention. My mum and I travelled together for her birthday and we loved it. Restaurants. My mum is a pure vegetarian yet she never went hungry. There was always so much choice for her to choose from. We dined at both buffets and 3 of al carte restaurants. We enjoyed the food at all 3 places. We dined at Aqua and Nikei once and twice at Cilantro. did not visit the steak house so can not make any comments. There was always so much to choose from during breakfast. My favourite had to be the two ladies who were making the omelettes. A big special thank you to the chef at Aqua who went above and beyond to create an egles birthday cake for my mum. To say she was surprised is an understatement. I have included pictures of this cake. Staff I do not think those who left those negative reviews stayed at the same resort as us. Everyone we met from the restaurant staff security bar staff lifeguards and cleaners were ever so lovely and friendly. They would always make an effort to stop us and say hello and make conversation.

The beach was lovely as well. No issues getting any chairs or it being over crowded. Activities. I decided not to use any of the water sports on this occasion. However there was always something going on at the swim up bar. They also had daily activities the mixing class was the best. So much fun. We went into town a few times.

Our holiday started horribly due to airline baggage issues which I will not get into but because of the venue and people it made it easy to get over. There were loads of activities and entertainment every night with exactly the music we love. The staff there were amazing especially Bary and Dwinique. They made our holiday fun and we had great conversations. I also have to mention Salome who always brought a smile to our faces.

I suggested they get covers for the food. lets hope they get that soon. Beds are awesome. room was smaller than I expected. patio is so small that 2 people can barely stand next to each other. Wifi throught out entire hotel is free but it goes down for more than an hour at times. Gorgeous beach and nice water activities. Make your restaurant reservations early. Surroundings and pools are beautiful. carpark is a bit of a walk. you park in the lot across the street from the hotel and you climb stairs to get up to the lobby.

The hotel is ok definitely not great. It \u2019s not ok enough for me to come again or recommend. The hotel staff are either hit or miss which is n\u2019t good considering they work in the hospitality industry. Things are n\u2019t always communicated well from requested attire during themed meals meal times processes etc. The property is definitely older and really needs some updates. Leaks in the halls with small garbage cans catching water. Nice pools and beach. The food eh. Restaurant reservations are insane to get. Buffet did n\u2019t offer a real variety and not very kid friendly. They consistently ran out of food chicken nuggets bacon you \u2019d think that these would be staples. And the food presentation at the buffet was n\u2019t always the greatest. They had a hard time accommodating our large group which I get to an extent. Not very many activities the free water toys were nice. Ping pong table giant jenga. etc were available inside. WiFi is not consistent. I did n\u2019t have a meal that I loved the entire stay the food is decent. you wo n\u2019t starve. Paulete at the omelette station in Aqua was superb. Not very many breakfast choices pretty much the same thing everyday. Kenwod and Wentworth were particularly nice. The female staff were not very nice. The entertainment could have been better and communicating the nightly activities could have been as well. There \u2019s literally nothing for kids to do once the shows end at 10. The performances take place in foyer of the pool entrance so that was inconvenient. You had to walk through the performance or around the set up. Once the performance is over at 10 the dj is in the main area behind the lobby and once again kids are walking through adults partying to get to their rooms from the pool. Just awkward. I read so many reviews before coming some seemed overly dramatic for example \u201c there are flies bothering you while you eat \u201d. well it \u2019s outdoor seating so you can expect that. but for the most part the reviews are spot on.

This was a nice stay with a family with young adults. We enjoyed not having to worry about buying meals and drinks. The meals and drinks were nothing special but for us just fine. Reservations are needed at the restaurants except Market Place and need to be made the first day you get there. They do book up. They do provide towels for beach and pool but it seems people save seats and are not in there seats. If this matters to you then you need to do the same. We did not care and just used one chair to put all our stuff before going to the pool or beach. We sometimes found chairs for our family. It was nice to snorkel and kayak in the ocean. They also have these floating secured raft like objects to wade out to and hang out in. The place is very clean. They even sweep the sand off the pool decks. It is going under renovations so there was some noise. The rooms are nicely renovated and spacious. It was nice to have drinks and snacks in the mini fridge. Though sometimes it was not refilled. You can take the boat from their pier to Balmoral. The island does have towels in the VIP section that was nice. We were with Costco travel and were sent to the VIP section. That was nice I have never been a VIP before. There was also air conditioned lunch room that was nice. We enjoyed the stingray activities. The nightlife is minimal but we enjoyed it. It was fun to play basketball ping pong and connect four. Signing up for activities is necessary. I tried by web but was unsuccessful. There was one activity called water aerobics but there was no instructor just the music. We just tried to figure it out by goofing off in the pool. The wet bar is fun with sports on their TV and well staffed for the crowd. We did sleep well. Though the hallway noise sometimes were an issue. There was an incident outside that was also disturbing by some other patrons. The staff were very nice and treated you like you were on vacation. Next door is a casino if you are looking for additional fun. All in all it was a lovely vacation with warm beautiful water and sunny days. Good way to spend some family time.", "offset": [1312, 1347], "date": "2018-07-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "e87d0706-8773-4944-a6e3-cbcb11294c9a", "sentence": "A resort with a lot of potential but needs better management. This was our third time staying at this resort the first two times when it was The Radison. Overall there is a lot to like but there is also a lot that can be improved with better management and employee efficiency. The funny thing is the improvements are not that difficult to implement. Here is my personal opinion on our vacation at the Melia1. Room Seemed worn and tired. Had two double beds one of which had a bad sag in the middle and creaked whenever you moved. We had our nine year old sleep in this because his light weight mitigated the issue. AC was not very cold at first but seemed to get a little better as the days went on. being on the west side of the resort could have contributed to this. Hairdryer blew up left it outside and never got a new one in its place. Had to go to front desk to resolve. Towel replacement was not consistent. Room was usually made up by 330Mini Frig was a nice surprise with a well stocked bevy of drinks and goodies freIn room phone was useless as it seemed no matter what button you pushed for service you always got kicked to a voice mail system. Very frustrating when you can not reach the front desk or housekeeping. The exception to this was room service. We used it once and they charge you a 10 delivery fee and also expect a tip. Balcony was extremely small and uncomfortable. Our room overlooked the side with a small slice of the ocean in view. Not the best nor the worst view. Rooms seemed to have good soundproofing in the walls though you can hear everything in the hallway. Bathroom was decent slow shower drain no fan vent for smells or shower fog. Safe is convenient easy to use. TV remote had old batteries and drove us nuts the first three days. Finally I went to the front desk to complain remember no connection on the room phone and a maintenance man came up to replace the batteries. Problem solved. Decent selection of channels news channels are all liberal mainstream media with no Fox News to balance things out. Room seemed small and cramped. Overall a bit disapointing2. Food Dining. All of the reviews seem to cover the dining options in great detail so I will not rehash most of that here just try to give you some general observations Your main go. to will be the Market Cafe buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner. Most of the time you can get in there fairly quickly without a reservation and the food is solid if not unspectacular. Lots of grease and basically the same items put out each time. Be forewarned that this food may go through your system with a vengeance. You have the choice of dining inside or out but outdoors seems to have a lot of flies and of course the heat and humidity. For some reason I always thought that the buffet dining area had an offensive odor to it and I could not figure out where it was coming from. the food or a combination of other variables. but I found it hard to deal with. The service was friendly and mostly efficient with some outliers in there. For something quick and easy the Market Cafe has you covered. But you have to be willing to deal with the buffet vibe and some of its negatives. The Aqua is the Italian restaurant whose quality and service was much higher than the buffet. But again good luck waiting in line at 80 am trying to get a reservation. The outdoor grill by the adult pool was poorly managed and dirty. Took us about 450 to get our food with a small crowd and the seagulls flying around you and cleaning off the dirty dishes from the other tables is a major turnofOrdered room service one night. We got a turkey club and pizza. Mediocre at best3. Lobby Pools Ocean Lobby is the main gathering place for activities. Among some of the attractions were a three piece band very average and uninspiring family karaoke various solo vocalists singing along to karaoke tracks DJs movie night and board games. The bar can get crowded and service is slow and steady. I was under the assumption that all liquor and beer choices would be included like it is advertised but not so fast. They only have one beer available the locally brewed Kalik and a shelf system of liquors where you have to pay extra for the stuff you really want. For me this was very deceptive and not customer friendly \u2026 one of the major negatives of our experience. Another major negative the Melia decided to hop on the save the planet bandwagon and ban the use of straws. Did you ever try to enjoy a frozen daquiri using a wooden stick. Or mix a hot cup of coffee with a wooden stick that will not reach to the bottom of the cup. I burned my fingers more than once. Come on guys give the customer the little amenities they want so they can enjoy their vacation instead of trying to shove some BS liberal agenda down our throats and force us to do stuff we do not want to. What nonsenseThe pool area is probably the crown jewel of the Melia. Spectacular grounds to explore plenty of seating and areas for privacy and overall stunning. The pools could be a little better cleaned and maintained. Towel situation can be better managed again for the convenience of the customers. If you want a beach side seat be prepared to wake up early to reserve it with your towels or personal belongings. For the pool you can tip the pool boy and he will have your seats reserved for you when you get there. Activities for the ocean are plentiful. Crystal clear water warm tides it does not get much better than this. probably the main reason most people stay at the Melia. The hallways to the rooms were a little dingy with old worn carpets and windows that looked like they have not been washed in years. Come on staff. What would it take to have those windows regularly washed as they are something the guests look at every day4. Service. The Bahamians are in no hurry they will get to you when they are ready. This aspect of our vacation might have been the most frustrating because I believe a lot of it is just poor management and maybe part of their culture. The employees were very friendly but just do not seem highly motivated or efficient. If these resorts were in the states many of them would n\u2019t last very long based on their mediocre customer service. The Melias marketing states that all inclusive includes all taxes and tips. So why does there seem to be an unwritten rule at the bars that in order to get service you have to have money in your hand. Or the room service receipts that have a place to leave a tip on top of the 10 fee you already pay. This kind of hustle got old real quick. One of the main attractions of all inclusive arrangements is that it relieves the customer of the hassles of tipping. When that subtle pressure is introduced almost everywhere you go it becomes tiresome. Pay your employees enough so they do not have to put out those tip jars and pressure the customers.", "offset": [3652, 3719], "date": "2019-08-12", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}]}
