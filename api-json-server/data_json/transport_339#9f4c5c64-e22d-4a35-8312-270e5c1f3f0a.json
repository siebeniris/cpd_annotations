We are just back from a weeks stay at the Ritz Carlton in Istanbul and it was a fantastic experience. The biggest driver of that was excellent service especially from the concierge staff. They thoughtfully helped us every morning as we planned what to see that day and their recommendations were always exactly in line with what we requested. But they did not stop at just making suggestions and booking restaurants they also provided guidance on how best to get from place to place as well as details such as little streets for us to walk down while we were in certain neighborhoods. They also went above and beyond when we one of us was ill relaying symptoms to the pharmacy and dispatching a taxi to go pick up medication and deliver it to our room. We felt amazingly cared for by the staff. The property itself is great as well with the room being quite spacious and nicely appointed. The beds specifically were very comfortable. The cleaning staff also did a very good job making us feel like we came back to a new room every day. There is a tram stop a short walk away and we found that to be the most efficient way to get around particularly to the Sultanahmet area for sightseeing. Apart from that we were able to easily grab taxis from the front of the hotel with the door staff relaying where we wanted to go to the driver in Turkish. The hotels proximity to Taksim square was also nice as we found ourselves nearby and able to walk back on several occasions. Note however that it is not a particularly nice walk from the hotel to anywhere nearby it is next to the construction of a new stadium and is largely surrounded by threfour lane streets. Also important is that we thankfully did not hear any construction street noise from our room at all it was perfectly quiet. We really just keep coming back to the fantastic staff at the concierge when thinking about our experience they made our time in Istanbul truly special.

Our party of four stayed at the Istanbul Ritz Carlton for one night prior to embarking on a cruise. From check in to departure it was a wonderful experience. Our room was lovely and had a beautiful view. Our rate included a restaurant credit so we had dinner that night in the hotel and the food and service were outstanding. Breakfast the next morning was an extensive buffet which was very good. We had plans to sightsee before checking out to board our ship and were provided with a 4 pm checkout.

My wife and I just returned from a trip to Italy and Istanbul and while all the hotels were stayed in were 5stars and great I must say that The Ritz Carlton was the best. It was our anniversary and the hotel staff went out of their way to pamper us. From our initial greeting to our relaxed check in on the Club Floor we were staying in a club room and the Club Floor has its own check in check out and concierge to the oversized room with its fabulous partial Bosphorus view everything was perfect. All right the safe in the room did not work when we first got there but within a half hour the engineer came up and removed the broken safe and replaced it but it was no problem because we simply had tea and fabulous food in the club lounge. I can not speak for rooms on the lower floors but the club floor was extraordinary. Great sound proofed rooms fabulous bathrooms with separate tub shower and toilet room. plus5 different meal presentations in the club lounge during the day and evening wonderful wines and spirits a private concierge that went out of his way to be helpful and fabulous views. And the rest of the hotel was not bad either. I great indoor pool and outdoor pool was not open yet Jacuzis in both the mens and womens locker rooms a steam room a sauna and a very good restaurant. Actually there are 2 but we enjoyed Atelier Real Food so much that we kept going back. And even though it is a Ritz Carlton the restaurant prices were remarkably reasonable. The hotel is located a short walk from Taksim Square and we walked it one day but be warned traffic in Istanbul is a nightmare especially if you are going to the old city. We had wonderful tours arranged by the hotel and were very grateful that someone was driving us. Still one evening after the Whirling Dervish show which we did on our own we were warned not to take a taxi from the old city to the hotel because the drivers there tend to cheat tourists so instead we were told to take the tram. Since the last tram station is about half a mile from the hotel it was a slight walk some of it up hill. but it was a fun experience and it saved us an hour of sitting in traffic. And even though we had to get to the airport on May Day with all the roads blocked off and no cars permitted anywhere near the hotel the staff went out of their way to get us to a place where we could meet our car and driver to take us to the airport.

Selecting a location of hotel in Istanbul is critical. Traffic is slow so you want to minimize your travel time to destinations. The Ritz offers a central location that is a short tram ride to the Old City which is much faster than a taxi during rush hour and easy walking distance to terrific shopping and the ferry boat cruise departure docks. The staff are attentive and helpful. Some guests complain about the security check. I appreciate the precautions taken in todays world. If you want to see the key tourist sites I recommend having the hotel book a walking guide who can orient you on the tram system and take you to the head of the line at most sites. We were assigned a delightful guide Selen Nur Caliskan who is a professionally trained archeologist and very knowledgeable about the strategies to see key sites at the best times and without dealing with lineups.", "offset": [521, 701], "date": "2015-05-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "d85ca387-92fa-4116-a9bf-4f479d2d2ad8", "sentence": "Very good experience. We stayed at the Ritz for part of our visit and overall were satisfied. Being at the Ritz anywhere in the world certain expectations are set and most of these were met. We had a smooth checkin experience. Our two deluxe connecting rooms with views of the Bosphorus were as expected beautiful spacious well furnished clean and comfortable though a little outdated. The marble bathrooms were luxurious and we had no complaints here. The reception staff concierge and the housekeeping staff were excellent and efficient and always very helpful. The breakfast was of high quality with good variety. The Ritz is about a ten minute walk away from Taksim square and a ten minute walk to the Dolombache Palace and the boat yard for Bosphorus cruises. The minuses are that it is not as centrally located as some other five star hotels are. We had much more phenomenal views of the Bosphorus at the other hotel we stayed at. Also the dining choices are quite limited within the hotel.

This hotel not in the middle of it all but very convenient and cabs at hotel readily available. We had Lunch at the hotel and service and food both excellent although drinks a bit expensive. Concierge was great with tips for restaurants and sightseeing. We booked a private guide with them and very happy we did. Guide was a PhD student in Archeology and we spend 8 hours with her learning a lot about Turkish history but also about life in Turkey while enjoying highlights of the old city.

We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Istanbul for 4 nights in September during our first trip to the city. We were in a club level room on the 12th floor. First off the location of this hotel is a little bit isolated. there is not a lot that you can walk to apart from Dolmabahce Palace and Taksim square. We were aware of this ahead of time so it was not an issue but if you are someone who likes to be in the thick of things this might not be the best choice. As for the hotel itself we found the rooms to be very nice and adequate the bathroom very nice and private separate door for toilet. there is an outdoor pool and jacuzi area which was nice after a day of walking around and sight seeing. We really enjoyed using the club level lounge and the food and beverage presentations. We loved going in for a glass of wine and some snacks before heading to dinner. Breakfast at the hotel had a very nice international selection was included in our club level pricing but I do wish they had some more authentic local options. We did not eat at the hotel other than breakfast. The concierge team was what made our stay extra special. They were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and were kind enough to spend a lot of their time explaining the city local culture and cuisine to us.", "offset": [194, 256], "date": "2015-09-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "a990962e-4733-4b9a-a85b-d0679c385a3f", "sentence": "Excellent Concierge. Was in Istanbul for business 3 nights and extended my stay for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. It was my first stay at the Istanbul Ritz Carlton and I chose it mainly for loyalty reason. Istanbul is rich of very good options between grand luxury hotels or small boutique hotel. In my previous visits I stayed at the Kempinski Ciragan Palace and Sumahan on Water and both were better the Ritz Carlton in many ways. Nevertheless I had an pleasant stay at the Istanbul Ritz Carlton but there was no wow factor to right home about. The check in process was seamless and efficient but front desk did a very poor job in allocating a Platinum member a good room. Yes the room was spacious and on the 14th floor my colleagues who booked at company corporate rate were given rooms at the 3rd floor. but it had less attractive garden view I was hoping to be upgraded to a Bosphorus view and a located next a noisy machinery that turned out to be too noisy and I had a very poor sleep that night as a result. The room had Nespreso machine but lacked other typical amenities like a kettle and tea infusion bags. Bathroom felt dated had problem with water supply late at one night no water. but was ok for the remaining of the stay shower experience is 610 with low water pressure an unimpressive short head. Bathrobe was luxurious and could have a better matching slippers which felt to be rather a 3star quality. After a disastrous first night I demanded a room change and settled for a regular room with partial Bosphorus view nothing to rave about on the 12th floor Club Floor. I was expecting to get a better room as I extended my stay and mentioned to front desk that my wife will be joining me for the weekend as we are celebrating our anniversary. It was unlike our Ritz Carlton experience the year before in a different city. when we got pampered with a nice upgrade and delicate romantic touches for our special occasion. I dined at Blu once for dinner nice alfresco dining overlooking the Bosphorus and enjoyed breakfast at the dining area unlike most RC breakfast is not offered at the Club floor. I was overall pleased with the quality of offerings though variety seemed limited for a Ritz Carlton. I found the staff very friendly and attentive throughout my stay. The gym was relatively small in size but had most cardiovascular machines and weights. The climate control and was rather poor as gym was poorly ventilated and warmer than average. Most users appeared over sweating. The overall feel of the hotel reflect outdated some may call it Classical design as felt from the furniture design and condition. You would feel it is an old but a well maintained hotel. I am sure it would rank below its peers like the St Regis or the recently opened Shangri La I also have high tier status at both chains. The location is close to the Taksim area and the shore of the Bosphorus both are within a 10min walk where public transport Tram and Metro can be found. The concierge the highlight of this stay was extremely useful to me in this trip and I found its staff to be very knowledgable resourceful and helpful. The transportation service on the other hand seemed too expensive and I thought the hotel can offer its guests a reasonably priced services without compromising service quality or standard. Finally I would like to commend the customer relations staff on their follow up made and sincere attitude towards the remarks I raised on the stay questioner I completed post check out. This by itself makes me appreciate the Ritz Carlton more as I always trust that I am always in good hands and my loyalty is highly rewarded. To end it with a sweet note I enjoyed the complementary tray of Turkish delight Baklava and dried fruits nuts which was accompanied with a welcome note from the Front Desk Manager.", "offset": [3141, 3330], "date": "2015-09-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "1a023e79-a956-4536-a8f6-99e9e1f8285d", "sentence": "Still excellent.
