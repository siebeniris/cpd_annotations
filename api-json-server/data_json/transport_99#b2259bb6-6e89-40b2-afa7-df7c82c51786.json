We were worried our short connecting flight in Miami would cause some issues but was relieved to find out we had sufficient time to catch the flight to Curacao. We grabbed lunch in Miami consisting of spinach roll and baked ziti. The baked ziti was quite pungent like a hot day without deodorant. Upon landing in Curacao the nice shuttle driver took us to the hotel in an empty bus. If you have T Mobile this is another country where you have free data and text. Life is so much better with Google Maps. Why do people still use Verizon but I digress. We stayed at the Curacao Mariot Beach Resort and Emerald Casino. I was provided a brewed in Holland Heineken beer bottle at check in. We walked around the beautiful property then attempted to eat lunch at Sea Breeze restaurant. We had to wait quite a quite while for a server. I was getting frustrated as I was quite hungry but my wife said to me. chill mon they be operating on island time. We ended up eating fish and chips along with a cocktail which was very good. After eating we took a small break in the hotel room and then went to the diving snorkeling shop to see what options they had for trips. Next we went to the swimming pool. My wife made me use sunblock spray which was frigid and shivered me timber. I practiced snorkeling in perpetration for the next day. For dinner we went to Portofino restaurant where my wife had the lobster dinner Tuesday theme night special and I had the rib eye steak with a glass of wine. The lobster was a bit tough but overall the dinner was quite tasty. Thus concluded day 1. Day 2 Wednesday Mushroom Forest Wilemstad We started the day by going to the Mushroom Forest snorkeling trip through Caribbean Sea Sport. There was a group picked up from the Hilton next door. We saw many flying fish on the way which was very cool. This was my first full snorkeling experience the time in Santorini does not really count. and I was not quite sure what to expect. Our boat had 6 snorkelers and 5 divers. When I first got in the water I got scared because the waves were crashing into me. I ended up getting a snorkel vest to comfort me. The mushroom forest was a dark area that reached depths of about 30 feet. The ocean floor was covered by mushroom shaped coral formed by erosion at the base plant life including purple pool noodle like plants and various fish. The second part of the trip took us to an underwater cave. Here the water was much calmer and I felt a lot more comfortable. I saw some amazing fish down there like parrot fish clown fish trigger fish and angel fish. Inside the cave the waters were so calm I was almost able to stand on a big boulder. On the ride back one of the boat passengers got sick. We ate oranges and saltine crackers Social Club to keep us nourished. I will discuss snorkeling in greater detail in the Thursday and Friday summary. After returning from our trip we showered and took a little nap. Then we took the local bus to Wilemstad to check out the historic UNESCO heritage site town. The bus stop Bushalt was located to the right of the entrance of the hotel. The bus ride cost 250. it is a small town with old Dutch architecture. We walked around Punda and Otrabanda which are areas located across the floating Queen Ema bridge which completely pivots against the far wall of Otrabanda when cruise ships or other large boats need to enter the Santa Anna Bay. We had ice cream by the CURACAO and DUSHI signs then ate dinner at the Gueverner de Roevile restaurant. The waiter was from Suriname. For our appetizer we had Cuban banana soup. For our main course my wife had musles I had their traditional beef stew. We also enjoyed a few cocktails on the balcony facing the bay and Punda. We caught a taxi back to the hotel and stopped in a mini market for milk for our cereal. Thus concluded our second day in Curacao. Day 3. Thursday Exploring the Island This day began with renting a car Alamo National for the day at the hotel lobby. Our chariot for the day was a white 4 door Nissan Versa. She had no clear coat left on her hubcaps nor power windows in the rear. By looking at the rusted seat rails it would appear she had many beach trips under her belt. It did have Bluetoth and a CD stereo with an AUX input. We started the journey with a trip to the Shete Boka Park where we saw the rugged side of the island. On the roads leading to the park we saw large stubborn iguanas sunbathing on the roads which caused havoc for passing cars who were forced to swerve or stop abruptly. After paying 11 for entrance for two and 1 for the map we entered the park. Inside we saw huge waves crashing into the land mass. The most famous of the various Bokas is Boka Pistol aka the Breath of Curacao. With each crashing wave water is taken into the cave and shot out into a thundering mist. We took some amazing pictures here. Inside this park by the natural bridge we saw a beautiful large sea turtle coming up for air. He looked to be in his teenage years. This park is also known to be a sea turtle nesting site. This area was extremely arid bring a hat and plenty of water. Next on the trip we went to Grote Knip an amazingly beautiful beach where we snorkeled. The cliffs flanking each side of the beach had amazing collection of fish. I was able to snorkel here very comfortably as the water was calm and the depths very reasonable. For a beginner snorkeler i would recommend sticking to the beaches instead of a half day boat trip save time and as beginning 10 20 ft from the shore there is ample sea life to satisfy animal lovers like myself. The sand is white but still contains coral therefore water shoes would be recommended. Next we went to Playa Jeremi which was a small beach. We did not go in the water here. Just did a quick stop and went to the next beach Playa Lagun. This beach was also small. It was around noon so we decided to eat lunch at Lagun Restaurant located in the beach parking lot open air which specializes in fresh seafood. The menu itself offers a decent selection. The catch of the day options were Tuna Wahoo and Baracuda lion fish was not offered this day. Feeling adventurous we tried the wahoo and barracuda with the risk of getting sick. Both dishes were beautifully prepared on the grill and tasted fresh as promised. We left Lagun for Playa Casa Abao. This beach was a full feature beach with bathrooms bars and lockers. We went snorkeling here the left edge of the beach again contained sublime sea creatures. After a few hours we left to make a pit stop at Playa PortoMari. This looked like a nice wide beach since we did not really go into the beach nothing more to add. Our final beach destination for the day was Daiboibai. By the time we had gotten here the beach was empty it did not have the wow factor of our two favorite beaches Grote Knip and Playa Casa Abao. On our way home we stopped at the Centrum Supermarket just outside of town. This was a modern grocery store where you can pretty much fulfill any western food desire within reason. I would definitely recommended going here right after landing in Curacao to stock up as food is not exactly cheap and this is a great option for those on a budget. The minimarkets which dot the island have extremely limited selection. Since we had the car until Friday we took the ol Nissan to town to get our McDonalds fix. The restaurant was clean and modern nothing out of the ordinary for an international McDonalds. We returned to the hotel and concluded our third day. Day 4 Friday R R Mariot Beach Snorkeling We decided the last two days of our trip would be used to relax at the hotel and it is beautiful surroundings. The Mariot hotel to me looks significantly nicer than the Hilton next door. The pool beach front looks picturesque and worthy of a post card. Instagram filters need not apply. We picked a place near the Boardroom bar which is located on the beach. I went snorkeling and found the ocean in front of us held plenty of beautiful fish. The day was quite windy which caused some choppy seas. I would recommend going out to the rock structures on either end of the beach on the property to see the best concentration of fish. The water depth is around 10 15 ft deep. I had a few cocktails at the bar. For lunch we had the delicious chicken wings and a chicken cesar salad. The salad dressing is particularly good. After lunch Rubiya decided she wanted to check out the reefs with me. After getting to the reef some large waves filled her snorkele with water which made her panic. I calmed her down and assisted her to shore. If you are going to snorkele get a decent set of snorkeling gear from Amazon for 40 50 wifes set was purchased from CVS please do not get that as the snorkele lacks the auto shut off valve. We lounged around a bit longer and had dinner. Cerita our friendly bartender got us drinks chicken quesadillas and cesar salad. After sunset we went back to the hotel and retired for the evening. Day 5 Saturday Polside Curacao Cuisine We woke up a little later than usual and headed to Punda via bus to grab lunch at the Old Market. Before eating we went to Penha it was a perfume store on the first floor and Nautica boutique on the second. For lunch we got the fried Red Snapper for one and chicken curry w rice and beans. For the drinks we got lemonade and coke. This was a very good fresh tasting meal. The fish was crispy with a delicate flesh and the chicken was fall of the bone tender. After lunch we stopped by tourist stores for trinkets I bought a T shirt and picture for mom. It was so hot outside we decided to head back to the hotel. After getting to the hotel taking a nap we headed to the pool. For dinner we went to the Emerald lounge. We had the grilled cheese sliders chicken wings and a cesar salad. We also tried the local Bright beer. The beer is basically Carona light. After dinner we went to the casino to play Roulette. We started with 40 then added another 20 but we lost it all. Upon our defeat at the hands of the roulette gods we wrapped up our last night in Curacao.", "offset": [3188, 3210], "date": "2015-01-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "32b730df-ec33-4ee8-b0d7-3f8a78634b79", "sentence": "We Loved Curacao.

Just returned from week long stay. We have been to Aruba St Lucia Barbados and hands down nothing was as perfect as going to Curacao and staying at the Mariot. We were mesmerized the moment we entered the lobby where you encounter an amazing view of the pool which lies just feet away from the turquoise waters of the beach. Friendly staff who obviously took pride in their hotel this was the cleanest and most well kept hotel we have ever stayed in. Not an all inclusive so eating can get pricey. Portofinos the hotels main restaurant was superb for breakfast but ok to good for dinner as I said a little pricey. So many restaurants are just minutes away in Wilemstad Le Bistro Clocherd located in the Rif Fort is a must for both food and view. LAldea is woth a visit for any meat lover where there is no menu you are served 15 different kinds of meat on skewers all night long. Also a must is the day trip to Klein Curacao which we took with Yellow Tourism. You are picked up at the hotel driven to a catamaran 90 minute ride to isolated island. 100 included sandwich roll and coffee for breakfast a sumptuous feast for lunch all the alcohol and drinks you can imbibe hours of snorkeling they have everything you need. sea turtles and beautiful white sand and beach. Hopefully you will get Captain Stan. He and his crew catered to everyones needs they even took great care of those two or three who were seasick. Also check out museum at Kura Hulanda.

I stayed a the Curacao Mariot for a brief 3 days in December 2014 for a winter break. There are a few other resorts nearby and this one by far had the best look. The open air lobby with the view of the pool and beach sets the tone for what will be a relaxing visit. When you arrive the staff offers a refreshing welcome beverage beer or a fruity drink. The rooms are not super luxurious but they were clean and comfortable. When I vacation I do not spend much time in my room so I am not that particular about how new something is. I just need fresh towels and my room to be tidied. There also is a fridge empty and safe for any valuables and for any food that you might need. Most if not all of the rooms have a little patio. There is a car rental agency on the premises and I recommend that you rent a car in Curacao. The hotel does have a shuttle service but I did not take it. Also it is not possible to take the shuttle on the day you arrive. You have to have stayed there a night and then sign up to go ub to town on the shuttle the next day. I think this is kind of silly and restrictive so be warned. They do have a price list of cab costs based on your intended destination on the island but the cost of cabs will quickly surpass what you would have paid for a rental car. I ate at three of the restaurants on the premises. The Emerald Lounge quick dinner Portofino breakfast and Boardroom Beach Bar quick lunch and beverage. The drink at the Beach Bar was really good. The food at all of the locations was just fine not outstanding but on par with what you would expect from a Mariot. The service I received at all three locations was really good. The majority of the staff during our stay was really friendly particularly the two women who work in the Gift Shop and the security manager Alan. A few drawbacks but not deal breakers were the casino which is basically a small room and the mosquitoes that are EVERYWHERE. When the lobby is open air there is no escaping them. On the whole I recommend this hotel and plan to return next year for another relaxing vacation.", "offset": [975, 1075], "date": "2015-01-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "14cf08e1-a30e-4132-ac5c-d402e39c4b75", "sentence": "Beautiful Accommodations.

The food was pricey but we did receive a 50 daily credit which helped. We enjoyed the walk down the beach to adjacent hotels restaurants also. The drinks were outstanding and there is usually a daily special. I highly recommend this hotel and would love to go again. Also the beach is sandy which is not always the case in Curacao. I especially enjoyed the dinner on the beach one night during our stay and the entertainment on weekend nights. There is a casino available for those who are interested in gambling and a free shuttle to town that leaves at 90 am and 20 pm Everything even the iguanas.

I told the staff member that it was not mine as I was on vacation by myself and there were about 4 drinks and 2 pizzas and they did not believe me. Also told me the signature was the same as the forged signature when my signature was clearly different from mine. Anywho they took finally took it off but it was definitely a hassle. I ended up taking a taxi with the flight crew because I was running real late by this point. Even with the hassle I would def stay again.
