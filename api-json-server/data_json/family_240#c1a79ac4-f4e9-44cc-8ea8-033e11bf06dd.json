This is supposed to be a premier property some of a Puerto Rico Landmark. 26 Years ago I joined the Army I came home to celebrate retirement and instead of staying on my Favorite Condado Plaza. I Figured I will spend the weekend on a Fantasy Location. a location that carries weight based on name and in a Ocean Front Room result. Biggest disappointment I have ever had. Before I go forward I must add Customer service tried but to no avail I was compted room service but still that did not help ease the wrongs with the Hotel. So I Arrived early. 330pm. I sat on the lobby till 530 and my room was still not ready. and I got another and this one no longer towards the front but assured as same type. and it was with a great breeze and Industrial AC units sounds to make sure you do not stay in balcony and even with the doors closed still hear the hum. Next suitcase stand broken left the room 2 days later they never replaced it after calling front desk. if that was bad. bathtub chipped. lost of chips that you can see and feel and moldy corners cheap plumbing fixes water stains all over doors covered with dust vents painted over dust. some might think that is trivial but that should not be in a H level 6 hotel. Think that is bad. make sure you check your credit card. I was charged deposit on the main charge and an additional deposit on top of that. 30 in pending charges if you have only one CC or are close on funds that would easily ruin your vacation as I was promised it will be released. but like all hotels stays it was released 5 days after I left the hotel. that again not excusable in a Level 6 H hotel. To add insult to injury I left the room at 130 am at 4 pm room was not cleaned notified front desk again I was assured it will be done. at 7 pm I arrived to my room to find it. you guess it. not touchedBasicaly. unles I get a few nights for free. there is NO WAY I will bring mine and my business to this hotel I have spent this trip checking locations for my Business meetings that have good rooms for my employees as perksOn the good side the Gardens are nice and the beach is good and in the property. but as I said before you are not paying Interstate Hampton Inn rates you are paying full fare resort level rates. Ah listed also as free WiFi. but in small print shows that is not included as you pay 18 resort fee that includes WiFiDo not stay in this Hotel if you plan to enjoy the Condado nightlife unles you plan to drive take cab or walk a lot this Hotel is separated from the hub of the nightlife in San Juan and Old San Juan.", "offset": [1423, 1566], "date": "2015-12-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "cb39f6ad-aef7-4e73-9fdc-855da3efbcf5", "sentence": "Glory days gone by.

I have nothing but positive things to say about the Caribe Hilton. From check in to check out and everything in betwen this is definitely one of my favorite hotels I have been to. Being an avid traveler I was turned off at some of the reviews but I am glad I decided to stay at the Caribe Hilton. The amenities were gorgeous private beach pools and plenty of places to eat. If you wanted to you could stay at this hotel for your entire trip and not leave. We had a beautiful ocean view room in the main tower I would suggest staying there as it seems newer than the honors tower. Room was spotless upon arrival with a nice big bathroom and balcony. Staff is friendly and welcoming they even have some great perks like free float hour at 10 am every morning. Ample security guarding all areas of the hotel. So if you are looking for a beautiful and safe place to stay in San Juan Caribe Hilton is a must.

We love the close proximity to Old San Juan and Condando area. We took advantage of kayaking and padleboarding in Condando lagoon for a great price. The food on the resort is a bit pricey but there are so many options around the hotel to eat at which are much cheaper.

So this year as I did last year I decided to stay at Caribe hilton resort needless to say it was just as memorable as vacationing in 2016. However things were slightly different as I had requested a room in the main building as opposed to the tower building due to the reviews. It was during checkin that I was informed of this assignment so as I approached my room 1763 despite all of the negative tower room reviews I was pleasantly surprised with my room. It was well maintained and large with a balcony and had an even better view than my previous stay in the main building. There was one difference between my tower room and the main building room I previously stayed in and that was the fact that there was no tub however the shower was extremely large and the bathroom did offer a double vanity.
