We found this hotel on one of those find a cheap spot places so we were n\u2019t expecting much. We really had n\u2019t planned on staying in the room or hotel much at all since we wanted to have fun on the strip but I got sick and we had to head back early. We were sleeping around midnight when some dude said \u201c Room Service \u201d while opening our door. Confused and disoriented my boyfriend said no thanks and he promptly left. He did linger though. looking at me stare at him in confusion while lying in bed. We called the front desk immediately but were n\u2019t offered any kind of consolation so we opted to deal with it in the morning. Next morning we went to concierge to let them know what had happened and wanting to speak with a manager. When we told them there was n\u2019t any kind of reaction or apology again. The girl we spoke with encouraged us to check out and the manager would call us. We refused to check out but allowed them the time to get back to us. After walking the strip and not hearing back for about 3 hours we headed back to the hotel. Upon speaking with a new set of concierge personnel we had the same response as before not apologetic at all and wanted us to wait for a call from the manager. We opted to wait in front of the desk until we spoke with a manager. When the manager came out she was extremely apologetic and consoling. She took our room number and asked for a couple minutes to look up the account and investigate. When she came back she had greatly reduced the cost of the room and offered us her sympathy. She had checked us out and handed us our checkout slip receipt and said she would still investigate. We left feeling violated and wronged on a degree we never have had in leaving a hotel. I was the one that was sick and I encouraged by boyfriend to stay out. What if he had. What if I was in that room alone and sleeping. The way the first three people reacted and treated us was just wrong. It seemed obvious to us that this is what happens at this hotel and all the employees know it. After all of that we will most likely need to dispute invalid charges on our credit card that we put down for incidentals. The amount held has doubled since we checked out and almost a week later we still have no resolution. After reading this if you do decide to stay here do n\u2019t leave anything valuable in your room definitely opt to secure the safety latch if you decide to stay in and be sure to keep track of your charges.

I do not know where to begin with this place. I am trying to not be totally negative but it is hard. It tries way too much to be cool for school but misses some hotel basics. Everything is different weird unusual in the casino and rooms. This does not need to be a bad thing creativity is good and exciting and I saw a lot of interesting ideas. However a lot of it is just different for the sake of different and not well thought out. I stayed here for a business convention because it was reasonably priced and next to the monorail to the convention center. The reasonableness of the price is offset by the unexpected 25 day resort fee. Um a mediocre pool and spotty WiFi does not make this a resort. it is simply a way to hide 25 night of the room cost from the online booking web sites. Poor WiFi in a brand new hotel seriously. Also the monorail is expensive not SLSs fault but again offsets the value of going so far off strip. Location This is at the edge of Sketchyvile watched a drug deal going down on the stet out front. it is even past Stratosphere which was already too far from the strip so you will need the monorail to get to the strip and a cab to get anywhere it does not go. Signs. There need to be some signs to direct you. Spent 10 minutes dragging luggage and asking directions to finally find the hidden check in desk. The place is small so making it this confusing was a challenge. Also you need the room key to operate the elevator by holding the kit to a black circle on the wall this is not explained and another guest finally came along and explained. She said she had the same problem until another guest showed here. Room Small weird confusing. Bed against the window which I have never seen before. The window is not soundproofed so outside noise is a problem middle of the night delivery trucks beeping as they back up. Pulling down shade had picture of people at a concert creepy. Desk has a strange second glass top which is offset so useless for doing work on a PC. Tops of glass desk have images on them which hides anything you place on them. Limited outlets which is insane for today when you need to charge laptops phones. The desk chair not even up to Ikea standards. Minibar Thought they killed these 15 yrs ago. We were warned by staff to not even go near it cause just brushing past it would trigger weights that result in indisputable extra charges on the bill. Aside from the noise coming through the window the minibar fridge running is also noisy and you can not unplug it cause of the getting charged for stuff issue. Were were charged a hold of 450 on my card for three nights in case I used the mini barBathrom Door is a sliding barn style door made of mirror. When closed you can peek around it into the bathroom so no privacy. Also can not be locked. Also sink is so shallow that turning on the water splashes you and everything else. No towel bars although I could see places to mount them. Mirrors mirrors mirrors I am guess they thought that covering every surface with mirrors would make the tiny rooms seem larger and be very Vegas. Whatever however if you are going to have so many mirrors then CLEAN THEM. The mirror under the desk was smeared. More noise The heating AC blower is loud had to turn that off to sleep. Bed OK the bed was good. However I was short sheeted only a bottom sheet and duvet. I called and was told it was european. K Asked for a second sheet to be sent up anyway cause I did not want to sleep under a hot duvet. They sent up an empty duvet cover instead. I guess they are short of sheets. I ended up using the extra duvet cover as a bottom sheet and the one flat sheet as a top. Rest of visit had to trip over the duvet cause there is no storage space in the room. No closetCasino and common areas. Even though people smoking everywhere in common areas I did not smell much smoke so they put in an excellent ventilation system good job. The casino is small but well laid out. Imaginative design and interesting to look at. Interesting that they left the ceiling exposed like a warehouse store. I know this is a thing but not sure it is a good thing looks too discount. Food Expensive with a capital E. We ate in one food was good service was good but costly. Being so far off strip you can walk a short way and find an IHOP so there is that. Overall Mixed feelings. If you want a different experience are young can sleep under any conditions and do not mind being isolated from the reset of Vegas then try it.

Handed off the rental car to the valet free valet parking. Great greeting from the front desk and fast check in. FD clerk explained that I was on a high floor 24 and explained the room number code. No appreciation for my status no welcome gift discussion but ok. Just a few steps away to the elevators and whoosh up to my room. Anyone who has stayed in Vegas knows that is a huge benefit no lugging luggage through an endless casino. Open my door and find a white and bright and well appointed room with a huge king bed sofa chair lighted mirrors galore desk and chair tons of power outlets and HUGE tv. Open closet no doors but that is ok. Large glass enclosed shower no tub and large mirror and sink vanity in the bathroom so all good. The lighted mirrors in the room have power switches so they can provide light or not depending on your needs. Cool. Quick phone call to the valet brings the car around. This hotel IS at the north end of the Strip. You will not be strolling out the door to visit other hotels. Actually you do not want to go strolling out the door at all unles you are getting into a car. The neighborhood is a bit uneven. Note to Uber and Lyft users their GPS thinks you are on the west side entrance of the hotel. No you are not. The main entrance is on Paradise by the monorail. Later that night. Bed and pillows are crisp clean comfy and there is very little hallway noise. The casino is another matter. The place is so small that Saturday and Sunday nights are total pandemonium. Too many people not enough space. Felt a bit unsafe. Monday after work and back at the hotel in the casino. Thinking a quick bite. Bartender at the Umami burger place is a not that busy but b really too busy watching MNF to pay attention to his real job as in serving guests. The guy is just a tool. Tuesday is great as the casino and hotel have a very low key love life kind of vibe. Quick bite at the Northside Cafe is delicious Asian fusionHaving ice makers on every floor is a plus. Stupid mini bar with sensors is a minus. Note to SPG For the love of Bob why not have a keurig in the room. I mean why not. No one in the 21st century is ordering room service coffee. If it will get me downstairs into the casino faster why not have a small coffee makerAnd ditch the mini bar OR add a small fridgeHousekeping was spot on. Lastly I must mention the resort fee. it is 25 per night. I get it all of Vegas has it but SPG please be bold and end that silly practice. Just tell me what the price is per night. Fully loaded.

I come to Vegas about 6 times a year and this time decided to travel with my brother and share a room. We stayed at the SLS because I just discovered it was an SPG property and I got the room on points. My brother spent 5 minutes in the hotel room before booking himself a room at the nearby Hilton Residences where the rooms do not resemble an old yet oddly decorated Soviet era apartment. The room is tiny basically fits the bed a char and a desk. It has a single small window that allows some natural light but in our case the window faces the side of the garage. The bathroom is small bland and most importantly does not have a door. It has a sliding mirror that hardly gives you any privacy. Last night we spent a little bit of time in the Casino Lobby. We tried to get dinner at the Bazaar at 940pm but were told they were done seating for the night. At 940pm. The Casino is small and uneventful with a minimal amount of patrons compared to other places on the strip. If I had paid for this room I had be fuming.

Cleanines our room was not properly cleaned when we checked in wrinkled bedshets trash can had garbage in it towels smelled like smoke not sure if isolated or the standard3 mini bar our mini bar and snacks were cleared missing items when we checked in. so i called the front desk immediately but they were really hostile about the issue. Tried to resolve it and worried about it for the next couple of days it was only cleared up when i insisted to speak to a manager about it when we checked out4 Check in had a long line when we showed up at midnight on first night and then everytime we passed by we did observe a long line presumably at all hours. Check out line was definitely lengthy as well. all in all was okay considering how much we did pay for it honestly would not recommend as the service sends a signal that they do not expect you to come back any time soon so they could careless about you as a customer.", "offset": [28, 91], "date": "2018-11-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "69597ff9-0eb7-4528-92ab-f3a4df0cbb4c", "sentence": "Very minimalistic decor.

This is a great room for men who are in an out. The bathroom is HORRIBLE. The sink is literally a sink like in a jail cell outside of the toilet and shower area I wish I took a pic lol. The beds was comfortable that was a plus. Our mini fridge was n\u2019t even plugged in no drinks or snacks not sure why. But other than the rooms handicapednes it \u2019s great if you do not care where you stay and literally I mean do not care. Reason being You are not on the strip if you gamble the casino is small the entire hotel is small compared to all other Vegas hotels and I have stayed just about everywhere so I can really compare. However the restaurants choices were great. The hotel was clean lobby and ground areas were fine. They only had 1 pool open and only half of that pool so everyone was fighting for lounge chairs. Which was really annoying. Overall I would n\u2019t come back.

BEWARE BUSINESS TRAVELERS. This hotel has very poor internet service and little to no cell phone reception. I have Verizon had a signal in a canyon in Zion last weekend but not here. Had to cancel several calls due to lack of cell service. And guess what part of your resort fee is to pay for this exceptional internet service lol. ROOMS. Literally had to call 6 times to get my room cleaned. I \u2019m in the World Tower the place looks like it was decorated by a 6year old girl. Mirrors and shiny things everywhere. The window shade is a photo of random people at a concert. I wonder if the hotel bothered to get permission from these people before plastering their photos everywhere. The showers have old dirty tiles probably same from the Sahara. Bedding is old and nasty have never wished so much that I brought my own sheet. Yuck. DINING. Most of the dining options here are pretty good as far as the food goes. Cleo yum. North side makes a decent breakfast. The customer service is pretty atrocious though. They are slow dismissive and respond very poorly to any requests. I \u2019ve been here long enough to notice it \u2019s not really the staff \u2019s fault. Everything here is just poorly planned and lacks standards. DEAR MANAGEMENT. After reading reviews it \u2019s clear you do n\u2019t understand the base of your problems. You continuously respond to complaints with how these actions are n\u2019t indicative of your standards. Yet with all these complaints it \u2019s exactly indicative of you standards. The problem is there clearly are n\u2019t standards in place and the few you may have are clearly not enforced. It \u2019s not a problem with your staff it \u2019s a problem with your management or lack there of. I was waiting at Umami to pick up a carry out. Stood there for 10 mins without being acknowledged then finally caught someone \u2019s attention who just pointed at my bag and rolled her eyes. So I grabbed my bag but still had to pay although I seriously considered just leaving at this point. As I \u2019m still waiting there to pay my bill the manager is about 2 feet from me trash talking another customer within earshot while I wait for help. Like I said lack of standards. If this is how your management acts I \u2019m not surprised your employees are rude and completely lack any customer service skills. BOTTOM LINE. There are plenty of well priced options a in LV with excellent service that offer plenty of value. Do n\u2019t even risk a bad vacation with this place. Read the bad reviews they are consistent and a good representation of what this place is.

I told him their must be a mistake because the reservation was paid in full. When I said his responds was feel free to call your bank with attitude and eye roll.

I felt like an idiot arguing with my bank and orbitz for a mistake done by SLS. Alberto offer to upgrade our room but the upgrade was not even an upgrade. Only difference was that it had couch.

You can not open either without knocking someone using the sink in the head. The tile had a hole in the corner. The only chair in the room is a desk chair.
