Having just spent seven relaxing mid July days at the Karon Beach Movenpick Hotel it was time for my partner and I to move on. We had arranged via phone at the last minute a stay at a hotel at the southern end of Kata Beach but upon arrival it was far from what it was described as and way overpriced. So we disappointingly found ourselves trundling our cases along the road not sure how far we would need to go to find another place. Phuket was pretty busy from Patong and down the coast. We immediately saw a nice ice cream shop so went in for one and to use the Wifi to look at options. The shop led through to a sort of swish spa and pool area so I investigated and found it was part of the Boathouse Hotel. It was pretty stunning. Minutes later I had booked us the last room but it was available only for one night. It was a very easy decision made all the more easier by the welcoming and exceptionally helpful staff. It was double our budget but you could not move on from such a lovely place and with the staffs help we eventually managed to extend our stay for several more nights. What the hell. The hotel has just about the best aspect on Phukets tourist west coast. What could be better than sitting by the sparking cool infinity pool overlooking the beautiful and safe Kata beach. Breakfast was an absolute delight. Not just the food itself but the service and wonderful view. We have never actually had a holiday where we just sit and relax but this was amazing and such a pleasure. It was simply idyllic. The only gripe would be the high cost of eating in house so we just slipped to the few Thai restaurants at the very end of the beach. I travel all over the world for work and generally for the more adventurous type holidays and it is so rare to meet such terrific staff. I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending or returning to the Boathouse which also has the same name as one of my favourite New York restaurants The Boathouse in Central Park.", "offset": [1128, 1199], "date": "2015-07-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "080035fd-a1a6-4508-bb9e-75629e73c087", "sentence": "Awesome Phuket Experience.

After a long 1hr 45min ride from PHK airport we used the GrabCar ride hailing service. Worked perfectly. Would use again. we arrived on Wednesday evening. We were greeted at the front entrance by multiple staff. They ushered us out to the seaside dining area where we got a complimentary arrival drink and small snack. We received a bunch of various coupons free Tea time 1000 BHT voucher at the restaurant wine tasting etc etc. From there we were escorted to our FIRST room Deluxe Room where our bag AND 2 kissing a towel Swans and a Happy Honeymoon message with flan awaited us. Like I suggested in the title stupendous service. From there we went down for dinner. As we sat for dinner we realized we really liked the views of the other rooms we passed on the way to our room. While at dinner I spoke with the front desk and splurged for an upgraded room to the Ocean view Room 503. GREAT CHOICE. We loved the location and access to the beach. The Deluxe room was very nice but we wanted a little more for the honeymoon. I am currently writing this review from the front deck overlooking the infinite pool and ocean. I give full compliments to the staff here as they are very attentive and give you the feeling that you are their 1 concern while you are here. NOW this may be because we are at the beginning of high season but i truly believe this is how they are year round. As for the location it is within walking distance to restaurants convenience stores and shopping. The streets are tight and walking can be a little tough but its all about the experience. Definitely not a deal breaker. The beach is great not too busy and there are water sports shops you can rent equipment from. Weather was great. A few times it rained we were inside but it ended quickly. We were concerned because the forecast showed cloudy and 60 80 rain. FALSE. Sunny and fair clear for our time here.

The Boathouse occupies a prime spot at it is Southern end. It is one of the few truly beachfront properties in Kata with the sea literally lapping at its doorstep. Most other resorts in Kata are not really beachfront. The views are phenomenal get a seaview room if you can swing it. It also feels safe as access to the beach and vice versa is gated and security guarded. A short step out its gates and a plethora of retail options present themselves. Note though that Kata beach has a more laidback vibe as compared to Patong but this is actually a boon to those who just want to chill and relax.

Cheers to Tain and Nob thanks for all the service at the pool. The beach was very wide and no waves just right for swimming or just standing. My only suggestion is to expand the area around the pool as it was pretty full at times. This would mean the massage area would need to go or be reduced in size and push the bar to the back.

Can a holiday experience get better and better. It definitely can. And I will say it again. I am so glad we old folk were brave enough to travel 10 0 km from Cape Town to enjoy yet anotherunforgetable Boathouse experience. After our extended stay in March 2018 which I described in my previous review as being even MORE perfect than our previous seven visits which I realize is not good English. my husband and I feared we might be disappointed this time seeing we were treating ourselves to another 3 week stay. Because the South Africa rand has depreciated to such an extent It meant making sacrifices and economizing all through the year. However as one ages each day becomes precious. My husband was grateful that he had made it into his 91st year and is still an avid swimmer and snorkeler. you have guessed. His favourite beach is Kata where he enjoys snorkeling close to the rocks on the left hand side. The sea temp was a blissful 30 deg C every day we were there and the soft white sand and gentle waves were a sheer delight for young and old. We are both passionate about Thailand and love the happy smiling hardworking Thai people. This visit was probably our best ever and we struggled to tear ourselves away. The Boathouse has turned 30 now and has gone from strength to strength. It is not surprising that so many return. guests refer to it as their Home from Home or Second Home. We love all the new bright and light nautical touches which were added in the refurbishment. In my last review I emphasized the hotels perfect Situation on the best beach we have visited in Phuket the amazing Staff their exceptional Service and the Spirit or Vibe at the Hotel. Topping the list this year must surely be the AWESOME Staff Team which serves their guests with love and devotion and displays an incredible work ethos. You will not find many hotels where staff make a point of learning your name greeting you personally remembering your favourite table whether you prefer hot or cold milk in your coffee and if you like your fried egg easy over or well done. Thank you dear Nom Kuhn X Pepe Mai Mem. Jay Kuhn K Ao and others with tricky names. We can still picture you looking after us so well. And what a lovely warm welcome one receives from the ever smiling Kuhn Bure and Kuhn Nong when they act as hostesses at dinner time and lead you to your table. The staff at the swimming pool were superb too with long serving Nom constantly on the trot to fetch towels or water for his guests and Pump dusting loungers putting up umbrellas and even fetching us mosquito repellant. It was great being able to swop books at the pool although not many were in English. The new General Manager is yet to be announced but Kuhn George from the Hard Rock group is doing a great job holding the fort in the interim. As many guests have mentioned in their reviews it is not really fair to single out individual staff. The entire Team is phenomenal. Some like Kuhn Jarine the highly efficient and approachable lady who manages the Front Office and Room Division Dept speaks good English and sorts out any problems you may encounter and her calm affable co worker Kuhn Nong and her husband Kuhn Pinyo the Food and Beverage Manager and the inimitable Kuhn X have served faithfully for 30 years at the Boathouse since it is inception. They lead by example and give a wonderful sense of direction and purpose to younger members of staff. We found the lovely young ladies in Reception quite remarkable. Aom Pair and Bovy and their co assistants like the competent young trainee from Singapore all go way beyond the call of duty to help you with accounts taxis tours bookings and boarding passes. Two of the young ladies even ran after me to tell me they noticed my necklace was missing on the way back from dinner. Unbeknown to them I had removed it because it was scratching my neck. Fancy them being so observant and so caring. Our room upstairs with its private balcony overlooking the jacuzi was quiet with a very comfortable king size bed excellent pillows and a quiet air conditioner. The room was kept spotless by the delightful Kuhn Toey and Kuhn Rung and the quiet obliging gentleman who substituted for them. We greatly appreciated the services of the IT gentleman who sorted out the Wi Fi for us and the kind staff member who bent double to tackle a plumbing job right underneath the wash basin. The arrival of the outstanding Executive Chef Jonathan Bruel last year has done wonders for the Boathouse. Jonathan you dare not abandon ship. In our 9 visits we have never seen the dining room so full or heard such glowing reports about you and your kitchen team. Do you and Chef Jimmy and Kuhn Phet and the handsome young porridge maker Hong and the helpful folk who prepared the delicious freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juice ever get time to read the glowing comments about the culinary delights you serve. I wish there was space here to list our menu favourites. Instead of doing the rounds in Kata as we have always done in the past Chef Jonathan had us hooked from day one. We ate at the Boathouse restaurant every single night for 3 weeks. We tried all the Thai favourites like Masaman Lamb Shank Braised Beef Cheek Green Curry Crispy Duck with Curry Pineapple and Chicken Cashew Nut and raved about the Tasmanian grilled salmon and the steamed sea bass in the Western section. I have never before enjoyed grilled KingTiger prawns or prawns. done to perfection in crispy noodles quite as much as Chef Jonathans. His homemade after dinner chocolates are to die for. Do try the kiwi ice cream before you leave. The Boathouse is a very special spot to celebrate a birthday or anniversary and its magical starry beachfront setting with the waves lapping just beyond your table is blissful and romantic. Breakfasts too are a wonderful experience as you listen to the swish of the waves and watch the early morning snorkelers bathers and joggers. Chef Jonathan and his Team provides an incredible buffet selection and the menu includes a mouth watering selection of hot treats like steak and eggs eggs Benedict salmon fillet mascarpone French toast Belgium waffles and Asian specialities like Me Sua Noodle Soup and Me Spam. There is plenty for the health conscious Banting and Vegan fraternity too. Best of all you can take your time and linger over your coffee because breakfast is served until 1030. We noticed that the Boathouse has become far more child and family friendly and seems to have relaxed its policy regarding long trousers for men at dinner time. It was heartwarming seeing elderly travellers single folk and widowed guests being welcomed back again and again. We sensed that the Boathouse is appreciated as a safe secure and comforting holiday haven even for solo travellers. Being able to make a direct booking with the hotel and to be met at the airport by a charming young man who handled our luggage and helped us into the Boathouse taxi was a huge bonus. Thank you Boathouse for making long distance travel painless even for those of us who are elderly or timid. You all have a very special place in our hearts and we would dearly love to see you again.
