Well we should have braved the rain and gone elsewhere. This location has a traditional restaurant and a more sports oriented casual restaurant. We decided to take the casual route. We chose the casual restaurant because of their vegetarian burger options. It became obvious that there is not a call for this option often. It should not even be on the menu. Our burgers were well. disgusting there is no better way to describe them take a look at the picture.
