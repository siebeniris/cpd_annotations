And when I say that it ticked all our boxes of what we were looking for and more. Not only was the location superb literally on the shores of a beautiful beach but everything else was special. Our room was a deluxe beachfront and it had all the mod coms plus great comfort with a huge bed. What made this resort so great was the location. We were in Kata beach away from the seedy and tacky Patong but close to all the amazing restaurants cafes and activities. However all this aside it is the staff at the Boathouse that blew us away. Always so happy and helpful. And despite being bombarded by stupid questions from tourists they still managed to smile at you. A huge thank you to Siriporn Porn and Huang from reception. And also to Aud and Rung from the restaurant. Remember the names because they are awesome individuals and deserve all the recognition. This resort is an easy 1010.

Fast and simple check in process. great room with everything we needed with little touches like mosquito repellent and balm. access to a semi private terrace with lounges and couches fresh fruit daily and super friendly staff. Simply walk down to the pool and they will set you up a lounge with two towels and a fresh cold glass of bottled water. Excellent a la carte breakfast each morning with a long list of delicious dishes. And the best coffee we had in Thailand. The location at the end of the quiet bay was the best spot on the beach with calm waters great view access to kayaks and stand up paddle boards and a short walk to the busier louder part of Kata Beach. The perfect relaxing luxury holiday and not that expensive. I honestly can not say enough positive things about the experience.

Our family of 2 adults and 2 teenage children stayed at Boathouse for 8 nights in July. We booked 2 interconnecting Superior Seaview rooms all rooms would have some view of the ocean through a travel retailer in Australia price beat after getting a quote from HotelTravelcom. I then contacted the hotel directly to ensure we would get the rooms which they did confirm. I think they have 2 or 3 sets of interconnecting rooms. We were tossing up whether to go for the Family Suite but we are glad we booked the interconnecting rooms as you get the extra bathroom which is brilliant. The rooms are very modern clean and ours had views to the ocean over the 1st floor courtyard area. The rooms are not massive but as we had interconnecting rooms this did not seem an issue. Excellent free Wifi everywhere around the hotel. get a free Re Ka Ta club password when you are down there as the hotel Wifi does slow down a bit when you are around the pool area. Breakfasts at Re Ka Ta restaurant were fantastic a small buffet selection as well as an a la carte are included plus coffee made to order and the staff are brilliant and attentive and also sit you where you like which was nice. A panoramic view of Kata Beach to have breakfast to each morning does not get better than that. The Re Ka Ta beach club which is part of the hotel has a fantastic infinity edge pool overlooking the beach plus plenty of sun lounges and day beds to loll away the hours. The pool area staff are excellent as well. Every morning at breakfast I saw them down on the beach in front of the hotel cleaning up rubbish and raking the sand. Plenty of towels too the guys will even race over to put one over your sun lounge or day bed for you. My son had a birthday whilst we were there and a day or two before without any prompting we were asked where we would like to have his complimentary birthday cake very thoughtful and very much appreciated thank you. This was our 3rd trip to Kata Beach and would by far have been our best yet thanks to our experience at the Boathouse. The staff are excellent and so very friendly and welcoming. We highly recommend Boathouse by Montara if you are looking for a quality holiday. You will not find a better location on Kata Beach and you get the boutique hotel experience.

Having just spent seven relaxing mid July days at the Karon Beach Movenpick Hotel it was time for my partner and I to move on. We had arranged via phone at the last minute a stay at a hotel at the southern end of Kata Beach but upon arrival it was far from what it was described as and way overpriced. So we disappointingly found ourselves trundling our cases along the road not sure how far we would need to go to find another place. Phuket was pretty busy from Patong and down the coast. We immediately saw a nice ice cream shop so went in for one and to use the Wifi to look at options. The shop led through to a sort of swish spa and pool area so I investigated and found it was part of the Boathouse Hotel. It was pretty stunning. Minutes later I had booked us the last room but it was available only for one night. It was a very easy decision made all the more easier by the welcoming and exceptionally helpful staff. It was double our budget but you could not move on from such a lovely place and with the staffs help we eventually managed to extend our stay for several more nights. What the hell. The hotel has just about the best aspect on Phukets tourist west coast. What could be better than sitting by the sparking cool infinity pool overlooking the beautiful and safe Kata beach. Breakfast was an absolute delight. Not just the food itself but the service and wonderful view. We have never actually had a holiday where we just sit and relax but this was amazing and such a pleasure. It was simply idyllic. The only gripe would be the high cost of eating in house so we just slipped to the few Thai restaurants at the very end of the beach. I travel all over the world for work and generally for the more adventurous type holidays and it is so rare to meet such terrific staff. I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending or returning to the Boathouse which also has the same name as one of my favourite New York restaurants The Boathouse in Central Park.", "offset": [1200, 1315], "date": "2015-07-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "9d29c50a-548c-4725-9993-f6d965740eda", "sentence": "On the beach fantastic choice. SO glad we chose this hotel solely based on it is setting on the beach. My friends and I had the best time hereThe hotel is about an hour away from the airport which is not great but if you want privacy and a great spot the further away from the airport you have to go. it is located on the beach which rare because for most hotels at Phuket you will need to walk 5 10 mins to get to the beach. The hotel is beautiful relaxed chilled out and its most standout feature is the Re Ka Ta bar pool area. People come all over Phuket to laze around here with good music and cocktails. The pool is small and perfect for lounging around in with colourful beanie floaters. Be sure to book your sun deck though as it gets packed by 930am. Boathouse is about 20 mins from Patong by taxi. The staff are friendly well trained and speak fluent English for the most part. They are always checking in to see if you are having a good time and courteous at all times. Housekeeping could be better though. They cleaned the rooms but did not really do a good job with the bathroom. Shower gels were not stocked up even after requesting a couple of times. Room was large and comfortable we were upgraded to a sea view with a super large private outside area to sun tan lounge around etc. There were big sofa couches and a library to relax in as well on our private floor. Wifi is really strong everywhere in the hotel and its surroundings. The breakfast was interesting with ample of choice. Nothing much at the buffet but they do offer free breakfast via an ala carte menu that has a good variety and equally delicious too. We usually had breakfast at the hotel but lunch and dinner elsewhere. Lots of restaurants around the hotel and a really cool reggae bar on the beach to wind down with.

Overall we were a bit disappointed with the hotel as we paid \u00a3 100s more to stay here than choosing other local hotels after reading good reviews but we might as well have paid less and stayed at Kata Beach Resort.

I am in doubt whether to give it 3 or 4 stars. Some major drawbacks ends it at 3Had the big 80something sqm suite with full length balcony overlooking the beach. Fantastic view.

Large living room with sofa table with chairs a desk for the working man and a big thank you for electric output by the table which is situated in the middle of the room. Huge bathroom with double sink. There is a big bathtub in the middle which takes away a lot of space that could have been used for a big shower cabin instead. Shower cabin is small given the size of this bathroom. This room has one of those very small refrigerators the smallest kiddy type you can get in which you can barely fit a large bottle of water. You are in the biggest suite and get the smallest fridge. Then they say we get a free milk every day. wow a free 20ml milk every day. And we just paid 90 bht per night for the room. At this level the whole mini bar should be free or at least water and soft drinks. I have never seen this before a free milk. I consider this almost a joke. Free newspaper every day but there are loads by reception free for guests to take. And the milk you can get at breakfast and bring up. So much for the free stuff. I am used to better extras and complimentaries. Breakfast is a big disappointment and the selection is very very narrow. There is not one single thai dish on the menu not a single one nothing. Omelet stand white breads jam and 3 types of meat spread duck salmon and ca nt remember the last one. Muesli available. And a juice stand where the lady makes it from fresh fruit. Which is odd cause it all had almost no taste and at the same time a perfume ish aftertaste to it. Not good. Fruits are not ripe but where the aftertaste came from I do nt know. Tried 4 different fruit juices none tasted like what its supposed to. For a place like Boathouse which is known for its good restaurant its just far from good enough with this breakfast. No thai food. Minimal spread. But 90 bht per night. We did nt eat dinner here or had any other food so I will not comment on it but just state that I have eaten here several times before and while it is good it is also too expensive. A thai dish at Boathouse cost 500 bht all inclusive. Hence we went for different restaurants in the area. Service is overall good as expected. Parking right at the front door if you are a guest at the hotel. Lastly I will say that the beach is now so littered that its disgusting. Get up in the morning and see the amount of garbage left on the sand by the ocean. Its mind boggling. The city and all the hotels should clean it up. The water is likewise filled with plastic plastic bags caps crap and what not. It was not like this 4 5 yrs ago and it will only get worse. Thais worry about tourism and all the money it brings to this country but do nt see a need to keep the beaches and everything else clean. No one cares. Location is fantastic but for the price tag we expected more from the hotel itself. Do I recommend it. yes for view and location.
