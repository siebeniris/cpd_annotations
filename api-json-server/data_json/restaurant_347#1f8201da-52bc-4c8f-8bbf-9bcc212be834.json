But for such a nice hotel it seems odd that the only place you can smoke is at the entry way where all other guests come and go. Many people do not even like to walk through second hand smoke. How about another location. It might also keep the homeless from rifling through the ashtray that is provided for smoking guests to get a long butt to smoke. The night shift is well not up to par with the day shift. The gentleman who makes the coffee and hangs out in the lobby overnight was not at all personable. He was very interested in listening to music via earphones. I know it may not be a fun job but there are many times that we all have to put our best foot or face forward to meet customers expectations whether it is fun or not. Finally I am a very early riser. The night shift made me feel as though there was something wrong with being up and about at 5 AM. Again give it a try nice and quiet clean good restaurant close by many downtown attractions.

We called down to valet to request our car before coming down and after checking out and waiting about 10 15 minutes I asked the valet if he could check on my car. He asked my name and said it would be up soon. Another 15 minutes went by before the bellman enquired into what we were waiting for. He checked with the valet and told us that our car had not been ordered and that they were getting it now. All in all we waited 40 minutes to get our car. If the first valet had actually looked into what was happening with my car then we would have been much less annoyed at the miscomunication.

After waiting for my room and finally getting the key I went up to find my room was already occupied by someone who had just checked in ahead of me. I went back downstairs and discovered that they wrote the wrong room number on my key card envelope. The room itself was odd but nice enough. Bathroom is weird. Three different sections with a small closet then a very low sink dressing table height I guess but there \u2019s no stool. So you have to bend way down to use it. and I \u2019m average height.

At check in I was not addressed by name nor was I thanked for staying. All of the staff were polite. They were not intentionally bad. it is just that they were not well trained in the sort of service one expects at 4star hotel. Very rough around the edges. Nothing refined.

Instead of a modern luxury shower the hotel has old Jacuzi tubs which I found difficult to get out of when I was wet. I was really afraid of falling. Also the bathroom showed a considerable amount of wear and tear despite this being a recently renovated property see picture. My bed was comfortable but the pillows were horrible. The pillows were four twin sized pillows for a king sized bed. They were either polyester fill or lumpy polyester foam. Horrible especially since Hilton normally has luxury feather king sized pillows. There were two major design flaws in the room First the door does not close all the way. As a result it lets in a lot of light. Look at the pictures. One picture shows the gap between the door and the door frame when the door is closed. The other picture shows how the door gap is eliminated when you push the door closed and hold it in position. The second design flaw is in the bathroom. The towel racks sits right under the dirt old heating and air conditioning vent which means dust and other things are likely falling down on the towels. Not exactly what you want. The breakfast restaurant is horrible. When I was there they were out of pretty much everything except bacon eggs and muffins. there is no on site lunch option nor is there a restaurant unles you consider the bar pub only opens after 4 pm a restaurant.

This was our first time at the Cincinatian and I \u2019m pretty sure it will be the last. When I booked I noted that there were 4 adults so we wanted 1 room with 2 beds for a Saturday and Sunday night. I pre paid for the room almost 400. When I checked in I double checked that I was getting a room with 2 beds they said no. They said they did not have any available. I checked in at like 305 pm so unles they had them all given away the day before I was lied to. I asked if we could get a rolaway bed they said they do not do that. Then I asked if we could be switched to a room with 2 beds on Sunday night since most people would be leaving and they said that was a great possibility I just needed to go to the front desk and ask on Sunday afternoon. We got to our room and there was 1 king bed a chair and a HUGE open space where another bed could have been. It was a good thing we brought an air mattress. Three adults slept in the king bed and one adult slept on the twin air mattress we had brought with us. We had to go downstairs to ask for an extra pillow and blanket because there were none in the room and our phone did not work at all. Then the next morning we had to go downstairs and ask for more towels and washcloths because they only gave us 1 washcloth and 2 towels. The next afternoon I went to the front desk to ask about changing rooms. The girl was super nice if you have to deal with anyone here I hope you get her because she was super sweet. She said that I had have to pay an upgrade fee to change rooms. wait what. So I have to pay extra to get what I originally asked for but was n\u2019t given. I was angry but like I said she was nice and I knew it was not her fault we did not get what we booked to start with. I begrudgingly agreed to pay the upgrade so no one would have to sleep on the floor or air mattress. She said it would be charged to my card on file. I currently have 2 pending charges on my card. One for the 100 incidental deposit and a second for the upgrade. Depending on what actually goes through I may be contacting the hotel directly with my review. Parking. The hotel does not own their own lot so you can valet for 40 a night or you can park in the lot across the street Corner of Vine and 6th. like my daughter did for 1650 night or park 2 blocks down 6th for 10 night like we did. Bar Restaurant I was going to post a review separately for Brick and Mortar but could not find them listed on Trip Advisor. After checking in our group went to the bar for a few drinks. Two of us ordered Michelob Ultra \u2019s. The bartender said he did n\u2019t know if he had any but then said he found some. They were warm. He did not offer us anything else just gave us the warm beers. We were thirsty so we drank them and left. At the end of the night we returned to the hotel and bar for a few more drinks. The bartender tried talking us out of ordering what we wanted off the drink menu. I always like trying one of the house specialty drinks but he told me they were all horrible. I was undecided so I let him take everyone else \u2019s order. When he came back to me I said just give me a beer not another Mic Ultra because I did n\u2019t want another warm one. he said do you like rum or vodka. I said rum so he made me a drink that I did n\u2019t really want or like but drank and paid for just so he \u2019d leave me alone. On Sunday evening we stopped back in there for a few more drinks. The mic ultra was no longer warm so we had a couple and moved onto another bar. At the end of the night we returned to the hotel but were n\u2019t ready for bed. We had a few more drinks and played shuffleboard until they kicked us out at 10 pm because they were closing. Over the course of the two days we were there only one person in our party ordered any food and she said it was HORRIBLE.

This was our first time at the Cincinatian and I \u2019m pretty sure it will be the last. When I booked I noted that there were 4 adults so we wanted 1 room with 2 beds for a Saturday and Sunday night. I pre paid for the room almost 400. When I checked in I double checked that I was getting a room with 2 beds they said no. They said they did not have any available. I checked in at like 305 pm so unles they had them all given away the day before I was lied to. I asked if we could get a rolaway bed they said they do not do that. Then I asked if we could be switched to a room with 2 beds on Sunday night since most people would be leaving and they said that was a great possibility I just needed to go to the front desk and ask on Sunday afternoon. We got to our room and there was 1 king bed a chair and a HUGE open space where another bed could have been. It was a good thing we brought an air mattress. Three adults slept in the king bed and one adult slept on the twin air mattress we had brought with us. We had to go downstairs to ask for an extra pillow and blanket because there were none in the room and our phone did not work at all. Then the next morning we had to go downstairs and ask for more towels and washcloths because they only gave us 1 washcloth and 2 towels. The next afternoon I went to the front desk to ask about changing rooms. The girl was super nice if you have to deal with anyone here I hope you get her because she was super sweet. She said that I had have to pay an upgrade fee to change rooms. wait what. So I have to pay extra to get what I originally asked for but was n\u2019t given. I was angry but like I said she was nice and I knew it was not her fault we did not get what we booked to start with. I begrudgingly agreed to pay the upgrade so no one would have to sleep on the floor or air mattress. She said it would be charged to my card on file. I currently have 2 pending charges on my card. One for the 100 incidental deposit and a second for the upgrade. Depending on what actually goes through I may be contacting the hotel directly with my review. Parking. The hotel does not own their own lot so you can valet for 40 a night or you can park in the lot across the street Corner of Vine and 6th. like my daughter did for 1650 night or park 2 blocks down 6th for 10 night like we did. Bar Restaurant I was going to post a review separately for Brick and Mortar but could not find them listed on Trip Advisor. After checking in our group went to the bar for a few drinks. Two of us ordered Michelob Ultra \u2019s. The bartender said he did n\u2019t know if he had any but then said he found some. They were warm. He did not offer us anything else just gave us the warm beers. We were thirsty so we drank them and left. At the end of the night we returned to the hotel and bar for a few more drinks. The bartender tried talking us out of ordering what we wanted off the drink menu. I always like trying one of the house specialty drinks but he told me they were all horrible. I was undecided so I let him take everyone else \u2019s order. When he came back to me I said just give me a beer not another Mic Ultra because I did n\u2019t want another warm one. he said do you like rum or vodka. I said rum so he made me a drink that I did n\u2019t really want or like but drank and paid for just so he \u2019d leave me alone. On Sunday evening we stopped back in there for a few more drinks. The mic ultra was no longer warm so we had a couple and moved onto another bar. At the end of the night we returned to the hotel but were n\u2019t ready for bed. We had a few more drinks and played shuffleboard until they kicked us out at 10 pm because they were closing. Over the course of the two days we were there only one person in our party ordered any food and she said it was HORRIBLE.

So at that point we looked at what was supposed to happen with the wine and the strawberries and we agreed that breakfast in the morning might have cost us more money and more grief then trying to just get it so we decided to go elsewhere for our breakfast. Look at things from my point of view I took my wife to a hotel with the expectations of having wine flowers chocolate covered cherries breakfast delivered to the room in the morning. Too well none of this has went as planned let us not stay past noon because that is our check out time and we left at 930. Well before this point we were both disappointed in the service and I was expecting for her and she was disappointed at this point to that she insisted I must complain. So we are at the point of nothing got delivered to the room this is just a normal date night for us but yet it is her birthday. It made me look like an idiot it made me look like I did not know what I was doing for her on her birthday we could have changed any hotel with a jacuzi for a couple hundred dollars and then an hour and a half closer to our house but because you guys offer the extra amenities I decided to go with you.
