Our room was beautiful large and filled with light light mint green and beige upholstery was used with rosewood type light brown wood and it had art deco touches it had great big bathroom with fantastic looking fixtures generous amenities. If I did not pay with taxes etc more than 1000 a night I would not find the following to be an issue but since this is a Mandarin Oriental and a five star hotel and I am paying from my own pocket I expected better service and closer attention to detail. in our front facing room street noise was annoying there are noise blocking second windows easily installed that could be beneficial. The bed mattress was very hard and not very comfortable. I woke up with my lower back and shoulder in pain. I know how difficult it is to satisfy a variety of travelers choices. but I never had a problem with any of the mattresses I slept on at the Four Seasons nor at the Canyon Ranch Spa nor at The Carlyle. Usually a high quality ultra plush side sleepers mattress agrees with everyone including back sleepers. Room service was slow it took 45 minutes to an hour for a breakfast or a meal to arrive when the meal or the breakfast finally arrived something was always missing a spoon for the coffee knife for the fruit a plate for the continental breakfast not even a charger plate under the salad bowl. little details that would not be forgotten or missed in a five star hotel in Europe. The bath tub was not properly cleaned when touched with fingers it had a yucky texture. I actually went out and bought a disinfectant wipe from the CVS at the corner and cleaned it myself because I wanted to take a bath to soothe my aching back. The spa was booked solid not a single treatment was available. I thought for the hotel guests some allowances could be made as the spa is advertised as being a major attraction for this hotel a great big 16 thousand square foot spa with many treatment options. I thought they would have had enough therapists and enough space for one more guest to have a simple massage. Or at least try to accommodate a guest In Europe in a similar situation at a five star hotel when a small spa was booked a therapist was found and sent in room it shows the difference in trying to accommodate guests here it is a bit like a factory. nobody cares. Cafe Boulud is the only restaurant in the hotel and the music was blaring on the evening we tried to dine one could not hear ones companions speak. The menu is awful tete de cochon charcuterie beef croque monsieur all heavy greasy not a single simple fresh salad. Service is poor a slimy annoying waiter more interested in looking around than doing his job. With the frying oil smell spilling from the restaurant to the lobby elevator area you would think you are in Munich in some cheap hotel. I hope they will fix these issues because the people who work at the hotel from the room service to housekeeping people are friendly polite and lovely and the rooms decor is really beautiful and the location is great as well. Although some at the reception and at the spa could be trained to be more gracious and not behave like snobs with their guests.", "offset": [1082, 1373], "date": "2015-04-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "5fd4a3cb-230e-4325-8c47-65c1c85a6691", "sentence": "Simple Elegance.

This was our second stay at the Mandarin over Marathon weekend. The hotel was of course completely full yet the ambience at the Mandarin was always one of an oasis of welcome and calm. The Mandarin is definitely Bostons best hotel. The staff is truly extraordinary. Concierge Jenifer epitomizes what Les Clefs dOr symbolize. Neither the word no nor the concept that something can not be done are part of her professional life. In a word she is great. We also had a wonderful experience with Sala the Director of Banqueting. We were hosting a dinner for 12 in the North End the night before the race and needed place cards. I asked Jenifer if the banqueting department perhaps had a dozen place cards that I could buy. She introduced me to Sala who immediately offered to give me place cards and lend me the hotels place card holders for the evening. When I said that I thought silver holders would be a bit formal for a big pasta feast he agreed and offered to make me some less formal place cards. I gave him the names of our dozen guests and he had the printed hand folded cards back to me within 20 minutes. He too is great. Lastly we also were charmed by and mightily impressed with Tom the driver of the hotels BMW. we miss the Tesla but understand why the hotel made the switch to the bigger sedan. Driving around Boston during Marathon weekend is extremely difficult given the numerous street closures. Tom always knew the best routes and got us to both Fenway and the North End in no time at all.

I \u2019m not going to get into every detail here because I already wrote lengthy reviews to Amex Travel and MO. However I will summarize why I was disappointed by my stay at MO Boston. I had a week long engagement to attend at MIT during June. The Four Seasons happened to be completely booked so we chose MO. I have been wanting to try MO for a while but we typically choose FS. This was the opportunity. Problems started at check in where our Amex FHR package was completely mishandled. We were rushed into a room that ultimately was sub standard as far as what a luxury 5 star hotel should exhibit. I booked a fairly premium room no FHR upgrade was given first time that has ever happened anywhere in the world for us. No FHR benefits were explained until I asked about them in the elevator causing the reception agent to take us back down to the lobby to \u201c check \u201d if there could be an upgrade. No luck. Throughout the stay a number of other issues were apparent. I explained that I would be going to MIT and would hopefully be able to use the house car to get there. I \u2019ve done this for business at luxury hotels in other cities many times and it is one of the great perks of staying in a five star hotel. Not only do you save money from Uber cabs but the service is typically excellent because you \u2019re being driven in a luxury car by someone who does n\u2019t slam the gas and brake every five seconds. On the first morning of business I was told that since MIT was 23 miles away and the house car can only go 2 miles away that it would not be available to me. The front desk associate actually told me that if I had been going to Harvard maybe they could bend the rule. Harvard is 34 miles from MO. As someone who has many engagements at both Harvard and MIT this was utterly absurd to hear. Furthermore I \u2019ve been to a number of hotels that have said \u201c oh you need to go 24 miles. Not a problem. In fact here \u2019s the driver \u2019s cell number. When you \u2019re done give him a call and see if he \u2019s available. Maybe he can pick you up too \u201d. No such comparison. And it was a bit insulting to hear the distinction made between Harvard and MIT. The room was facing the street and unfortunately not very sound proof. The Peninsula Chicago and Four Seasons NY come to mind when I think of luxury hotels that are SILENT at night regardless of what \u2019s happening outside. Needless to say we heard screaming and yelling at 2 in the morning from the street on of our several nights. The furniture showed a lot of wear and tear. One of the doors on a dresser hung a off at an angle. One of the cushions on the couch was also a bit stained. Our room was immediately adjacent to the elevator something I never allow when checking in. However at check in I was told it was the only room left. Lastly the spa was not at all impressive. We only used the facility for the steam room and hot tub but it could use a makeover. The hand rail leading to the men \u2019s hot tub was very loose and moved a lot from side to side when you grab it. Take a trip to FS Dubai to see what an indoor spa should be. If that \u2019s the best spa in New England no thanks. The only good thing about MO boston was it \u2019s downtown location and the restaurant downstairs. Breakfast was excellent each day as was the dinner we had one evening. At check out it did n\u2019t appear that they genuinely care whether we were satisfied with the stay. They were happy to hand us our receipt and move on to the next guess. This is the opposite of what you feel at FS where staff members do everything to make sure you know they care. Overall I was very disappointed. However it reaffirmed my love for FS and Peninsula as being the best of the best no matter where you travel.", "offset": [3251, 3321], "date": "2018-08-26", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "38f25de0-4790-4b31-b685-797aaeba3d47", "sentence": "Home away from home.

Having breakfast at Bar Boulud is definitely the best thing one can ask for a hearty breakfast. Though selections are limited its made up for with quality of fare served and excellent service and wait staff. Only hitch I felt was checking in. Drove in from Logan International and it was pretty late in the evening. about 8 pm. As they outsourced the valet and there was only one valet in attendance it was a messy affair trying to make sure our 6 pieces of luggages get moved in. To make matters worse no staff from MO around so this poor valet guy got ta move our luggages into the hotel and still park our car. So it was not a good first impression we had for sure. Thankfully the front desk staff was around and we did managed to get all that sorted out. Still I will come back to stay given that the location is super convenient.
