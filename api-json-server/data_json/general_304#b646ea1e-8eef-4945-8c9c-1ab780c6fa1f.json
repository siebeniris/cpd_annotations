Found everything to be wonderful. Had two connecting rooms on the 19th floor with awesome views. Very clean and very secure premise. Experienced no issues and found all the staff to be friendly with hellos every time we passed one. The location is ideal with plenty of restaurants to choose from an easy walk from the mariot. We took advantage of packing collapsible coolers and bought beer at the Walgrens a block away. Made drinking at the beach very affordable. Had lunch service at the beach once and the food was actually very good and excellent service. The shade at the beach was not a problem until late afternoon. did not spend any time at the pool so can not comment about the shade concerns others mentioned. We go to the beach for the beach and ocean not the pool. However the pool looked very inviting and super clean. Hit the breakfast buffet our last morning and it was very good food and comparable prices from our other experiences. The casino was very enjoyable but only a single craps table and roulette table.

I have read previous reviews about this hotel and most of the reviews were positive. So I went ahead and booked a reservation for this hotel. When we arrived immediately we were greeted with such warm hospitality from the time we checked in to the very end where we left. I could tell this Mariot was older but was pleased of how they renovated the inside from the rooms to the lobby. Everyplace especially the public bathrooms were clean. I requested a balcony room and the breathtaking view exceeded my expectations. We used most of the amenities and services casinos breakfast buffet at La Vista and were very satisfied. If I had to think of anything that I was not pleased with was the beach location was a little limited for walking on the beach past the other hotels. Although we were in an area where there were other hotels there was not much room on the beach to walk since there were large boulders on the sand. Also there was not a lot of local restaurants in walking distance from the hotel to choose from. However I would still recommend anyone I know to this hotel. I also wanted to mention and recognize the names of the excellent service of my breakfast buffet we received were from Sonny Juan Carlos and Sonjia from the hotel restaurant in the La Vista. Also Francisco and Alexandra at the front desk were very nice to help dispute some discrepancies of my hotel charge.

Pool staff is great with towels always available and GoPros available for a test run. Our stay at this hotel was just marvelous I could not have asked for a better experience in San Juan. The Mariot is in a great location with stores restaurants 24 hour taxi service and the bus stop in a one mile radius. I also wanted to give a special recognition to the cleaning staff and Javier. The cleaning staff was amazing in taking out our trash and doing our beds they also took the liberty of cleaning the room a bit and tiding up our belongings. Javier was also a great staff member he came up to our room a couple of times to deliver shampoconditioner or whatever we needed when we called room service.

My mom and I stayed for 8 nights at this hotel. Overall we had a lovely and decent stay but the beach area in front of the hotel is definitely not family friendly. The Condado beach is a surfer beach. The waves are pretty big and the currents are very strong. Also the Condado beach does not have lifeguards on duty. There are 2 volunteer lifeguards on the weekdays who are there from about 9 10am until 5 6pm. They go around on the beach and ask for money. We definitely gave money as I found it very strange that the hotels in this region do not pay them for the service they provide. So if you like to just swim and relax in the ocean then this beach is definitely not for it. And definitely not for children. One last note about the beach. they do not clean the beach on a daily basis so you will see cigarette buds and other things in the sand. The hotel does have a nice pool so you can just relax there. The pool I found to get quite dirty and foamy especially in the afternoons when there was tons of people in it. The service at the hotel overall is good decent. I was not impressed by any means given that they do charge about 240 night. The cleaning was ok again nothing spectacular. The first day they did a more thorough job and for the rest of the stay I think it was just very minimal cleaning. The drinks are very expensive at the hotel. They charge 12 for a mojito. The food they served for lunch was very good and actually to my surprise decently priced. There are plenty of restaurants in the area so do go out and explore the numerous options other restaurants have for breakfast lunch and dinner. On the Saturday we got there the hotel had a dinner buffet for 40 per person which I found outrageously priced. Within walking distance of the hotel there are 2 Starbucks a Walgrens and a CVS and as I said numerous restaurants. So you can not beat the location of this hotel. If you like to explore about 30 minutes walking there is a great local beach called Escambron. It is absolutely perfect. You can swim there since there are no waves and no currents. You can snorkel as there is a coral reef to the right of the beach. It is definitely worth going there. We spent 2 days on this beach. You can even see the El Moro Castle in the distance. My mom and I also walked to Old San Juan taking the scenic route following route 25 after you pass the bridge over the lagoon. It took us about 45 minutes. It was a gorgeous walk along the coast of the Atlantic and I highly recommend it if you can walk it. BUT we careful because the sun is very strong and it is HOT and HUMID. If you decide to walk to Old San Juan I would not recommend walking the route past 930am because of the high humidity. If you want to take a cab it will be about 20 to go there includes tip too. We also did a catamaran sail to Icacos arranged by the tour desk at the hotel. The beach on the Icacos island is breathtaking. White sand and gorgeous light blue water. Overall would I return to the Condado area. No because I did not like the beach. Would I return to a Mariot hotel. Yes I would because even though there are things I did not like we had a decent and pleasant stay.", "offset": [2477, 2577], "date": "2017-07-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "27b423f6-3809-4a18-8e11-a7036f0d00dd", "sentence": "Great hospitality great location great fun.

Being this our first trip to Puerto Rico we felt very safe while walking around and exploring our surroundings. Old San Juan is a short taxi ride I think we spent 18 going there and 18 back. The property is very nice and clean with friendly staff. There \u2019s a restaurant on the lower level that we loved. The room we had was an \u201c Ocean Front \u201d room with spectacular views. Definitely worth the money. Our room was clean with nice amenities in the room. The bathroom is very nice as well. It \u2019s a very small bathroom and space is limited. Definitely ca n\u2019t have 2 people in there at the same time getting ready. There is a safe in the room for your belongings. The balcony is very nice as well it had 2 chairs and a small table. The staff was wonderful from check in to the waiters and wsitreses at the pool and beach. The outdoor grounds were beautiful. They have a nice private beach. The beach is clean and upkept. The pool is very nice as well there \u2019s a swim up bar which is convient. They do have 2 pools but one of them was under construction which made the one pool a little crowded. We visited in slow season so we understand that they do a lot of their work during this time. The hotel offers a lot of off shore excisions. They have a desk where they can book the excursion for you. From the hotel we did a day cruise to the island to go snorkeling. We also did a bioluminescence bay tour as well as El Yunke rainforest.

The food and drinks at the Mariot are expensive. 12 for a rum drink at the beach bar. and no happy hour prices. The best thing to do is go next door to CVS or Walgrens. A bottle of Bacardi rum is 12. Get some juices snacks and you are all set. Food and drink can be brought to the beach and into your hotel room. Much more cost effective.

Overall I ca n\u2019t say that it was bad but customer service does need improvement. I own a tour company and customer service for me is priority number one. Maybe I expect for staff to say good morning and acknowledge me first instead of me doing it. A customer should not be left waiting while the staff talks amongst themselves. There is too much competition out there to not pay close attention to customers. We booked a corner room that was oversized but like many have pointed out the rooms do need some freshening up. The beach staff was AMAZING. Alejandra Stephanie took care of us and make sure we had what we needed. The food was great and well priced for hotel food. We were both surprised at the quality of the food. The chicken wings were good. On our last full day they had a grill and offered your typical burgers hot dogs but we chose to go with the lobster tails. WOW WOW WOW. So glad that we were able to enjoy this day where they were grilling food. We spent most of the our time by the beach but we also visited the pool. Why did n\u2019t we spend more time at the pool bar. The water was FREEZING. Every time we got out we were literally shivering. So for us the beach area was much better and as long as the staff kept the drinks coming we were happy. Would I stay here again. Not sure.

My pool view room was renovated but it was missing some kind of carpeting maybe just around the bed would be nice. so the floors are a bit hard on the feet. I just wore my flip flops the whole time. There was no full mirror in the room so that was a minus. The in room coffee was great I was impressed. The room was spacious and the bed was very nice I slept well. This property is on the beach in Condado which was really nice to walk on each morning. The area is a bit touristy but I never thought that was a bad thing. The pool is super shallow so do not expect to swim its more of a wading pool. Food is lacking here but it is not their fault. I think this is an island wide problem. I will say that the coffee is amazing. The cafe in the lobby has great coffee and I highly recommend it. Housekeeping was great I always came back to a spiffy room.

We also really liked the Condado District as a home base for our trip with the beach right there and some nice restaurants close by. However I know our trip would not have been nearly as memorable without meeting Byron and Ivan. Byron and Ivan work at the valet stand at the SJ Mariot and in aditon to being friendly and professional they gave us a couple amazing recommendations on places to go that were away from the touristy locations. I am not going to give away what seem to be like local gems but we decided to be adventurous and took their advice over our originally planned activities. I am so glad we did as we had an amazing time getting out into real Puerto Rico. It helps that my wife speaks fluent spanish but everyone we met was extremely friendly. They gave us a few more spots to check out next time we are down and we will definitely be back. Only minor issue we had with the property was that they have an Elite lounge that is apparently only available to access on arrival. Being a Platinum member I get a bit spoiled when I travel but I was disappointed when I tried to get a bottle of water from the lounge before heading out for the day and was told no that it was only for arriving guests.

This was our third week long trip to San Juan this year. All were business trips for my husband and happily I was able to join him. On our last two trips we stayed at the Courtyard in Isla Verde which was very nice. On this trip we decided to stay at the Mariot. we have stayed at this Mariot property twice in the past most recently in September 2017 when our trip was cut short by Hurricane Irma. Mariot does an exceptional job hiring and training employees and everyone EVERYONE we encountered was friendly and helpful. We were even impressed with the attention to our rooms cleanliness by the housekeeper Dominga P. All that said I am not sure we will choose the Mariot for our next trip to San Juan which will probably be next spring. I should mention that we are Mariot Bonvoy Gold and actually this most recent stay raised us to Platinum status. Check in at the Bonvoy desk was fast and efficient but our room felt more like a downgrade than the upgrade we had been hoping for. The room 1614 was tiny and cramped. Yes it was an oceanfront room as we had booked but you could hardly close the bathroom door without getting crushed between the door and the toilet and it just was not a room I wanted to stay in for the next week. We stayed in the Cabana Wing on a past visit and that room was much larger and newer. I called the front desk and was told a better room would not be available until the next day. The following day we did move to a somewhat larger room in the main Tower with a larger bathroom. Still I was surprised to see that the hall carpeting throughout the building which I thought was truly in need of replacement during our first visit three years ago was still in place. It looks either thread worn or bleached out. I am not sure which it is but it is totally unattractive. Also the room furnishings and bathrooms need updating. We stay at Mariot properties quite often. Even the Courtyard and Fairfield Inns we have stayed at recently have had updated furnishings and more modern bathrooms most with nice large showers in place of tubs which are often slippery. Another disappointment was the Gingambo restaurant. Again the servers were attentive friendly and knowledgeable but we found the food breakfast and dinner to be somewhat lackluster and quite expensive for what we ordered. Fortunately there are many wonderful restaurants a short walk or inexpensive Uber ride away. Uber BTW costs a fraction of a regular cab ride. In particular we enjoyed Bodegas Compostela Santaela and a new pop up restaurant called Oriundo at Atelier Cocina Abierta just across the street from the hotel a few steps down from the Hard Rock CafeThis hotel has so much going for it it is in a great location the pool and beach are very nice the staff could not be more helpful and the oceanfront views from the balconies are beautiful.

My 1star is mostly for the housekeeping service. It was consistently bad. Second day we were out of the room from about 10 am till 5 pm. When we came back the room was n\u2019t cleaned. So we had to ask consierge to ask housekeeping lady to fix it while we had to find something to do meanwhile. Same thing happened five times out of seven nights we stayed. Five out of seven. I am not kidding. There was no \u201c privacy please \u201d sign at the door and we were n\u2019t in the room most of the day giving them plenty of time to clean. Last few days we had a \u201c guessing bet \u201d with my kid if our room will be cleaned when we return. Last night after I even told consierge at 5 pm that room was not cleaned again when we returned at 9 pm it still was n\u2019t cleaned. At that point of course we all wanted to go to bed so I let it go. But honestly this should not be happening for 650 a night in a 45 star hotel. Also most days they did not replace toiletries like shampoo and body wash. Same for coffee cups. We used both disposable cups the first night and they were not replaced for 2 days. On third day after I mentioned it to consierge downstairs there were different type of coffee cups that did not match lids provided. So I could n\u2019t close the lid and safely take my coffee downstairs. The following day no coffee cups again. I just gave up and went to Starbucks across the street every day. Mattresses can use upgrading. We travel a lot and in most hotels of that level mattresses and pillows are super comfortable. Unfortunately in this Mariot they are very average not luxury hotel quality. Also pools are very shallow both of them. I understand kids \u2019 pool is supposed to be like that but even adult pool is only to my waist at its deepest part. Keep in mind some older reviews mention kids game room it does n\u2019t exist any more. Other than pool there is nothing for kids to do in the hotel. So when it rained my kido was bored. On a positive note all security guys casino employees waitresses are super nice and friendly. Breakfast buffet was good too. Bartenders at the pool were all quick and friendly.
