We booked a king oceanfront on a high floor and we were upgraded to a king suite on the third floor which was just fine which had a fantastic balcony and was steps from the beach. We could hear the surf in our room with the patio doors open and it was wonderful. I spent a lot of time on the balcony very happy. There was a wedding the first night with a big party below us on the second floor. Thankfully the band quit at 1030. We ordered champagne for our room upon arrival 30. Champagne did not come to the room within an hour and we went to the beach and ordered it there. Went out in the evening and when we came back at 80 champagne was there. We took it back to the desk the next morning and the front desk wanted me to return it to the restaurant but I did not want to deal with it so I left it with them. It was taken off our bill. The housekeeping service was great with turn down service in the evening. I enjoyed having towels replaced two times a day since we went to the beach a lot and took a lot of showers. Beach service was very good. The only disappointment was that the electric floating chairs were not working. Small beach but not overcrowded. Nice and clean and great service. Great location. Two blocks from the butterfly conservatory where the troly stop pedi cabs and bike rental is. Away from the big crowds. The only real complaint I have is that the bed was uncomfortably hard. I expected a more luxurious bed. I do not mind paying high rates for great rooms and luxury I expect from the Waldorf Astoria hotels and this bed disappointed. I have had better beds in a Hilton Garden Inn. I was sad to leave Key West but so very happy to be home in my own very comfortable bed.", "offset": [680, 843], "date": "2015-01-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "5de0a20e-aed5-4c7c-a67f-cd4f24ea3fb5", "sentence": "would go back. thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel ca nt wait to go back.

Conveniently set at the south end of key West just off duval Street. it is about 30mins for a casual walk to the north end where the sunset festival starts the crazynes in malory square. The check in staff were friendly and very helpful in planning our 2 Day stop in key West. The hotel grounds were as good as some 5 hotels with a slightly heated outdoor pool garden area small private beach beach side restaurant hammocks and an impressive over water gazebo area with amazing sunset views and water sports. The sister hotel next door has a spa and a longer beach too. We paid for a king garden room and had a surprisingly good side on view of the beach too. And the nespreso machine was a nice touch. There were some disappointing points too though. Check in time was at 4 pm which is the latest we have experienced in all our travels. When we got up to our room it was still being cleaned even though check out is at 11 am. The room next door had a food tray left outside which the cleaners left there until at least 10 pm when we got back after dinner. our room was normally not cleaned until late afternoon either. The bathroom door had warped with some visible damp and had to be forced open and closed. Our room phone was not working for incoming calls which we only learnt after waiting an hour for a call back from the concierge for our jetsking booking. And also meant we had to use our international roaming mobiles to receive calls from back home. There was also quite noticeable noises through the night from the fridge which buzzed intermittently. One last point we noticed whilst walking through the hotel one night was that there were empty glasses left around the lobby area and corridors as well as some red wine spilt on the floor by the lifts. All of which we would not really expect in a hotel of this class. Given the location and the service we received we would still happily stay here again as I am sure all of the above issues we also pointed out to the hotel can be rectified and taken into consideration to improve things for future guests.", "offset": [968, 1097], "date": "2015-02-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "61e292de-8b02-4fad-bbe5-6c14b3720d6f", "sentence": "Not a Waldorf Astoria. First the staff were friendly and helpful so I have only wonderful things to say about them. However the state of the rooms was not at all what we were expecting and looked nothing like the online pictures on trip advisor or the hotel website. It is a motel style building with long winding cement pathways to get to the rooms the outside walks are in desperate need of a pressure washing and repainting. When walking you see into their parking lot and storage spaces that were filled with broken furniture old room service dishes and bins full of dirty towels. The room was ok but not very good quality. Our room was missing a desk chair there were ants in the bathroom and an old orange Chetoh on the closet floor when we first checked in. The pool and beach are nice. We were very disappointed that the life size chess board that they show on the website was not usable they apparently do not have pieces for it even though they show it with pieces on the website. It is rated as family friendly and in general is but be warned that their restaurant named The Strip has large life sized soft porn photos all over the wals not exactly child appropriate. The price for the room was very high and we were simply expecting more given the Waldorf Astoria name attached not a semi clean worn down motel style place. Very disappointing.

This is a very nice resort in a beautiful setting. We had a studio suite with a balcony above the pool overlooking the beach and the ocean. The room had a king bed and a sofa sleeper couch for our two daughters who flew to Key West to meet us for vacation. I talked with a staffer named Cindy who worked in the front office of the hotel about our room reservations before we arrived. She was incredibly helpful in talking through the options and then setting us up with a room that would fit everyone before we got there. We went back and forth on whether to stay here or the Casa Marina and I think we made the right decision. This hotel was smaller and more intimate 100 versus 300 rooms had a nicer beach updated rooms and everything at the resort was very accessible. We walked down the beach to the Casa Marnia one day just to see what it was like. The Casa Marina was beautiful but I liked our hotel better. I was afraid The Reach was essentially going to be an overflow hotel for the Casa Marina but that was not the case at all. I thought the service at our hotel was wonderful too. There was a different crew working at the beach pool every day setting up and taking down lounge chairs umbrellas and passing out towels. These guys hustled from 80am when the first guests started to arrive at the beach until 730pm when the last stragglers left. They worked non stop and came around throughout the day to chat and make sure we had what we needed. My daughters rented jet skis one day and then paddle boards and had a great experience too with the staff who ran the watersports operation on the beach. You do not go to Key West expecting a real beach experience so I was pleasantly surprised by what a nice beach they had and how well it was staffed. The restaurant had indoor and outdoor seating and it was nice to get up in the morning and have breakfast outside overlooking the ocean on the large covered patio. It was a perfect spot to sit and relax especially during the heat of the day. We arrived at the hotel pretty late our first evening after driving all day. My daughters and I went to get something to eat at the bar before we went to bed. One of the bartenders Lucy was the first person we interacted with and was very friendly. It sort of set the tone for the week. She served us dinner at the bar and made some great recommendations for restaurants off the resort. We ended up eating half our meals at the resort including a couple of dinners because the food at the resort was very good overall and it was so convenient. In terms of the location this hotel is literally two blocks from the southeast end of Duval Street which is close enough to walk and far enough that you do not have to be around all the commotion when you are trying to relax. Key West is best explored on foot or on a bicycle. It was easy to walk from the hotel to the central part of Duval Street and the surrounding neighborhoods. One day we walked to the other end of the island and back to the hotel. We also rented bikes in the hotel lobby which was a nice way to explore some of the more out of the more remote parts of the island. We spent more than we normally would on the hotel and food that week but I thought it was worth it and you have to put it in context because nothing is cheap in Key West.

Now I do enjoy the Key West craziness very much but this hotel at the end of Duval Street about a mile and a half up from Malory Square offers a nice quiet place to recover or just chill out. A lot of people choose this hotel because it has one of the few beachfronts in Key West and many were using the loungers there and at the small pool fronting the beach. Just know that the beach is pretty narrow and while we were there the surf was brown and there was a lot of seaweed but that did not seem to deter mostThe rooms are pretty simple but ours was very clean and tidy. We loved the Nespreso coffee machine. Only downside of the room was the very loud air conditioner which is a unit behind the wall under the ceiling. It went off and on all night but eventually lulled me to sleep. We liked the good size balcony. Our room faced the street overlooking palm trees. Normally we like a beachfront room but there was a strong stinky seaweed smell all along the beach during our stay so I am glad we had a bit of shelter from that via the street. The staff was very helpful and gave us a lot of information and tips on FantasyFest. A great benefit of The Reach is that you are free to use the facilities pool restaurants etc. at its more upscale grander sister hotel the Casa Marina a short walk away on a back road. We ate at The Reach only once at the bar. it is pretty pricey 1215 glass of wine. and we found the food not so great. We opted for a couple of meals at the Casa Marina beach bar food was not so good there either and over next door at the Southernmost By The Beach which IMO has better less expensive menu and excellent people watching.", "offset": [1472, 1689], "date": "2015-10-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "9093c918-a53d-46b0-a1b9-bbccae524da3", "sentence": "it is an ok hotel with a good location.

When we entered our room a random rod from the shower was on the ground you could tell housekeeping just left it there Maintance did come fix it promptly. We just at at their restaurant for the included breakfast buffet and it was ok. Nothing amazing nothing bad. The ocean room view room was ok. We had a better view of the roof of the ocean than the ocean. Speaking of the restaurant roof they have a great thing going if they would lean how to use the space. There is large area with one couch. Put some chairs and umbrellas there and they would have a great space. The tv in the bedroom was in a very awkward location. They should have mounted it on the wall at the foot end of the bed. The beach and location is the biggest selling point for the hotel. It has a small private beach with great sand.

My wife and I just returned from a quick 2 night stay at the Reach and it was wonderful. First off as to the the negative reviews the building does show very minor wear and tear. but I found the property overall to be outstanding. Is the building itself a Waldorf maybe not. but it is a very nice Hilton. it is very similar to the Waldorf in Puerto Rico. We arrived Sat morning around 11. I had emailed ahead about early check in and they promised to try and accommodate it. Our room was not ready so they held our bags and we walked over to Southern Most Cafe for lunch only 1 block away. We had just sat down when they texted me the room was ready. We went back and they had upgraded us to a studio suite on the courtyard with a slight view of the pool. Very large clean room perfect. They even sent up a larger bottle champagne and chocolates for my wifes birthday. The Beach The beach at the reach while small is one of the nicest in key west. it is small and private but has plenty of room for the guests. there is not much space to take a walk but for the time to relax on a beach it is perfect. The two beach attendants were outstanding. Upon arrival they take you to your chairs put nice Waldorf covers on them and lay out your towels. The Pool Very similar to the beach in its smaller than most. but I found to be perfect for what it is needed for a place to cool off. While we did not make it over there a guest told us they walk over to Casa Marinas pool at the other Waldorf for a change of pace during the week. Spencers the Restaurant This is the place inside the hotel. While we only visited one night for drinks and one day for lunch I found the service to be horrible and slow but the food was good. If you are looking for food while there take a quick walk to the other places around. there is some great coffee shops and breakfast places 5 mins up Duval from the hotel. The Banana Cafe is right there as well. Location to Southern Most Point Get up early one day and walk down there before 10 when the cruise ships load it up. it is only 2 blocks from the hotel. Bikes You can rent bikes at the hotel for around 100 day and leave them just inside the parking garage. The hotel is in a great spot to ride up Roosevelt back towards the airport along the beach and bike trail. it is a 5 mile ride from the hotel to the intersection of Route 1 and Route A1A. it is a great ride all along the beach.

When we first checked into the Reach after a long day of travel I was quite disappointed. I did not like the layout of the property. it was a long walk to our room along a zig zaged walkway. I did not like our view. our room was not overlooking the beach courtyard. it was overlooking a residential area. There was no dresser for storing our clothes. just a couple of shelves in a credenza. We were here for a conference staying three nights. I was not excited. I then looked at some reviews and saw that others had the same reaction. Then I decided to relax and stop thinking about negatives. I am so glad that I did. I had a wonderful relaxing time. I really was not there for the room. I was there for the experience and to relax. The staff offered to bring me a dresser for our clothes but I decided it was not that big a deal. The concierge was very helpful. The folks at the front desk were so friendly and accommodating and were happy to call cabs when we needed them. The restaurant was very nice. I had breakfast there each morning and lingered there enjoying the view. I highly recommend the Shrimp Eggs Benedict. We spent hours relaxing in the courtyard and Richard at the pool bar was very accommodating. He took care of our beverage needs and had great suggestions on things to order from the menu. Try the yummy burger or flatbread. He was very entertaining. I hope the Reach knows what a jewel he is. We had dinner at Spencers once and thoroughly enjoyed it. The courtyard is lovely and has interesting features such as statues and sand carvings. There is a large chess board and a bocce ball court. it is a nice place to read or just watch people. I enjoyed relaxing on the balcony even though it did not have a beach view. I was able to take in some people watching which was quite amusing. My husband attended a seminar each morning and he reported that the daily breakfast was good and the meeting room was very nice. My overall experience at the Read was very good. The room was clean.

The few issues we did raise the staff and management was quick to point out how is was our fault or because they were so busy that there was nothing they could do.

Attentive staff provide lounge covers and towels popsicles and icy towels once each afternoon.

The outside seating at Spencers on the Beach was pleasant and breezy right on the ocean. Inside Spencers was more formal. I had a delicious breakfast there and for lunch i recommend the crab cake.

We arrived in the late afternoon 5 pm ish on a Wednesday. No door man or bellman. No ramp for your luggage. So we had to carry our luggage up the steps. Next the lobby is what you would expect at a Hampton. Nice nothing special. Then our room was not ready. It was after 5 pm check in was at 4 pm there was no one around why was our room not ready. Then they tell us we have a city view when we had upgraded by phone to a court yard view. No court yard views available BUT wait we can have a partial ocean view. Well look at the pictures. Our view was of the trashy house next to the hotel or the parking lot where the laundry got picked up if we went to the very end of the balcony and stretched we could get a glimpse of the ocean. When we complained they told us they were sold out of junior suites we we were paying for not on point paying for and we could get the 1 other available room which was a regular room that viewed a wall. Our room was large but the bathroom tiny and falling apart. Plaster coming off the wall no counter space rusted shower curtain yes rusted. We had a couch no chairs in the suite. The place is a dump. Disgusting elevator whose last inspection was Aug of 2018. This is March 2019. The stair case I \u2019ve been in cleaner chicago parking garage stair cases. The pool was nice very small especially compared to the Waldorf pool next door. At least the Casa appears to be a Waldorf. The restaurant food was good. The people were very nice and friendly with the exception of one horrible concierge woman The bar closes down at 10 and the gift shop if you can find it open it always seemed to be closed when it was suppose to be open closes at 9 pm. Also the woman in the gift shop is not nice and does not appear to like people. It is nice there is a beach but the public beaches are very nice Hilton should be ashamed to have their name on this property.

The staff acts like you are a nuisance. The furniture is scratched. The pool is tiny and full of screaming children. What a sad display of breakfast in the store. If you are a Hilton Honors member you are entitled to 15 worth of breakfast items consisting of coffee and a packaged croissant. \u201c Sorry no fruit today \u201d. That is if the store is even open. They will tell you that you can go spend your 15 in the restaurant where no one greets youWe were just so disappointed to find that what was presented on their website as a luxury hotel turned out to be more like a bad Hampton Inn.

We went for breakfast and got there at 101. They stopped serving that menu at 11. When we asked for the regular breakfast menu as it was only 1 minute after cutoff time the kitchen said no. Not so lazy when it comes to their time. Not worth the price. Next time we will stay at the Pier House. They had a clean beach better service and not that much different in price. The first day we ordered bottomless mimosas but the server was MIA. I do not think she understood the bottomless part of the mimosas. I ordered a regular Eggs Benedict as they only had Lobster Benedict on the menu and she tried to charge me the same price as the Lobster Benedict. I bet that she would have charged me for the lobster if I asked to substitute ham for lobster. it is amazing how she thought that charging me 26 for 2 poached eggs and ham was acceptable. Oh wait.

Any request we made was granted. They even texted us a couple of times to be certain all was well. The pool and grounds were immaculate. The beach did have some seaweed but the staff went above and beyond to keep the beach as clean as possible. They have little control over mother nature. The hotel does need some fixing up but this is due to normal wear and tear and they have renovations planned. Our rooms were clean and fresh our furniture was comfortable and the bed was AWESOME. Those sheets were the best sheets I have ever slept on or under. The towels and chair covers at the pool and beach were always clean and smelled fresh. Spencers never failed to please no matter what meal drink or snack. The little shop on site had some great muffins croissants fruit cups etc. Oh and the nespreso machine in room. Great little machine. We loved our stay at The Reach. The only reason it is not a 5 is because it does need some freshening up but that did not bother my family at all.

We had paid for ocean view rooms and requested we all be within reasonable proximity of each other. We ended up as far from each other as was possible including from my kids who must definitely needed supervision. Beach was small and clean. Staff nice but not staffed enough to handle the customers. Food in the one on site restaurant was over salted and very expensive. Not any better at the sister hotel we were able to use next door. It would have shown class to put cookies or Christmas token in the room. Should dress staff festively and play music. Have music at the bar and include customers on this festive night. If reach wants to be an up and coming 5 star hotel they have some serious work to do. Begin by getting rid of the cocky rude big boss who offended everyone in our group. Rooms were new. Reasonable quality. Noisy old air conditioners. No water. Stingy coffee supplies and no complimentary water.

The Reach is located right next to the Southern Most Point. A few steps from the hotel starts Duval street which is only a mile long. Great location. The Reach has the only natural sand beach with ocean access along with a pool. This is a big draw since most of the resorts only have pools or beach chairs on decks docks with no sand or beach access. But the Reach is not cheap and for the price you will need to decide early on what is most important to you on your vacation before you commit to paying the price. We could have easily taken two other vacations to more luxurious resorts with better service for what we paid for just 5 days at the Reach even with a wedding rate discount. The rooms are average even after the upgrades and I have a better bed with more luxurious bedding at home. The bathrobes are nice but do not expect slippers with it. And be prepared to go to the local CVS to buy bottled water and anything else you need. Everything in the resort store is highly overpriced. The staff is very courteous but the service itself is average. The Reach markets amenities that you would expect to be included for the price you pay but the amenities either do not exist or are not high quality. The service on the beach and the pool need improvement. Again the staff is accommodating but more staff is needed. The bar does not open until 130AMeven though everywhere else on Duval street serves alcoholic drinks at 7AM. Beach and pool drink service is very slow. There are service buttons on the umbrella poles but I do not believe they work. We tried multiple times to use the buttons on different days but even after waiting 15 minutes or more the waiter did not show so we went to the bar ourselves. The staff walked around with Popsicles once a day at the beach and pool but never once was I offered a chilled eucalyptus towel which is marketed on the Daily Resort Fee Inclusions. The daily resort fee is 45Repairs and upgrades are still in process so keep that in mind. They are doing their best to update everything so expect to see and hear repairs being done during your stay. Food at the restaurant is very good. Definitely have at least one breakfast there. The coastal sunrise and the avocado toast leave little to be desired. They are fulfilling and deliciousFinaly we stayed at the Reach for a wedding. The reception was outside on top of the restaurant. The music played until 1PM. Make sure to ask if anyone is getting married during your stay. If so you will most likely hear the music until the reception is over and it may keep you from sleeping.

We called down several times to the front desk to have someone come up to help us with it. No one ever showed up and we gave up. We had 2 breakfasts and 1 lunch at the hotel.
