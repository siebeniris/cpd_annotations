This has to be one of my all time favourite hotel stays ever. Yes it is not cheap but it is worth every penny. Checked in with ease and given our room an hour early this has not happened anywhere else from Vegas San Diego or Long Beach hotels. Given a chilled Proseco on check in and absolutely blown away by the lobby bar area and outside pool area with beautiful cabanas. Room on 7th floor was stunning with city view. Decor so charming and loved all the products in room. Our daughter got a lovely card wishing her Happy Birthday and hotel sent up plate of cookies fresh fruit. What a lovely touch. Walked a few minutes down to the beach and Santa Monica Pier 5 minute stroll. We returned to hotel and just wanted takeaway pizza reception staff were so helpful recommending and allowed us to use lobby phone to call in order.

Viceroy Santa Monica is a great hotel with nice and friendly staff small but well decorated rooms. I really appreciated the bottle of fresh water they handed to me each time I came back from my morning run. They have a lovely patio with 2 pools. One of the problems with these kinds of hotels in these kinds of places is how they try to get a maximum extra money from you despite a room price that is already very high. As an example they tried to charge me a 26 daily fee called amenity which is mandatory and covers things like priority bike rental you still have to pay for the rent standard wifi even if you get a better connection through 4 G morning tea or coffee etc. that you either do not need or should be included in your basic room fee. If hotels start like this what is next. A mattress or shower fee. Thankfully after a small conversation with the front manager she removed it. I had a mixed feeling about this process in one way she was very nice and removed it but why would an hotel of this category even try these kinds of things. it is something that could discourage me from using this hotel chain again even if I know they are not the only one using such practices.", "offset": [0, 55], "date": "2017-04-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "ba0dd3b0-03b4-46e4-ab80-7689d178eaf0", "sentence": "All about the location.

So we stayed here my wife and I plus our two boys 17 and 14 first stop on a California Road Trip. I picked The VSM out because the rate was pretty good and it offered Ocean View rooms. We really did not get off to a great start when we checked in. Was offered the standard glass of Proseco each and waited for the reception guy to get our key. But strangely he just disappeared for about 10 minutes until I got to the point of thinking what is happened. So returned to the desk and spoke to someone else he checked on the system and said in fact the hotel was very busy and the room we had booked was no longer available. We could either stay in a smaller room for one night with an ocean view and then move to the room we had booked or stay in a larger one but with no view. Hm. Kept calm and said neither was acceptable. And they needed to sort something else out and to be fair they did. We were magically upgraded to a bigger room with a really nice view. So well done VSM for turning a lemon into lemonade. Thereafter things were fine. Food was okay but not outstanding. But the hotel just lacked those nice extra touches and personal service that we did experience later on our trip. Other things for people to note and these are not criticisms the ocean is a lot and bit across the somewhat busy ocean avenue. it is totally walkable but you are not actually on the beach. The pool is very much in the shade and a little on the small side. But apart from the usual extras eg parking and Evian super expensive if you want to buy it is pretty good value for money.
