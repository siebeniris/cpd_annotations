I am not giving the hotel a 5 because it is a 4 star and a really great solid one. it is expensive tho for a 4 star in my mind but I could have gotten a better deal than I did if I shopped around and had not booked at the last moment.

First getting to the hotel. Even with google maps to guide me there are too many one way streets around the hotel with the pylons that come up at certain times of the day to close a section of street. I do not recommend renting a car if you are staying here. I arrived the 1st day Reykjavik and spent about a half hour driving around looking for somewhere to park. The hotel no longer has any spaces assigned to them I asked. Next the roms I should start by saying that the room that I stayed in after the 1st night 410 was nice and quiet with no complaints of the room. However the room they assigned me the first night 215 should be avoided. it is right above the street where the drunk tourists yell and scream from about 1230 am until 330 am on their walk home after the bars had closed I guess. Some others just wanted to hang out by the street corner and talk very loudly for about an hour. In case you are wondering I had my window closed. Ask when you check in for an interior facing room even if you have to wait you will be glad you did. There are no views to speak of anyway. I only ate at the restaurant once. I had the breakfast buffet and was disappointed. The offerings looked and tasted like they had been sitting out a while. They had an omelet station but otherwise the food seemed to have been cooked hours earlier. I also could not find any cereal that they supposedly offer according to what I read online. Some pancakes or waffles would have been nice. Overpriced at 2850 Kr to me. I saw one guy that really seemed to like it though. He had 3 plates of food must of had a bit of everything offered. The Laundromat Cafe just around the corner had better offerings in my opinion. I did not get recognition for my gold status until returning to my room for my 4th night at the hotel. A nice card from the manager a chocolate and a free bottle of iceland water. A nice touch. I am glad they managed to get around to it before I left. There is construction going on nearby the hotel and while there was never a problem with noise from it it did make the the traffic and parking problem worse as they had closed down a lane of traffic right by the hotel. Plenty of shops and restaurants nearby and there is a few nice walks around the area. The paid parking I used most of the days that I stayed there was a few streets away to the west of the hotel on Oldugata street. it is not to bad of a walk but it is up a little hill. Another place that I parked was further away but not uphill. It was paid parking Southwest of the hotel on Tjarnargata street by the little lake. The price of parking was not too bad as it was free on Sundays and they only charged you for the hours of 9 am to 6 pm. I think it was around 100 Kr an hour or less. To summarize I stayed for 5 nights but used points to pay for 4 of the 5 nights. There is no way I would have paid cash about 300 a night for a room at this hotel for 5 nights. One night at about 300 was enough. Other than the 1st night and the following morning buffet breakfast I had a enjoyable stay throughout with the rooms being perfectly adequate.", "offset": [2308, 2436], "date": "2016-09-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "c983acd4-1cc7-4f20-838b-ad82f1f5118c", "sentence": "Excellent location. Our travel agent booked us into here based on its convenience to our plans. Checking in was a bit of a hassle as it was dark and snowing and parking was somewhat challenging. Also one of the evening desk clerks seemed to have a bit of an attitude. Beyond her though everyone else was very friendly and helpful. All spoke excellent English. The room was a bit quirky and the ceiling sloped to such a degree that neither my wife or I I am 510 she is 54 could stand erect on the left side of the bed. The bathroom was essentially institutional and not what I would call spic and span. My wife was a bit put off and it was not what we typically expect from a Radison. These factors are really why we did not give this hotel higher marks. Regardless as the title of our review suggests the location is outstanding. you are within easy walking distance of many excellent shops and restaurants. it is an area that obviously caters to tourists and also appears to have some of the more upscale shopping in Reykjavik. Likewise the breakfast at the hotel was outstanding. The chef made excellent omelets and the other buffet offerings were varied and delicious. Perhaps we are a tad over critical and could go with a 4. I just really do not know what other hotels in the area are like. I have heard this is one of the best.

The Radison Blu 1919 is in a nicely renovated older building located right near walking distance. many shops bars and restaurants making it super convenient for dinner options and nightlife. Much of downtown Reykjavik is explorable from here on foot but if you are getting a rental car to do day trips to explore the rest of Iceland be advised this hotel has no parking lot and no parking plan. Staff will just shrug and offer no help. Parking is on street pay cash credit and can be a challenge to find close to the hotel especially on nice afternoons when all of Iceland decides to come to town to party. Sometimes this forced us to park in the opera house parking lot several blocks away. And this was during winter slow season I would imagine summer crowds make it much worse. We had one of the top floor suites which was a nice large room but I think a room on the next floor down might have had a better view as our skylights only afforded a limited angle view of a construction crane. The aurora was not visible during our visit and if it had been viewing photographing through the skylights would have been awkward and unacceptable at best.
