Beautiful sun loungers are ready for guests to relax and take in the amazing view. If you are lucky you can see Turtles coming onto the beach to lay their eggs. The hotel is right near their favourite spot. The beach and all of the estate has high speed no fuss wi fi probably the best service I have experienced in any hotel. The concierge is a fountain of useful knowledge and support. Charlene is the shining star going way above and beyond expectations. She booked us so many wonderful activities and restaurants every one we were treated like VIPs and everyone we enjoyed throughly.

My wife I decided to get away for a long weekend and chose the Fairmont. It was a good choice. We went mid August which is the slow season. No crowds no cruise ships just mostly peace and quiet. The staff are all very friendly the rooms were cleaned every day by noon the pool was never crowded and they provided towels and floats and on our last day we were witness to a group of monkeys traveling through the resort \u2013 they were making all kinds of entertaining sounds noises. The gym was nice and the 2 of us seemed to always have it to ourselves 3 treadmills 4 bikes and some weight equipment. The beach was relaxing with some slow waves and soft sand. I believe every room faces the ocean and all have balconies. We did walk north on the beach to a few other bars restaurants but found nothing nicer than the Fairmont \u2019s outdoor bar area. The food was top notch at the resort we were never disappointed. The breakfast is buffet style with an egg station lunch is by the pool bar and dinners are either by the pool bar or 1 night was in the breakfast area restaurant \u2013 both with live music. Awesome. They have a great chef but I do n\u2019t remember her name. My favorite bar tender was Ralph \u2013 very calm and professional and easy to talk to. We did venture out of the resort a few times. We went to the Hole Town mall nice area Cin Cin \u2019s for dinner very nice and elegant \u2013 recommended and we went down to The Boatyard for an afternoon recommended. We had a 2nd floor room which does n\u2019t include a butler nor travel arrangements to from the airport. I recommend the 2nd floor. Not having a butler is fine for me and we pre booked our taxi \u2013 round trip for 62 US. And even without the resorts pre arranged transport to the Fairmont the Fairmont still has someone waiting for you at baggage claim to help you get through Customs quickly and then get you to a taxi. That was a 5Star touch. We hopped on a bus once instead of using a taxi. It was well worth it \u2013 I think it was 3 vs 20 and it was fun.

We LOVS this place. Just back from 9 nights at the Fairmont Royal Pavilion and I am ready to go back. This place is very different than other vacation hotels as it is a smaller boutique hotel with less than 100 rooms. This actually made it easier for us to meet tons of people and connect. The hotel is located on the most beautiful pristine beach which was perfect for swimming lounging walking and snorkeling further down. The sunsets were stunning like the postcards from the 80s. Our room was on the third floor and we took it advantage of the amazing balcony with cozy daybed and obstructed Oceanview sunsets each night WOW. We slept like babies as we were right on the ocean. it does n\u2019t get better. The Pavilion staff were so genuine and amazing. we were greeted by Tawanda who brought me the most delicious gluten free coconut sugar cakes upon arrival as well as rum punch for the hubby. I do n\u2019t drink. Apparently everybody at the hotel ca n\u2019t stop talking about the rum punch. I could not get enough of those sugar cakes. LOL Marcela in housekeeping was super pleasant and attentive to detail which we greatly appreciated. Thanks so much. Chantel Holder was every day \u2019s ray of sunshine. She made sure that my husband and I were taken care of and was so great to talk to. Handsome Michael Sealy LOL was just amazing with the guests and staff. Not even two seconds after he saw my husband \u2019s sunburn he was on the phone calling for aloe to be brought to our room. His customer service is top notch. OK Let me tell you about Chef Janele. she was super careful knowing that I have a gluten intolerance. she came to our table to see us before preparing my meal to reassure me of the gluten free preparation. Her coconut curry shrimp dish is possibly one of the most delicious things I \u2019ve ever eaten in my life. I am still dreaming about it. Janele you are the best. Chef David took us around each dish at West Indian buffet night to go through each dish for me as well. David is just amazing. This theme night is a must go the food was delishious. It felt more like we were with friends when we were chatting with the staff they are such a blast genuine amazing people. One thing I must add is that both my husband and I never got sick at this resort and the drinking water here is perfect. I highly recommend this resort for couples who want a super relaxing vacation on the most gorgeous beach. if you can try to check out the beautiful island. There is so much to see.

We ordered a sandwich at the Beach Bar and after 45 minutes we enquired as where the sandwich was only to be told they had been very busy Rubbish. When we arrived all had been serviced with just a group of 4 waiting for their lunch. The waitress told us \u201c the Chef had just returned to the kitchen \u201d which begs the questions as to Where she had been. We cancelled the sandwich and left. After saying 4 nights with you we went to Coral Reef for the remainder of our Holiday our 10th visit here and the service was absolutely excellent as always. We ate in various Restaurants over our 9 days stay on he Island all with the exception of the Fairmont was superb. We do like the Fairmont group and have stayed at many in our time. We are planning to celebrate New Year at the Fairmont St Andrews Scotland as we have visited this this Hotel on several occasions mostly over New Year. and we know the service will be extremely good. Sorry for the poor review however on speaking with other visitors both at your Hotel and on the Island many to commented that they either experienced or had heard that the service was generally poor.

I have been a returning guest to the Fairmont for 6 years. I usually go in July so being there in December their busiest week from 1220 \u2013 1229 was a change. But as busy as everyone was the staff always had time for me. Charlene the concierge extraordinaire at the Fairmont is one of the most positive people on the planet. When I walked into the lobby she greeted me with a warm hug and I knew I was home. Tawanda was my reservation specialist. I booked very late Tawandas determination to get me a room was epic. The pure magic that Tawanda pulled off for me was humbling and the best Christmas present I \u2019ve received in years. There are more people I want to mention by name so please read the full detail of my review. The rooms are spacious and all have a beachfront view. I love the covered patio with the amazing sunsets and listening to the waves gently crash. The beach is one of the best on the west coast of Barbados. There was always a cushioned chair available with a big umbrella to protect me from the sun. The water is warm and calm. Get the breakfast buffet as part of your room. I \u2019m vegan and so it was my favorite meal of the day. After using the gym which is sufficient the breakfast buffet has something for everyone. The food choices at the hotel are good for me but I \u2019m not a foodie. There are other restaurants a short cab away. The uniqueness of the Fairmont is the people both the staff and the guests. It \u2019s a place where the kindness never stops.", "offset": [36, 94], "date": "2020-01-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "b690cfb1-f21c-4b2b-bc2b-5155fafcbfdd", "sentence": "Our Latest stay. I write this review partly with a heavy heart as we have been coming to the Fairmont Royal Pavilions for the last ten years. The location and the beach is second to none and you would be hard pressed to find anywhere as good in this part of the world or any part of the world for that matter However the stars of the hotel has started to dim anc little indisciplines have crept into the place and it \u2019s frustrating to see the wonderful long standing staff who pride themselves on customer service suffering due to poor management and what appears slackness in the standards that were such a benchmark for this hotel. We find ourselves questioning for the first time should we go elsewhere and see if we can better value for our money. The resteraunt is very average and it \u2019s tired It needs an upgrade and somebody thinking ahead instead of just taking the money and hoping we will all simply return. The thinking is that the location and beach will offset everything but we know that guests are staring to question the price and standard and some have gone next door As I say I write this with a heavy heart as we love the staff we have grown to think of as friends and we love the area and of course Barbados itself But the management apathy has started to set in abc unles that attitude changes then we will begins another casualty.
