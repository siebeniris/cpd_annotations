The staff go above and beyond to make your stay as memorable as possible. Victor who works the pool area is phenomenal. The man is amazing at remembering names and what you ordered the day before. This guy needs to have his salary tripled as far as I am concerned. you just do not find as dedicated employees like this. Fernando at the Lobby Bar would address us by name as well and always remembered our favorite drinks. The property is well maintained but the rooms are extremely small with thin walls.

Ernesto might just be the friendliest guy you ever metTwo of our older kids enjoyed the activities that were put on by Silvestre his co workers. All the above people got to know our family and provided really great service. Our Maid Ana did a great job every day and worked around our schedule with a baby. The weather was great the pool really good although our last 2 days were over Xmas so lots of beds taken with towels early in the morning. The Christmas Dinner was great value Roberto was very helpful. The concierge staff helped our older children book trips family dinner reservations outside of the hotel. The Marina is a very short walk away we had a few good meals there that were excellent value. The property is very well maintained has been modernized in some areas but other areas look as if they need a bit of an upgrade. Worth mentioning are a couple of things One of our two rooms was not ready at the 4 pm check in time. The staff were very busy and they could have handled this a little better than they did. Especially as I have Mariot Rewards Platinum Status. The WiFi is patchy if you are looking to stay connected.

My wife and I had a great time at the Casa Magna resort in Puerto Valarta. It is our second visit to this hotel and this trip was even better than the last. All of the employees that we encountered went out of their way to make our vacation a GREAT ONE. I have listed below a few of the employees that I meet that went above and beyond to help us out 1. Warren is the beach and pool concierge who is always walking around this area to make sure the guests are being taking care of. I met him on the first day of our trip and he was able to give me a list of places visit and also made our nightly restaurant reservation. What a great concept. The General Manager David Gauna was able to realize that people come to this resort to be at the beach pool and that \u2019s where you will find most of the hotel guests. Warren made a big difference in my impression of the hotel. Warren is Canadian so he has a good grasp of the English language which give him an advantage. I consider Warren to be the best overall Mariot employee that we met during our stay2. Diana Aguilar Executive Assistant was able to help me with my requests before I even arrived at the hotel. I would like to thank her for all of her good work3. Audrey Formisan is the hotels Sommelier. She offered Tequila tasting on Tuesday and Thursday. It lasted about one hour and it is well worth the time to learn more about the subject. She also gave us some recipes. 4. Belen was the person that cleaned our room daily. My wife \u2019s birthday occurred during our trip and I asked her to do something special with the room. She put a birthday banner on the door and decorated the room. I would like to acknowledge her for her creativity and good work she made by wife \u2019s birthday special. 5. Mitzi is the hotel cat that they adopted and is well taken care of. She is always around and seems very much in charge. Being partial to cats it was nice to stay at a resort that values animals. It is a nice personal touch. I have attached a copy of the current taxi cab rates that are posted at the hotel and the money exchange rates.", "offset": [659, 824], "date": "2017-02-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "9f26b9d5-9f95-4695-8cda-df3c82989e98", "sentence": "Puerto Valarta Vacaciones. The minute I arrived the bell man offered to help me and was very courteous. Checked in and because I was an elite Mariot member we had our own line and help desk and also got a free ocean and pool view upgrade with free wifi. I was ecstatic. They put me on the 7th floor and the view was amazing. Room was very clean and the bathroom was exceptional. I could just sit at the patio and marvel at the view. This hotel is just very close to the marina circle walking distance to a bunch of authentic Mexican restaurants. Taxi cabs are controlled so every body gets a cab right away. They control who gets in as well. There are 5 restaurants inside the hotel. I have only been to 3First one was Las Casitas which is located next to the pool and the beach which is amazing. Great Mexican and American food combined and drinks and ice cream are available too. The waiters waits for the restaurants and the people at the pool and the beach with much enthusiam and energy that was the best part. They obviously love their job. And this restaurant had some July 4th celebration with fireworks toSecond The Champions Bar. Nothing much to say American restaurant and sports bar with a hint of Mexican style. 3 pool tables and some multiple tv screens for sports fans. Third is the coffee shop Judy across the gift shop. This place is actually pretty cool. Opens at 7 am and closes at 11 pm. Your go to snack and coffee place. It has a nice patio too. And they sell ground coffees. Their gift shop is well typical but one thing I can say is they have the tequila tasting every Tuesday 4pm closing time and you get 20 off of your entire purchase. Got me some Don Julio 70 and the Centenario Reposado. Yum. 4 stars just because you can hear people talk outside your room.

Brenda and Denise helped us out and everything was taken care of. When we got to our room we were surprised by the accommodations. We got ready and when out to discover the resort and what it has to offer. Ernesto met us with a friendly smile and ask if he could help. He did suggest we go to the Marina on Thursday night. So we did. It is a short walk. While we were there we made an appointment for a couples massage and pedicure. It was only 350 a each for our next morning. After we sat at the pool all day. We had great polside service of food and drinks by Edquardo. During our stay we ate at 3 of the 4 restaurants. They were all good and the prices were very reasonable for a resort.

They were very thorough in cleaning it the water was clear of any debris. there are lots of entry points they have loungers in the water hammocks in the middle of the pool.
