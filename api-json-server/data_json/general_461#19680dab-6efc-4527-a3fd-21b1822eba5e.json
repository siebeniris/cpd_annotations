Four Seasons Kuda Hura is a beautiful secluded resort with great rooms facilities restaurants. The only issue I had with the resort was privacy. I stayed in a standalone beach bungalow on the sunset side of the island. Since the sunset beach is more usable than the sunrise beach the sunset beach gets a lot more traffic. Lots of people passing the room impinged on privacy. Also children would regularly take a shortcut across my villas pool area to get to the beach. The hotel has a policy that the sun loungers in front of your villa are for public use often there were loungers hanging out with view into the room. Once I was even asked to leave the area so someone else could use the lounge chairs. The resort management was very apologetic of this but it was unfortunate. SCUBA diving did not meet expectations for Maldives. The wildlife diversity was not as expected and the currents were often very rough. I assume the dive staff took us to the best option sites so it is probably a problem with diving in this area of the Maldives.", "offset": [869, 951], "date": "2015-01-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "d84173f3-e154-4084-b4e0-4ed768d0c508", "sentence": "Great intro to Maldives. We split our stay between FS Kuda Hura and Landa Giravaru. The resorts are quite different with Kuda Hura being the more dense and casual of the resorts and Landa Giravaru having a remote lush setting with greater privacy and intimacy. Of the two I preferred Landa Giravaru but Kuda Hura was a great introduction into the Maldives after 30 hours of travel time. The highlights for us included Recreation Diving. My husband could not have been more pleased and he is now spoiled for diving outside of FS. Things like handling his gear partnering with a dive master vs a guest providing post dive coffee and treats. these all left a lasting impression. Recreation Other. The recreation team was extremely helpful and friendly and I appreciated the attentive service of their director. On our afternoon Turtle Snorkel Safari we saw 7 turtles hawksbill and green and enjoyed our guides insights. We also went on a sunset dolphin cruise and while we did not have much luck in dolphin sightings it was a beautiful evening spent on the water. Sunrise Water Bungalow. the view was incredible as was the sound of the surf in the distance. We watched the glorious sunrise each morning from our deck savoring every moment. We appreciated the welcome champagne and sweets and especially the upgrade to a suite with its complimentary afternoon dim sum Sunset Beach the waters and beach were stunning. We loved being able to tuck into the landscape under a palapa while enjoying the incredible views and drinks. The beachside service was attentive and being able to buzz for service ensured we had what we needed when we needed it Barabaru the setting food and service at this Indian restaurant made this our favorite at the resort. While I did experience and issue with my spa services when I brought it to the spa teams attention they made it a priority to establish an acceptable resolution. In addition I had misplaced a spa product after my spa services and the FS team did a great job in locating it I left it on the beach and returning it to me. While the service was not as personalized as it was at Landa Giravaru the Kuda Hura staff provided sincere service that created a warm and welcoming environment this is what keeps us coming back to FS. It was the FS management team at Langkawi that inspired us to venture to the Maldives and they were right to do so. The Langkawi GM even went out of his way to assist in finalizing our plans and reservation.

From the reception buggy drivers restaurant staff housekeeping the managers gym staff yoga instructors even those sweeping the beach were all very nice friendly accommodating. There is not anything they will not do to make sure their guests have the best time. One perfect example was when we experienced a storm on our 4th night we did not want to go out of our villas because our 3 villas were located on stilts we will need to pass the boardwalk going to the restaurant. We ordered room service but 30 mins. later a restaurant staff informed us that it was difficult for them to deliver the food because they could not assure the quality of the food if they will bring the food with the strong winds rain instead they offered to escort all of us to the restaurant. We told them we did not want to get wet from the rain so we do not mind if they deliver the food in plastic containers we will understand if the food was not hot anymore without the usual cutlery formalities under the circumstances. They delivered our food after a few more minutes when we were asking to sign the bill we were informed that it was complimentary because of the inconvenience we experienced brought about by the storm because of the casual preparation. If that was not what an impeccable service is I do not know what is. We booked 3 sunrise water bungalows the 3rd bungalow with a pool. I requested that all 3 bungalows to be adjacent or near each other. When we arrived there were no available 3 water bungalows that were adjacent so they just upgraded our 2 bungalows to be adjacent to the 3rd water bungalow with pool. The water bungalow is so beautiful we can go down behind our room walk to the sandbar. At night we stay on our balcony to watch the sharks mantarays swim by. We even saw a big turtle in front of our bungalow. We also enjoyed the facilities amenities. The gym was open 24 hrs my children enjoyed the sports activities like wake boarding snorkeling banana boat. We also joined the shark safari and the turtle safari. The swimming pools were also very nice. Lastly i truly appreciate when they extended us a late check out our flight was at 10 pm the management was kind enough to allow our 2 rooms a 90 pm check out while the 3rd room was given till 12 noon. The housekeeping surprised me my husband on our last night when they decorated our bath tub with heart shaped rose petals complete with a cold drink. We stayed 8 full days at Four Seasons it was not enough when you are having a grand time. I had say Four Seasons surpassed my familys expectations. The minute we set foot on the island we felt we were in paradise. Just one suggestion though it would be nice if there were more food variety on the menu especially because we stayed for 8 days otherwise everything was just perfect. We will definitely go back to this paradise.", "offset": [1580, 1746], "date": "2015-07-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "73cf40b3-e7da-465a-ab72-93abfe6c0124", "sentence": "Best vacation ever. I stayed here with my family 3 generations of us. a week ago. I have stayed at several resorts in Maldives and many Four Seasons around the world before and this is by far the best hotel. The service is impeccable. Our butler Mr Nawax was attentive and often delivered solutions that far exceeded our expectations. There are plenty of activities for the whole family young and old even if they do not dive. All of us went to the spa which was relaxing and accessed by a short ride by dhoni. One of our party wanted to buy a pair of the comfortable slippers made available at the spa. We were told these were not for sale and yet the lady at the spa kindly arranged for a complimentary pair to be delivered to our villa. This exemplifies the exceptional service at this resort. We also had a pleasant private sunrise yoga session on the beach. We windsurfed kayaked surfed and snorkeled. There are many fish to see in the corals lying just off the beach on the sunrise side. The resort is one of the few turtle sanctuaries in Maldives. Turtles that have been caught in ghost nets who require their flipper to be amputated are brought here for the operation and recuperation. There is a resident marine biologist who also gives talks and accompanies the guests on the dolphin watching cruise. We saw many spinner dolphins on the cruise. The tuition provided by the snorkeling windsurfing and surfing instructors is also professional and we all had great fun. Mr Sabah the snorkeling coach was very patient with one of our party who was very afraid of the water and he managed to persuade her to go snorkeling. We stayed in the water villa suite. We would recommend the villa on the sunrise side where the waves are less choppy and it is less windy than the sunset side. Staff at the Caf\u00e9 Hura where breakfast is served are very friendly especially Ms DeDe and another lady from the Philippines. The staff squeeze fruit and vegetable juices to order which we appreciated very much. Complimentary dimsum was also delivered to our villa for tea and when we commented to the chef how good they were the Caf\u00e9 Hura staff made sure we were provided with a steamer for breakfast on subsequent days. The pizza and pasta at the Italian restaurant were excellent as were the waffles served at breakfast. We also appreciated the complimentary early check in and late check out and the boat upgrade for our return journey to Male. In the evening there is shark feeding and crab races which the child in our party thoroughly enjoyed along with the kids club. and she said it was her best holiday ever.

Where do I start. This was our first stay in the Maldives and also our first with Four Seasons. The resort is absolutely stunning and small enough to be able to comfortably walk everywhere and large enough not to notice other guests. In fact we kept asking where everybody was as the beaches were empty. Part of the reason might have been due to it being the 50th anniversary of the Maldives and a number of the guests were government guests and therefore not the average holiday maker. Our beach villa was beautiful and spacious and it was brilliant to wake up and have a cup of coffee on the beach all to ourselves. If the facilities were good the service staff were 6 star. The staff could not do enough for us. By way of example we went for a walk to explore the island and my wife walked on her bare feet 20metres on the boardwalk to the water villas before she realised the wood was too hot to walk on. We had not walked back more than 10 metres before one of the cleaning staff whizzed up on his pushbike and gave her a pair of new flip flops. There are too any examples to quote. We went sunset fishing one evening before dinner and again were surprised to be the only guests on a large dhowdue to reasons above. We caught loads of fish in the 2 hours and were able to select the ones we wanted the chef to cook for our lunch at our choice of venue the next day before our departure. They opened the Indian restaurant just for us and we had a very special lunch at the gazebo. Unfortunately we were only here for 2 nights before our departure on the Explorer which was a step up again and is reviewed elsewhere.

After spending four nights at FS Dubai at Jumeirah Beach incredible hotel we came to FS Maldives KH to continue our Honeymoon. I chose Four Seasons for the entire honeymoon because I wanted to experience the highest level of service and quality. We were not let down. We were met at the airport by FS staff members who brought us to the FS lounge while they loaded our stuff onto the resort speedboat. After a short wait in the air conditioned lounge which had wifi and drinks we took the 20 minute boat ride to the island. We were greeted on the dock by a group of people playing instruments and clapping. Several staff members took our stuff to our room while a few others brought us to the lobby to give an overview of the resort. We were upgraded to the beach bungalow which was bigger than the room we had booked. A bottle of champagne was waiting in the room to help celebrate our special occasion. The island is small. You can walk from one end to the other in about ten minutes. One path runs down the middle with bungalows on either side. Water villas are off the far end of the island. There is a sunrise side and a sunset side. Our bungalow was on the sunset side. The water seemed more calm on the sunrise side primarily due to the presence of a reef. For snorkeling I would recommend the sunrise side. You can see everything in the water more clearly whereas the sunset side had some good size waves making it hard to see things like baby sharks and sting rays. Nothing really dangerous but we prefer the calm water so we can see what is swimming around nearby. We ended up walking across to the other side every day to use the sunrise beach. Not a big deal because the beach was mostly empty. The resort was quite full while we were there yet the beach was empty almost all the time. We had hours in the sun with no one around at all like a private island. Our bungalow had a good closet space beautiful bathroom and bathtub inside shower and outside shower classic FS bed TV and private outdoor area with plunge pool. The plunge pool was nice but smaller than you would find at the other FS resort Landa Giravaru which we stayed at after. The two islands are very different but great in their own ways. Look for my review of Landa to compare. We spent 3 nights at KH and 5 at Landa. Both were excellent and we are glad we experienced both. The food on KH was excellent. We were treated to some of the most beautiful tables you can imagine while at KH including twice on an elevated platform over the waves of the ocean at the main restaurant. Steaks and seafood here are all very good. We had the half board meal plan which provided for dinner on top of our complimentary breakfast. Lots of fruit in the room for midday. Dinners came with appetizers entrees sides and deserts. We were stuffed every night. Food plan well worth purchasing as it is cheaper to do so than order individual meals. Drinks are outside the meal plan. The Sea bar has a beautiful dock that you can sit on and view the sunset over the spa island. We enjoyed it very much. You can order a bottle of wine and continue it at dinner elsewhere if you like or just have cocktails. The absolute best part of the island is the service. This is where FS differentiates itself from other brands. At every turn we were greeted by people who knew our names knew what we had done on the island or where we had eaten. Everyone from restaurant staff to housekeeping to reception and concierge staff was amazing. We heard stories about the Maldives about the island itself about local traditions and culture. Everyone was polite and it seemed like everyone was genuinely happy to be working there. The island is a paradise so it makes sense but it was impressive to experience nonetheless. One example of the outstanding service ad attitudes of the staff is how they helped me with my GoPro. I forgot to bring a little plastic piece that fits on my new GoPro to make it waterproof. The first day I got there I realized this and went to the dive shop to ask about it. They did not have the item in stock but they said they would track it down from another island. Less than a full day later I was swimming around the reef away from my bungalow and away from my wife when I heard my name coming from shore. One of the staff members was on shore calling me over. He had a waterproof housing for my camera in hand and he had tracked me down despite the fact that I underwater about 50 feet off shore. The housing worked perfectly and I thanked him. Key point they go above and beyond at every turn to make you stay feel special. The little details add up. Highly recommend visiting KH. If you want to see both islands I recommend the paradise twice package as FS will take care of all the transfers.

There is also a complimentary family photo shoot with 5fre images however. we did n\u2019t have the time to do this.

I was interested in getting the Advanced Open Water diving certificate and was a bit nervous as I had not dived in a long time and did not have as much experience but Susane my diving instructor was very patient explained everything in as much detail as I needed and did everything to make sure the experience was as enjoyable as possible from picking interesting and beautiful diving sites to recommending more adventurous dives I would not have thought of myself. It was a very unique experience in the end and I could not thank Susane or the diving staff at Kuda Hura more.", "offset": [16, 86], "date": "2020-01-11", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "e9ec5189-020c-4ee3-b202-d99bb282c489", "sentence": "Back in paradise. I dived every day with the expert help of Moose and Adil while I was doing that the sun beds were prepared for my wife and at breakfast Yan was always there with his attentive service. Dian and Sebastian along with Branka keep the Reef grill going ably assisted by Zaidhy. I would like to thank the Spa management and staff for fabulous treatment. The chefs are very open to fixing just what you like in all the restaurants. While I had a fabulous breakfast in Cafe Hura looked after by Joseph Nissan and Osama.
