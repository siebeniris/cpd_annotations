It is beautiful grounds are maintained to a very high standard and it is spotlessly clean. However there were too many flaws to give it 5 stars which is a shame because it has such potential to be magnificent. Positives first full marks to the Concierge and staff at check in. We were taken to our room very quickly which was impressive and very welcome when you arrive at 7 am. The orientation tour that afternoon was informative and helped us get our bearings worth doing. The overall site as I have said is lovely so no issues there. Enough has been said by previous posts about the good so I will go to the issues that made it not so good. Staff there are so many staff on hand but service is often slow and poor. We were often kept waiting at one time it took 20 mins to order a drink in a bar when there was more staff than guests. Having said that there are stars in there who know their stuff would like to mention in particular Kaumar said I would mention you. Mrs Robert De Niro here. on the beach great guy always on form also Veer with the funky glasses Yash the coffee man Aikin in The Bar and all the oh so cheerful Boathouse Boys thanks for the rescue. last but not least Burwing in the gym who put me through my paces and only laughed a little bitThe Room spacious but really in need of a refurb. Furniture had dents and ring stains shabby wardrobes with poor lighting in that area and only 4 hangers each. Turndown service was negligible not worth bothering when all the dirty glasses empty bottles etc are just left for daytime cleaner. The Beach pretty to look at but like swimming in a river estuary see tips below. The sun bed situation was getting worse by the day Lux management you should stand by your own rule of removing property for beds that are saved by people at dawn who then do nt turn up until lunchtime. Yes I was guilty of saving a bed but I am an early riser and we did make use of them within the hour and stayed all day. Another issue is people leaving and not placing their used towels in the baskets if you do nt do this it looks like the beds are still occupied. Pools did nt use them but the adults only is lined with dark tiles and looks like a very univiting pondFod poor. Buffet had little choice and the plates if they have nt run out are cold. The restaurant is open to the sides and windy see tip below. so food was always cold by the time you made it back to the table. Breakfast buffet was much better. Lunch food is good as well as it is prepared to order and lots of cholce. A la Carte was nt up to much either not much choice again. They get booked up far in advance and only seat small numbers. We only managed 4 visits in a 2 week stay. All in all we did have a lovely holiday and there are certainly worse places you could be. I just did not get the luxury experience I was expecting although the ice cream bar is to die for. yumyTips Waterproof shoes for the sea really you do not want to walk in that barefotLadies take a cardi wrap shawl for the evenings. It is always breezy sometimes downright windy and can feel just a tad chilly. Gents be aware long trousers only in the restuarants in the evening please ditch the slogan tee shirts and make an effort for your ladyIf you are going out request a packed lunch rather than the picnic hamper. It was very good despite half of it being stolen by a rather scary monkey. sorry that s another storyTake part in the stargazing on the beach so interesting and the view through the telescope was amazing.

When lunch time beckons a short stroll to one of the nearby restaurants will see you well fed and watered. This resort is set in a stunning location and it is no mean feat that a relatively small team of gardeners are able to maintain the vast gardens so superbly well. The quite unique atmosphere and ambience which the management team have been able to create within this resort make this hotel outstanding. Each and every team member has taken on board what must have been extensive training to provide the service that they do which is a joy to receive and something that Management can be proud of.

Having arrived after a hectic few days in Dubai my family of 6 adults were welcomed to the LUX G with a cooling towel and a huge smile.

They are without doubt the most fabulous team I have encountered in a long time. Nothing is too much trouble and everyone greets you with such professionalism and it is so clear that they want you to enjoy your stay. The refurbishment is about to happen and it will be fabulous when it is done. The food Absolutely lovely and so much choice in all the restaurants. We loved the Abalone at lunch time and The Beach in the evening although the buffet restaurant always had a great choice too. The Mauritian food served under the banyan tree at lunchtime was also really lovely. We were all inclusive and I would definitely recommend that. The beach and pool We tended to stay around the adult only pool and beach as it was quieter. The sea is not crystal clear but the bays are very pretty and the surrounding gardens really are beautiful and meticulously maintained. The facilities Lots to do outside with a great deal of water sports included in the all inclusive package. The gym is good and the spa offers lovely treatments.

This is such a shame to write a negative review but before doing so it has no bearing on the staff who are truly the most warm hearted helpful and kindest people you could meet. The comments are aimed at the owners and investors of LUX hotels. Last year we went to the Maritim which is supposed to be in the top 20 hotels. Loving Mauritius we decided to go back and on advice decided on the LUX Grande Gaube which is supposed to be in the top 10. Without any hesitation whatsoever the Maritim wins hands down The rooms at the Maritim and the Gaube are comparable is size but the Maritim wins again on d\u00e9cor freshness and cleanliness The food at the Maritim was superior in terms of choice and selection. Not once did we ever need to ask for things in our room at the Maritim. At the Gaube many times we asked for Tea Milk Water Face Flannels Towels. After being told such great things about the Gaube by Thomson staff it was a natural disappointment. The big thing though is that on the day we arrived we were told that the hotel was closing at the end of May for a 6 MONTH REFURBISHMENT.

You \u2019l also find that if you \u2019re carrying maybe 3 glasses of drinks or food at breakfast time then staff will go out of their way to come and carry them to your table which is always very thoughtful. We were even jokily told off for pouring our own water one day. The restaurants The Palm restaurant \u2013 buffet style breakfast and dinner. Both mealtimes have everything you could possibly ask for and we always found that we ate too much. At breakfast you can have your omelette or eggs cooked to order a choice of pancakes waffles and other sweet treats cereal Asian food and a whole room of fresh fruit juices.

If you are considering booking the LUX Grand Gaube \u2013 do it.

Our room in the adults only section was beautifully decorated thoughtfully equipped and benefited from a tranquil view over the secluded bay.

We stayed at the LUX for a week for the start of our honeymoon. The resort is beautiful and has been recently refurbished to a high standard. Clean and chic with a lovely setting and thoughtfully designed spacious rooms things like special shelves for your books and suitcases a two person bath and touch screen do not disturb sign. Also the mini bar and all room snacks are included a welcome bonus and the supplied beauty products were excellent. Wi Fi throughout the resort is fast and reliable. There is a great choice of restaurants with truly excellent food with many options cooked fresh in front of you. You could easily eat different cuisine every day for a week. The Turkish restaurant Bodrum Blue was particularly special and has the best view which is panoramic you feel like you are on the sea. Also the little touches are great such as spraying your face with refreshing mint spray on arrival at the restaurant and the fresh hot bread served before the rest of the food. The Peruvian restaurant Inti by the main pool is also very good but the food is not included the drink is. This felt odd as it was great but not better than the Turkish restaurant or the main one. It should be included. The cookery class in the main restaurant was brilliant. You learn to cook a 3 course Mauritian meal it is very comprehensive and they give you the recipes and aprons after. There were only 4 of us so it was exclusive. You eat the food at the end in the dining room which is closed to others a great experience. We eat out a lot in London and have high standards plus expected very good food here and the LUX really exceeded it for example it beats the quality and choice of Club Med which I have been going to for many years and that is saying something. You MUST go all inclusive I think most people do. we did as the cost of drinks is high if you do not. which is apparently the way in Mauritius not just here up to \u00a3 10 for a glass of wine for example. The wine and other drinks are all delicious with cocktails at the quality of a central London 5 star hotel and the best wine we have had on holiday their Scrucap and Popcap own brands are highly recommended. They have wine tasting on offer too. We had a wonderful dinner on the beach as a special treat for the honeymoon it costs extra but that is understandable as they set it up especially and you have your own waiter throughout plus they print out menus with your names on which was a sweet touch. The reception staff were also very accommodating when we had to change the timing of the beach dinner twice because of the windy weather. The staff are all really friendly and the level of service is good only sometimes a little slow to serve drinks at breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant for example more than once we had finished our starter and still did n\u2019t have a drink so this could be improved. The spa is blissful beautifully designed and massage treatments excellent. Other activities are very good too such as water skiing and the glass bottom boat trip. The main pool is heated but did n\u2019t feel like the 28 degrees mentioned on the tour definitely cooler. The adult pool is not heated but in a wonderful quiet area by another bay round the corner from the main beach which is windier. It is peaceful with its own excellent Creole restaurant rum tree house outdoor cinema and bar within a charming retro van. Lunch is gently introduced by the sounds of an acoustic guitarist playing every day. One point about the adult area there are no umbrellas. The shade from the trees is relied upon but it is not full shade anywhere. There should be some umbrellas. There are large beds for two which should have canopies as not everyone likes can cope with full sun all day. it is fine as long as you are prepared to cover up or move around as the sun moves. Having been to a number of all inclusive resorts our only gripe throughout the week was having to sign a receipt for every drink lunch and dinner. This included a line for tips which felt like the tipping was being pushed on us. It would be so much simpler to give every all inclusive guest a bracelet they even have them ready to give you as a parting gift which is nice but why not give them at the start like other all inclusives and then you do not need to sign anything and can decide on your tipping at the end of the trip. They would also save a lot of paper this way. Although this was annoying it was a minor element which did not detract from our overall enjoyment of the place it is just something that would have improved our experience. In summary I would recommend booking you will not be disappointed. The setting friendly staff quality of accommodation spa food and drink all superb and the overall atmosphere and ethos is perfect for a very relaxing holiday.", "offset": [867, 1043], "date": "2018-09-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "19eace28-aa76-4e95-ac8e-4f4eba6c23b7", "sentence": "Nice hotel but little maintenance of room.

I would highly recommend to have a stay there and the rest needs to be experienced.", "offset": [13, 82], "date": "2018-10-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "f9ec093f-1fa8-414e-ac8d-23ff3987e329", "sentence": "More than 5 star plus.

Recently we arranged for a day visit to the Lux Grand Gaube where we have previously holidayed. On arrival we were greeted by Anabel served coffee and made to feel at home. Following a brief introduction Anabel took us on a conducted and informative tour of the refurbished premises pointing out the changes and improvements made since our stay. This included access to a redesigned guest bedroom. We were most impressed with the extensive re modelling of the hotel and the significant changes and improvements made to the premises and facilities. After the tour Anabel gave us the freedom to wander wherever we wished and so we enjoyed some time on the beach and an ice cream. She met up with us later when our taxi arrived to say farewell. We would just like to say a big Thank You Anabel for being the perfect hostess and taking time out to show us around and explain the thinking behind the redesigned and impressive Lux Grand Gaube.", "offset": [361, 412], "date": "2019-09-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}]}
