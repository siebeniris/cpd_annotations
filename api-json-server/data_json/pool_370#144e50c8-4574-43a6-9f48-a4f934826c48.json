My sun worshipping wife and I pale freckly and factor 20 kinda guy fancied a luxury ish stay near enough to Barcelona so we could have a day there but also with beach gym good food etc. and boy has this ticked all the boxes7 nights at the end of June and the weather was ideal a light breeze kept the 30 degree C heat down and the semi private beach has plenty of natural wooden parasols made from twigs offering shade if required. there is a cafe bar on the beach with waiters offering table service and during our stay this was the location for a couple of themed nights one of which for San Juan festival where kids set off fireworks all night long. The rooms are spacious and include two single beds pushed together into one monster bed. We had a partial sea view which was absolutely fine. The balcony is big enough for a table and two chairs and is super clean. it is accessible via the floor to ceiling double sliding doors. Minibar safe large wardrobe hair dryer. his n hers sinks separate shower and WC bidet are all good. No tea coffee making facilities for those that might be interested. The hotel is located on the outskirts of a fairly low key town and is the stand out attraction. All that separates it from the beach is a walkway where runners cyclists and walkers parade up and down it is a great place to people watch. A 5 minute stroll parallel to the beach and you are in amongst the bars and cafes of Calafel all of which seem just fine. there is barely any reviewed on Trip Advisor but there are plenty to choose from. Back to the hotel. The main building is gorgeous super tall ceilings in a huge open reception area next to quiet reading chilling indoor areas. Either side of the main building accessible via external walkways are symmetrical 3storey horseshoe shaped accommodation blocks. Every room looks over a central water feature. I say feature but it is no more than a shallow rectangular area of water. Despite what we would consider being peak period the hotel seemed quiet which is probably down to its size because at breakfast almost all of the 30 outdoor tables were taken. There are plenty of options for breakfast and dinner in the bufe style restaurant although despite the array and presentation the quality was not quite 5 not far off though. All staff we encountered were polite smiley and spoke to us in English how could they tell. it is a beautiful building clinically clean throughout and the Spa is a real gem. Excellent quality if not a little pricey. The gym is full of top quality equipment and we were among only a handful who seemed to use it which was even beterBarcelona is a 40minute car journey down the toll road around \u00a3 6 I had guess. although we took the double decker train for \u20ac 5 per person each way. It took an hour because of the 7 or so stops but the train line runs adjacent to the coast and even passes a couple of nudist beachesWe are fans of quality hotels and Le Meridien Ra has plenty going for it. So much so that with a sub2 hour flight time from the UK it might just become an ideal long weekend option.", "offset": [1914, 1987], "date": "2015-06-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "1e10fa45-f26e-4eb1-b058-39690576b3e5", "sentence": "Average hotel.

Very nice but maintenance again a problem with broken sun loungers and mosquitoes splattered on the walls.

Arrived in the evening and greated with a glass of cava. Nice touch. Staff was friendly and helpful straight away. Our room was lovely. Clean spacious with a balcony looking at the see. The room was quite and did not get really hot overnight which was great. Made for a good night sleep. Wetried the roof top pool and the spa both of which were lovely. Great facilities. The gym was well equipped and quite big for a hotel gym. Shame there is no pictures of it on the website as it is really good. Breakfast was great good variety of food and great sitting outside looking at the see. Private beach right in front of the hotel so it is really convenient. we have also had lunch in the a la carte restaurant which was cooked well. Fresh seafood cooked perfectly and personalised smoothies. The staff was really friendly and helpful throughout our stay. If I had to pick fault I would mention that they charge for bottled water \u20ac 450 per bottle which is carzy considering that in the shop about 10 minutes walk down the road sells 15 L bottles for \u20ac 045. But that is hotels for you. the only other negative was the taxi back to Barcelona. The hotel called one for us which was great saying they can add it to the room and we can pay now so we do not have to pay the driver at the end. we have paid \u20ac 140 but when we got to our hotel in Barcelona the clock on the taxi only came to \u20ac 91. so we were overcharged nearly \u20ac 50 which is a lot.", "offset": [385, 449], "date": "2015-07-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "88c74dca-16b2-4d88-9d3d-644eb40e071e", "sentence": "Stunningly perfect in every detail. My partner I stayed here in early July for 5 nights which by chance also took in my birthday which was a nice way to celebrate. We were warmly welcomed on arrival with a glass of chilled cava whilst we checked in. We were blown away by the sheer size and space of the entrance which along with the rest of the complex just exudes a distinctive designer quality with precision and minimalism. There are some excellent examples of Salvador Dali artwork situated in various locations for you to admire. All the staff were very friendly helpful and courteous at all times. They made us feel valued and special. We had a deluxe room with a balcony and sea view which was very spacious and comfortable with a super king size bed. One thing we would recommend is to ask for a tea coffee tray as this along with a kettle is not a normal feature in the room. The food was just divine even when we attended the buffet and the breakfasts were simply a gastronomic delight. The bar and public areas are spotlessly clean airy and comfortable and again the staff are on hand pampering to your every whim. My partner enjoyed a massage in the spa treatment area and said it was one of the best she had ever had. This is a resort of the highest quality and I can not commend it enough. Expensive but indulgent and hugely enjoyable. They have their own private beach where you can enjoy loungers with shade umbrellas all serviced by waiters and alongside there is a lovely cafe bar. There are two pools both rooftop one of which is part of the spa centre is an amazing experience. Go there and be blown away you will love it and like us you will want to come back.

We stayed here last week for 5 days following a 3 day city break in Barcelona. We got the train from Barcelona PGratia direct to calafel in aprox. 50 short minutes. This cost us 5 euros each. Much cheaper than the 135 Euro Taxi fare we were quoted. We got a taxi from Calafel train station as we were not sure where the hotel was located. This cost us 10 Euros. It is easy to walk if you are able. Just cross the road infront of the station and head down towards the sea. Turn right and walk along the promenade to the hotel. 10 minsThe hotel itself is really lovely and the reception staff are very helpful. I would say that it would have been useful to receive a map of the hotel as we were unsure of where everything was as it is abit spread about. We had a good walk around and found our bearings. We spent many days lounging up on the Spa Deck inside pool. This was lovely. However on one particularly hot day they could have done with more sun loungers as these were all full one afternoon and it was abit awkward lurking around waiting for people to leave so we could immediately occupy their beds. Although if you come down earlier in the day this is not a problem. I am not sure what this situation is like in high season. Most mornings we had the whole terrace area to ourselves. We also spent a day at the outside pool on another roof terrace. This was lovely too. The pool was very cold though. More sun loungers here. The beach was lovely and Mustafa was there to look after you and you could reserve sun beds at a cost if you wanted the front row or a pavilion bed. 35 euros for front row sunloungers and 70 euros for a pavilion bed. Other beds some without shade umbrella were FOC first come first served. We were half board. The breakfast was very nice with plenty of choice hot and cold. I would not recommend the restaurant on the beach. Very overpriced and bland. Evening buffet meal Plenty of choice so always found something I could eat. Very Spanish but you should expect that being in Spain. My palette is more vegetarian and simple so others may enjoy it more than myself. Drinks are not included at Dinner as you would expect being half board. However water is 6 Euros a bottle. This was not chargable at breakfast along with other fresh juices. The cleaners did an amazing job and our room was cleaned to a really high standard every day and always replenished with Fresh towels etc. The bed was enormous and we are used to a superking. Very comfortable too. Air conditioning quiet and adequate. There are plenty of restaurants along the promenade. we tried Burg6 and it was really lovely. We also ate at the Italian next door to this and this was lovely too. Shops are located in the side streets off the main promenade. Nice to stroll around and shop early in the evening to walk off your dinner. All in all we had a lovely time and would like to return again. We got the train from Calafel to Sants and then the Metro to Barcelona Airport. This was simple enough. Airport signs were the most difficult but we allowed plenty of time and it all worked out. Again 5 euros each for the whole journey by train to the airport. Good Metro connection from platform 9 well signposted.
