My family and I have been traveling to Cancun and staying at what was originally the Gran Melia and is now the Paradisus Cancun for the last 15 years. The resort just gets better every year and not just because of upgrades but because of the fantastic staff. We have had the pleasure of being pampered by Luis Cortez at the pool and beach. Rody Sonia and Angel at Mole restaurant. These are just some of the many fine people working and tending to the needs of guests. For the last 3 years we have gone for our wedding anniversary and find the room ready with champagne chocolates and rose petals every where. The beach as always is beautiful even this year with all the seaweed the staff at the Paradisus found away to make everything enjoyable. This year we also went for the 16th of September independence celebration. It was a total joy to be with the people of Mexico and help celebrate their independence day. The Paradisus not only had a great party but respected the culture and history of Mexico.

I had a great experience staying at Paradisus Cancun. It is a beautiful high quality resort with an incredible staff. First off our room was a Junior suite which was a good size for two people and everything inside was in good shape. Housekeeping is very responsive and mini fridge is stocked daily. Every room has a hot tub outside on balcony. Also the location of the resort was great. it is on the southern half of the boulevard where all the hotels are farther away from the nightlife in the north. I liked this because it was more quiet and peaceful. However it is still a quick and cheap bus ride 1 US dollar person for bus to the north part where you can go shopping and go to clubs. Paradisus Cancun is also across the street from the water sporting place AquaWorld which is convenient if you sign up for any of those activities. The food at the buffet and at the restaurants inside the resort was phenomenal. there is a lot of variety and I think it is the best food I have ever had. The drinks are very good and there are some special tequila shots they make too. The people who work at Paradisus Cancun made my experience truly memorable. These were the friendliest people I have ever met and are genuinely so. They got to know us a bit throughout our stay and even joked around with us a bit too completely within a professional capacity though. Some of them even learned our names and greeted us namely. It is evident that they care about their guests and that they like talking to people.

The setting. You are a 20minute drive from the airport and a 10minute walk some of the best lagoon facing restaurants in Cancun Porfirio \u2019s Fred \u2019s Puerto Madero. There is a convenience store and pharmacy right across the road from the entrance to the hotel. The resort is a massive structure of five Mayan esque pyramids. The one in the center is the largest and functions as the main reception area for regular hotel guests. The lobby entrance is impressive as this is the largest pyramid. The massive open space is nicely accentuated by a plethora of pathos plants hanging off each floor. There is a lounge bar with an awesome view of the sea and many restaurants including the main buffet off this lobby. If you are arriving in a taxi or a shuttle the main entrance is where you will be dropped off. If you rented a car and you can drop it off at the main entrance for the complimentary valet to park it. If you are a Club Melia guest you will be staying in the first smaller pyramid which has its own parking lot and entrance. If you are arriving prior to 11 pm you can park here and access your room much easier instead of parking in Pyramid three and walking through two pyramids to get there. Pyramid five is the exclusive adults only pyramid. The spa is located on the ground level of pyramid four. We are Club Melia members so we parked directly in front of pyramid one and our check in was smooth. I was expecting to have to battle with reception staff to get a sea facing room which is an incredible view as we usually get lagoon facing rooms with a view of the parking lot and the road but with gorgeous sunset views but we were assigned a studio with an amazing sea view so I was pleasantly surprised relieved. The room. Ours was a studio with a decently sized bathroom tiled with natural stone. The bathroom had a tub with a rain shower head. The tub drained slowly and the water pressure was weak in the shower. The toilet and bidet were behind a sliding door. The room had a stocked kitchen with a microwave and a range. There was coffee maker with complimentary coffee but no milk or sugar. There was also no tea. There were water bottles and an empty fridge as we did n\u2019t opt for the all inclusive package. Housekeeping will not replenish your water unles you opt into the all inclusive deal. There is complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby area of the Club Melia Pyramid but this gets taken away in the evening. If you want to enjoy a cup of tea in the evening in your room make sure to grab some tea bags and cups during the day. We had a king size bed in the room and the bedding and mattress were comfortable. There was a dining room table in the room as well as a small sofa. The flat panel TV hung opposite the bed but channels in English are limited there was n\u2019t CN for example. The WiFi was free and worked great at night but was sluggish to non existent during the day when resort \u2019s guests are simultaneously using it. The air conditioner worked well in the room. Our balcony had an amazing view of the sea and came equipped with a chair a sun lounger as well as a large jetted tub. The food. We never opt for the all inclusive as it \u2019s a poor value if you are a couple without kids. The restaurants in Cancun are excellent and a great dinner will never exceed 50 60 person. We ended up eating breakfast at the resort \u2019s buffet which is not a terrible value at 23 person and is convenient. For lunch which drove out to a local taco stand or took advantage of the small free lunch buffet offered on Saturdays in the Club Melia Pyramid \u2019s lobby. I would only opt in for the all inclusive package if I were staying with kids for convenience. The pool beach. The resorts has large pools for regular guests an exclusive Royal Service pool area with Bali beds a pricey beach club area which no one was using and a pool and beach area for Club Melia guests. There were a lot of children in the main and the Club Melia pools so prepared for the noise. If you are Club Melia guest you can reserve a Bali bed either beachside or polside. These are ideal if you love the beach but not the intense sun. You get your first day free and subsequent days are 10 person. These Bali beds cabanas are upholstered in a towel like material with plenty of cushions. There is a foot was at the entry to each polside Bali bed. The polside Bali beds also have electrical outlets and USB ports for easy charging of your electronics. There is drinks service offered frequently polside and less frequently beachside. If you prefer both the beach and the pool then opt for Bali beds 7 10 as these are closest to the stairs leading to the beach and farthest from the shrieking children in the pool. The beach has soft white sand and the water is crystal clear but the wind is strong and so are the waves at least during the month of March. Lifeguards at the beach herd swimmers into a shallow sand bar area which is handy for safeguarding swimmers but is annoying for the swimmers as this is a very shallow area. The water temperature is refreshing and comfortable but not too warm. All in all this property keeps improving but is still no match for true Paradisus branded resorts like in Dominican Republic or Playa del Carmen. It \u2019s impossible to retrofit an older Gran Melia into a modern Paradisus. The small improvements like electrical outlets in the polside Bali beds are a step in the right direction. Customer service in the Club Melia Pyramid could improve very much so. First of all when guests arrive even late like us and ask for some tea bags to make tea these should be quickly brought to the room. Instead the reception staff who checked us in suggested we try for tea the next day or order room service at 5 cup. If the resort supplies complimentary coffee beans in the room they should also supply tea bags sugar and milk. There is no reason why complimentary water bottles are not replenished for Club Melia guests who do n\u2019t opt into the all inclusive package. The resort should redesign all inclusive to bed and breakfast or breakfast and lunch only allowing guests to leave the resort for great restaurants nearby. We had a butler assigned to our room Bryant but he never even made an appearance during our long weekend stay. I would stay here again only because it \u2019s a good value if you have some options that are expiring.", "offset": [542, 641], "date": "2018-03-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "1cdfafa7-838c-439e-ade5-556fee670534", "sentence": "Excellent services staff ambiance restaurants.

The check in was fairly quick and straightforward although we felt a little rushed. We took our time to ask questions about dining options pool reservations and other amenities.

The dinner reservations were hassle free you will need to dial up guest services and make a reservation. Breakfast was good lots of options to choose from. For dining they had mexican latin asian sushi continental Mediterranean tapas style and much more. Apart from these there were espresso gelato booths lounges and beach club too. The pool was huge and well maintained. There are shows every night to entertain the visitors. There is plenty of lounge pool chairs near the pool and on the beaches.

We were very pleased with our butler Galdino as he was always in communication and helping us with reservations and making sure our stay was wonderful. We spent most of our time in the large royal service pool because the ocean had quite a bit of seaweed. I would recommend bringing your own inflatable as the resort does not provide pool floats.

The only music was that of another customer. Overall loved the pool and had no problem getting chairs and drinks were good and never ending. Beach was beautiful but rough so we only went down for a few pics. Pretty laid back place in the evenings. Noticed most were in bed by 10. We enjoyed both clubs all three evenings.

The amenities were not up to the Paradisus Playa Del Carmen resort but the pool and the friendliness was better in many ways. We decided to go back this past October with our friends and it was fantastic. They have made some significant improvements to the restaurants and the atmosphere was even more relaxing. We all had a great time and enjoyed most of the restaurants. We all had favorites but we went to Fuego Enzos and Blue Agave twice during our 8 night stay. We also enjoyed Mole and Vento try the octopus at either restaurant. We also went to The Market which was also fabulous but we did not try this out until late in our trip and they were not open again while we were there. Our service was always phenomenal and we would happily go back again. We just need to decide when and for how long. In particular we are thankful for Jose Meh and Claudia Ariola with Club Melia for their help throughout our stay and wish them the best.

Our stay was 6 nights around Christmas at the Paradisus Cancun. We had an oceanfront suite in Tower 3 and the view was to die forWe spent the first day exploring the facilities. The layout of restaurants pools and bars is excellent. Customer service was fantastic anyplace we went. The staff was courteous and seemed to like going out of their way to appease us in spite of the fact that we were a large group of four families. In particular Rodrigo and Arne were super helpful in putting together activities for us to do and accompanying us to a few of those. Lucia was very friendly and everyone had fun with her Latin dance classes. The rooms and facilities were very clean and not once did we find a restroom or any public facility dirty. Now for some of the poorer experiences we had Some of the restaurants needed reservations most were booked solid and we had to wake up 7 am every morning to try get a table. Granted we were a group of 16 but even splitting up into 4 groups did little to help. A friend traveling with his girlfriend said he had trouble getting a table of two. A unified online reservation system would go a long way in making this experience smooth. Getting up early in the morning to make reservations is not my idea of a vacation. One of the poorer customer service situations we experienced were with the hosts of Bana the sushi restaurant. Here we could not even make reservations in advance we had to stand in line starting at 6 pm and wait if until we got a table. We had some back and forth arguments with one of the hosts who basically asked us to leave because tw of the people at our table were still en route to the restaurant. This kind of attitude is probably expected at restaurants with a Michelin star not something in an all inclusive resort. That said the food we ate there was really good the customer service left a bad taste. The tennis courts were empty the gym was well equipped would have been incredible if there were windows with views the classes were great our botcamp class was with Rodrigo. the guy wears so many hats. We played a lot of water polo the drinks were not watered down. the tamarind mojitos margaritas were amazing and the breakfast buffets had an unthinkable amount of variety. Some of the members in our group were vegetarian and they did not complain about the choice at all. In summary would highly recommend staying at the Paradisus.

We choose this time and location due to the desire to travel with friends who are owners. Our reservation was for a King room on the ocean side. When we checked in there were not any king rooms available. After seeing a few options we opted to keep our room and have the beds put together. The first two nights were wonderful. On the 3rd day a group of 60 conference attendees arrived. During lunch the entire group came into the buffet at the same time and took over the restaurant. They removed plates from tables that were occupied in order to be able to be seated. Granted this was not their problem as the hotel and the conference planner should have had the fore site to accommodate the attendees while avoiding interruption for the hotel guests. The conference attendees were rude and pushed hotel guests out of the way in order to get their food first. we decided to let this go and move on. However that evening the Red Lounge which stays open until 20 AM stepped it up a notch to entertain the attendees. As mentioned before we had no issues the first two nights despite being in building 3 which is where the clubs are located. The first night that the attendees were present the DJ turned it up and the attendees were so disruptive that we complained. The manager on duty Alejandro chose to do nothing despite the fact that the concierge admitted that they were trying to get the music turned down and the security guard said it was out of control. Alejandro was rude and dismissive to us as we are females. The following morning we were moved to an owner building and given bracelets which allowed us to go to the adults only portion of the resort. The front desk admitted the situation was handled poorly. This would have been great but our travel companions owners did not have the same privileges so we did not partake in the benefits with the exception of being moved to a more quiet building. Thinking that all the inconvenience was behind us we went about our way meeting other guests owners and enjoying the resort. One challenge is tipping all the wait staff and we were running out of pesos. I had previously gone to the concierge and converted dollars to pesos. Knowing that the staff appreciate american dollars I went to concierge and attempted to break 200 bills into smaller amounts to tip the staff. I was informed that I needed to check with the bellhop or bar staff. the bellhop did not have enough so I asked front desk to again convert dollars to pesos. I was informed by Guadalupe that i would need to go downstairs in order to do so. Mind you we had already done it at the desk as had our friends. In my frustration I returned to Bana where we were eating dinner and the manager noticing my frustration immediately was able to get me smaller american dollars. The next day I went to the front desk and brought the situation to their attention. The day manager was out ill so they said they would take it up with her the next day and let me know what the plan was. Today Friday. we went to the front desk and after several go rounds with Margarita were informed that because we signed off for an upgrade on the noise level that nothing more would be done. We were also informed that they were having trouble with the front desk staff and that the general manager was addressing it. Neither the manager nor the general manager contacted us nor have they made any efforts to address the situation. I was a previous owner at ME Cabo and can tell you that I would not recommend the resort to anyone until the management and front desk staff get their stuff in order and figure out that customer service means putting the customer first. Before any nay sayers respond this is my 7th stay at a Melia resort I paid full price and have confirmed with the owners we are traveling with as well as the ones we have met that this is not appropriate.", "offset": [190, 249], "date": "2019-01-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "a0f12bb7-fb76-4813-b17d-4c5be00b1b14", "sentence": "Good value Service.

Walking in was very lovely with a smell and vibe of a spa inclusive of cold fragrant towels to wash your face upon arrival. We were taken to the check in the area until that our room would not be ready until three. They went over the policies of the resort and then you meet with a resort planner to tell you about the restaurants and such. It was at this time that we found out that three of the restaurants were closed. They asked if we were celebrating anything so we share we were celebrating my birthday which is this month. We went to the taco quesadilla place for lunch only to find out that if you \u2019re vegetarian your only choice is cheese. They only offer pork chicken or beef. The beans are not vegetarians he can not have that. We looked on the site before coming here and there is zero mention of any renovations or construction. But I \u2019l put arrival we found out that three of the restaurants we could \u2019ve used are closed for renovations. When we spoke with Margarita she told us that it was on the website which we went back on the website to confirm that it actually was not listed as having any construction she was quite defensive with us and kept telling us that it was posted on the website but in fact it is not. When we finally got to our room the door was broken into the balcony so hot air it was flowing in as well as water. We tried to have air conditioning compensate her but it was impossible. We call downstairs six different times asking to be changed to a different room. Keep in mind we were told a check and that they were only at 40 occupancy so we know that there are other rooms available. They sent to people from housekeeping and one person for me except they never shared with us what was happening. Finally during the six calls we spoke to said she would get somebody to move us in 45 minutes. At that hour we called and they were told that they were on our way it was another 15 minutes before anyone showed up. Unfortunately could n\u2019t do much on the resort because we needed to wait to get to our room and get everything settled. The new room was bright and well appointed with perfect air conditioning. There is a small step to get into the bathroom. This is a major fall risk and horrible trip hazard. But we had wasted three hours of her first day which was not appropriate. When we went to talk to Margarita about it she made it as if she did it a favor to ask by changing our room. We explained that we paid for with air conditioning and so really just change our room was not doing us a favor. It started to get a little heated which was also inappropriate. She asked what we could do for us and we asked if we could have dinner in the upscale restaurant and we were told that it was not for us only for private guests. We tried to explain that we we \u2019re not asking for a discount in the room she did n\u2019t even offer an upgrade or a free massage or a free cabana on the beach or anything just to make the reservations for dinner that night in a restaurant that was included. She offered an upgrade towards the end but at that point we had already moved and did not want to do it again. We went to the sushi restaurant which was not good and then went to moly the specialty Mexican restaurant. I \u2019m sure if you eat some of the items there it would be great but if you \u2019re a vegetarian it \u2019s very limited. Also on the vegetarian menu is grilled grasshoppers. And my book that is not going to work. We ended up going to the buffet which was lackluster. The next morning we got up had breakfast in the downstairs restaurant which was buffet style but good. Of note the omelette has a large selection but be careful to ask for a little cheese otherwise you will have an enormous amount. If you like that then you \u2019re in the right spot. There was no cocktails offered at breakfast which was strange being in an all inclusive resort. We came out to the pool looking for a towel service as we had that cards to get towels but could not find where to get them. Once we finally figure that out we asked where there was a bar. There is no bar open before 11 AM. You have to go to the buffet and ask for a drink there. I guess this is one of the ways that they save money by not having to serve alcohol. I \u2019m not saying you need to drink your entire day away but on vacation having a bloody Mary Mamosa or margarita in the morning would be nice. But that is not available here. We were approached by someone in for a massage telling us that it \u2019s normally 140 for a 50 minute massage but today only you could get it for 90. Since there were three of us we asked to get it for 80 each. She came back inside now. Again not trying to be cheap about it but if you \u2019re telling me you only have 40 occupancy and that you have tons of openings then work with us or say hey for the 90 we can throw in an extra five or 10 minutes but they do nothing of that here. We have been to Moon Palace Nizuk dreams and they are significantly better with food service and beauty. We were told Market Grill was open for breakfast it is not. It is open for lunch. Manuel has been the best service person here. Very attentive and friendly. There is a gelato place but it closes before 10pm. RealyOveral if you were looking for a budget friendly clean hotel this is it. If you \u2019ve been anywhere else that is truly five start this will not meet your standards. I would give it a two star.", "offset": [3811, 3906], "date": "2019-09-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "3012e6ce-8ea2-442d-bf51-32549a1a301e", "sentence": "Beautiful Beach. Downhill Fast From There. Let me preface this review by saying this was our 7th different all inclusive 6 in Cancun Playa del Carmen 1 in Punta Cana. This our first trip without the entire family. People giving this place 5star reviews apparently do nt stay at many high end resorts. This place is in no way worthy of 5stars. THE GOOD The beach is the best we ve ever been. The resort is extremely wide and the water was stunningly turquoise blue. We got lucky as there was no seaweed at all during our stay. Unfortunately that s where the good ends. Ladies beware there are 4 toilets total on the entire beach two at each end of the main area. None of them are well maintained. THE BAD. Food The food was without question the worst of any resort we ve ever been. Their best restaurant was on par with most of the bad we ve had at other resorts. Nothing seemed cooked fresh. Everything is cooked into large lots and stored in open areas and is cold by the time it s served. When it reaches your table buffet nothing was hot or even warm. When we checked in the staff touted how the buffet was all new and the food was improved. The wife and i were starving so we headed there to check it out. We were shocked at the limited selections to choose from and the lack of cooked to order selections. Most food items were empty every time we ate the buffet mostly breakfast so we stood around expecting a replacement. Nope. So i asked. Out came food. COLD EGGS COLD BEEF COLD CHICKEN. It was ridiculous. The next three nights we tried a la carte. It tasted like they pulled the food off the buffet put it onto a plate and served it up. Nothing was hot like you d expect from an a la carte. Most people go to a higher end all inclusive for good food. This is not one of those resorts. BALI BEDS are 160 day. That s right 160 day. and the bed itself is hard as a rock. DO NOT reserve one on the beach. There s a large double stack of speakers at each end of the bali bed setup and the DJ plays music aldaylong. and it s LOUD. Think Metalica concert loud. Not an exaggeration. POLSIDE SEATING. There just is nt even close to enough seating around the pools. There s not even close to enough polside seating for this resort. We were told the resort was at 80 capacity and there were people sitting all over the concrete and in the grass areas. and that was at 11 am in the morning. There is very limited shade umbrellas for the chairs and no small tables to hold your drinks. I felt so badly for people arriving each day at noon not finding a single chair just to put their stuff. I m not sure but i m thinking this is on purpose to get people to rent their 160 day bali beds. POOL BAR had 1 bartender each day we were there. There d be 20 people at the swim up area and 1 bartender so waiting for a drink was excruciating. Drinks were stiff however so there s that. ROOMS. The rooms are TINY. It was just my wife and I and we barely fit. They are extremely clean however might have been the 5 day we left housekeeping. DO NOT stay in the main tower. It is loud. Music blared up from the all night bands DJ s well into 1 20am. We were awoken many times. kinda like a frat party. lol. Overall there are so many other places that cost about the same that are much better. Moon Palace Hilton Play del Carmen and even Paradisus Play del Carmen come to mind. Save the frustration and book elsewhere.", "offset": [781, 862], "date": "2020-01-25", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "11524fd5-a6ec-4fea-8aff-a9725be12ba4", "sentence": "The Worst Experience. Save Your Time Money. Something is fishy about this resort and their ethics. Was here with a large group for an event and they claimed that we had not paid for our rooms therefore we could not check in. Sometimes there is a mix up in communications which I can understand but this was a complete and utter lack of morals and hospitality. We had full documentation from our bank that we did in fact pay for the rooms and all the front desk could tell us was that their bank had lost the money. We waited 7 hours trying to resolve this issue but since this resorts bank is in Spain there was nothing they could do. They insisted the only way to resolve was to pay in full again and they had try to find the money tomorrow. So being that we were a large group from out of the country without a place to sleep we paid for a single night. The next morning the staff we were speaking with the day before would not even speak directly with us to try and keep resolving. We ended up finding last minute rooms at the resort next door and it was 10000 more accommodating and our trip ended up being fantastic.", "offset": [515, 634], "date": "2020-03-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}]}
