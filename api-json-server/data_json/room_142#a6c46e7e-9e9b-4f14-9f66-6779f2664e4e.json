This one was recommended by my parents and we were not disappointed. There are plenty of food choices around the rooms were clean the free breakfast was great and the beds were comfy. The only issue we had was when we went by car to the shell gas station around the corner. When we first pulled up there was a guy in a white pickup leaving and when we were leaving the same pickup came back in front of us and before the pickup came to a stop another guy jumped out and started coming toward us and kind waving like he wanted something. Not being from anywhere near this town there was no way he needed something from us and he was old enough to buy his own alcohol and cigarettes so it was strange that he was coming at us like that. I am not sure how safe this area is because of what we experienced but it was just strange.

The room included typical amenities like hair dryer shampoo etc but also included a microwave and refrigerator. Even though our room was just two doors away from the ice maker we found it quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included and had quite a few items including hot eggs and ham as well as oatmeal. There was also fresh fruit and pastries. Being there on the weekend the dining area was very crowded and not as relaxed as we wished but no one could help this. Parking was handy with lots available near the front door.

There were dogs next to my daughters room that barked continuously. The land line phone in my room did not have a cord to plug into the wall. The carpet was coming apart at the seams. The patio chairs were absolutely thread bear. This hotel is no doubt an older one but there is no excuse for the above complaints. The ONY positive that I can say about this hotel is the staff.

There is mold in the shower tub area gross. The room thermostat would not hold a temperature. The hotel does not have a guest laundry not all of them do but that would have been a nice thing. Instead I had to schlep my clothes to a laundromat and spend 6 for one load. I was just surprised that it was not up to the brands standards and wonder if Hampton has inspectors that visit properties to ensure they are meeting the Hilton standard.

Breakfast was consistent with other Hampton Inns as good as you would expect for being complimentary. About 10 minutes from downtown and UK. A little challenging to get to if you are arriving from the west side of Lexington. Would definitely return. The only problem we had was that our digital key did not work and the ap stated we had been checked out prior to our arrival. This could have had something to do with our very late arrival 230 am but fortunately the staff still had the reservation and the same room available. The next day the ap did not work for check out.

Not a huge deal but seemingly unnecessary as the hotel was not full. Our room overlooked what appears to be the outdoor break area for employees and every so often our room would begin to smell of cigarette smoke. Unfortunately we noticed this when everyone was already in pjs and ready for bed and we were exhausted from traveling. I always bring a floor fan and we out the kids in the bed furthest from the window. They both have asthma. Luckily the fan helped a lot. The water from the sink was either scalding hot of freezing. The handle did not work well so no happy medium and then surprisingly the next morning no hot water in the shower. I brought both of these issues to the attention of the front desk. The gentlemen did say that our room was overlooking the designated smoking area. I commented that it seemed like a bad choice to put an Honors member there and he looked at me like I was crazy.
