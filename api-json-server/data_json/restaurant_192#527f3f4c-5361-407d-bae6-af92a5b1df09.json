However the parking attendants were great about letting me get my car out and then allowing me to leave it at the curb intermittently while we ran back into the hotel for a quick change or grab something from our room. We loved the rooftop lounge for an afternoon snack my daughters are not old enough to patronize at night but it was also the source of our only complaints about this terrific property. One being that we were forced to wait in line for the elevators behind large groups of tourists going to the lounge while we were trying to get to our expensive. room. The other complaint being the noise that comes from the lounge until late night which made it hard to sleep. In general great location good service but needs to decide whether want to be a great hotel or a happening lounge as right now the two are not totally compatible.

Two of the four nights I spent at the hotel on the 10th floor there was SO MUCH NOISE from the employees of the POV restaurant bar sliding tables across the floor above me at all times of the night. The first time it happened I finally called the front desk after midnight and asked if anything could be done because I had a conference early the next morning and I needed to get some sleep. The guy that answered the phone apologized and said he would send security up to the POV to remind them that they were supposed to lift the tables not drag them across the floor and the problem was solved. The second time it happened 021420. I called the front desk and spoke to a lady that told me there was nothing that she could do because the POV was busy and they had events planned that night until around 020 the following morning so I was out of luck. I asked if they could just pick up the tables and not slide them. I was told NO. No apologies nothing. I asked if she could find me another room and I was finally relocated to the fourth floor which solved the problem. With the POV being on the floor above I imagine that there are a lot of complaints from people like myself trying to use the space as a hotel to sleep in. It was so frustrating. The POV was OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED. 99 for dinner for one with appetizer dinner dessert and 20 tip. I ordered the surf and surf entree for dinner which included two small crab cakes and four very large shrimp. When the dish arrived they had forgotten the shrimp.
