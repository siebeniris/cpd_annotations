The bathroom was finejust a shower that was okbut the amenities were heavily scented rose maybe. so I opted not to use their shampoo conditioner shower gel. Hilton Honors members received free WIFI.

When I visited Easton before I stayed about 10 12 minutes away at a beautiful Embassy Suites. It was far less expensive than the Hilton but I did not want to deal with the drive back and forth this time. It is just a question of whether one wants to pay more for the convenience of staying onsite. I was able to check in early on Friday. around 1 pm. and being a Hilton member received a late checkout on Saturday of 2 pm. Both check in and check out went seamlesly. My room was beautiful up to date and spotless. two comfortable queen beds with nice linens pillows etc a spacious and well equipped bathroom with a large shower but no tub not uncommon these days plenty of storage space. a big flatscren television well placed and functional lighting. My room was very very quiet even though it overlooked the front entrance driveway parking lot etc. I do wish the in room cofemaker was of a higher quality it was of the nature that one would find in a Motel 8 or someplace comparable.

All but about 50 feet of that was INSIDE. There is valet parking if requested. Otherwise the parking lot in front of the hotel or the parking garage on the side has ample place to park.

We envisaged returning after shopping on a very cold day and sitting by the fireplace in the lounge to enjoy a cocktail. However the public areas were still under construction and there was only a temporary bar and dining area. We decided to go to the bar for a drink although it did not look like a comfortable area. We sat at the bar and waited to be served but we were ignored by the two people behind the bar. We took our coats off and made ourselves comfortable but no one attempted to serve us so we left.

Check in valet and bellhop were all great. Room was nice large comfortable we were in 642 \u2013. junior suite I believe. Cleaning service was great the entire time. Only issue with the room is that it was HOT. Several of my colleagues said similar things about their rooms. Thermostat was set to 68 and read 73. We turned it down to 64 and it still did nothing. I think there was only one tiny corner vent in the room. Sleeping was pretty uncomfortable. We meant to say something the second night but it got late and two had fallen asleep so we never did until checkout. The location is excellent. Bartenders were great and attentive. My main issue was the food service staff. the meals were mediocre at best. I host a lot of events at hotels and I \u2019ve seen much better. The plated lunch we had one day that consisted of soup and salad took FOREVER. The tomato soup was cold. The chicken Cesar salad was just not good. Service was slow. Then the plates breakfast the last day was a bad experience also. Food was n\u2019t good. But what was most strange was that the servers were serving guests as soon as they arrived at their table or so it appeared as people were arriving at different times. My friend and I sat there for ten min with no food. Our roommates joined us and then we sat there another 15 min so 25 altogether and had to ask for our breakfast they had plenty of breakfast plates covered and waiting on the side. Then they serve my friend and I our plates. We did n\u2019t want to start eating until everyone was served but our roommates never got their plates. We told one guy they needed them. He brought one and said he needed to get more. He comes back with a tray of fresh plated breakfasts then proceeds to distribute them to other tables. we tell another lady and she kind of ignored us until we finally asked AGAIN and she said \u201c oh they need breakfast too \u201d.
