Anyone reading reviews knows the Mayfair is under renovation. The result is that things are erratic. My room was on the top floor and had been renovated it was a cute room and they let me check in early. All good. Except I did not have towels and when I turned down the bed the blanket had a LOT not just a few. long black hairs all over it and the second morning they did not actually va cum the carpet. They were cheerful about bringing towels and a clean blanket so it worked out but it was not great. On Sunday they left a note saying the water would be off all day Monday starting at 9. They gave me a price break on the room when I pointed out that if their renovations had a negative effect it should be absorbed by the owners who will eventually benefit rather than by the customers who will not.

Not familiar with downtown LA I booked this hotel because it appeared to be close to the hotel where my convention was held and at 12 the price. What I did n\u2019t know is the area north of 110 is pretty seedy. Contrary to the advertising they do not offer a breakfast. The nearest place is a 10 minute walk through a homeless encampment. Needless to say you need to forgo walking and take Uber or Lyft for your safety when going to and from this property. My room was small like New York small and had a peculiar layout. There was no place to put luggage. The bed which was comfortable was accessible from just one side. The bathroom was nicely modernized always had hot water but was without a normal door. When I booked the hotel it listed a fitness room which is really important to me. There is no fitness room. I visited a nearby gym at a cost of 23 a day gym fee and Uber rides. I asked to be reimbursed for this cost and was denied. The lobby of the hotel turns into a lively party room at night so request a high floor if you are a light sleeper. On a positive note the restaurant and espresso shop were excellent and the staff was very friendly.

There are endless photo opportunities both indoor and outdoor all over the property. Even inside the lighting was perfect due to large windows and skylights throughout. The hotel has a beautiful Old Hollywood Great Gatsby vibe that really came through in the photos. Not only was the venue stunning the staff and event team was so organized professional and timely. They made sure the bride and groom were well taken care of all night. At one point the bartender even brought them drinks while we were taking photos which was the perfect break and added an elegant touch to the images. Spencer event manager was so responsive leading up to the wedding and very easy to work with.
