We were lucky to stay in a beachfront suite it was an amazing position a great size with beautiful modern bathroom and wrap around balcony bright airy with good quality furnishings. Only downside was as others have said the beds are very hard much as this may be preferred by some we did not find them very comfortable. Mosquitos are rife so room has to be sprayed every day we did have to ask to have this done feel should have been done as standard. Pool although small was lovely with comfortable loungers very attentive staff who could not do enough for you so well done to all the pool boys. Excellent breakfast in lovely position in rekata rst looking on to beach also ate here most evenings food very good but service at times a bit chaotic often not that attentive it seemed some of the serving staff were very inexperienced. No reflection on the hotel but the area of kata lacks any real quality bars and very few nice resturants hence we ate mostly in the hotel. Lovely clean beach but does get very busy most dayswas very shocked at the rudeness of some of the Russian visitors but thankfully none in this hotel.", "offset": [288, 425], "date": "2015-01-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3498f4d9-ad72-454e-876f-7389b2d53f18", "sentence": "99 perfect Stayed for 4 nights at the marvellous Boathouse hotel in the Montara Suite their penthouse suite. The room was truly immaculate and such a privilege to enjoy such a beautiful room in such a beautiful location. The hotel facilities are also amazing. The pool area particularly is superbHad only one gripe and it was service related. On our last night we enjoyed a beer from a local vendor on the beach and watched the sun go down. We then all came up to the hotel pool to order cocktails. We were served by a lady named Oil. I asked her for what we wanted and I was told that only hotel guests may use the pool. So I said we were hotel guests. She did not believe me. She asked me my room number to which i replied 401 and this only furthered her disbelief. I assured her we were guests but she still would not believe me. She did however go and fetch the 6 cocktails we had ordered. We were all in the pool on the bean bags when she brought the cocktails. She put them on a table next to the pool. We got up and brought the cocktails onto the bean bags. She then came running over and was extremely rude to us because a we were not hotel guests and b. we were not allowed glass in the pool. Now I have no problem with the latter. A simple sorry but we do not allow glass in the pool please use these plastic cups which she had brought would have been perfect. Anyway I ignored her rudeness and carried on relaxing in the pool with cocktail in plastic cup in hand. Later on I asked her to bring me the bill. I got out of the pool to come and sign it but she flat refused to give it to me. Instead she ran past me with my hand outstretched and gave it to a colleague of mine who was in another room which I was also paying forJust weird. Anyway the hotel is lovely. The rest of the staff especially Siriporn in bookings were all super helpful. Oil needs to learn some guest etiquette tho.

Spent 5 days4nights at the Boathouse in August with my wife and loved it. Glad we chose this hotel. Its directly on the sandy beach and has 2 pools on site too. You will not be doing lengths in these pool but just chilling out on the floating beanbags. The hotel has a very relaxed and chilled out atmosphere. Friendly staff are well trained and always there to support you with a smile. Even the Management can be seen moving among the guests and talking to them ensuring everything is going well. a nice touchdo not forget you 20V electric plug converter. No 3 pin square UK Malay plugs in the rooms. But you can buy the convertors locally too. Breakfast was included in our package and worth it. Good selection and great service from staff. There was a small continental buffet fresh fruits Juices yogurts pastries breads and cold selection meats cheese Salmon etc. and then you also choose of the large Al Carte menu See picture attached. Quality of food was good. Had lunch several times by the pool and that was also good quality and not too expensive for a hotel. Beer prices are reasonable and the in room Mini bar is stocked and cheap to use. The Staff are always cleaning up the beach outside the hotel area. They keep on top of it. The small pool is heated. We had the Family Seaview Suite Rm105 on the ground floor and it had direct access to the small heated pool with floating beanbags and balcony for siting out on and 2 loungers. The Room is spacious with a large comfortable king bed double day bed and a massive bathroom with double sink large bath large walk in shower and toilet. In room Wifi is very fast 10mb s and gave no issues at all. There is Wifi throughout the hotel for free to but this is slower but works well too for smartphones and tablets. Surrounding area has plenty of simple restaurants convince shops and massage shops. Its not a massive rocking nightlife place like Patong but perfect for a peaceful and relaxed holiday.

Spent my 30th birthday at this amazing place. I was so sad to leave. Arrived to a welcome drink and refreshing cold towel. We had the base level room which was nothing short of beautiful and clean. Bed was huge. Fresh fruit arrived daily. Restaurants and shops literally on the doorstep. Only downside about the room was the bathroom was enclosed in glass with blinds there was a decent size gap in the corner of the blinds meaning anyone in the room could see you on the toilet if they walked past. Eek. The room service ladies were so lovely and came in each night for a turn down service. I can not say enough about how kind and sweet they were. The resort felt very safe there were security cameras outside almost every room so I was not worried about my valuables inside etc. The beach front location is beautiful we often lazed around by the pool at night with a beer listening to the soft music. I did not like the fact that the outside visitors can pay to use the beach club pool. Although I was there in the low season I would hate to think as a guest I would not be able to find a chair because an outsider paid to have one. Food was pricey but drinks were good prices. Happy hour was from 5 7pm. Breakfast with a view was beautiful each morning. On my birthday I was given a beautiful bunch of flowers a small cake and a card. Everyone at reception greeted happy birthday all day. It was so wonderful. We had a couples massage at the spa and it was amazing. Watch out for deals they had a buy one get one free offer which was great. My husband left his watch at the spa and they returned it to us within ten minutes.

We initially just booked for 5 nights at the Boathouse however we were having such a great time we extended our stay to 10 days. Although this hotel did not have the grandeur of some other hotels seemed a little outdated and came with a fairly high room rate we really loved the warm hospitality and homely feeling of this hotel. It actually did not feel like you were staying in a hotel. You enjoyed the place the longer you stayed a little charmer. Breaky was nice and we always received such a warm welcome each morning from the staff and the other guests which you bumped into very regularly. We had a lovely view and the staff were great. Internet could be improved it was annoying. The location was fantastic and the Beach Club with the pool chairs and bar right on the beach offered a nice escape when the beach got too busy or too hot. We loved the adjacent Ska bar and restaurant which was our daily hangout our favourite. The view is fab. The guys there are terrific and there was always someone to chat with. The hotel is well located at the quieter end of Kata close to some great local restaurants Two Chefs Kata Seafood Gastron massages and shopping etc. Easy to catch a taxi to local areas eg. Nai Harn beach about 40b. lovely beach and Kata Noi beach is just a short walk up and over the hill worth a visit. The Hi Class massage directly across the road gave a nice massage on proper massage beds in a no chit chat environment. Cheap and still good although pedicure was very average.

We stayed at the Boathouse shortly after it reopened following its renovations. This was our third stay here and it was our number one choice to stay at in Phuket and Kata Beach following our previous experiences staying there. As well as that it was where we wanted to have our wedding ceremony at since it was possible to have a beach wedding there. something that my wife had been dreaming about. We made all the arrangements with Gam who was absolutely fantastic in making recommendations and meeting our every requirements we were in regular touch through email and kept us up to date with how the renovations were going. The night before we stayed at another property close by but Gam and the rest of the staff were able to take my suit and my wifes dress to get them ready for the wedding ceremony apologies for arriving late and keeping you up Gam. The following day upon check in we were greeted like long lost family members staying at this hotel really makes you feel right at home taken through to the small bar area next to the restaurant and sat down provided with cold towels and a welcome drink and some canapes they even have a special welcome drink menu for you to choose from. They then went through the whole check in process using a tablet whilst this was taking place the rooms director dropped by and welcomed us back and offered her business card in case we needed to contact her about anything. We had originally booked a seaview room which we had stayed in previous stays but the hotel kindly upgraded us to a Junior Suite which was both spacious and comfortable for our 4 night stay there was plenty of room and had a balcony overlooking the beach front both the room and the hotel have been modernised from our previous stays and they have done a fantastic job. Breakfast was included each day and as well as having a continental buffet to help yourselves from they provide a a la carte menu to order hot items freshly cooked to order for you. You have the option of sitting inside the restaurant or outside overlooking the beach. Thank you Mr X and the rest of the staff for looking after us every morning. The wedding ceremony itself was a day that both of us will always remember. Thanks to Gam and the rest of the staff that assisted it went incredibly smoothly and without any hiccups the decorations were beautiful and food and drinks went down well with all the guests. They were even kind enough to offer their van to transport our guests to and from the hotel they were staying at nearby. I think having the ability to hold it on the beach and have a ready made area to hold a reception gives the Boathouse a considerable advantage over many of the other hotels in the area as well as the dedication and service oriented culture of all the staff in making sure everyone feels truly valued and special sets it apart hence why we feel so much at home when we stay there. I would also like to thank Max the manager who always had time to pop over and speak to us daily to make sure that everything was going ok and that we had no problems. We look forward to our future stays at this wonderful hotel and if anyone is looking for a property to hold their dream wedding at then please look no further than the Boathouse.", "offset": [0, 44], "date": "2017-12-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "c6b4a289-5fa9-44e8-aed6-24d0e1c75034", "sentence": "Wonderful meal in a fantastic location.

First they have taken away that amazing bar that you could watch the sunset from to add more sun beds. Second they have totally taken away the spa which was the most relaxing time of my holidays.

People reserve them the night before did n\u2019t know this was Cyprus at a budget hotel. also noticed that the guys by the pool were reserving beds for people that would pay them. CrazyAlso on our last night we tried to get a reservation to have dinner in their restaurant. I wanted a table on the front like most people would but they said they were fully booked we asked for any time but they still said they were fully booked. After saying we will eat out then they came up with a table. When we were having dinner I noticed 6 tables on the front were FREE for the whole dinner. Just because someone says they want that table every night but wo n\u2019t tell them when they are coming for dinner they reserve that table for the whole night.

There are not enough kind words to say about this hotel. From the minute we arrived we were immediately welcomed with refreshments and snacks to enjoy as we sat enjoying the view while we were checked in. We could tell immediately that this was going to be an amazing stay. They did not say it but I think they may have upgraded our room as we had a balcony that I was not expecting to have. The room was spacious and filled with every amenity we needed even sandals and a beach bag tonuse for our stay. There was fresh fruit ready for us and each day more fruit and sweet treats were given to us to enjoy. Every staff member we interacted with or even just walked by was so warm and friendly we felt like royalty. Watch night at turn down they left cute little lead origami and the second day even left a sweet Happy Anniversary laid out on our bed with roses. The property is small and quaint but the service was spectacular. The infinity pool along the beach made for amazing views and relaxing days. The spa is next to the pool with large open windows doors so you can hear the sound of the waves during your massage. I did the 60 minute aroma massage and loved every minute of it so relaxing. Around the hotel there are a lot of restaurants and shops a little convenience store and pharmacy right across the street. Two Chefs restaurant right across the street had fun cocktails and a live 2 person band that took requests they were amazing. The next night we ate at Mama restaurant and it had amazing food too. But on our last night we chose to make it extra special and had dinner at the hotel and it was the perfect ending to our trip. The food was phenomenal we shared the Thai and western set with wine pairing. We could not stop raving about each wine and each course everything was so tasty and the wines paired perfectly. We had an early flight the next morning and they offered to make us a breakfast box to have ready for us in the morning since we were leaving before breakfast started. the breakfast is also amazing buffet and a la carte included so many options. It was another example of how they go above and beyond in the service they give you. We were blown away and were so appreciative that they cared to offer it.
