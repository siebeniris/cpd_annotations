When I checked in I was surprised to find my view from my Double Room 2 Double Beds View as I purchased was a view of the alleyway and the parking deck next door. I did not complain because I thought maybe the rooms facing the beach or the pool were already completely booked. I later determined that evening many of those rooms appeared to be vacant. The location was very dated. Much like I remember it 20 years ago. But it was extremely clean and tidy except for the carpet and the staff was friendly. I was a bit puzzled when I left my room to walk to the beach and saw a feeding bowl and what appeared to be cat food in the brezeway outside of one of the rooms. I also saw a plate of half eaten human food chicken fingers. sitting on top of the trash can and the housekeeping staff was standing right beside it. Beds were very clean and comfortable but I woke up several times throughout the night with the overwhelming scent of cigarette smoke in my room. There are concrete ashtrays with sand outside many of the room doors and people stand sit near them to smoke. The smoke was entering our room through the large cracks between the door the door frame I could feel a breeze from outside and also around through the A C unit.
