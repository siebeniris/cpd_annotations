From the moment I walked into this hotel I noticed that every staff member treated you like you were someone special. I have stayed at the Ritz before and everyone says hi to you. This was exactly like that. They keep their rooms very clean the location is superb second to none and for their daily rates you can not beat it. I will be going back there in 4 weeks for business and I will be staying at the Hyat. One more thing if you are there for business its perfect. Plenty of private settings in their large lobby with very comfortable furniture and they even have a Starbucks and a Subway in their lobby for those of us that have really busy days and can not leave the hotel. Everything. Plenty of great places to eat Lucas Oil Stadium is across the street their City Hall is right there and so much more.

The hotel is located adjacent to the convention center and the downtown circle mall area with abundant restaurant and entertainment options including the nearby stadiums. Indy has rebuilt itself into a convention and events destination and this hotel is centrally located near anything you had want to do here. An open atrium design from the 70s you might not want to pick this one if heights and glass elevators bother you. I love it personally. The rooms have been refreshed within the past 5 years. Most rooms are fairly standard although on my latest stay I received a corner adjoining room pass on that as I found noise did travel more between rooms than in prior stays hereBed is standard Hyat comfort with 2 pillow types for back or side sleepers. Rooms mini fridge came in handy for refreshments and in room coffee is possibly handy for those who do not want to venture to the lobbys starbucks or Fat Rooster diner. I found on this stay that I got standard toiletries though the upgraded options on the club lounge floor were a plus face wash chapstick etc. The rooms are otherwise no different there. Most rooms have converted to the walk in shower in the bathroom rather than a tub shower. I did find the lounge chair to be of lower comfort than I hoped and it had an odd back angle. Clearly it was chosen for looks vs comfort. If you bought a lounge floor room or get lounge access as a loyalty member you will find a typical continental breakfast fresh fruit cereals pastries hard boiled not scrambled eggs lox juices coffee tea. In evenings not much more than cheese plate. I would not pay recommend paying extra for access to this lounge vs others in the Hyat system that might have really wowed you in past. Alcohol is not free but not marked up as much as at say. Mariot properties if comparing. Hotel gym is typical Hyat Regency without anything high end but just the basic equipment you had expect and a small indoor pool. I did not try the revolving rooftop restaurant due to some steep prices but the lobby bar option had typical bar foods burgers flatbreads salads etc. All passable but nothing thrilled me on my meals here. If you have the time and weather permits go check out other nearby options. The Japanese food and service at nearby Makado proved a good choice for me and a colleague. There are other lobby food options for lunch including Red Rooster hotels diner a Subway and a Pizza shop but they are primarily lunch only. Parking prices vary wildly due to the many event nights nearby but you can find cheaper options nearby within a block or two. The valets were very helpful and welcoming as were all of the staff here. that is the Hyat way. Internet proved fast and reliable for the most part and the in room TVs are newer and can accept connections to other devices. My stay was standard Regency.

But everything they had worked properly and was in good condition. The only thing bad is that we paid for breakfast with our room and we were charged by the hotel as well but since I never received a bill from the hotel I could not verify that.

The rooms appear to be luxourious and the amenities look second to none. My partner and I were so excited to stay there during our trip to Indiana. When we arrived the parking lot was unmarked an terribly confusing. Not to mention VERY expensive to park for the two nights for 250 a night you would think parking would be included. I paid 460 for the first night alone. We got to our room and were immediately unimpressed. It was tiny. I could have dealt with that but then we found peeling paint and dust pouring out of every outlet. There was hair in the bathtub too. Normally I am not extremely picky but the hair and dust at 250 a night felt unacceptable. The concierge graciously gave us a new room and apologized for the issues. Our new room was better upon first glance. It was a little bigger and the view was amazing. After looking around we found even more peeling and bubbling paint and water stains on the ceiling. There were two water bottles on the counter near by the complimentary coffee pot and condiments. I drank both only then to read the fine print that the water costs 40 per bottle unles you are a Hyat World rewards member. While I take full responsibility for not reading before drinking the water I find this a little ridiculous when you can get unlimited free water bottles at the front desk. Lastly the pool in the pictures on the website looks huge and inviting. In real life the pool is tiny and needs maintenance. At check out we were informed that we had free breakfast. No one told us this when we arrived. By the time we left breakfast was over. I paid an additional 360 for parking. Then we did not leave quickly enough. you have 15 minutes to exit the parking lot after paying. so I got charged another 70 for the 2 additional minutes it took me to get my three year old in the car.
