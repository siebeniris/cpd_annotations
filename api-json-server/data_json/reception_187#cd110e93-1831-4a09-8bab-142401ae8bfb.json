We were fortunate enough to stay for one night in a Courtyard Suite. However this meant our visit was a short one and so we only experienced a small part of what the hotel has to offer. We also visited a couple of months before the shut down with renovation works already underway. This puts into context my comments. My comments are that the overall feel of the hotel was as we expected and wanted. The standard of customer care was high. All staff encountered were friendly professional and helpful. The transfer of the Long Bar facilities to the Billiard Room worked well enough. The ambience in the Billiard Room less comfortable than the Long Bar but acceptable. Although the service was slow and the Sauvignon Blanc wine that I had by the glass was poor. The bedroom was comfortable clean and a good size with a good level of amenities although an inning board iron would have been useful. The rooms are in need of modernisation and that will happen soon enough. Finally the breakfast room experience was OK. Not exceptional. Again service was quite slow and the quality of some of the produce questionable. For example the bacon that my wife and I both had had a peculiar taste perhaps even past its sell by date and our coffees cappuccinos had far too much cinnamon powder. I also ordered toast that was brought to table after I had finished by breakfast. I fully appreciate that it is difficult to maintain standards whilst such major renovation works are underway and I look forward to visiting the new hotel at some point after the grand opening in 2018.

I wish i could write 2 reviews for this hotel one would be about the service and the other about the current renovations. So staying here has always been a dream and I got a chance to spend the night here as we toured the Far East. We arranged to be met at the airport and were briskly whisked away in our comfortable car to the door of the hotel. Now I had read all the information on the hotel website on the renovation programme but i was still surprised to the extent of the work. In fact most of the hotel is closed the iconic front facade covered by a painted sheet. The billiard room and bar is open a courtyard with a fountain a further room reception area and then the rooms in the one wing adjacent to the road. The ground floor of this wing has the shop in it. Its actually more closed than open. Now from the moment we arrived and taken to our room on the third floor we were looked after impeccably with the most perfect service. The rooms are a celebration of the old colonial style and still maintain the old charm of knobs and dials and wooden furniture. We had a welcome bowel of fruit and bottle of drink with a lovely welcome card. Check in was done in our room. The room and bathroom was just perfect and the attached lounge area comfortable. It has double doors leading to a communal balcony that runs the length of the building overlooking the main room. The room is well insulated and there is no noise from the road. Make sure you visit the corridor on the first floor which has rows of photos of the royalty and famous guests. As others have said you can still get your Singapore Sling from the bar. We had a wonder through the shop for some souvenirs of our stay and sadly had to leave the next morning for our flight to Bangkok. So back to my opening sentence I now wonder had I known how little of the hotel was open whether I would have stayed there there is no concession on room prices as far as I can see on the other hand the history ambience and service made it a memorable stay. I wonder whether the hotel website could have been a bit more explicit on what was left open during this period. I understand it will be closing completely for a short period before reopening and maybe that is actually what should have been done already as there really is so little of the original hotel open at the moment. So 4 stars are really for the service if i was going to rate on the building it would have been a 3Maybe one day I will get another chance to visit once the work has finished and I can see it in all its glory and pomp.", "offset": [828, 962], "date": "2017-11-19 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "85a61cca-1b92-4dee-9290-1c78e31c090c", "sentence": "Long bar closes at 11 pm on Saturday nights.

It all felt like the luxury Raffles name has been cheapened by Acor down to something more akin to an MGalery Collection branded hotel. Service experienced was very mixed starting with my travel agent Virtuoso and myself sending independent email inquiries regarding my confirmed reservation only to receive the automatic acknowledgement email but no following email to answer the queries clearly the hotels email system is not working. I was greeted on arrival by the resplendent Sikh doorman and ushered into the main lobby. Rather than shown directly to my suite for in suite check in as expected I had phoned ahead and told my suite was ready I was sat at a reception area under the main staircase where I waited and waited with no refresher towel or welcome drink offered. After some time waiting with nothing happening I got up and wandered about the lobby until a butler finally came up to check me in only to be rudely interrupted by a hotel visitor with the result the butler switched her complete attention to the rude hotel visitor and wandered off with them showing directions leaving me abandoned on the lobby floor. Welcome to Raffles. I walked back to the reception area where another staff member completed the check in process. I requested to inspect a Studio Suite but was told they were either occupied or being cleaned. Despite saying I would not mind seeing an uncleaned one just wanting to get an idea of layout and view. this was refused. Arrangements were made for a butler to arrange a viewing the next day but this never happened. A couple of days later I requested at reception for an inspection but was told all were occupied a lie to fob me off as it turned out. and that the hotel was no longer selling the Studio Suites and I would not be able to inspect one. Why then are they still being advertised on the Raffles Hotel website. Later that morning my butler said she could show me a Studio Suite when I was ready she immediately took me and showed me a serviced unoccupied Studio Suite. Do not train your reception staff to lie to in resident guests to fob them off it leaves a very sour impression indeed. My most helpful and professional butler also gave me a glimpse at the still unfinished Sarkies Suite gone is all the magnificent elegant antique furniture and persian carpets and it now looks like some hideous gaudy upmarket brothel. black sofa with silver or gold speckles. bed with huge contemporary brass bedhead etc. History destroyed. Talking of history the silver beef trolley famously saved from the invading Japanese has been relegated to the store room perhaps never to grace the floors of Raffles again. Very sad. Check out experience was even worse than check in. Despite all confirmed for a butler to attend my suite from 130pm to check out for an arranged limousine transfer at 145pm I waited until 140pm with still no contact from any staff. I phoned to ascertain what is going on and a butler said he had come to my suite. I got sick of waiting yet again and commenced carrying my own luggage down to reception to check out only to meet a butler half way who ushered me down only to be sat down in the public part of the main lobby and wait and wait again presumably for a sheet of paper to be printed out. By the time check out was finally completed it was nearing 20pm. Fortunately at least the limousine was on standby and ready to go and luckily I was not in a mad rush to catch my flight or attend an important business meeting. It seems my check out was completely overlooked by the system. Such a shame as excellent service was also experienced during my stay. Special mention must be made of one of my butlers Claren who was very polished and professional with the service she provided. Ryan at the Tiffin Room could have been in any number of European three star restaurants perfect professional service to be highly commended.

It all felt like the luxury Raffles name has been cheapened by Acor down to something akin to an MGalery Collection hotel. Service experienced was very mixed starting with my travel agent Virtuoso and myself sending independent email inquiries regarding my confirmed reservation only to receive the automatic acknowledgement email but no following email answer. I was greeted on arrival by the resplendent Sikh doorman and ushered into the main lobby. Rather than shown directly to my suite for in suite check in as expected I had phoned ahead and told my suite was ready I was sat at reception where I waited and waited with no refresher towel or welcome drink offered. After some time waiting with nothing happening I got up and wandered about the lobby until a butler finally came up to check me in only to be rudely interrupted by a hotel visitor with the result the butler switched her complete attention to the rude hotel visitor and wandered off with them showing directions leaving me abandoned on the lobby floor. Welcome to Raffles. I walked back to the reception area where another staff member completed check in. Arrangements were made for a butler to arrange a viewing of a Studio Suite the next day but this never happened. A couple of days later I requested at reception for an inspection but was told all were occupied a lie to fob me off as it turned out. and that the hotel was no longer selling Studio Suites and I would not be able to inspect one. Why then are they still being advertised on the Raffles Hotel website. Later that morning my butler showed me a serviced unoccupied Studio Suite. Do not train your reception staff to lie to in resident guests to fob them off it leaves a very sour impresionCheck out experience was worse than check in. Despite all confirmed for a butler to attend my suite from 130pm to check out for an arranged limousine transfer at 145pm I waited until 140pm with no contact from any staff. I phoned to ascertain what is going on and a butler said he had come to my suite. Sick of waiting yet again I commenced carrying my luggage to reception only to meet a butler half way who ushered me down only to be sat down in the public part of the main lobby and wait and wait again for a sheet of paper to be printed. Check out was finally completed a bit before 20pm. Fortunately the limousine was on standby and I was not in a mad rush to catch my flightSuch a shame as excellent service was also experienced. Special mention must be made of butler Claren who was very polished and professional with service provided. Ryan at the Tiffin Room could have been in any number of three star restaurants perfect professional service to be highly commended. I used room service once which was promptly and professionally delivered. Butler Jeremy was efficient at delivering fresh milk for coffee in suite it must be the first hotel I have stayed in where no milk or creamer is provided in room of course preferable would be on call tea or coffee served by butler as used to be the case in Raffles and is still done at The Strand Hotel Rangoon for example. The restoration architects are to be applauded and commended for the magnificent restoration of the Raffles Hotel building beautifully accomplished. Modern technology airconditioning and lighting have been cleverly and seamlesly integrated into the historic suites and bathrooms pleasingly remodeled. Double glazing and soundproofing provide for a generally quiet retreat although the traffic noise can still be heard in the State Suites overlooking Bras Basah Road and thudding footsteps of those in the suite above can still be heard below. Marble and teak walkways gardens and courtyards have all been beautifully restored. However those in charge of interior decoration ought be sentenced to several dozen strokes for the unforgivable destruction of the grande dames elegant colonial soul. Colonial cane furniture on the front portico replaced with dull modern furniture of a style one would expect to find in an Ibis a somewhat gaudy platinum coloured main lobby chandelier clashes badly with the elegant colonial styled brass coloured chandeliers elsewhere in the lobby the beautiful antique persian carpet in the main lobby replaced with a bland modern abstract patterned rug the same completely out of character mass produced contemporary artworks hang in every suite and abstract patterned carpets in the suites instead of persian carpets etcThe elegant colonial Raffles Grill has been replaced with a modern bistro at fine dining prices complete with gaudy laser cut light fitting and with some tables so close you could bump elbows with neigbouring diners. The Tiffin Room has been guted and replaced with an ambiance more akin to an upmarket food court stripped of crisp white table clothes and with tables so small the waiters have difficulty juggling tableware around to fit plates on the table. The elegant haven of the Writers Bar is now a darkly decorated room which feels like ones in some modern Italian basement bar. The final straw would have to be the graffiti street art murals on the gleaming colonial white interior walls of the first and second floors of the main building completely and utterly absurdThe elegant Raffles Hotel monogram cutlery and silverware is retained however a big tick for getting that right. Elegant bedside lamps remain in the suites and there is a comfortable leather upholstered chair. but then a modern styled table and bland gray sofa with thin armrests which looks like it is from a cheap Novotel hotel. Acor are misleading guests by claiming the hotel fully reopened on 1 August. The Bar Billiard Room was still not open and scraping down and repainting of the front wall of the hotel was still taking place at the time of my stay. Scraping painting and use of strong smelling epoxy glue was evident in various locales about the hotel. It all felt like the hotel was very much still in pre opening soft opening mode. The in suite iPad management system is an excellent idea and worked well for operating lights curtains etc except that the night and day curtain buttons are the wrong way round as are the high to low fan speeds for the airconditioning check for yourself Mr Westbeld State Suite 265. The latter resulted in me having a somewhat noisy uncomfortable suite with roaring fan noise and blasting air in the parlour on what was supposedly low fan speed until I discovered the fan speeds had been incorrectly programmed. I used the iPad command to have a butler call me or attend to my suite a couple of times but gave up waiting only to discover it is much quicker to dial 2 on the telephone and speak to a butler directly. if the call does not ring out with no answer as it did on a couple of ocasionsThe Raffles Spa facilities are excellent with helpful staff the sento provides a wonderfully relaxing soak and there are saunas and steam rooms. Pity the ice machine never worked for the whole five days of my stay. Breakfast was excellent in the Tiffin Room apart from the lost colonial ambiance with what may well be the best pastries in all of Asia. Service in the Tiffin Room was excellent particularly from Ryan as previously mentioned. If you are merely seeking a plush modern hotel experience in the shell of an historic building then you might give Raffles a pass subject to service levels experienced. If however you are seeking that unique special elegant colonial Raffles experience that modern hotels do not offer forget it you are too late.", "offset": [2734, 2876], "date": "2019-08-28 08:08:57", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "7b9bdcdc-f193-404a-8edc-60755ece89fc", "sentence": "The hotel is beautiful as are the grounds and pool.

I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to stay during the grand re opening of the Raffles after such an extensive renovation. The grounds the rooms and every inch of the hotel was spectacularly beautiful. I was impressed with the attention to detail on the finishings of the rooms and the technology upgrades functioned flawlessly. Please consider any feedback below within the context of an overall very enjoyable stay from a detail oriented individual who understands that you too are striving to be at the very top of a competitive group of luxury hotel experiences Peninsula HK Tokyo Aman Tokyo Mandarin Bangkok MO HK MO Singapore as reference point for some of our prior travel experiences etcThe check in process left some room to be desired. We were greeted appropriately at the door and ushered to the check in area. I did feel that the check in staff though friendly and efficient were too few and thus frequently tied up having to handle other requests on the phone or even other in person interactions with other guests. I noticed this both at check in as well as check out. I mention this only as other hotels offer in suite check in which removes the distraction to this portion of the guest experience and allows the guest to explore the room during the check in process. Bag handling at check. in was excellent on point and largely invisible. We requested bags to be stored at check out for about 3 hours prior to our late flight that evening. There was some confusion as we did not know whether we could leave them unattended in the room to be picked up and we had already checked out and handed in our keys. It was clarified that they would be taken care of and we did not need to sit in the room and wait for them to be picked up. However upon picking them up from the concierge we were asked if we had a ticket. At any other hotel this would be a non issue. But it represents a break in the continuity of the experience either the process is completely invisible the whole way through and the concierge when we pick up the luggage simply asks for our name or maybe our room number from earlier that day or we interact with the people who pick up our bags andor receive a baggage ticket from the check out staff. It is a little incongruous to have an invisible baggage pickup from the room but then be asked to provide a receipt of the transaction at the concierge desk upon pickup. The round soap dish as found in the shower is difficult to remove the soap from and re place into the dish as the dish is almost exactly the size of the soap bar. The alternative is to leave the soap bar bare on the ledge in the shower however there is no corrugation to keep the soap bar from sliding around on the smooth surface. The butler service is friendly but also likely on an early learning curve. We received our complementary welcome Singapore Slings in the room and enjoyed them in addition to snacks from the minibar. We returned to the room after a decent period of time I believe over an hour to find the room uncleaned. I would not expect an automatic full room recleaning at every exit of the room however one might anticipate that first completion of welcome beverages will leave the room partially unkempt and it might make a strong positive statement as to the attention to detail if this was briefly surreptitiously taken care of when your guest makes their first exit of the room to explore the grounds etc. I also noticed that the butler pages to a general number and not our specific butler which partially detracts from the personal nature of the relationship. The bartender at the Writers bar was extraordinary as you might expect both in knowledge capability and attention to detail. At this level and price point would anticipate flexing up more support waitstaf as the bar got crowded around the time that the Long Bar made last call and there was an influx of additional guests to the Writers bar. I do recall a similar bar in Tokyo where both chairs for myself and my wife were pulled out for us simultaneously not even having had any prior reservations. Details like these are memorable and understandably difficult to pull off routinely. The cocktails were phenomenal. The breakfast was truly wonderful. The captain was deeply apologetic at a small misstep of the kitchen with regards to a request to serve an ingredient on the side but it in no way detracted from my overall enjoyment of the atmosphere the service or the quality of the meal. Afternoon tea was impeccable. There was an error in our reservation that we had to clarify both to confirm the same day reservation reservation was made on the day of after check in and to cancel a reservation which had been made for the following day. But thoroughly enjoyed the quality and creativity of the dishes the tea the atmosphere and the service. With regards to the feel welcome endeavor for the stay I did sense the effort to make guests feel more like residents than traditional hotel guests and this was noticed and appreciated. I think there are some challenges at the front door with separating guests from tourists passing in for food and beverage with regards to the welcome. Regardless of these small details overall we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and hope to be back in the future.", "offset": [874, 1080], "date": "2019-09-02 05:21:30", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "e20ffc5a-9d5e-4c6b-938d-daa765639c25", "sentence": "An extremely overpriced placed with a completely patronizing concierge who was also very condescending.

Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Raffles particularly liking the high fit and finish of the newly renovated suites the unique feel of the rambling historic property and the understated luxury. Service however fell short and we were not impressed with the Butler service or the staff at the Grand Lobby. The Raffles has just come off a major renovation and is one of only a handful of true luxury properties in Singapore with just over 100 suites. The low slung 3 story property has been expanded multiple times throughout its history so the layout winds around multiple courtyards and wings. While smaller boutique properties have begun to pop up more in Singapore in recent years the Raffles \u2019 restrained size and historic nature remain unique in the city. We really wanted to love the Raffles however our expectations were high considering the price point of our Bras Basah wing \u201c State Suite \u201d \u2013 around USD10 night including taxes and 10 service fee \u2013 and found that the service just did not live up to the highest standards which we had experienced elsewhere. The service we received from the room butlers at the room orientation and in room check out was proficient but perfunctory. There was no grace or friendliness. For instance at check out the butler did n\u2019t smile once did n\u2019t inquire as to our stay or our onward journey and showed up 8 minutes late from our pre arranged check out time. She did the bare minimum I would expect from a 4star hotel let alone a 5star. The experience felt similar during the in room orientation when we first arrived. The most frustrating service experience though was at the front door. Due to the iconic history of the property the Raffles gets many curious tourists wishing to explore the lobby. As a result the staff is proactive at gently nudging them out of the property but this comes at the expense of providing a warm welcome to resident guests. The front doors to the grand lobby are kept locked and you need your guest key card to open the door. There are no doormen to consistently open the door for you a first for me at a luxury hotel. When you do enter the door staff members will challenge you with questions trying to ascertain whether you are a guest or not \u201c Sir how can I help you \u201d. \u201c Sir are you returning to your room \u201d. My wife literally was asked the impertinent question of \u201c Ma\u2019am where are you going \u201d. upon returning to her own hotel. Luxury hotels should make their guests feel warm and welcome upon their return not feel like they have to justify their presence. It got to the point where my wife and I would hold our key cards in our hands to signal the hotel staff we were guests and to leave us alone when we walked through the grand lobby. We should not have to do that. At the best luxury hotels staff will warmly welcome you back proactively open the door and even provide a welcome back cold beverage or towel. Not only did none of this happen at the Raffles but we felt actively dissuaded from coming through the front lobby. Between the challenges we would receive upon entering the hotel and the perfunctory check out we just did not feel welcome or like valued guests at the Raffles. That said the physical property is lovely and lives up to its reputation. Our suite was of a very high fit and finish and we loved the large size 750 sq feet which gave us ample room to stretch out including a good sized bedroom living room and large bath room with bathtub large shower room toilet and his hers sinks. Amenities were of high very quality and we thought the free non alcoholic mini bar snacks and daily fruit was a nice touch. Tech was also as good as you could get with ipad controls for lights temperature curtains and the ability to use one \u2019s own streaming service on the main TVs. The Bras Basah wing is the noisiest of the wings located above public areas including the Long Bar and shopping. However our suite was well sound proofed so we only heard the noise when walking to from our room on the outdoor walkways. Also while our wing was the least tranquil of the Raffles \u2019 wings my understanding is that the State Suites are about 100 150 sq feet larger than the other non named Suites so it \u2019s a bit of a trade off. If you want the space stay in a State Suite but if you value tranquility go for the smaller Courtyard or Palm Court Suites. In addition to the room we also loved the understated luxury of the public areas of the property. Singapore is a city of modern high rise blocks so to be able to experience a low rise historic property with tranquil courtyards and historic finishes felt special and luxurious. It definitely had some wow factor there. We did n\u2019t use the facilities but we did check out the new roof top pool and gym both of which seemed fine. I wanted to give the Raffles a 55 but our service experience on really important elements of a stay left us frustrated and with a sour memory. I e mailed the hotel and separately provided online feedback to express our dissatisfaction but the management did not respond to either which further compounded our frustration. A simple acknowledgement would have been appreciated.", "offset": [2168, 2321], "date": "2019-12-01 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "6b84514e-e6c5-4bcb-a8f1-a429a8624953", "sentence": "Great hotel beautiful rooms but service not up to the standard.
