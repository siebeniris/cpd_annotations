Being a seasoned traveler who has visited a lot of the great hotels of the world both large and boutiqueI looked forward to visiting la grande dame from 2812 14 for 5 days. I was not disappointed. The oriental is excellent service personified with butlers on each floor ready to look after your every whim. From the doorman porters concierge and more senior employees everyone is proactive. They go out of their way to satisfy the customer. A simple example during breakfast at the riverside terrace the minute the sunlight started to hit us there was already someone at hand to move the shade before we had to ask. There were numerous such instances of customer service that I can not begin to list here. The family suite we occupied was spacious and well furnished modern classical. The food at the hotel particularly the breakfast buffet catered for every taste. I challenge anyone to find a wider array of foods at breakfast. Seafood at lord Jims was super and the high tea at the authors lounge excellent. The spa and gym were equally impressive. Considering that occupancy was full I was impressed by the efforts of the staff to ensure all customers were well attended to.

We spent the first day recovering from jet lag and lounging by the pool in a cabana. I think we counted about 8 other people at the pool the entire day we practically had the place to ourselves. We ventured out into Bangkok the second and third days and the location of the hotel was quite ideal for this. We took advantage of the shuttle to get us across the river which is a beautiful wooden boat. We ate brunch in the restaurant one day and while it was expensive the food was good. The front desk staff was very helpful in arranging transportation back to the airport on the morning of our departure and the butler on our floor knew us by name and let us in to our room several times.

I have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental many times in the past 30 years. It has always been like coming home to an oasis for me. As most of the guests here my reason is to have a great service and peace and quiet. Unfortunately this time I noticed that the staff in general is not as attentive and not as available as before. The pool area which is the main attraction for most guests during the day is like Disney world. Lots of young children running around screaming and constantly jumping in and out of the pool. There is a smaller pool next to the main pool where children can swimAdults diving and splashing their neighbors even though No diving is clearly marked around the pool. it is not only annoying but also dangerous as the wet stones get very slippery. As a matter of fact an elderly lady slipped and fell breaking her arm. What I found amazing was the lack of interference of the pool staff. The smoking area which is outside right behind the lobby does not have anyone anymore to order drinks. The food is still very good in all the restaurants. The only place which did not change at all is the spa. It is still wonderful and run very professionally.

My son and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental MO for 4 nights April May 20169. It was our second stay at this quite remarkable property on the banks of the Chao Phraya river. Most reviews are extremely positive and for the most part I would agree. Perhaps it \u2019s best to start with some of the cons which are few. The boat masters and crew are not as friendly as one would expect. In fact one boat master a young good looking Thai was a bit unfriendly. Management needs to talk with this individual as well as the crew members. Speaking of the boat transportation I felt that Peninsula almost directly across the river from the MO offered a better service than the MO seemed like more boats were available at the Peninsula hotel and a friendlier staff plus the Peninsula had its own pier very convenient. Another con is that the standard rooms are quite small for the price. Small bathroom with a very small shower. To our surprise one of the girls working at the restaurant was unfriendly an attitude issue perhaps. Other than these small problems the hotel is quite exceptional ie a highly friendly and professional staff. wonderful small shops in the old wing excellent butler service and last but not least an amazing concierge section. One person in particular Ms Vasa Assistant chief concierge was outstanding and went beyond what one could expect even from such a great hotel. We lost our VAT papers on a rather expensive item discovering this just a few hours before checking out. We went to the concierge to see if the hotel limo could drop by the store so we could obtain a new VAT paper. She came up with an even better solution namely sending someone from the hotel to the store to get the VAT paper and deliver it to us before our departure. She called the store and made all the arrangements. The store personnel said they would give a copy of the original paper and that this would be accepted at the VAT office at the airport. Ms Vasa being a true professional called the airport to check if a copy was sufficient. She was told that the original paper was needed. She then called back the store to have them make out a new VAT paper. A 30baht service fee was applied to our bill about 850 to cover the hotel costs to pick up the new VAT paper. The personnel at reception were always so friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I did n\u2019t take down their names. We had breakfast lunch and dinner at the hotel nearly every day. The buffet breakfast is what one expects of such a famous hotel but honestly I thought it could be improved in some areas a greater variety of juices including grapefruit juice and better bread and fruit assortment. My son enjoyed the spa. Most people will be very happy with their time at the MO. To conclude I would like to say we had a very pleasant experience when we took the limo to the airport. About 4 5 staff members followed us to the car to send us off maybe to get rid of us which was such a marvelous feeling. Of course this is just part of the MO \u2019s service policy but still I thought it felt so good.", "offset": [488, 562], "date": "2016-05-02", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "687cf80d-cab2-4014-b433-e5993c5e2851", "sentence": "Excellent.

Everyone kept telling me what an amazing place this is. I go to Bangkok all the time. Several times a year. Everyone wants to stay here. So finally I booked at this hotel. Maybe because I am asian but I was not treated very nicely as I am used to be treated at 5 star hotels and also in Bangkok. The hotel seems to be too busy esp in the restaurant at breakfast time. It seems like you enter chaos and mayhem and the waitors waitresses can not smile at you nor take the time to know if everything is ok. I always felt I had to rush to catch someone to ask for a coffee or anything. They make you feel like you are bothering them and also they are literally running all of them in such a rush. I felt quite stressed out going down for breakast every day. The pool side also made me feel quite unwelcome. They never asked the other white people at the hotel if they were staying there but they made me feel like a hanger on and double checking if I was really staying in the hotel and checking for my room number and name even when i was there every day and coming down with my key and bathrobe. The only time I was treated with respect was by the service on the floor. The room attendants were lovely. I had a nice view of the water looking down the river and even when i had checked in I did not like the view and they were acomodating enough to show me several rooms. in general the breakfast service SUCKS and so does the pool service. the pool is crammed also with all the chairs right next to each other. I would think they would have built it with more space around not to feel so crammed next to each other. The buffet in the evening had a different ambiance and the service was nice. The staff is lovely at night most of the times but they are a bit cold for the kind of service I have gotten used to in Thailand. I am quite disappointed with the Mandarin oriental there and I will not be coming back. I get to choose where I stay for work and also have a group coming with me but they might have treated me better if they really knew I was the one that had decided to bring my group there.

We very much enjoyed our stay at MO Bangkok. We stayed in a State Room for 4 nights. Our experience started with the hotel \u2019s airport transfer service. We were picked up at the airport by Alex an impeccably well dressed chauffeur who whisked us to the hotel in a brand new BMW 7 Series. This was truly the best airport transfer service we have experienced. Upon arrival at the hotel we were taken straight up to our room whereupon we were checked in nice and swiftly. Our bags arrived whilst we were being checked in. Our room was gorgeous and spacious with panoramic views of the river. As for the amenities I would have liked a rainfall shower and more or better located plug sockets. For example these were hidden behind the large bedside table which was a tad inconvenient for me. Nevertheless the room was spacious comfortable and clean. Housekeeping did a fantastic job throughout our stay. On our first evening we dined in the hotel \u2019s Chinese restaurant. Having spent two weeks in Asia we were both in agreement that this was the best meal we had during our entire holiday. To put this into context it was even better than two Michelin Star restaurants we ate at in Hong Kong. The food was sublime. So were the aperitifs and champagne. Breakfast was busy but any concerns I had about that were quickly assuaged by the prompt service and fantastic buffet. What else to say. Well the pool area is great. The pool manager is clearly an asset to this hotel and I hope that this is recognised by management. While we were at the pool the hotel manager came over personally to introduce himself. This was appreciated. Some posters have commented on the \u201c snobbish \u201d attitude of staff. I would n\u2019t say snobbish. The hotel has standards which should be observed. However some staff can appear quite cold aloof. Formality is fine but there is a balance to be struck between this and being cold aloof. Anyway this really was a minority. I \u2019d say 95 of staff were wonderful. The room service attendant who brought us some bubbles on our third night was the sweetest guy ever. His personality grace and service epitomised everything that we love about Thai hospitality. I was impressed that staff around the hotel knew our names even though it was busy and is quite large relatively speaking. That was a nice touch and was appreciated. On our final night a lovely lady on Concierge recommended a restaurant for us as we were craving dim sum. Having eaten in lots of high end restaurants during our trip we just wanted somewhere relaxed and informal. The kind lady gave us an excellent recommendation and upon coming downstairs she instantly spotted us and took us outside to our taxi. Unfortunately 20 seconds into the taxi journey the taxi driver refused to put on the meter. I advise any traveller to immediately get out of any taxi not before it has stopped of course if this happens to you as you will be charged at least 4 times the regulated fare. In Thailand this is not a lot of money to a Westener but it is unprincipled and in the words of the kind lady on Concierge \u201c it is bad for our country \u201d. After re appearing in the hotel lobby only minutes after seeing us away the kind lady I say \u201c kind lady \u201d because I did not catch her name was incredibly apologetic and saw us into another taxi. The good thing is that MO make a note of every taxi \u2019s registration plate which picks up guests so they made a note of the driver who tried to fleece us and I am told reported him. Good for MO. Anyway this next trip was without incident. Upon return to the hotel the kind lady at Concierge was again very apologetic. In summary we really enjoyed our stay. I would n\u2019t say I was blown away but perhaps my expectations were too high to start with. One other comment is that I think some staff should undergo language training as it was difficult to converse with some of them. Would we return. Yes.

There is a special magic all around in every room lounge bar salon outdoor facilit and restaurant. Celebrating a special occasion I splurged for an Authors Suite which was simply amazing. We never wanted to leave our room. In fact we cancelled two dinners during our stay to enjoy Room Service since we had the best table in Bangkok looking out over the exciting lights and activity on the river. Special thanks to all the wonderful staff who made our stay so very special. Every single one of you represent the highest standards of genuine and gracious hospitalityThank you Oriental Spa Team and especially my Healer and Friend Khun Narerat who has been providing life changing therapeutic body work on me for almost 10 years. Often I route myself through Bangkok just to experience her healing therapy. The Butler Service at MOBK is World Class. Thank you Khun Patimapon Khun Thuntika Khun Ritichai and Khun Som for all the special details in the Suite and for anticipating our every wish. We love you.

The beauty and history of this old hotel are renowned. It certainly more than lives up to its reputation. Everyone bends over backwards to accommodate your needs and wishes.

For example on checkin the front desk made us meal reservations instead of sending us to the concierge and she ordered us box lunches for our early tour departure the next day. The box lunch was over the top two kinds of milk two different sandwiches fruit fruit juice rolls gluten free ones for me. The Loy Krathong celebration was over the top elaborate costumes several Thai traditional performances an elaborate buffet of unending choices of traditional Thai foods fireworks and Krathong to float on the river.

The water pressure was excellent and the bathrooms were very spacious and well appointed. Their cocktails are good and the breakfast buffet is fine. The spa and fitness center are on the opposite side of the river which is slightly annoying. They do offer a free ferry across the river which is quick and easy but you do need to plan accordingly. The spa is not to be missed. We got great 90 minute massages for a very reasonable price. far less then any hotel I have ever stayed in before. However the rooms are dated there are not enough outlets for charging devices and I was not served a drink in the evening because of their dress code.

The service was exceptional and they went over the top for my birthday with gorgeous flowers from the concierge butler and cleaning service to a breakfast birthday cake and various treats over a few days. Overly thoughtful. The renovation did not impact our stay but my view of the river did overlook the construction of the pool and tower. The hotel is on the mainland and you have to take the hotel ferry shuttle across the river to the spa fitness center and their Thai restaurant. For the spa best massage I have ever had in my life. Anong may appear tiny but she was a strong woman. They were kind enough to upgrade my massage room steam shower massage bed massage table jacuzi. I was spoiled and think I ca n\u2019t have another massage in the US. \u200d \u2640 \ufe0fThe only negative I have to say is although the concierge is helpful I think they push the wrong restaurants tours to fill numbers. They suggested the Thai show dinner and was so touristy I felt like I was on a cruise. The restaurant decor should be updated and the food was just ok. I was disappointed to waste an evening there when I had restaurants of my own I wanted to try. They do mean well and were very helpful when I inquired about specific sights and suggested the best means of transportation via river or car. All other meals were excellent and the breakfast was a highlight with fresh fruits made to order juices smoothies and traditional menu items. The complimentary river cruise offered by the hotel is quick and a great way to see the scenery locals feed the fish in the river it \u2019s like a frenzy.

Upon finishing my meal I went to hotels lobby waiting for my taxi to come. I remembered from last stay that there was a restroom located on the 2nd floor so I headed to the stairs. However I found one of the staff looking at me as if I have invaded the hotels property and when our eyes met he asked me right away where I was going. I told him I am headed to the restroom and pointed at the direction towards the restroom I remember in the 2nd floor but he shook his head and said it is not there but there is one on the first floor. I am not saying there is something wrong with him giving the direction to the nearest toilet which is located on the first floor but his way of telling me his face expressions and his tone offended me so much.

The hotel is beautifully decorated throughout with great taste care and interest reflecting it is history since 1863. However the very best thing which lifts it above most other top hotels is the people who care for you there. Thai people by nature are amongst the most gracious in the world. The staff at the Oriental are just wonderful making you feel so very much at home and welcome in a personal way. You feel part of their family and part of the hotels history.
