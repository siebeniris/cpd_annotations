The photo shown on the trip advisor site of the swimming pool is very misleading as it makes it look huge when it is not big at all. It is very difficult to get a lounger unles you go out at the crack of dawn as all loungers have towels put on them but very few are actually in use. The hotel is nice but not really suited to anyone with mobility problems as there is a great deal of walking to be done between rooms dining areas and swimming pool. As a large hotel there is a lack of toilet facilities with just one in the huge lobby bar area and another one shared by all the restaurants. The only toilets at the pool area are one in the health spa and one in the restaurant near the pool. The food is not of a high standard and very few dishes are labelled as to what the are. When I recently asked what a dish was I was told no flavour. However The staff here are very helpful and the rooms are spotless.", "offset": [523, 664], "date": "2015-03-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "d98d9a03-3b28-4e42-b37d-893a9bdf0e50", "sentence": "very disappointed. I do not know how anyone reviewing this resort can say it was wonderful. The only good I can say is that the beach grounds and weather were great. Other than that I can not find a good thing to say. First on check in staff is unfriendly and unhelpful. It is difficult to communicate with most of staff and they make no effort to try. They do not speak english. Get to the room and smells like musty moldy damp gross. spent one night in that room and had to change which was not the easiest thing to do. Head to buffet and day 1 looks impressive however it is exactly the same every day and gets old very quickly. Mid afternoon there is nothing to eat anywhere. No outside grill or anything just the remains of the lousy buffet that has been sitting there for hours. The theme restaurants are better food however the choice is limited and availability of reservation not so easy either. I found that the drinks were horrible. Have a Pina Colada and it comes like milky water with ice cubes in it. The main lobby bar was the only place for a decent drink and the only pleasant bartender not sure how to spell but mabe. Yojany she is a sweetheart as well as Michael in buffet. Other than that the service staff left much to be desired. The entertainment staff was better but still nothing that I would return for. The shows were mediocre and the smoking was atrocious. Other resorts I have been to have designated smoking areas here every where I turned I inhaled second hand smoke. At the beach the buffet the pool the show. It was a real turn off. We had a Saturday to Saturday vacation with a group of 14 and on Wednesday I became sick with extreme nausea and diarrhea. Soon my husband and 5 others of our group had the same. So from Wednesday through Saturday I ate probably some rice bananas and 7up. The others ate minimal as well. I m home today and my husband and I are still sick. Must return to work tomorrow in need of a vacation after this horrible experience. This resort made money on my family for all inclusive since we only ate and drank 12 the time we were there. I will never return to this resort or recommend to anyone. Not even sure I would ever return to Punta Cana at all.", "offset": [1015, 1135], "date": "2015-04-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "99a8cd05-2b66-44c5-bca6-59ffefc1255c", "sentence": "Enjoyable but.

Pros. The grounds are beautiful as most say. Had a great waiter in main dining room Jose D took care of us EVERYDAY. tour area was good lots of variety. It you have ever gone on a cruise it is like that but on land. Had a GREAT spa treatment and massage. Nail treatment was very old school and polish did not dry in the humidity for hours. Cons THERE ARE MANY. First room given was not cleaned it was though someone had come back in after it was cleaned. It also smelled like mildew and it was hot in the rom 2nd floor room. That was quickly rectified. 2nd room on 3 rd floor was ok but still warm. Come to find out within an hour the air broke down. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon. I immediately told my roomie I bet this will not get fixed til Monday it is cheaper to fix. So entire weekend was hot and muggy complaining to the front desk was no help. They LIED TO EVERYONE and told different stories depending on how loud you yelled. I did notice most of those yelling were Americans. I am just saying. we like our comfort after paying money. Not every room was out but more than half. We started taking a poll with other guests. Hotel was completely full over the weekend. Monday afternoon voila air back on. Also the is no air in the small little slow moving elevators so be prepared for that. Take the stairs if you are able bodied. The drinks were sweet but not strong if you like mixed cocktails. The service to get those drinks is pretty good but you will go broke here to get really good service for tipping. If you tip service is spot on if you do not be prepared to wait a little longer. You need lots and lots of 1. The food in the main dining room was just so so. Lots of variety but no flavor. There is no air in the main dining room or the lobby just big ceiling fans so ITS HOT. The specialty restaurants you must make reservations in advance however you can at least make up to 3 days in advance. I went to the steak and the Italian. both I did not care to rebok so stayed with the main dining. The casino on prem is a joke. Play the free little dollars they give you then RUN. it is only like 8 machines akin there and half were broke. There is a bigger casino near there but still on the Riu compound. The shows are just ok the Michael Jackson one is the best. The beach was horrible they did not clear the seaweed one single day we were there so it piled up and stank so most stayed at the pool. If you stay in the Riu compound you will be ok you can walk to the other ones on the beach path but you can not eat at all of them so ask at your front desk. All in all I would pick a more modern hotel with better ventilation throughout the property intsead of hit and miss. If you send postage from there it took 5 weeks for me to get my post card. Was given to the front desk.", "offset": [1327, 1366], "date": "2015-09-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "63dce45c-4ed0-4c7a-acea-10e196b1e580", "sentence": "Simply incredible. From the moment you step into the lobby of the Riu Palace Punta Cana you feel like you are in a 5 star masterpiece. Not only is the resort beautiful their amazing staff is always there to help when needed. I ended up here after a week a the neighboring Riu Bambu. We booked the Riu Bambu for 1 week but then my mom became ill and could not fly so we ended up booking 6 extra days here since the Bambu was filled and had no space. I am so happy the Bambu was full so I could experience this gemFront desk Front desk service was amazing. I was paying on a day to day basis as we did not know when my mom would be able to fly. That being said I was there everyday. Nelson was the best. Not only did he help me with our reservations he called our room everyday to ensure we were alright. He also managed to get a wheelchair for my mom so she would not be confined to her room. After a 3 day hospital stay Nelson welcomed her with a hug and a smile. He ensured I had a taxi everyday so I could get to the hospital. Nelson was more then an employee he quickly became a friend. Everyday I was there I made sure to stop in a say hi. Even though I was in this resort alone with my mom in the hospital I felt safe and welcomed. I can not thank Nelson enough for everything he did for usFod. Under the circumstances we were not able to reserve any a la cartes. My mom being in a wheelchair wanted to stay at the buffet as we knew they had space for her chair. Well the buffet at this resort is absolutely AMAZING. I saw everything from Caviar to shrimp. I am not a fish eater but I know these items are hard to come by in all inclusives. The pasta station was our favorite. You could choose from a variety of wonderful vegetables fish and meats and he would fry them up and add pasta and sauce. The salads were also top notch as were all the fresh bread and fruit. The chocolate fountain was awesome. The deserts at this buffet were incredible. All 3 meals here were great with top notch food and service. Thank you to Marino during the Breakfast and dinner buffets. He always insured we had a table with space for moms wheelchair and always served us with a smile and some small talk. He treated my mom like a queen and we really appreciated this. Beach. Beach is GORGEOUS. The water here is blue and crisp. Beach was very windy the week we were there. They do a good job keeping it clean and free of seaweed. We did not spend too much time there with mom in a wheelchair. Rooms. Our room was 3041. Top floor by the beach. We had a semi Ocean view and a lovely balcony. We had a larger room with a suken living area. These rooms are out dated and are starting to show wear. HOWEVER. they were spotless and our chambermaid did an amazing job. Mini fridge was filled daily. Pool. Pool area was a wee bit smaller then most resorts. The main pool was large with a smaller pool next to it. Not much place for kids to enjoy. We did not have children travelling with us but I could see kids not having many places to go. Pool waiter was amazing and came by often. As with many resorts if you want a prime spot you must get there early and reserve a spot. You are not supposed to do this but everybody does and it is the only way you ensure getting a spot. With moms wheelchair we stuck to the smaller pool on the end of the row so we could store he wheelchair out of the way. I loved the smaller pool. It was so clean and rarely busy. Gym. Gym has zero A C and the weights and equipment are old and out of date. You can get a basic workout done but no more. The worst was they do not have any open windows or A CDrinks. The drinks at the pool bar were always melted by the time they got to me so my Miami vices and pina coladas were very watery. Also at the pool bar they never seem to put in any rum. Easy solution was to head to the pool bar and ask for a half cup of rum to add to my drinks. The lobby bar was AMAZING. The drinks there were some of the best I have had on vacation. The young lady working that bar was always smiling and did her job so well. Make sure to try a Miami Vice and a Caribbean orangeEntertainment Due to my moms illness she was too exhausted to view any of the nightly entertainment. But I loved listening to the live music in the lobby bar or by the buffet. Entertainment staff were always starting another activity during the day. Although we did not particiate they were fun to watch. WIFI I had a hard time getting it in my room. It would come on and then I would get booted off. But it worked great in the main lobby. I had zero issue walking down there and sitting with a drink to check e mails from home. Resort grounds This is not a big resort and that was excellent since I was pushing mom around in a wheelchair The elevators are good. The grounds are spotless and very well maintained. The gardening staff are very friendly and very hard working. Please bring them sunglasses and gloves from the dolarstore. They very much appreciate it. Staff. The staff at this resort were simply the best. Once again thank you to Nelson for making our stay wonderful and to Marino for always putting a smile on Moms face. Also thank you to the chambermaid in room 3041 for excellent service. We never had any issues with the language barrier as most spoke good English. I speak some Spanish and they loved watching me try and speak their language. Also every night they would knock on the door and offer warn clean towels. One night I needed a blanket and no kidding after calling down it was there in less then a minute. This staff here bends over backwards from the front staff to the bellboy. I did not have ONE bad experience with any staff. After this trip I am now a Riu member and plan on only staying in Rius when there is one available. This Hotel not only surpassed my expectations but it kept me wanting more.

I went there on my first trip I thought that it was maybe that week but on my recent trip it was worst. So this is my only complaint. The staff were great and the chefs were friendly and amazing the cleaning ladies whom clean the rooms were very polite and did a great job and the front desk were absolutely great.

Just back from 2 weeks here. There a number of good things and bad things about this hotel. The staff Benjamin in the pool bar was excellent and we never had a wrong drink. He even suggested new ones for us to try. Matos and Victor were good around the pool during the day. In the main buffet restaurant Joel and Michael were very good. Unfortunately in the other bars and on a night the staff were not as good. I had to send at least one drink a night back as it was normal Pepsi not diet as requested being diabetic it was a hassle. The hotel yes it is dated and needs painting the pool needs tiles replacing elevators need upgrading and the WiFi desperately needs to be upgraded. We had a broken elevator 6 of the 14 nights we were there and being on the top floor was a pain. But in all its a good hotel. Food the food was very good. We tried 3 of the 5 special restaurants. The hotel do need to invest in the restaurant by the Beach pool as the food is left out uncovered for hours. Our rep was very helpful from TuiWe had a day where it rained. thunderstormed most of it but otherwise it was gorgeous. Mosquitoes they were quite bad and unfortunately our maid kept forgetting to spray our room so I came home with about 20 bites. Make sure you check the type of electrical socket u need before u go.

I booked this trip to get away for Christmas and New YearThis place is part of the Riu group so you can be assured of a good start. You can also use the facilities at some other Riu hotels nearby. Its got a grand lobby that serves drinks and teas n coffees and is probably the only decent place to get the so called wifi. The wifi I would describe as clockwork speed is super slow cuts out and when its busy forget itYou do get a wifi signal in your room but its touch and go but my room was one of the furthest away from the lobby it may have contributed. That said you are on holiday so it should not be too much of an issue. if you NEED to get online go when everyone is at the pool. It has the Pacha night club within the Riu grounds 5 hotels and waterpark too so is great if you want to party without going to the town nearby. The standard hotel entertainment is ok but its not Las Vegas so do not complain. The drinks are pretty good lots of them branded with your own optics in the room free minibar that gets regularly stocked the food is pretty good too so as I said before Great Value. You also get FREE room service 24 hours not the full menu but its a great touchBusy. this place was busy but it was New Year and was better the second week we were there. Noisy at times with lots of families filling the pool so if you want a relaxing holiday perhaps try the Riu Macau next door. We snuck in to get some peace but there are areas away from the pool that were better. The waiters hunted you down served you drinks so you did not have to move other than go for a dip to cool down. THIS INCLUDED THE BEACH. Great to sit on the beach and get served. I loved this part of my trip it made it a holidayHunt the sun lounger. be prepared to get up early to grab your favourite place. the other option is of course pay one of the staff to grab you a spot so you can leisurely get up have breakfast and arrive at your bed no hasleBeach is amazing. lovely sand nice and long and water is a fab colour.

Nice touch from the hotel management at the end of the first week small bottle of local drink and lovely little ornaments left in room with note from management. Food varied and good choice of restaurant to cater for various taste. I am vegetarian and had not problem finding something to suit me. When sitting by the pool or on the beach drinks kept coming from extremely pleasant waiters. One in particular called Victor was the nicest waiter ever. The only 2 negative comments I would add are. The lack of Internet connection beside in the reception area and the poor English speaking of the staff in reception. The hotel could perhaps offer some lessons to their staff above all in reception.

Smiling faces and prompt attention with a genuine desire to accommodate guests needs were demonstrative. the norm. You can not fake nice and management is to be commended for the results of their hiring practices and supervision. The physical facilities offer pretty much whatever you might desire and they are kept up immaculately. The pools are spotless and the beach welcoming sandy and clean. If there is one potential downside to the beach for some it is that it is public. So be aware of your valuables just common sense really. There are plenty of lounge chairs at the beach and ample palm trees for shade when desired. One is issued a towel card per person at check in and you can exchange your towels throughout the day as often as the desire to do so takes you. The food was well above the norm for a non truly exclusive overly expensive all inclusive. If you can not find something to satisfy your desires you are really either not hungry andor not looking. The buffets have something for everyones palette. The assortments of fresh tropical fruits at all times were a treat as were the pastries. The bakers do any outstanding job on both the deserts and numerous varieties of breads. Though we sampled the specialty restaurants come early they do not take reservations and fill up quickly and were satisfied with all of those which we sampled being the Japanese Spanish Haute Cuisine French and Steak Lobster the buffets are expansive and highly diverse among their offerings. Like I said if you can not find somethings to satisfy you you are not hungry andor not looking. Made to order eggs omelettes stir fry and a host of various regions foods are on offer. The grilled BQd chicken at the pool side snack bar was surprisingly tasty and made for a pleasant and quick lunch. there is plenty of sea foods on offer as well. Burgers and fries are on offer virtually all of the time should you be traveling with childrenThe rooms renovated over the summer of 2018. are extremely well maintained by the staff they come in twice daily to clean make up the room and replenish the beverage supply in the fridge. The bar and fridge were adequately stocked with Vodka Stolychneya Rum Brugel a local DR product. though not their top label and Gin Gordons. The fridge contained a surprisingly pleasant local the most popular DR lager pilsner style beer Presidente. Unfortunately for my tastes the establishment is a Pepsi products one. there is something just wrong about making a cuba libre without Coke though you can purchase Coke at their shop. Liters of water were amply provided and refreshed as well. A footnote about water it is advisable to use bottled water in your rooms to drink and brush your teeth with. Otherwise the water served in the restaurants and the ice used for drinks are all adequately safeguarded and we experienced no gastrointestinal issues whatsoever. So relax in that regard. Please remember to tip your housekeeping staff their wages are low and they depend on gratuities and they earn the your consideration. For those whom might wish to work off some of those calories yoga classes and exercise classes in the pool at the beach and elsewhere take place at various times and those conducting them are very pleasant people. there is a sports bar with food if that is your thing the NCA Tournament was taking place while we were there and there was a contingent of Michigan State fans ensconced at the Sports Bar when we passed by. Evenings entertainment is somewhat limited this is not Broadway Vegas or a substantial cruise ship but we found some of the musical offerings pleasant and sufficiently diverse to satisfy our needs. For our trip at the end of March early April apart from a little rain a nature imposed siesta the weather was delightful. Though we did not venture in it is my understanding that the casino is operated by a separate entity so I have nothing other to add to that. For a week or so if you want to relax dine drink swim golf snorkel dive dance enjoy some excellent coffee top notch cigars etc etc this is a near perfect venue to do so. When arranging your flights be sure to fly into out of PUJ Punta Cana if you can it is much closer to the resort than STI Santiago International Airport. Regardless of whichever airport be sure to pre arrange your ground transportation and avoid the various shills that will somewhat aggressively approach you. we had booked with Coming 2 and the driver that met us was extremely pleasant while his colleague loaded our bags and we settled into the spacious van he brought us some cups of sweet black Dominican coffee.", "offset": [462, 564], "date": "2019-04-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "8e185b3a-e935-4188-8ded-732a53829d08", "sentence": "Excellent couple getaway. I just wanted to share that my wife and I had an excellent stay at RIU Palace Punta Cana. The resort was beautiful and the staff was friendly and made the stay great. Our favorite restaurants was the main dining hall and the steak house. Sandy in the main dining hall gave us top notch service for breakfast and dinner and I recommend you look him up if you staying in RIU palace. We also went to the pool parties and had a lot of fun there and recommend going to a couple if you get a chance. The jungle party was our favorite. The staff works very hard so I also would recommend tipping the staff during your stay.", "offset": [264, 406], "date": "2019-07-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}]}
