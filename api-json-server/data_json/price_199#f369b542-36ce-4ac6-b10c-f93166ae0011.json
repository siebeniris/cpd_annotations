I researched many hotels before choosing Epic because of the length of our stay. My spouse told me Kimpton was a good brand and I believed him so I booked a 7day stay here from 6 30 15 to 7 7 15. I also became a Kimpton Rewards Member before arriving. Staying at this hotel was a big mistake for the many reasons mentioned in my review. This hotel is dangerous and it is my responsibility to let travellers know what they might be in for while staying here. This was supposed to be a relaxing vacation getaway for me my daughter and my mother for her birthday. This review is based on our experiences at this hotel1There is construction going on right next to this hotel. I did not know this prior to booking. We were assigned room 2902 and after being in the room for about an hour we heard nothing but noise. I thought it was housekeeping vacuuming but no one vacuums for that long on and off. So I went out to the balcony and almost lost my hearing. I looked down to my left and sure enough a big construction project was going on. There was no way I could stand this for the duration of our stay regardless of the \u2018 view \u2019. I explained the situation to the front desk and made the decision to pack up all of our things and move to room 2918. The view was not nearly as good but at least it was quieter. 2Club Lounge was added to my stay prior to my arrival but the Club Lounge is closed for renovation. Based on the length of your stay the hotel will give you a small hotel credit for this inconvenience \u2013 but you ca n\u2019t use it at Zuma. The hotel website should state that the Club Lounge is currently closed. 3There is nothing on Kimpton \u2019s website about the construction or the Club Lounge being closed for renovation. Not professional. Now you know. 4After being in room 2918 for about 30 minutes my mother decided to take a nap. She was under the covers and I heard a loud scream. I jumped up off my bed thinking maybe she had a leg cramp. When she removed her foot from under the covers I saw blood. I almost fainted. We discovered that pieces of glass were in the bed in the sheets and she scraped her foot on the glass. She was in so much pain and all I could do was try to stop the bleeding. I called the front desk and they sent up a security guard with an old orange bag. Mind you this person had no medical expertise he was not a paramedic nor did he have any business dealing with this situation. There should have been licensed medical personnel on staff to deal with this kind of situation. The man they sent up was very unprofessional. Luckily I had a small first aid kit with me and wrapped my mothers foot. She required ice packs daily and bedrest as she could not walk on that foot for days and had to limp to the restroom. This vacation was then officially ruined. More importantly this is really a safety issue and should be investigated by the Miami Health Department. 5After the security guard left the room I asked for a manager to discuss this situation. Two people came up to the room a Mr Felix Roder Guest Service Manager and Ms Anna Hoyos Ast. Director of Housekeeping. I showed the evidence of the incident to both of these individuals. Mr Roder appeared visibly nervous about the situation and Ms Hoyos tried to \u2018 destroy \u2019 the evidence by taking the glass and rubbing parts of it in her hands. Luckily I kept evidence to protect my mother and myself. Mr Roder then offered free American breakfast to make up for this situation. I ask is free breakfast appropriate compensation for this type of incident injury. Absolutely not. She did not even eat the breakfast only a couple pieces of toast and an egg or two. Who has an appetite when they have pain and in a hotel with no way to get out. In addition Mr Roder promised my mother a 60 credit not part of the 200 for room service on the night of the incident which was never applied. She felt so bad the night of the incident she did n\u2019t want to eat. All she wanted was diet coke and hot tea. No 60 credit was added and no nights were comped. A few days later a waitress hostess at Lilt Lounge promised to deliver some cokes to the room with snacks at no charge. I waited for over an hour and nothing. I called the front desk to find out what happened and they connected me to room service. Then I was charged 25 for 4 small bottles they brought to the room. They charged me another 3 for another coke and another 3 after I checked out without my knowledge. Also as mentioned hotel credits can not be applied toward Zuma and reservations have to be made at least two weeks in advance. I \u2019l tell you the place is not hot at all \u2013 it \u2019s all talk. it is overly expensive obnoxious and my waitress spilled water all over the table and in my lap took dishes away before we were finished etc. Save your money \u2013 do n\u2019t do it. 6Before arriving I made dinner reservations for all nights of our stay but had to cancel all but two. I kept one reservation at Area 31 on the first night of our stay. I was with my daughter while my mother stayed in the room. The food is very expensive and the menu limited. For my daughter and me the bill was 1590. Ridiculous. We kept one reservation at Zuma again I went with my daughter only as my mother was unable to go due to her injury. Same thing overpriced and not worth it7We requested NO housekeeping service as we were paranoid worried about their competence. After the glass incident we had housekeeping change both beds to ensure our safety and then told them we did not want housekeeping for the duration of our stay. We kept the room as clean as possible only requesting towels water and necessities. 8I was told by several people that work at this hotel that based on our experience we should NOT have had to pay for our stay and it should have been taken care of by Kimpton. Many people could not believe what happened and said the hotel handled this situation very badly. 9Management did not do their job properly and honestly were probably scared to death about this situation. Nevertheless all I kept hearing was about the hotel \u2019s budget the 200 credit for no Club Lounge and they could n\u2019t do this or that because of the budget. Well when they get sued we will see about the budget. 10This hotel is highly overrated and I absolutely would not bring children here. There was an incident at the pool where someone intoxicated threw a drink down from his or her balcony and it hit someone down at the pool area. Terrible. A child could have been hit1This place draws a lot of \u2018 riff raf \u2019 and not the upscale clientele described in many reviews I \u2019ve read. Do n\u2019t be fooled and do your research. This is a terrible representation of the Kimpton brand and it is almost impossible to reach anyone in Corporate to get help or asistance12Don\u2019t stay here \u2013 do n\u2019t take a chance. It \u2019s not worth it. If I could have I would have changed hotels but it was too late. This was not a vacation it was a nightmare. 13I want hotel management to know that the 200 hotel credit was for the inconvenience of the Club Lounge being closed \u2013 it had nothing to do with my mother \u2019s injury and was in no way compensation for her suffering. Also free breakfast is not compensation either. It \u2019s insulting. Also I believe someone stole or through away my cell phone charger. I have a clear photo showing the charger but was told it was not there. do not leave anything of value in the room. I would like to thank some individuals that did what they could because they are good people \u2013 not because they work for the hotel \u2013 but because they were good to us and felt bad about our situation. I want to thank Natalie at Area 31 at breakfast. You are the best and I truly appreciate your kindness and understanding. I want to thank Karef Pool Manager. thanks so much and I really appreciate your kindness and professionalism. Kevin Abel and Rosie at the front desk \u2013 thank you for your help and patience. These are good people. Just because I \u2019m thanking these people does not mean I support or have any respect for this hotel. These are just good people. Juan at the pool was a jerk. The hostess at Lilt is incompetent. All hotel management including Mr Zachary Jelson are useless. I left several messages for individuals at Corporate waiting for a response. The hotel did not have proper people on staff to handle the situation and they did n\u2019t even have a wheelchair or anything for my mother to get around. I highly advise against staying at this hotel. I could n\u2019t believe our situation and still ca n\u2019t. This certainly is not a place for children. My mother is still suffering from this incident and we are going to fight for our rights. Management failed miserably. Promises were made and not kept and someone got hurt. It is not right and I do n\u2019t appreciate it one bit. I will never ever go to a Kimpton hotel again. I was so relieved when I checked out \u2013. I could n\u2019t wait to get out of there.

This hotel is officially my favorite hotel in Miami. My family and I were in Miami for work on Saturday and decided to stay the night in Miami instead of driving home to Naples. Being a Mariot snob I almost opted for the JW Mariot Marquis right across the street from Epic but glad I did not. I even opted to PAY for a hotel instead of burning some Mariot points to stay for FREE. This stay was my second stay at Epic and each time the service amenities and rooms have been five star. The bell men Archy Mauricio and pool staff Juan remembered us from last time 2 months ago. Archy bell man disappeared for a few minutes while we were getting things squared away at the front desk only to return with a Disney princess coloring package for my daughter and Hot Wheels cars for my son. The front desk staff went above and beyond to beat a deal I found online without being smug. The rooms are well appointed and clean. Nice Samsung flat screen TVs. Beds are a little on the stiff side but I use and prefer a foam mattress. The toiletries are paraben and die free which is great because we use the cleanest skin care available back at home go BeautyCounter. you will definitely want to ask for Juan at the pool but all of the guys out there are great. The pool is in the sun from morning until early evening something you will not find at the JW Mariot across the street. And you are one block from Whole Foods if you are an organic non GMO eater like us. Also do yourself a favor and visit Cviche 105 for the best Peruvian food you will find in town roughly three blocks away.

How come you have only one person managing valet us crew who by the way was far more busy worrying about his looks than anything else yet I witnessed 4 people standing around watching one person put new frames on one of the pool doors. Employees sense of belonging Obvious discontent Employees were openly critizing management desisions and very upset about these to be fair they still went out of their way to comply with requests with a smile on their face but It definitely shows a lack of leadership or at the very least a failure to communicate the rationale behind directions. Efficiency Even a six sigma amateur would have had a field day on this place with so much that can be improved upon. Let alone a green belt or good forbid a black belt. Amenities. Guest Pool. Open on Saturday and Sunday only. Food Cuban Sandwich was not the worst. closer to mediocre in all honesty unles you brought the sandwich by chopter from Cuba a 47 minute wait is an insult considering the price and the aforementioned taste. Bar. Knowledgeable good people skills and service but multi tasking can definitely use some improvement Very limited liquor variety does not match clientele target. Surcharges the hotel needs to either charge more upfront or reduce all the surcharges as in drastically. It is ridiculous that you get a 50 hold for a charger wire. not even the whole thing. yeah you have the usbs in the room but they take 2 hours to fully charge the phone that is when you charge it while turned off. whereas a fast charger takes maybe 35 minutes. No to mention that a 50 hold for something you can buy a block away in CVS for 29 is just absurd oh and they did not even have the Galaxy S8 charger USB C. the one I was offered was for Galaxy S7 and below. Toothbrush and toothpaste where like they were just shipped from county jail. The valet charge is ridiculous considering that it takes forever there is mass confusion amongst the staff as they are clearly under capacity.

Only one person working the front desk who took his sweet time checking in the family of 4 in front of us.

This was not disclosed by the hotel or through American Express we booked through so we could not have our patio doors open or be outside. 2 Area 31 is closed on the outside so no more beautiful happy hours and nights out as there used to be. You can have breakfast there but even the windows are totally blacked out who wants to eat in a place like that. Feels like you are in a strip club. 3.

Also can not use those credits at Zuma so you are left with only Area 31 the strip club restaurant. The pool bar never opened when we were there. It was very difficult to order drinks from the pool. One night they kicked everyone out of the pool before sunset as they had a private event. Again no notice of this when booking or checking in. Finally the day we left they told us we could not have a late check out even though they granted one to my in laws who were staying on the same floor. American Express called the hotel and begged but they said no. American Express gave me 100 to pay the late fee since we had to stay in the room before making our flight at 7 pm. The hotel told me I could not pay a half day fee and would have to leave the room or the police would be called. I truly could not believe a hotel that used to be so grand could stoop so low.
