The thing that made this stay particularly nice was the staff. Every encounter was lovely and friendly and even an odd request was met with accommodating cheer. The breakfast space was understaffed one morning but made up for the wait by being especially gracious. While the breakfast was very nice quality the one lunch we tried was not nice at all though again the server was warm and accommodating. Go elsewhere to properly experience Madison food scene.

I would like to mention the shuttle driver who drove the hotel shuttle to the airport at 630 AM on July 19. He checked my flight at the airport website in advance because it was raining with thunder and found that my flight from Madison to Chicago got canceled. Then he guided me to the counter of the American Airline in the airport and confirmed it together. In the meantime he called to the hotel and figure out the bus schedule to the Chicago airport. However the bus was scheduled at 11 AM. To catch up the connection flight from Chicago to Seoul Korea he informed me that the only ways are to use a cab or a uber like service. With his great help I was able to find out a ride by LIFT with my friends and arrived at Chicago OHare airport on time for the flight to Korea without a problem. I really appreciate his kindness and great help. If he had just dropped at the airport without any information about the cancellation I would not have caught up the flight departing from Chicago.", "offset": [278, 376], "date": "2019-07-13", "cpt": "4", "category": "general"}, {"id": 44, "uid": "7c74b1f4-2c9c-465b-a753-e33ca1fef042", "sentence": "Will never stay at a Hilton again because they made WiFi access so difficult.

The staff was friendly and helpful the room clean and comfortable and they even got us a crib for our toddler after they switched it out from the pack n play when I had originally requested a crib and clarified that I did not want the pack n play. But otherwise it was just OK. you are definitely paying for the Hilton name and the downtown location. The pool is exceedingly small so do not get your hopes up if you have kids. The breakfast buffet was no better than a Holiday Inn. The alarm clock was not set to the right time and did not appear to have a way to set it. And the biggest kicker when we walked out the skywalk to Monona Terrace so we could get down to the water we were locked out. The doors were clearly open to let people out but there was no way to get back in without walking outside and all the way around. Not a big deal except when we are paying that much we should be able to you know get back into our hotel. We had to actually call the front desk and talk to a girl who seemed confused and finally came out to get us. If you really want to stay in a hotel near downtown this one is OK.
