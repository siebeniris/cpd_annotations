As a Platinum Elite I have to say that this is by far one of the most disappointing hotels I have stayed in and by far the least impressive Mariot I have ever seen. The club lounge rates at the bottom of the list of all that I have visited. I read some of the positive reviews and I ca nt help but wonder if those people are staying in a completely different hotel have very low standards or perhaps I am in the only room in the hotel that has never been updated or renovated. The rooms are straight out of 190. They are old and worn and the walls are filthy. The beds are the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in. The decor is laughable. As I sit in my room and look around I see three very shabby mismatched tattered lamp shades and shabby and dingy looking carpet that I would nt dare step on with bare feet. Its probably the most depressing room I have seen. Furthermore I do nt recall ever staying in a hotel that did nt have an in room safe. I was advised that they have a safe at the front desk but who wants to run to the front desk every time they want to change jewelry or store andor retreive a wallet etc. For the price of this room 300 per night. I am completely disappointed that I did nt book the Four Seasons. Unfortunately I just checked and the Four Seasons is sold out otherwise I would be on my way out the door right now rather than typing this review. Also be aware that the belstaf tries desperately to get you to avoid using taxis and they push you to only use the cars they arrange. I found the pricing for those cars to be no less than 3 times the normal rate of a taxi and they are not towncars or any type of luxury car. Last evening I walked out to get in the taxi that was waiting out front and the doorman actually tried insisting that I wait for him to call one of his buddies to drive me. Sorry not falling for that one again. In all fairness I have to say that the lady that checked us in was excellent. At the moment she is the only positive impression I have of this hotel otherwise I would have to say I am not impressed at all and I will forgo the points and perks and chose a different hotel on my next visit to Las Colinas.", "offset": [1209, 1274], "date": "2015-09-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "5dc85051-0ab7-4ebe-95a5-3b2ca9ac3cf4", "sentence": "The hotel is dated and the room is getting tired.

My husband and I chose this hotel for our anniversary because we had stayed in this area at the Omni before and really thought it was nice. I booked the reservation online and I requested a king room with a balcony and a water view. In the notes I put that I wanted to have the highest floor possible. I downloaded the ap and went in the ap to find that they had changed it to a king room on the lowest floor available. I called the hotel to find out why it said that and they were not sure but said that they would book me on the 10th floor which was the highest they had at that moment. He said that we could see if there was anything higher the next day when we checked in. I put on the reservation that we would check in at 3 PM. We arrived at 330 PM and went to check in and I told them that I would like to see what the highest floor was available and they told me that it was the ninth floor. I told them that I was booked into a 10th floor room the day before and they told me that they did n\u2019t do that. it was the reservation agent that did that. I explained that I did not call the reservation line I called the hotel direct and they then said that the 10th Floor room was not yet ready and was still being turned. I asked him why it was not ready as I had informed them that I would be arriving at 3 PM. They told me that they could send a message to have the room expedited if I wanted to wait. We had Dinner reservations so I wanted to get checked in so that we could start getting ready so we opted to just stay with the 9th floor even though that is not what we wanted. When we arrived in our room we looked around to find that the room was very average. It is your basic bed and desk with a TV room. The balcony was large with a table and 2 chairs which was nice. We noticed that there were no robes or any other amenities that were listed on the website. Nothing was going the way that it was planned. When I asked about the robes I was told that they are something that they do not offer to everybody and that they have to be requested. On the website these amenities are listed as a room amenity it does not say that they are upon request. At this point I was truly frustrated and just not wanting to stay at this hotel. I went downstairs to let them know that I wanted to check out and just cancel my whole reservation. They informed me that if I did cancel that I would still be charged. The supervisor came over and was interested in helping make things right. She found a room on the 10th floor that she expedited to have cleaned and she had all of the amenities that were missing delivered to that room. She also went above and beyond and sent additional amenities to our room for our trouble. She definitely wanted to make sure that we had a good experience. We went to the room on the 10th floor only to find that it had a very small step out balcony.

I called downstairs and another agent answered and I asked if our original 9th floor room was available and I was told that it was not. I was told that the 5th or 6th floor where the highest floors available at this point. I went downstairs to speak with the lady that was helping me and she said that the 9th floor room was available. She gave us the keys to that room which is where we stayed for the night. Again the room was very average so if you \u2019re looking for a luxurious room then you will not find it here.
