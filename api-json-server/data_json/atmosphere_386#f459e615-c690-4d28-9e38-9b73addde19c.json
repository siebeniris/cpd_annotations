When we arrived the young black haired Caucasian with glasses at the front was short with us and rudely spoken. We got our keys and went straight to get something to eat and bring back. we arrived 40 mins later back the hotel. When we brought our luggage up and opened the door what we found was saddening. Crumbs on the floor and stains. a bad musky smell along with stains on the beds. we went straight to the front immediately and asked if we could have our money returned and we would look for a hotel elsewhere. once again the young man at the front was rude and tried in Noway to help us he told us he could move us to another room and if we left we would still be charged 50 percent of one night and that we had been their an hour already. I pleaded with him that we had went first to get something to eat and had not seen the room till now and he would not listen. So another guy from the front desk took us to show us another room which when he walked in with us I immediately showed him a threading needle laying on the floor and once again looked like the room had not been cleaned properly and was in pot condition. And I was very upset this time and I told him please return our money and he refused. So we lost 530 dollars and we did not even stay. me and my wife have never experienced anything like this with a hotel or even remotely close to this in our life. we are sorry to post this but we were done very wrong and we would like to advise anyone else to be very cautious and check your room immediately when you go to this hotel or they will put you in bad conditions and still takeyour money and claim you have been their an hour already.", "offset": [1309, 1422], "date": "2015-05-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b6f91790-93ce-4adc-b404-c5fc65919ee1", "sentence": "the renovations have not reached the floor and room i was asignedthis review is from what i experienced not what i could have experiencedgod Has its own parking garage.

The hotel when I stayed was under construction in places. It had some signboards of what was coming soon that I did not get to experience. However I dug the old fashioned vibe of the room and it was VERY clean. The only real downside to the room was that the folks next door were incredibly loud and the walls are just so thin. Also could hear a lot of noise outside in the neighborhood. The hotel recommended a cafe next door for meals which was very good loved the brunch. This is not somewhere to stay if you are looking for a plush experience. it is very boutique and hip. The view was also really nice could see downtown and the hillside with the Hollywood sign and the Griffith observatory. Could definitely use some improvements but seems like they are working on it. Would stay again to see what the post construction improvements are like.

After reading a lot of negative reviews about this hotel I was hesitant about booking but I am one who likes to experience things for myself and said why not. After my experience at the Mayfair I do not understand one bit why this hotel has so many bad reviews. I think that the bad reviews are due to the lack of research guests put in before booking the hotel. Yes they are under construction so of course the place is not going to look it is best but I was not uncomfortable and it did not hinder my stay or experience. I think a lot of guests who go into booking this hotel and complain are the same people who are looking for convenience. There is no restaurant bar pool or gym but I was completely fine with that because a hotel for me is just a place to sleep. My boyfriend and I were attending The Classic West music festival at Dodgers Stadium and we were out or the room for most of the day. so all we needed it for was to sleep and shower. And to comment on the bathroom yes it is small and the doors will lead you to mistakenly think that the doors lead into a closet rather than a bathroom but it serves its purpose. There are also neighboring restaurants that are in walking distance. I thought it was fun because it forced up to walk around and not just stay inside the hotel for food and entertainment it was our own mini adventure. Overall my stay was enjoyable with no complaints. I hope to book another stay once renovations are complete. The room I booked was a king bed for 2. The interior design and decor was simply beautiful. I love love loved the black and white color scheme. There is only valet parking available bu there is a parking lot literally across the street so its not too much of an inconvenience. 20 a day. There was only one working elevator during renovations but for me it was not an inconvenience I have enough patience to wait.
