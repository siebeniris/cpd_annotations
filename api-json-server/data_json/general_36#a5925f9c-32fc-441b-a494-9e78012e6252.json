The lobby is beautiful as is the lounge and the gym is fantastic. For 1595 per night there should be a level of expectation from this brand besides a view of the water. The outside of the hotel is a glorified motel. The pool chairs are beat up and ragged the pool itself is the size of most motel pools and there is no adults only pool so essentially the pool is a childrens urine soaked playground. The hot tub also was filled with children the entire time of our stay. The room 1595 for the most boring tattered room I have ever stayed in. I have paid rates like this for some of the top finest hotels in the world and this was a crime a joke and a total shame. The carpet was gross the bed did not even seem like a King. The pillows were so old feeling it was like sleeping on a piece of paper it was so feather thin. No extra pillows in the room. Bathroom The biggest insult of all the shower is so tiny and I weigh 12 lbs and I felt cramped in it. The bath tub and its stained disgusting bottom was unusable and old and as you can see in my photos the lovely rusted bath tub item how inviting. The toilet is in an even smaller closet good luck not hitting your knees when closing the door in there. The curtains in the room were ripped and junky looking see photos. The staff are all very friendly the food was nothing special. I would have given this hotel a 5 star rating but I am disgusted appalled and this hotel should be ashamed of themselves for charging 1595 per night for this tattered room and zero privacy as the pool is right over you with screaming children all day long. Worst room in a Four Seasons I have ever been in and the highest priced. I guess the joke is on us for being the suckers who paid it.", "offset": [1203, 1307], "date": "2015-01-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "69f84323-8d08-47ec-9a1e-cf51e74a38d2", "sentence": "Superb Four Seasons staff and service building not so much.

Our family had the distinct pleasure of spending our three day getaway at the Four Seasons Palm Beach. I knew we were in the right place when we walked through the entrance. The lobby area was very inviting. We were met with a smile and a very efficient registration process. Dining recommendations were provided and any questions we had were answered promptly. Our room was a full beach view and the view was amazing. It overlooked the beautiful pool area and as the room type infers a gorgeous view of the beach. It was so pleasant to sit on the balcony and watch listen as the waves came rolling in. It was a great place to enjoy our coffee in the morning and a glass of wine before retiring for the evening. During our stay we used both the pool area and the beach area. Both were well kept and comfortable. The service provided at the pool was outstanding. Sunscreen towels chair covers cold water etc were all provided. Christopher was especially attentive. We ate polside one afternoon and were pleased with the prompt service as well as our selections. Our evening dining experiences were outstanding. The menu offerings in the main dining room made it hard to make a choice. Our party all tried different items so that we could experience as many as possible. The service was impeccable. We enjoyed dinner so much the first evening that we went back the next evening and were once again wowed by the service and our selections. And of course our wait staff remembered us. true to the Four Seasons way. We totally enjoyed our stay and have recommended the property to others. We look forward to our next stay. Our room was large and comfortable. We especially liked the huge bathroom. The housekeeping staff did an outstanding job.

We recently spent 6 days at the Four Seasons Palm Beach. We were looking for a quick getaway from the cold and based on our stay at the Miami Four Seasons I \u2019m afraid to say we did n\u2019t have high expectations. Let me say that this hotel is nothing like the Miami location and this vacation was much more than what we expected. Before our arrival the front desk reservations and concierge staff were all very accommodating with their information. I have dealt with a lot of concierge departments and this one was amazing with prompt and helpful responses. Reservations department were gracious to honor our February rate when we had to move our vacation up to March due to a home emergency. Arrival to the hotelWe used the hotel limo service for our pick up from Fort Lauderdale airport. The rate is 209 for arrival and 19 for departure includes tax and gratuityCheck in was fast and friendly. The first person we met at valet was a fellow Canadian Roy from Montreal. The friendliness of the staff starts and ends at the valet area. They are all very good and helpful in getting the house car to take us to a few local places including the Palm Beach Zoo \u2013 thanks to the driver Peter. Our room was not available because it was still very early so they kindly provided us a coupon booklet with 10 off in the boutique free cocktails and a few other things. This was the start of what would be a wonderful stay. We booked using What a Hotel website and were given the FS preferred partner benefits including a 75 breakfast credit does not include tax or gratuity which is an extra charge 100 spa credit or Swell boutique and a room upgrade. The hotel is beautiful very charming low key but luxurious. I do not think the common areas need any updating but the rooms are slightly dated. But they are still very nice and only the carpets really need replaced. The furniture is still lovely and timeless. The bathrooms are lovely and the checkered tile floors are stunning. We were told they are doing renovations to the rooms in 2016. We were upgraded to a premier ocean view due to an issue with elevator noise in our first partial ocean view room. Irena was very good at handling this situation. In Room 453 you could hear the elevator hydraulics and feel a rumbling in the wall behind the bed. It would have made us crazy by the end of the week so we asked to be moved and were dealt with quickly. ThanksThe premier view was very nice and we would love to return to this category of room next time if we can. Restaurants. Room ServiceWe ate all meals at the hotel except one lunch on Worth Avenue and were impressed with Graze and Jov\u00e9 Kitchen and Bar. Our lunch at Atlantic restaurant was n\u2019t that great but our server was very good. Maybe we ordered the wrong items mahi mahi tacos and crispy shrimp with papaya. Graze breakfast is fresh and plentiful. The servers are fast and efficient. The breakfast buffet had everything you would want and the croissants were some of the best we \u2019ve had. Graze lunches were more impressive with fresh salads and yummy desserts. The crab avocado salad stands out and the key lime tart. Jov\u00e9 was outstanding. The Bar area is fun and relaxed and the bar tenders are all lovely charming and good at their craft. They have a happy hour menu from 430 pm to 630 pm It \u2019s is n\u2019t that extensive but there were a couple of nice selections. The fried pasta bar snacks are very interesting and addictive to say the least. Special thanks to Evan Matthew Nathan and Marcus who made this a memorable stayWe ate dinner 3 nights at Jove and 2 nights at the bar area. Our server Rick was very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. The burata appetizer and the pastas are all very good the Kurobuta pork tenderloin Prime Teres Majorbef and Veal Milanese were incredible. Each night our bar tenders would tell us what to order and all times they were right on the mark. The manager Karma was super kind to us on our last night and sent over dessert and glasses of wine. The hostesses were all lovely and sweet especially Nora and should be complimented as well. Room service was really good as well. Special hello and thanks to the manager Alesandro for being so kind and helpful. The Pool and BeachThere were no issues with getting a chair by the pool or on the beach the week we were there. Again the staff were all excellent lovely accommodating. In particular Pascale Federico Julio and the Manager Chris. They will help you any way you need your chair moved and even if you want to move around from Beach to Pool and back. There was never any issue and only lovely smiling faces and interesting conversation. Please do n\u2019t forget to tip your pool beach staff they work very hard. The Swell Boutique is cute and has a nice selection of high end stuff. Elena was super welcoming and helpful in our selections. Overall this hotel stands out from our other Four Seasons experience because the staff were all very approachable and accommodating in a very relaxed comfortable way. It did n\u2019t feel fake or forced it just felt right.

Not my usual Four Seasons experience. My mom I just returned from a long weekend in Palm Beach and we were so excited to have a girls weekend at the Four Seasons Palm Beach. We did not mind the high priced room knowing that it was peak season in an already inflated market. Four Seasons bought an existing hotel years ago and kept the mid century charm renovating the interiors so the majority of the property is stunning and it is small size makes it feel intimate. It was the mixed service that we received and the lack of pizaz in the rooms that left us feeling like this property is not quite up to the standards of its sister properties around the world. We had a room overlooking the pool with a direct view of the ocean on the 4th top floor. it is what they would consider their premium room. It had a great view of the water but was surprisingly located over the restaurants. Seems like all of the rooms are though given how the hotel is shaped like a U. The room was a great size but had a small bathroom and only one sink. Beds were comfy and we slept great just nothing uber special to warrant such a high price tag. The service around the pool was great as well as at breakfast each morning. Mark welcomed us each day at the front door with a huge smile. I would say our biggest huh would be housekeeping. We had put in a request for housekeeping to do turndown while we were out to dinner the first night and they came while we were getting ready. We kindly asked for them to come back and they did. No problem. I called to ask that for the next few nights they come at a specific time and was told no problem. The next day we were out and came back to get ready for dinner at 6 pm and the room had already been turned down. I called again was told so sorry we will make a note for tomorrow evening. The following night guess what \u2026 same thing. I guess they want to get in and out as fast as possible and not really when their guests request it. The other service issue we had was with the house car. The hotel is not in a location convenient to Worth Avenue where the restaurants and shops are so be prepared to either rent a car and pay for parking at the hotel of course or pay in taxis. The hotel has a prearranged fare set with a taxi company 30 each way for a 10 15 minute ride. OR you can try to call the ONE house car to come pick you up. We were lucky to get the car come pick us up a few times to be squeezed in with other guests. On one occasion after waiting an hour for the car when we were told 20 minutes we asked why the hotel does not have multiple cars especially during such a busy travel period and a wedding at the property and the kid driving responded Well the hotel feels that this is complimentary and you are welcome to call a cab. REALLY. I am also able to take my business to another property that would be more conveniently located and I am sure would value our business.", "offset": [1967, 2021], "date": "2015-04-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "013fd1d0-fce4-4551-b05c-11b9fceb2c6f", "sentence": "Good property but not great. Stayed at the Four Seasons over Easter weekend. We were looking for a property that offered a relaxing beach setting with great service a traditional strength of the Four Seasons. First off I really liked the architecture and decor of the property. While I can see why some would regard it as dated I think its both classic and elegant also impeccably maintained. The floral arrangements here are particularly good even when compared to other FS properties. The rooms could probably use a bit of a tech upgrade the lighting is a little dated and my room had no ceiling lights leaving it somewhat dim with only floor lighting to rely on. Media inputs for a larger more modern TV would be nice to have although not essential. Dining options include 3 restaurants. Graze is good at least above average. while ABG and Jove are mediocre at best. So dinner at the hotel is best avoided. Room service was disappointing although the menu virtually mirrors that of Graze there was a marked quality differential in the execution of meals ordered. Breakfast was a huge disappointment with both the a la carte and buffet options on par with your typical greasy spoon diner. Although breakfast mains start at 16 for some reason the Four Seasons believes it can get away with charging 9 for an espresso. It is cheaper to get an imported beer bottomless fresh juice or just about any other beverage then a cup of coffee. On the contrary food in downtown Palm beach is fabulous with many options to choose from. Service is good but compared other FS property it was certainly below par. The problem is with the rank and file employees who appear to be somewhat incapable of independent thought. While newbies will appreciate the free snacks and drink samples doled at the pool your unique problem is unlikely to be solved. I happened to have stepped in some pool side gum left behind by a less than courteous guest. When I informed the nearby pool employee of my predicament he looked at me bewildered and did not know how to respond. I had to get a manager to find someone to bring me a paper towel and clean up the gum. Confirming a restaurant reservation took two trips to the concierge and a cumulative 30 minutes of my time. The complimentary town car arrived 10 minutes later than promised. Again no deal breakers here and its not for a lack of trying on the part of the staff but the professionalism that their other properties such as those at Whistler Toronto Paris or New York offer is sorely lacking. The pool itself is noisy due to the large number of families with young children around. The Four Seasons provides a relatively quiet Adults section which is great but an out of sight out of mind issue is the result so you get far less attention from the staff. I had to assist an older couple with their umbrella as their was no one available and ordering a drink would require you to get up and try and flag someone down from the main pool area. The spa facilities are good. Well laid out with silent treatment rooms and good amenities. The treatment I had was somewhat lackluster although that largely depends on who you are assigned. For the same money choosing this property over Eau would be a coin flip. However since the Four Season is usually priced 60 higher Eau is where the smart money is at. Novices will certainly appreciate the signature Four Seasons service the complimentary treats for your special occasion children pets. The fact that everyone at least tries really hard to provide good service the flowers the cleanliness etc. While veterans will be left wanting for the better experience offered at many of their other locations.", "offset": [1066, 1190], "date": "2015-04-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "f8951f6d-2ccf-4fd1-8167-0ead3186e906", "sentence": "Delightful Memorial Day Weekend.

The showers had six or seven heads that sprayed you all over. They had complimentary razors to use along with shaving cream also body wash shampoo conditioner and body lotion all by LOcitane in the showers. This place is total pampering. My two daughters had manicures. One was offered a mimosa during her manicure. The other whom is expecting any day now was sent a pregnancy body pillow to our room for her enjoyment. Nice touch Four Seasons. The room was well appointed. Robes in the room for your use. LOcitane products for your use. The only thing besides our key not working and making FOUR trips to the front desk that was a disappointment was the food. We tried the calamari in Jove and sent it back. My daughter had been craving calamari and it was a disappointment. She thought they should take it off their menu. We ordered their margarita pizza and that was heavenly. Later in the evening we ordered two burgers to share between the three of us. We ordered it medium and both were more on the rare side. Both burgers were very dry though. I know lean is good but when you order a burger it should be juicy. One side we ordered the fries were very good. The other side fruit was very good too. Great selection of fruit. They have a Florida resident rate being offered for the summer right now along with some spa specials.

They rake up the seaweed that drifts in every morning really interesting to see them dig holes and bury the seaweed under the sand. The groundsworkers work very hard. Spa. Spa service was fine nothing special they do during nail service. The massage was excellent although my massage therapist was moving to another state. Even if you are not getting service any guest is permitted to use the spa area and the relaxation rooms are quiet good place to lay down for a bit after you use the steam room. They have little snacks in the waiting room like dried fruit and nuts. Nice touch. I was hoping for a dry sauna but that is located in the fitness area locker room on a different floor so I never got to use it. That would have really made the spa a 5 star for me. Rooms. Nice and clean although beds were a bit sagy and my back hurt in the mornings. I was hoping for some little chocolates at turn down service but they only gave water bottles. Had a nice welcome fruit basket upon arrival with a personal note nice touch. I will definitely go back again. did not take my kids this time not sure if I will take them next time or if they will have fun as there is not much to do at the resort for them. it is mostly RR which I really needed.", "offset": [458, 571], "date": "2015-07-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "bbb1b3fe-5ccb-4f4c-be17-e686e60dac8f", "sentence": "Excellent service and hotel stay here.

Umbrellas set towels delivered and cold ice waters brought right away. See my posted pics for beach side menu. The beach was well groomed and clean. Great sand and water.

It literally is steps to the beach and they offer complimentary sun screen and aloe vera along with Fruit infused ice water. We had an ocean view room that was fully stocked with anything you could ask for in a mini bar and snacks. The restaurant Graze onsite had an awesome Sunday brunch like no other I have had with a huge buffet plus you choose a full entre after you have made your rounds through the buffet which had ice cold crab claws on it that were delish. The water sports onsite were a blast also. They have paddle boarding jet skis WOW banana boat ride mini sailboats and tubes for rent. Down on the beach you can enjoy family style beach or the Adults only side for your quiet beach enjoyment. They even have an onsite complimentary daycare that you can check your kids in and out of for however long you want which do activities with the kids and there is a full room with games books video games etc to entertain them. They also provide a complimentary shuttle to take you shopping or to a convenient store if needed. Bottom line is you can not go wrong staying here.

My family and I stayed at this resort for the first time over the 4th of July holiday. The staff were very professional and warm. We found the rooms to be impeccable and nicely updated. While the hotel is not new it is very well maintained. The color schemes are all muted and calming. The feel is definitely older crowd and while there were children present the pace is FAR different that the South Miami Beach vibe we have been used to. The beach outside the pool area was pristine and perfect for swimming. I love the blue green hue of the waters in south florida and the Four Seasons beach has it in spades. The food was average to good. AND VERY EXPENSIVE. We stay regularly in luxury resorts but for the price I would expect a far better selection fresher quality and larger portions. The wifi was slow unles you paid a significant uncharge for higher speed PER DAY. That seems wrong for a hotel in this class. The 29 a day valet service is fast and friendly. But several of the valets seemed too eager to collect tips whether dropping or retrieving the car. This was annoying but typically valet us in this class of service do not give such impressions. Any shopping or restaurants are a mile away and so driving is a necessity which requires frequent valet use. If you retrieve your car 2 times a day and drop 5 for each pick up and drop you can add 20 a day to the 30 mandatory valet parking. That s 50 a day. Great hotel. Expensive amenities. Will return. The hotel was pristine. Well maintained. Great staff. Beautiful beach. Great rooms and comfortable beds. Nice quiet location. Beautiful beach. Service on beach was slow but good.

First off the staff are some of the most genuine kind and likable people I have ever come across in my entire life. Every single one of them who I had the pleasure to communicate with were not only professional but as real as they come. Nothing but impressed by ALL of them. Jason one of the bartenders outside was awesome at explaining the surrounding area after telling him I was planning on moving to West Palm Beach. The other male bartender who worked the outdoor bar his name escapes me was also an outstanding staff member who truly cared about his customers and you can tell he is an excellent father to his children. The girls at the front desk were also very nice and went out of their way not once but twice to enhance our stay. At Flories the hotels FINE dining restaurant the staff was all around phenomenal. Stanley our waiter for dinner was a fantastic and professional server who has excellent knowledge of quality food and drink treated us like family. Flories has truly unique and stunning dinner options with an abundance of different dishes that could please anyone with a pallet for fine foods. Another server there she was from Romania is another staff member we connected with and made us feel right at home. The dessert at Flories was to die for and we ended up trying three of them and all were top notch. The breakfast at Flories was also well above average when its comes to quality and selection. In addition the pool and beach area were also great and we enjoyed chilling there when we had the time. For the size of the resort they utilize it perfectly and it feels more personable then some other larger resorts i have stayed at in the past. We loved our rooms comfortable beds quality televisions fantastic modern bathrooms and a balcony with an awesome view even in the least expensive room at the resort. I have stayed at 5 star hotels resorts in the New York area California the Caribbean and Hawaii and the service and kindness of the staff HERE beats them all. Everyone from the valet guys to the housekeepers to the chef who made my breakfast were beyond impressive. This hotel has officially raised the bar when it comes to quality of employees. NEVER have I seen such a gracious respectful and just plain happy staff anywhere. I could continue complimenting the Four Seasons at Palm Beach for another three paragraphs it was that amazing. God bless all of the staff at the hotel and whoever is responsible for hiring at the resort deserves a raise. Simply Exceptional wish I could give it six stars. Will be returning again multiple times in the future. Truly a wonderful experience even for the price. If you are a people person you will want to be here.

The staff were amazing. It was my son \u2019s 2nd birthday during the holiday he they all made it so special for him. They could n\u2019t have done more for us. The food was excellent. We ate several times in both the pool bar restaurant. Again the staff were excellent. They also made up whatever cocktail I requested despite it not being on the menu. The pool was lovely. There are 2 pools one aimed at adults only. Great temperature a great size. We spent extra on an ocean view king as we would be stuck on that balcony during my son \u2019s nap bedtime so wanted somewhere nice to sit watch the sea. When we arrived we were very disappointed with the view picture attached below. If you hung over the balcony looked to the right you could see the sea. but that \u2019s not why I call ocean view. I would n\u2019t even accept that as partial ocean view. We did eventually question our ocean view they found a room overlooking the pool that also had a sea view so we moved there were much happier. They were also renovating which I was n\u2019t told until after I booked. They did an excellent job of hiding this. The only time we could even tell was when we were in our room as you could hear the drilling. The reason I \u2019ve put this in the negative part of the review is that the drilling would start at 8 am which would frighten my son in the morning and I feel this was too early.", "offset": [1131, 1224], "date": "2019-08-08", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}]}
