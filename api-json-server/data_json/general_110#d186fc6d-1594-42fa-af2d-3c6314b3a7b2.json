I am a travel agent and was fortunate enough to get an agent rate at this property. The location is great right near one of the many squares and close to lots of shopping and restaurants. A cab ride from the airport should only be about 20 25 AUD which was very reasonable. Immediately upon arrival we were greeted my concierge agent Ric. He was very speedy to pick up our luggage and spent almost 15minutes letting us know all about the city. This type of service is always appreciated as a tourist in a new city. Our room was not ready immediately but the front desk was very apologetic about this and even gave us some complimentary wine while we waited which was not expected but a very nice gesture. The rooms were spacious and clean and beds were extremely comfortable. The room was also very quiet as well which is a big priority for me. They have a nice lap pool steam room sauna and spa. All in great working order well maintained and clean. I used the facilities every day. WiFi was very fast even though we had several devices on it.

When we first arrived we were met with a friendly smile and the staff could not do more to accommodate our early arrival. We were provided with a key to the 3rd floor which happened to be a disabled room. We were fine with the room upon first entering but unfortunately things went downhill from there. The door to the room constantly rattled so much so we thought someone was knocking or worse trying to force their way in and this continued all night. Also the shower was almost useless there was no actual water pressure at the shower head so the water would dribble out which made it interesting when trying to shower. The shower curtain was about 15 cm off the floor and so when you did have a shower it wet the whole room. I can understand the need for people in wheelchairs. etc but I do think it is a safety hazard trying to maneuver around on wet tiles. There was no hope of recycling the towels as they were required to soak up the wet floor after each shower. One tip make sure you chose a pillow from the pillow menu as the ones provided are quite hard and after the fist night I had a sore neck.

All along every team member went above and beyond their call of duty to make sure I was looked after. got me glass of water coffee guided me to the bathrooms lift etc nothing was too much for anything. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Oh one small thing could housekeeping please check the clocks for alarms when cleaning rooms I was startled by a 070 am alarm. It was lucky I had awoken at 0630 so I was already awake because being woken up at 7 am if I had gone to bed late or was planning a long sleep in would have put me in a bad mood or could have damaged my health. it is weird though as I had completely unplugged the clock from power to plug in my phone charger so I do not know how the clock had power in it to alarm at 070. It had no time displayed on its face.
