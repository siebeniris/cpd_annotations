Stayed here twice both times were for my company \u2019s annual DD Plan to stay at Siam Kempinski was opted out as the price quoted to me to upgrade as single occupancy was far too high. So what \u2019s good in Centara Central World. I got this confused with Centara Watergate which is quite nearby. so make sure that you do not give the wrong Centara to your driver. This hotel reminds me of Hyat Kuala Lumpur where the front desk is located at the upper floor. Frankly speaking I am not attracted to such hotels. I believe there is a purpose to this arrangement but I prefer a straight access from ground floor front desk up to room. Due to time constraint with a DD event squeezed in on the 1st night followed by major shopping days I only have the time to take one picture of the room. Even though we had an extra large bed I find it to be slightly cramped. My partner agreed too and this is not the first time we slept together on an extra large bed. To be honest the only thing I loved and looked forward to was the huge round bath tub right in the middle of the washroom I almost bang my head for forgetting to take picture of the only thing I loved. It was huge enough to fit both of us in with legs extended. I heard some of my colleagues got a common long bath tub next to the window but I prefer the one that I had. You just got to fit yourself in to believe me. I would give a 5star rating just for the bath tub. oh and the great shower head too. In general the room was clean even though it looked rather old and tired. Wifi connection was good with no signal breakage. Both times here I stayed for 3D2N I did not have the time to check the pool and other facilities. Food wise I only tried the breakfast once which I think it was quite ok with international buffet spread. I am not sure of the breakfast rates in most of Bangkok hotels but I was charged S75 for an additional person. I did not register my partner for the stay thus I have to pay for his share. As for the location this hotel is centrally accessible in between the major malls. You just have to walk and walk. I could not find a direct link from Centara to Central World. Perhaps there is one but the nearest fastest way for me was to come out from the hotel \u2019s main entrance and entered the very first entrance next door to your left which looks like an office lobby you have to cross the small road for the hotel \u2019s carpark to get to the next door entrance. The service rendered by the staffs overall was just average. It took quite long for my coffee to arrive during breakfast but it was acceptable as the restaurant was flocked mainly by my company \u2019s staff at the same time. During checked out I was the only guest at the counter with 4 working staffs but I was kept waiting for over 10 minutes. There is this really big full length windows behind the front office counter which brings in strong sun rays at noon. So it was not comfortable for me when I was standing there. I did told one of the staffs if I could wait at another corner but she told me to wait and it took like another 5 minutes. As for the housekeeping I requested for another towel and it was delivered in less than 20 minutes. Would I pay on my own to stay at Centara again. I guess with the same price I would like to try another place. I am giving 3 stars based on my short experience in the hotel.", "offset": [664, 817], "date": "2016-10-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "b87b6f25-6a44-461d-91af-c2d3ba0e5a73", "sentence": "Lunch on 24th flr.

Hi everyone let us start with our experience of the Centara Grand Central World. For us it was out first time in Bangkok and we honestly did not know what to expect. After reading the reviews and watching numerous YouTube clips we arrived with open eyes ready to see Bangkok in all its glory. It started off with our cab ride from BK to Centara Grand. We arrived at 50pm on a Sunday and it took 1hour to get to Centara Grand along the freeway. Our cabie was a 72yr old and was so knowledgeable about Bangkok and so friendly. We arrive at Centara Grand just after 60pm and were greeted on the ground floor by the bell hop who took our bags and directed us to the lifts to the 23rd floor this is where the hotel reception is located. Upon arrival on the 23rd floor we are again greeted by very courteous doormen who direct us to the reception desk. We check in and were upgraded to a World Club Suite on the 45 floor with an amazing view of the city at no extra charge from a Superior basic room. This was really great as the hotel was pretty fully booked with a couple of huge conferences going on at the Bangkok Convention Centre. Please be aware that this hotel is located as part of the Bangkok Convention Centre and there is always big conferences planned and held here. This however did not bother us and even though there was 3 huge conferences on and the hotel was pretty much fully booked you would not have known as there was heaps of space and the restaurants and bars were always available for use without being overcrowded. LOCATION. The Centara Grand is very centrally located in Bangkok and is in within easy walking distance of major shopping complexes like Central World Siam Paragon MBK and Big C Supercentre. It is also very conveniently located next to the BTS and public transport services to get around the city. We walked everywhere or caught taxis. ROOM World Club Suite was amazing with a huge king size bed that was very comfortable to sleep in. We were on the 45th floor and had amazing views over the city. The bathroom was perfect with a huge shower and bath and all the necessary things you require to get clean after a humid day exploring Bangkok. RESTAURANTS. We had breakfast included in our room price and it was held every morning in the World Restaurant and I have to say each morning the breakfast was very good. There was a lot of variety and all food palates were catered for with Western Asian and European cuisine on offer. There were cook to order stations for eggs and pastries like waffles pancakes etc. Other restaurants bars we tried were the Uno Mas where we got complimentary wine sangria and tapas one evening which was really nice. We walked around the Red Sky Bar one night and planned to have a meal and drinks there the following night but as is Bangkok the tropical monsoon blew in and the bar was closed due to the rain. The Red Sky Bar did look very funky with a resident DJ playing and some fantastic views over the city. TIPS Transportation Tip do not use the tuk tuks as they try to rip you off use cabs as they are so cheap and use the meter. Tuk Tuk drivers will always try to con you and they are pretty insistent. Just walk past them and wave your hand gesturing NORestaurants A great tip for eating is to use the Central World Shopping complex. It is also part of the Centara Grand and you can access over 70 different restaurants at far cheaper prices that you would pay at Centara Grand. Swensens is a great ice cream parlour and is located on Level 6 of Central World not to far from the Centara Grand. Central World. To access Central World Shopping Complex from Centara Grand is very easy you go from reception on Level 23 through to the Bangkok Convention Centre lifts and then press level 7 and get out of the lift and walk about 25 metres through the car park and straight into Central World. The great thing by entering the shopping complex from this way is that you are so close to the supermarket and its excellent for groceries like drinking water and snacks. Changing Money When you have landed at BK and after you have gone through immigration and cleared customs go down to the bottom level to where the airport train is and you will find all the money exchange booths. We used Superich green booth and Value Plus red booth as they offer the best exchange rates and at far better rate than the other banks located in the airport. Then you can either catch the train or a taxi to Bangkok city. All in all I can thoroughly recommend staying at Centara Grand at Central World in Bangkok as it is good value a great central location and has so much to offer any type of traveller.

The property is very well located in heart of Bangkok. The biggest advantage is the mall which is connected to the hotel from the inside. The hotel has 3 sets of lifts to access 3 areas of the hotel 1 is from the entrance on the ground floor 3 lifts to the reception check in lobby. Next set is 4 lifts which go to the room floors and rooftop. The last set is 6 lifts going to the parking lot and the mall. The mall is also connected through escalators and a long walk way. Was here for a BNI convention. It has very large convention halls which can accommodate a very large gathering. But the flip side is the 4 lifts going to the rooms. There are very slow and not adequate and can not handle the large crowd which collects together post the conference hours and breaks. The wait for the lift was more than 6 mins at times. Was very frustrating The hotel is designed for large conferences but lacks the basic infrastructure of quantity of lifts. The coffee shop has a good elaborate spread for breakfast with 3 Indian dishes too. The taste is very average of the Indian dishes. The staff is very courteous and polite. I loved their Pickwick Lemon green tea bags. The room and bathrooms are big and spacious. Enjoyed the bathtub with their bath salts. The water pressure for shower was very good. You can ask for a clothes iron if required. There is a hair dryer in the bathroom and with all standard amenities both in the bathroom and room. The metro stations are a 5 min walk on either side.
