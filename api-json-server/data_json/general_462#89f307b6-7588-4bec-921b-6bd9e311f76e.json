This is a different type of review for me because I am used to leaving very positive reviews. My family and I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Atlanta Perimeter while our home was undergoing repairs. The hotel had pretty good reviews however my experience was a little less than average. So I check in and the front desk person writes the wrong room number on the key card envelope. This was quickly corrected. We go to the room on the 2nd floor and it looks nothing like the renovated rooms that were advertised. The room was old very dimly lit and just felt creepy. I immediately called the front desk and asked to be moved to a renovated room. The front desk promptly took care of this request and moved us to the 3rd floor. We open the door to a very nicely renovated room and it reeks horribly of Marijuana. I could not believe it. I immediately called the front desk and asked to be moved once again. They gave us another renovated room on the 3rd floor. 3rd times the charm. The room was nice and comfortable however the hall reeked of Marijuana the entire stay. The fire alarm actually went off the next night because someone was smoking Marijuana in their room. There were tons of No Smoking signs throughout the hotel but I guess that did not matter. There were definitely some sketchy patrons visiting this hotel so we definitely will not go back. Not what I had expect in Dunwody. I can not believe they are able to charge what they charge.

We were not told that the TV was inoperable before we checked in and there was no posts or notices about the satellite cable not working. We had to call the front desk to find out why the TV was not working. Then 20 minutes after we got in our room the room next door had a smoke alarm that went off all night for over an hour and when we called the front desk they told us it was being taken care of. 30 minutes went by and the loud smoke alarm was still going off in the room next door. We called back again the front desk agent basically told us it was not our concern because it was the room next door which was unprofessional. However the alarm was so loud you could hear it in the hallway and we could not even turn the TV on to drown the sound out. We had only booked one night and got to the room at midnight after a holiday party and now we can not watch tv and we can not sleep and enjoy the stay because of the alarm. Management was not available the whole night. We called and complained at the front desk so much that the agent discounted our stay and also offered us a full refund if we wanted to check out and stay somewhere else for the night but it was after 1 am and I was too tired to check out so we accepted the discounted rate. We were there about 8 hours and checked out at 10 am. Now I look at my card a few days later and they have charged me an extra 250. I called the hotel and they front desk rep told me there was damage to the room which I knew was a lie because I checked the room before we left and there was no damage. So I called corporate and the corporate agent informed me that she was told by the hotel rep that it was because illegal substance was smoked in the room which was also a big fat lie. We did not smoke in the room. So what is it doubletree dunwody. room damage or illegal substance. it is all a lie and made up so they can charge me extra. And I was never contacted about such a thing and the only reason I found this out was by checking my card and seeing the 250 charge and calling the hotel and corporate to inquire.

I am not sure I can even get through the number of things that were not to standard during my visit. I prefer to write glowing reviews but this DoubleTree made it very hard to say anything positive. Arrived around 330 pm and room was just being cleaned. Were allowed to check in when done around 20 minutes before normal check in time. Front desk was efficient at check in no problems. When I booked a King 2 Room Suite I guess I was expecting it to be one suite with a door to the bedroom. This is not the case. It is basically two hotel rooms with the bedroom bathroom mini frig etc a normal king room. plus if you open the door the other room is the Suite part with pull out couch kitchen area etc. The amount of space overall was exactly what I was looking for. Very roomy. The problem is that the attention to detail and functionality was completely missing. I was using the pull out couch but to do that I had to try to shove the round coffee table over and it has a marble top so it is quite heavy and inconvenient. I did not even attempt to put it back each day. Annoying. First thing I noticed when I opened the pull out were the MMs all over left by previous occupant. There was bedding provided in the King room closet but no pillow. Had to take one from King Bed. Also the blanket given was scratchy looked liked something happened to it in the dryer. Something I could see at a 1 star motel. The actual pull out was not too bad or I was just too tired. I was so excited to have a kitchen no oven or stove but that was okay. There was a refridgerator but only a mini frig. could not understand that. I wanted to put a couple of small frozen things in there but there was no freezer section only refrig. The microwave was on the counter which would have been great had there been a plug anywhere on the counter. There was not. The only plug was used for the frig and the cord did not reach. I had to move the microwave onto the side table and move it toward one of the few outlets in the room. Again annoying. There was a book shelf in the room but no dresser in case you are using that room as a sleeping area. There was a little cove that definitely could have used a dresser. Oh and the kitchen sink. nope did not work. No water coming out of there. As well there was a large orange extension cord running along the wall for a lamp. They really need to add some outlets. Nothing modern about their electrical facilities or any really. This room 432 was behind the elevator. Would have probably been fine had it not been for about 200 high school kids placed on our floor for 2 nights. no warning about that. Oh and one of the two main elevators was out the whole time. I finally discovered there was a set of elevators at the back of the hotel that would have been way more convenient. Hello front desk think you could clue us in. The bathroom was fine except they only gave two bath towels and when I saw a maid in the hall she said she had no mas. I was hoping after the first day the maid would leave more but no chance. The maid service the first day was just bad. Very minimal bed made two new towels and part of the trash was emptied. They did not even touch the pull out or do anything in the other half of the suite. The second day we were gone until about 3 and they had not touched the room. Left again around 6 came back. nope no service that day. We did have the DND on for the 3 6 timeframe because that was the only time we were in the room all day. No phone call or anything from front desk. Each time we left and came back no communication from front desk.
