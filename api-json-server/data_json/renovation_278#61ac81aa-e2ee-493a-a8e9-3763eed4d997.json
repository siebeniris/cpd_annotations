They said that the hotel was always full and there was not time to repair rooms. All of these excuses are of course ridiculous. They offered to give me another room but then said all the rooms were the same. Very disappointing. I have stayed at many Ritz hotels Los Angeles Maui Washington DC Laguna Niguel Incredible and the Miami Ritz does not deserve to share the title with these other beautiful perfect Ritz hotels.

We just stayed at the Ritz from Dec 21 to 27th. Great trip. We had two rooms for my wife and I and three kids. I booked two King bed rooms on their site and got a great Comfort You Package for 249 a night which included buffet breakfast for four valet parking and daily 100 resort credit. Breakfast was great. They actually did not even charge the fifth person in our group for dinner. We ate at the beach drinks through the week my wife had a spa treatment and after 6 days when we were checking out we had not used up the whole 120 resort credit we had so we went to the shop on the resort and my wife bought some Lulu Lemon cloths. The resort it self as in other posts could use a refresh but it was still comfortable and was in keeping with the Art Deco Scene of South Beach. The real charm is the staff. From the Beach staff to the Pool area to the restaurants and front desk and valet. Everyone was amazing. I have rarely met that kind of impeccable service across the entire hotel. They have an excellent corp culture Would definitely go back again and likely will.", "offset": [677, 821], "date": "2015-12-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "4323b3ca-22e3-45ad-bace-8072d8e3e26e", "sentence": "Service is fabulous.

Going for dessert and not having what we wanted the service at the bistro made it happen. My niece got a beautiful plate of macaroons.

Just back from 8 nights at the Ritz Carlton. First the positives the staff are great they work hard all over the hotel to try to make sure your stay is as pleasant and comfortable as possible. The hotel is clean and well located steps from the beach and just 5 minutes walk from the Lincoln Road shopping mall and restaurants. The reception area is a little dark but it is comfortable and very well air conditioned. The pool is nice but it was getting a little over crowded by the time we left there was a shortage of sun umbrellas at one pointNow the not so good points. The rooms are starting to look a little tired and could probably do with a refresh. When we checked in we were given various other room options and I thought we were going to be offered a free upgrade. But all the suggestions came with hefty additional supplements and as we had two rooms I was not going to pay an extra 400 a night or more on top of what we were already due to be charged. So we took the pre booked rooms. Nice enough rooms and inter connecting but the view was just of another wall of exterior bedrooms a few yards away. In other words no view at all. Then there is the costs. Maybe there is a big premium for the Ritz Carlton name but I thought the rooms were expensive. The basic charges for our two rooms were 349 and 39 each which may not sound too bad for a 5 hotel even for the basic rooms but on top of that there are numerous taxes. If you have not been to the US for a while like me and my family you need to remember this whenever you purchase something the price you see is definitely not the price you will pay. So on top of the room charges you have City Tax County Tax and State Tax what no Federal Tax. Then there is insidious US tip culture but do not get me started on that. Perhaps more annoying is the Resort Amenity Fee which just seems to be a euphemism for another tax this one to use the sun loungers the hotel bikes and the wifi. This is not cheap either at 28 per room per night plus taxes of course. It would be unthinkable for a European resort to charge an amenity fee just for sitting by the pool and using the wifi but perhaps it is accepted in the US. We ate a few meals and snacks by the polside and they were reasonable and it would have been nice to have had breakfast at the hotel too but at 49 per person plus taxes. that was a non starter for a family of 4 for 8 nights. I see many of the local restaurants are adding a service charge on automatically instead of expecting customers to supplement staff wages with tips so maybe the US hotel industry also needs to start becoming more transparent about pricing. So we had a great stay and the staff were top class but it was not a value for money holiday especially at current exchange rates.", "offset": [597, 680], "date": "2016-07-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "89c4831b-4afc-41d0-953e-413c81fd479a", "sentence": "Despite the awkward temporary location of the club level due to reconstruction and a VIP taking their 2nd location while undergoing reconstruction the people at the club made the stay a 5 star stay.
