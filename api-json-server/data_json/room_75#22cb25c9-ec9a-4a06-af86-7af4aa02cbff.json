I have heard the Westin is an upper scale hotel and YES IT IS. My basic room with king bed was perfect and it was only 20 more than the Holiday Inn.

The room was very clean high quality carpet and furniture. The washroom was very clean the shower was very clean the grout lines in between the tiles was very clean and the shower head was wonderful lots of water pressure.

We were not even upgraded SPG Gold. i know you should not expect it but when I called the front desk they did not even know I was SPG gold in my profile so they just treated me like a regular guest with no status. Disappointed. No upgrade and no connecting room. If you have to be in the area for work then stay here.

We had a spacious double bed room with a really big and comfortable bed 180 cm or more wide. The cleanliness in room and bathroom was superb and the staff friendly. The food is excellent although a bit pricey compared to the locations near the hotel. However the ingredients are always fresh and the food is prepared daily so it is worth it. Their buffet breakfast is very rich and I liked the freshly made omelette where I could choose the ingredients on the spot. I liked the bathroom towels so soft. and the big bath. It was also great to have the hairdryer and the iron already in the room. There is enough space provided for all clothes and shoes. The location is some 20 minutes drive from the happening in downtown so for those who want to visit the city it is not ideal. However we were there for biz reasons so it is a good place to retreat and focus. However the fitness is very small and so is the sauna and whirpol. As far as I remember the pool is open so it can be used only during summer. I missed more welnes facilities to have some relax after those biz sessions. There was also an unpleasant surprise whatever I book on the room breakfast for instance gets immediately charged on my credit card as non refundable incidental with extra amount as deposit. Usually in other hotels such amounts would be put on the room account and only paid upon check out. The difference between those charges and the actually consumed services is released some days after the check out as I was reluctantly told by the reception manager.

The clerk got us another room. It was cleaner. But the bed was a queen size I had booked a king. And the toilet ran all night and the small bed was incredibly uncomfortable. Either of us slept.

I stayed at the Westin Prince from July 5th July 15th. My father passed away during that time. I was not impressed with the level of service. First of all when I checked in I specifically asked for a corner room not near an elevator or ice machine. The first room I got was definitely NOT a corner and was directly across from the ice machine. I had to come down and change my room this was at 930 pm. I asked for turn down service and was told yes of course by the reception staff only to learn when I returned to the hotel at 100 pm that turn down service was no longer offered. Someone could have done some forward thinking and put clean towels in my room. I thought the rooms were surface cleaned but never felt like they were really deep down clean. I disliked the pillows and the room never felt pristine. The carpet in the hallways was buckling and seemed dirty. Several times over the course of my stay my room key did not work and no I did not have it near an electronic device. It is very annoying to come in stay on the 9th floor and have to come down to the lobby to retrieve a working key. Finally the parking situation is a disaster. I had extended my stay but no one updated my parking. I was leaving the parking lot and the gate would not open seven cars were lined up behind me and the head bell man was trying to help. The receptionist kept saying no payment had been made however I was still a guest at the hotel. It took over 25 minutes to get this straightened out. I was very late to an appointment.

This was undoubtedly the worst Starwod Mariot actually the worst hotel that we have ever stayed in. If you have a function in the Westin Prince Toronto which is their draw as they cater weddings and conventions plan to go somewhere else. The staff were overwhelmed the week we were there the service was atrocious and the rooms were so tired and dilapidated that it was a painful experience to stay at the Westin Prince. It seems the management is only concerned with turnover and the bottom line hospitality is not part of the equation. This does not look like a hotel that needs renovation it looks like a hotel ready to be demolished. A concrete brutalist badly designed hulk. Sliding doors to tiny balconies are bolted shut and your view is into your neighbor \u2019s room or an unsightly roof top. The reception and restaurant do have a lovely view of the trees. Do n\u2019t be fooled. that \u2019s it. My husband had numerous encounters with the staff. On the first complaint the receptionist referred us to the front office manageress. After discussion she said she would get the general manager to contact us. he was not there. On check out the receptionist asked us how our stay was had n\u2019t they seen us multiple times and then said the GM was not there again but we could speak to the Front Office Operations Manager Lewis Bold Wark. He said he would get the GM to contact us. We \u2019re still waiting. So the details for anyone still interested. First reservations we had 2 rooms booked for 6 days for a wedding. Originally we booked 2 rooms for 3 nights then we added 3 nights what were we thinking. We tried to connect the reservations on 3 occasions directly when booking a month ahead of our stay and 2 days beforehand. We tried to sync the 4 reservation numbers so that we had two. We anticipated having to move mid stay. That would have been the least of our problems. Needless to say even after assurances that it was done there was no connection of the reservations and the bill was charged after the first 3 days and new deposits charged on the card for the next 3 etc etc. On arrival we were given a room on the 10th floor. Our daughter and son in law were given a room on the 3rd floor because according to the check in person wink wink whisper secretly to us someone mentioned they were scared of heights. Oh my such baloney. These are people who bungee jump and sky dive. Made up nonsense to get rid of a mold smelly 3rd floor room. The room was finally changed for one on the 18th floor after inspection. Friends at the same function that actually arrived on their day one at 100pm at night were given a used slept in room. Sheets on the floor etc. How is that possible. RealyLet \u2019s go to the room In the hallways off the elevator the carpets are loose and folding in waves. A trip hazard for sure. We get the room directly in front of the elevator. For 6 nights. Two rooms booked for 6 nights each you would think a quiet room would be a givenInside the room there was the same carpet hazard and nasty dirty carpets. Perhaps provide slippers because no one can be expected to walk on these carpets. The smoke detector was removed from the main bedroom space with an unsightly plate where it used to be. We had a smoke detector in the hallway. It was the same in our daughter \u2019s room but they had a door dividing the bedroom from the hallway. Is this to codeThe curtains drapes were off the runners in the corner so light block out was impossible. The furniture was mismatched. There was a chair with a different fabric color ottoman I guess the ottoman was ruined long ago. The block out curtains were also perished so that there were light show through holes all over. On a positive note The bathroom was clean the sheets were crisp and clean and the bed was comfortable. so there is somethingDay one we had no hot water. Great. Cold shower. We called maintenance and it was repaired before we got back from day 1 sightseeing. A good positive and responsive maintenance department. Day two we arrive back from a long day at 10pm and the room is not made up. We have wet towels no coffee replacement. bed unmade. We called and it was remedied promptly but this was 130 at night when all you want to do is go to bed. Day three We left late at 10am and so we went directly to reception to ask them to arrange to make up the room in case we had missed the regular room service. We got back at 40pm. The room was not made up. I can go on and on thin walls with neighbors partying all night and making a lot of noise nasty poorly trained bar tenders etc. My husband spoke to the front desk many times also to the the duty manager who referred him to the general manager who was never available. So far nothing has made up for an awful experience. Avoid the Westin Prince Toronto. Note that the Westin Prince is 45 55 minutes from downtown Toronto.
