In fact the day of most peoples departure the president of the company was there helping people with their luggage so they could meet their shuttles on time. I played golf as well. The grounds were a little rough primarily because it is been raining all the time down there. But given the weather I felt the courses played well. The service was also incredible at the courses.

My husband and I visited for our anniversary and overall we loved it. The room was large clean and beautifully appointed. The front desk staff and bellmen were most helpful and attentive. The lobby and atrium are beautiful and there are lots of little nooks for a quiet spot to sit and relax. We went to Paddys Irish Pub to watch football and have a drink on Saturday afternoon and we had a great time. We also visited La Aubergine for a nightcap and a few rounds of pool on Sunday night. We thoroughly enjoyed that as well. The staff in both venues were friendly and took good care of us. Although we did not swim the pool area is very pretty and spacious. We normally eschew buffet meals but the Versailles Room excels in preparation presentation and service. The food was absolutely delicious and we ate way too much. The dinner buffet on Saturday night featured chilled shrimp and crab multiple small appetizers a cheese and charcuterie tray. prime rib sliced to order a seafood pasta prepared while you watch other meat and vegetarian entrees soups salads sides and an entire table of dessert options. The breakfast buffet was equally impressive with numerous hot and cold options an omelet station fantastic cheese blintzes with blueberry compote to die for in addition to the usual offerings. The bakery items and pastries were very good. We had the same waiter on Saturday night and Sunday morning and he could not have been more pleasant and attentive even though we knew he must be tired. We visited the Winery and thoroughly enjoyed the tasting and the tour. We consider ourselves to be well versed but we learned a lot. The history of the winery and the current winemakers vision are most interesting. We tasted eight different wines and were delighted with the Chateaus off dry rendition of muscadine wines. We normally will not drink them because they are so sweet but these were delightful. Each of the three wines in this category smells just like you are sitting under a muscadine vine but they are not sweet. The Muscadry Blanc was our favorite. We played 27 holes of golf on the Chateau course and the pro shop staff were just wonderful. The Chateau course has new greens and we thoroughly enjoyed our rounds. With that said there are a few things the Chateau could do to move from very good to great in my book. We ate in the Versailles Room on Sunday night an a la carte menu night and were very disappointed. They advertised as being open until 100. We arrived at 830 and quickly realized that our waiter was ready to leave. He was just surly and uncooperative. The butternut potage was very good. I ordered fried chicken and it was very good. My husbands scallops were dry and bland. We ordered desserts and they were terrible. My creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was burned and appeared to be old. My husbands lemon cake was stale. So my advice is to avoid the Versailles Room unles they are serving buffet meals. There are several restaurants on the property so I am sure there are better options for menu service meals. Secondly we experienced and saw several other guests experience. some confusion over bills in the restaurant. If your package includes a meal the bill in the restaurant still shows that you owe the total amount. We appreciated having the actual total to calculate a tip but it would be helpful to have a clear idea of what you really owe for things that are not included in a package. So in conclusion do visit Chateau Elan. We had a wonderful experience and only offer these criticisms as things we think management would want to know.", "offset": [214, 318], "date": "2016-09-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "454c228d-c5b1-45fb-b08e-0f02e3bfb091", "sentence": "good conference facility pretty chateau. hard to know why one would come here if not for a business meeting or special event but despite that there is a full blown chateau just off the interstate an hour north of Atlanta.

Anyone who decides to go I would recommend doing your homework since the first thing that was included was supposed to be a romantic dinner at one of their on site restaurants but this ended up being a buffet and not an order off the menu in a very open atmosphere that did not feel secluded or romantic. Unfortunately we were also overdressed for the event shirt and tie and we could have gotten away with pajamas if we had wanted to. However the food was very good and they had plenty of variety to choose from. The couples massage was great and included eucalyptus oils on the head wraps etc which enhanced the experience. The only issue was that the room that we were in had a shower designed for couples with dual shower heads and when asked if we could use it the staff said no and that they did not have any of the things in there that we would need such as soaps towels etc. I found this to be very annoying since it was available and we were the last appointment for the day and no other guests were going to use the room after us. Breakfast was another disappointment since it was once again buffet style and since we purchased the romance package they should have had room service provided since that was something that was available. Also we went on the winery tour and tried some wine tasting. Considering that we have been to several different wineries in the past and have done multiple wine tasting experiences we were disappointed with primarily the wine tasting. First the tasting itself was not included in our package which is silly considering that this is the primary reason that you go to a winery in the first place. Next the price was 250 for 6 small pours and did not include a complimentary glass. would not they want some free advertising by giving people souvenir glasses to take back with them everywhere else we have ever been gives you the glass when you are done. The other issue was that there was no bread or crackers provided between tasting. How were you expected to cleanse your pallet before sampling the next wine. After we asked our host if they had any for us to have he said that they ran out 6 months ago and never ordered anymore. What. Otherwise they had 4 different categories of wince selections to sample and you had to purchase your pours by the category. What. Why could not they do a custom sample where you choose up to the number that you wanted to try and pay by the pours as an example. This was just plain frustrating.

I was SO embarrassed for convincing our guests that they should come here for this incredible buffet and unique European hospitality. The only thing incredible about our entire stay was how shockingly fast this once great getaway did a complete 180 in every way from its appearance to its food to its management and everything in between. Their Thanksgiving buffet used to be the talk of the town. Worth every cent of its 80 price tag 2 tickets included per room if you stay with the Thanksgiving package. This year however there was a MARKED difference in the quality and the presentation. A select few dishes were superb the sweet potato pot de creme the Brusel sprouts au gratin the leeks with mushrooms and the whipped mashed potatoes. The crab legs were highly disappointing much smaller than in years past every dessert was either abysmal mediocre or tasteless the stuffing was dry meaty and horrendous the turkey was dry gravy was awful. The bread station was the best part. Apart from the food the ambience has gone completely downhill as well. They stuck the pianist in a back corner under the staircase where you could barely hear her. She used to be near the buffet table where all the guests could enjoy the music and could watch her play. They also did away with the lovely ice sculptures that added so much beauty to the decor. If I had never been to their Thanksgiving buffet before I would say it was good but far from great. Having been to it several times in the past I would say it was sad and disappointing. And I \u2019m not the only one. While on the buffet line I overheard several other guests lamenting the downhill turn it took and my extended family being there for the first time reported back to me that several people on the dessert line were complaining about how wonderful the dessert room used to be in both taste and looks and how mediocre it is now. The bad news did n\u2019t stop there. The breakfast at Versailles the next day was a joke. 23 for a buffet where the food is the same quality as a cafeteria. It was shameful. Later that day we had one of the worst lunches I \u2019ve ever had at Marc the restaurant at the winery. The night of Thanksgiving we had a late dinner at Paddy \u2019s Irish Pub. Nothing to write home about. As soon as we walked into the hotel we knew it would n\u2019t be the same. The new owners changed the lobby and did away with all its elegance and European charm. Now it looks like the inside of any airport hotel where you stay on a layover. The management mirrors the decline in ambience.
