We visit Puerto Rico every couple of years. When we found out about Dorado Beach we decided to visit. I am so glad we did. We got a suite with our own plunge pool and we were close to the water. Our suite had full views of the water. Waking up to the views was wonderful. The bathroom and outdoor shower were so well done and gorgeous. Loved my closet and makeup area. I did yoga from the exercise option on the television. I loved it. The bed well. it is the Ritz. Had a hard time getting up. The suites are not cheap but if you can splurge they are so worth it. They are not as private as other places we have visited where you have your own plunge pool but it was beautiful. The suites on the beachside are busier but they are right on the beach. Less noise on our side so it was good. We were across from the fitness center and it is state of the art. We used it daily. You can get bikes and I highly suggest it. Being on the resort it is huge. And we were only there 4 days and still had not tried everything the resort had to offer. Ritz outdid themselves. The restaurants were good I never expect a whole lot when it comes to food in PR so for the area it was good. I am a restaurant person and I consider the area when speaking about food. Make reservations always so you can sit where you like. We had a few problems with our butler but the hotel made up for it. I would have liked a better dossier before our arrival as we did not know anything that was going on at the resort until we got there or what they had to offer so that was a little disappointing. We would have loved to try the wine dinner on Friday but we did not know about it until it was too late. There were improvements that can be made to the service and I am sure they will do so we made management aware of it. None of it would change our minds about staying there again. We loved it. Ask questions before you arrive and make sure if you get butler service that you use them. Because you are paying for it believe me.

I had the good fortune to be able to stay at this amazing resort for four nights from October 28th through November 1st 2014. I used to visit this property several times a year when it was a Hyat and was brokenhearted when it closed back in 206 as it was one of my favorite spots in the world. I was a little worried that the Ritz would ruin the low key vibe we enjoyed so much in the past but need not have as they somehow made the experience even more special than it was before. SERVICEWe received impeccable service throughout our stay from start to finish by everyone we encountered it actually started prior to our stay with Ana Marie Ramos who was so helpful when I was not sure if I was going to be able to make my dates due to my mothers declining health and so patient with answering all of our questions and asking if there was anything she could do to make our stay more enjoyable. Another amazing staff member is Rosalia Gonzalez who is one of the managers that took it upon herself to surprise me with a new computer mouse and mouse pad that she had left in my room with a beautiful card and gift bag when she found out mine had stopped working. Special mention also has to be given to Ricardo Daley who treated us as if we were his own personal special guests with a warm greeting and big smile everyday. Last but certainly not least is George Sotelo the very competent general manager of this resort who graciously invited us to a paella tasting event with Jose Andreas we had such a good time that night meeting another group of women from CT and talking with him and Jose that it became the highlight of our trip which we still talk about today. ROMWe were in a west beach plunge reserve room in building 2. The room was very well appointed and we really loved the location as it was very close to the Encanto pool which was the perfect temperature for an evening swim which we enjoyed every night. I loved the patio so much that I slept outside each night listening to the waves from the nearby surf. literally the best nights sleep that I had in years and well worth the few mosquito bites received. turning on the overhead fan helped keep them at bay. GroundsThey obviously spared no expense when constructing this property as everything is stunningly beautiful and high quality. For those of you familiar with the old Hyat layout it looks like they moved the reception area and put it where the old building 7 was. The whole of the old main beach now fronts private residences guests do have access to this beach as well. and what used to be the smaller more private cove is now the main hotel beach. Both encanto and positvo pools are beautiful and relaxing with the water temperature in the encanto pool a little warm for daytime but perfect for evening and the opposite for positivo very refreshing in the day but a little cool for a night swim. so you get the best of both worldsFodWe ate all breakfasts and lunches at the resort. Breakfast was amazing with a very impressive selection I had the best waffles I have ever tasted in my life there and lunches were very good as well with only one miss. We had intended on having a dinner or two on property but never had a chance to but hoping to enjoy a few evening meals on our upcoming trip. RecomendationsThis place is as close to perfect as it can get so there is not too much to add here but it would of been nice if the room service menu was expanded a little. We would of ordered the first evening but the menu I found only had a handful of items available on it. I am assuming they would of accommodated different choices but we were too tired to deal with it so we ended up not ordering. Another thing that would of been really nice to have would be having the ability to rent a golf cart to drive around to other parts of the resort that are further away water park water sports center etc. as it is really spread out. George if you are reading this you could make big bucks off us old fat ladies who are too lazy to walk too far in the heatIn summary. if you are contemplating whether or not to stay here just do it as it is worth every penny and I am truly looking forward to staying here again this November.", "offset": [2604, 2682], "date": "2015-08-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "9c1e9544-55a5-46d9-adbd-b58072d32ace", "sentence": "Time of my life.

On August 21st around 10 in the afternoon while my husband and I were sitting on a beach chairs right outside our hotel room Room 215 a 40 foot palm tree fell on us breaking our beach umbrella in half and crushing my beach chair. If not for the umbrella we believe there would have been serious injuries possibly even death. The hotel crew nearby were wonderful and were quick to rush over to us to make sure we were okay as was a loss prevention officer who spoke to us quickly after the incident to ask if we needed medical assistance which thankfully we did not and had us fill out an incident report. Other than this we received no acknowledgement from management about the incident although it is possible someone from lower management did stop by following the incident not knocking at the front door but strolling past the back. but we were both in shock so we are not sure. However there was no mention of it at all for the remaining 3 days of our stay that much we know for certain. But even if someone from management did stop by once we do not think this is in any way represents an adequate response from the hotel management. My husband who has been in the hospitality business for nearly 40 years put it this way \u201c had someone been having dinner at my restaurant and had a small overhead lamp fallen onto the table I would have probably comped their meal invited them back and comped that one too \u201d. Their response seemed woefully inadequate given the circumstances. We are not the kind of people that expect special treatment or comps for every minor incident we barely help ourselves to the amenities already offered to us. so we did not bring this up while still at the hotel. But the fact that there was n\u2019t even a representative of the hotel at check out to inquire as to our well being not even an offer of a stupid upgrade coupon of the type given to bus tours leaves us unconvinced as to the level of commitment to customer service you claim to be striving for. We have been a long time fans of Ritz Carlton properties and we have stayed at their hotels all over the world including Cayman Island Barcelona etc but we will definitely think twice about staying in any Ritz Carlton hotels in the future. UPDATE. The GM of this property reached out to us after we emailed him and what he offered was that we get in touch with him next time we are in Puerto Rico and he will take care of us whatever that means. To make it extra creepy he made this offer on the telephone but not in his email.

My twin sister and I recently spent our birthday at this resort. I had read many reviews but nothing I can say will adequately capture my experience. You must go and experience paradise for yourself. About 2 weeks before we were scheduled to arrive we received a call from Ashley to see if there was anything she can do to assist us with our upcoming stay. At that time we made reservations for Mi Casa which has excellent food. We ate there for breakfast and dinner which was expensive but worth it. We also made reservations for the spa which was the best I have ever experienced. She also even assisted with airport transfers. When we arrived in our room we were surprised to see balloons and a cake to kick off our birthday celebration. It is details like this that makes you want to come back. We had 3 Embajadors Javier Michael and Jenifer. Javier was the best. We wish he could have attended to us our entire stay. We had a plunge pool room on the East Beach. It was very private and had a beautiful view. Our room was very spacious and clean. The bathrooms was very nice and taking advantage of the outside shower was so liberating. We also enjoyed the complimentary bikes they provided. Everything about this resort is picturesque. The entire resort was just beautiful. We received top notch service and were made to feel special which was wonderful since after all it was our birthday. Now lets talk about the spa service and treatment. We opted for the Manto Santos infusion and massage treatment. It was the best treatment we have ever experienced. We spent over 5 hours enjoying the relaxation room the sauna the cold plunge pool and the heated pool. As if things were not already top notched Lourdes made our visit that much more special. Again our birthday was acknowledge by the spa staff and they went the extra mile to make our day wonderful. Lourdes is exceptional. She went above and beyond and helped capture a memory that only sisters could appreciate. Lastly upon our checkout we had mentioned how we wish we had Embajador Luiz since we had read from reviews that he was awesome. And to our surprise we met him. And guess what. He is awesome. Too bad it was upon our departure. The next time and yes there will be a next time we will be asking for him. Luiz is very warm and inviting.

I recently just came back from a week long trip to Puerto Rico to celebrate my girlfriend and Is 15th anniversary together. While we were there we spent a few days at the Ritz Carlton at Dorado Beach and I wanted to just come back and address some things. I do not write reviews very often and it typically requires a bad experience for me to make the effort in this case it is quite the opposite. Early on we questioned whether to book the stay. The photos looked beautiful but we got hung up on some of the negative reviews regarding staffing waiting for drinks on the beach etc. Everybodys experience is there own but none of those negative things I read were my experience at all. From the moment we arrived the service was spectacular. First class. Everybody at the resort were always readily available helpful and did everything in their power to make our stay a memorable one. We had read numerous reviews here and elsewhere that the resort may be understaffed with long wait times for drinks and other services. That was not our experience at all. We never had any trouble getting assistance on anything we needed Chen did an exceptional job checking in on us to ensure we did not need anything. Dany and Angel at the positivo sand bar were AMAZING and we never waited more than a few minutes to have our drink orders filled. In a lapse of judgment we waited to book our couples spa appointment until we got there and they were booked up but went out of their way to keep on top of any cancellations and were able to fit us in. Just another win for this group of individuals. The spa was a little slice of heaven clearly a ton of thought and design went in to creating the perfect oasis. From the moment you step into the spa itself you can not do anything but relax and let your troubles fade away. The spa itself is breathtaking and you feel completely removed from any distractions etc. If you book anything over 60 minutes make sure you get there at least an hour in advance to enjoy all there is to do. steam room cold hot tubs. etc. Unfortunately I was so relaxed I let the names slip of our massage exfoliating therapists. i believe it was Luis Antonio and I forget the females name but both of them were fantastic really nice and continued the theme of going above and beyond. i feel terrible I can not remember their names but i was really just in awe as they gave us the tour right before our treatments. Having breakfast on our terrace staring out at an ocean that seems to be about 100 feet away is something we will not ever forget. It is true that those pesky birds show up for a nibble but this was true at all the locations we were at in PR when eating outside and as long as you are with your food they will not come near just do not walk away or your bacon may go missing. I do not have much I can say about the room itself that would not sound like a repeat of my spa review. Seriously just absolute heaven. Clean spacious and no detail was missed. Really enjoyed the outdoor shower and that tub was like no other also all those amazing scents in the bath salts cleansers etc. they truly have thought of everything. The sliding wood slat doors so you can listen to the ocean while you sleep. PERFECTSeriously if you are on the fence about booking a stay at the dorado beach do not be. They are world class top to bottom. The price can be a bit steep but it falls in line with the experience. Worth every penny. I just want to give a special shout out to Dany Chen James and the entire guest experience team for giving us a vacation we will never forget. More importantly I want to call out two people in particular. Angel at the positivo sand bar. this kid is just phenomenal aside from being a Boston Celtics fan but we all have flaws I suppose lol he should be recognized for his hard work great customer service and ability to make guests feel right at home.
