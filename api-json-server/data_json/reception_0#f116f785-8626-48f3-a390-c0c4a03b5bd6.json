My name is Vanessa and this is our vacation story. We started out with a reservation at a nearby Hilton family hotel. we checked in at this hotel to find out that the air conditioner was broken. and this is how we ended up at the Embassy Suites Tampa convention center location. sadly the Hampton Inn location and which we ment to spend our beach vacation at did not accommodate us and basically had us out on the street at 3 of the clock in the morning with my five children. I had stayed at the Embassy Suites Tampa Convention Center many times in the past and remember to call them in the middle of this disaster. Seeking shelter for my family during a vacation I came in contact with a wonderful gentleman by the name of Steve at the Embassy Suites Tampa Convention Center. He advised me that the hotel was overboked and after hearing that we were out in the middle of the street with our five children he told us to come on over and he would figure something out. Needless to say our vacation was ruined and the beach became farther away then expected. Not only with Steve and amazing representatives of the Hilton brand he also exhibited heartfelt regret for our circumstances. This facility is beautiful professional and for a ruined vacation the Embassy Suites Tampa Convention Center was able to turn our childrens frowns upside down. Although we did not make it to the beach as we intended our children were able to enjoy our 3 days with an excellent breakfast beautiful 3rd level pool deck and a sweet and amazing staff. Steve and his manager Jayson were the kindest employees one can encounter. We can wait to go back as my children begged not to go. After hearing our story the Front desk manager sent us off with complimentary tickets for the whole family to the Florida Aquarium. For any parents looking for a kid friendly place to take their children Embassy Suites Tampa Convention Center is the definite place to go.

Just recently stayed here and on arrival to our room we noticed a brownish yellowish puddle on top of the toilet seat. We immediately called front desk and they sent somebody up to clean up the liquid. After about an hr or 2 my friend used the bathroom and felt something drop on her back as she used the toilet. She told me about t and when i went to the bathroom to check it out I noticed a brownish liquid slowly dripping from the exhaust fan. I wiped it down to see if it would return. The next morning the drops were there again and then we found out that the light the goes around the tv would not turn off. We called the front desk again and they said they would send somebody right up. Cut to a couple hrs later nobody shows. we left for a conference during the day and when we got back to the hotel I immediately went to the front desk to see if somebody could come to our room now. after about an hour in our room maintenance finally shows up and checks the light. looks like switch was broken so he just unplugged it from some panel. he then goes to the bathroom and sees the drops from the exhaust fan and says it maybe leaking form the upstairs bathroom. I left to go to day 2 of my conference and when I get back at lunch my friend told me her 2yr old daughter basically got a shower of brown liquid from that exhaust fan. she immediately told front desk again and said they would move us but with all the toys and stuff we had and only 1 night stay left it made no sense for us to move so instead they took off one night stay. This particular hotel has valet only. I left my car with the valet and only got it back when we checked out so no need to move my car except for those 2 times. My car has a valet mode so it will record video everytime the car is unlocked and started and will continue to record until a few secs after it is locked. I went to check my recordings and noticed a 9min video that was recorded. Looks like one of their valet drivers decided to take a joy ride in their parking garage and reached speeds up to 22 mph and braking hard right before the turn. I know not fast but for a small tight garage this was way too fast for conditions. I contacted the hotel as soon as I saw that and was later contacted by the operations manager of the valet service Embassy Suites uses. He was apologetic and told me the driver in question did admit to what he did and was immediately terminated. The operations manager was able to get me my money back for valet but I still feel Embassy Suites dropped the ball on what they would do to compensate me on anymore than just the valet refund.

The next day we call down and ask for someone to come and take a look they were sending someone from maintenance to check the smell and if they can not fix it they would move us. 30 minutes go by no one comes. I call down to find out they were not sending someone then that person had other things to do and would come up later. Why were we waiting in the rom no idea. We were told they would send someone up now just for the smell. Girl comes up tells us that a lot of the rooms smell like this she was going to check 1507 and see if the front desk can move us. We do not hear from anyone so we leave the hotel and come back a few hours later. Check in with the desk who know nothing about this. Then they go and find us another room which ended up also smelling but was bearable. Our first room besides the smell was honestly dirty and just not well taken care of. Our second room although looked nicer I could tell was not fully cleaned because fake white roses were under the chair. The only pleasant person we encountered everyday was the man at breakfast. I did not catch his name but boy is he friendly. We looked around for hotels a lot and were deciding between this hotel and the Mariot across the street. Hands down would I choose another hotel. Breakfast omelets were god everything else was below standard. I d say this hotel is a 2 star posed as a 3 star. If this is actually a 4 star then I had be blown away.", "offset": [86, 138], "date": "2019-09-17", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "e220e455-9747-4a82-8521-a690183f80ea", "sentence": "Understaffed and poor communication. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon about 3 for an event next door the following evening. Our room was not ready which was surprising but their posted checkin time was 4 PM so we joined the couple of dozen other people in the lobby towing their luggage and waiting for their rooms. And we waited. And we waited. And we waited. No one from the maintenance staff appeared to be communicating with the desk staff so while we were frustrated at the lack of information we did not hold it against them. Finally about 630 we were told that a room was available not as large as the one we had reserved and no discount on price but by that time we were so tired of camping in the lobby and not knowing when or if our room might be ready that we took it. The room itself was comfy with a nice view of the water and the convention center and the location is historic and spectacular with very handy access to a free trolley that goes to Ybor City. However we did experience problems getting maid service we had to track one down in the hall to get towels and they never did service our room and at one point the water from the tap was milky white this may have been due to air in the line I set aside a glass to show management and by the next morning it was clearWhen we left for the event the next evening the lobby was again full of people waiting for their rooms so this leads me to believe that this is an ongoing issue. Out of curiosty we stopped at a hotel across the street and there were no people waiting for rooms. All in all it is a beautiful hotel and a great location comfy beds and the breakfast was particularly tasty and well run but so many of the issues we ran into were so core to the process of running a hotel that they negatively impacted our experience. Since we saw the same issues unresolved the next day and did no see the issues at neighboring hotels we have to assume it is a local issue. We rarely say this but we would not return under the current management.", "offset": [974, 1451], "date": "2019-09-17", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "2659a2c9-6a4f-4558-8956-dd9150acb9df", "sentence": "I know its the holiday season but surely this hotel has been sold out before.

If we did n\u2019t have to stay here we would n\u2019t. The front office is COMPLETELY incapable of assisting guests with any matter from housekeeping needs to billing issues. I \u2019l spare the details because there are so many but anytime we approached the desk with issues they had to go to the back to the \u201c mysterious manager \u201d that no one ever saw and even after speaking with them they never actually solved anything. Check in was 2 hours late extra charges on our romthat STILL have not been resolved and we checked out a week ago valet charges were inconsistent we went our whole stay with one towel even after calling down to housekeeping which just went to the front desk. I \u2019l give housekeeping credit because they made sure the rooms were clean and did it as timely as they could but their direction came from the dysfunctional front office so obviously guest needs were not communicated adequatelyif at all. Breakfast was great and the staff worked very hard with the volume this hotel held. Unfortunately the dysfunctional front desk and management overall negates the good that this hotel could offer. I wo n\u2019t even get into the problems with the event staff but you would think that a hotel where you were paying A LOT of money for a wedding And brought a good number of patrons to your hotel they may do more to help make your stay a little easier. Maybe assist with transport of wedding decor extra treats favors etc. I \u2019ve been to many weddings were hotels bend over backwards to help the host as they should. Weddings are a lot of work and this hotel did not assist with any matter to make our stay better. I would not recommend this hotel ever.", "offset": [238, 482], "date": "2020-01-12", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
