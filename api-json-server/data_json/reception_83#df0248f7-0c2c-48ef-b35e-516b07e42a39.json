Stayed at this hotel one night before meeting. The hotel is easily accessible off West Dekalb Pike near the King of Prussia mall.

The staff for checking in was friendly and helpful but that is about all I can say was above average. I got a room on the 6th floor and in taking the elevators I learned quick that they were hot and slow. The room itself was fine. You can see that they are a bit worn out around the edges and the toilet was in rough shape but nothing that makes it unlivable. However the room was very warm do you see a theme here for the entire hotel as the temp was 74 degrees when we walked in. The setting was on 68 so it shows how poor the A C is. I turned it down to 65 and by time I got back from dinner and an errand it was only 72The bed was comfortable and large and the pillows were adequate. When I woke up the temp was only at 68 so it is safe to say the AC is just awful. I went down to breakfast and was wholly disappointed. The food they had was just plain bad. They had some sort of omletes that were clearly microwaved and then some sort of crepe type thing that was disgusting. Obviously it is hard to mess up bagels etc. so they should just save their money and keep those things stocked. Overall I would suggest looking elsewhere first.
