This hotel is beautiful. It was very clean and the room was spacious. However the hotel could improve on service delivery. Upon arriving at this hotel four hours prior to check in time after 26 hours of traveling I was told I could not check into my room early unles I paid 50 cost of one days room charges. The receptionist kept referring to me as an expedia guest since I purchased my hotel through Hotelscom. She even called the manager to see if I could get into the room early but once she said I was an expedia guest the manager said I would have to pay the charges. Furthermore while I was having breakfast at the hotel the following morning the restaurant manager approached two guests and told them they needed to move form the four top table they were sitting at to a two top table. The restaurant was empty and had plenty of available tables. so I am not quite sure why they asked them to move. I and 25 of my colleagues each travel through Nairobi around 8 times a year. I would have definitely recommended this hotel to others had they treated me better upon arrival. However I will return to the hotel I normally stay at for all future travel in Nairobi. The Sankara hotel is far superior located better has more comfortable beds and has far superior customer service. So if you want a truly outstanding stay while visiting Nairobi opt for The Sankara over DusitD2.", "offset": [1017, 1114], "date": "2015-03-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "b607ee2c-97c3-4508-9e49-02d9be509a2a", "sentence": "Hotel okay poor execution.
