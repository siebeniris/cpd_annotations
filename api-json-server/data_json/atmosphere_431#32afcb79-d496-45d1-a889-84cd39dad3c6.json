Staying at Cosmopolitan for a conference was a nice experience by itself and arriving to 58th floor room was stunning when I first opened the doors. The view was amazing. Room was huge with huge shower separate toilet and bath tub. There is also a nice sofa working table chair. anything you need there it is. But since this is supposed to be really excellent hotel for the price. I started to notice small things that were out of order. Actually not a huge impact on stay itself but still. For example Vacuuming around bed was bad They never bothered to vacuum behind under sofa or even under cushions of sofa. but found a dime under it Shower head was full of limestone and I mean full. Nobody bothered Completely missing from the room was shoe kit. My Shoe kit box was empty. Also missing was laundry bag. My Loundry box had just paper form. When brought to attention laundry bag was provided but this means somebody did not properly check the room after it was vacated. What bothered me most was the fact they wanted additional money for WiFi. COME ON. You charge 200 room and want additional money for WiFi. I think it was something as 15 day. You better go and buy prepaid SIM and have 4G LTE wifi also on the way with you for that amount of money. Breakfast was included at the Spoon and it was really a nice experience as the selection is HUGE. Oddly breakfast starts at 80AM and there is no place you can get it earlier. So when we had conference that started at 80 our breakfasts were paid for nothing. The Marquee club was a mixed experience as it is VERY crowdy and getting in takes time of course even as hotel guest beer is 10 but once in you will see some of the best girls around. Casino is of high end. so do not look for 5 roulette or Black Jack there am not none All in all fancy stuff but I would reconsider spending this amount of money again for the room.", "offset": [1552, 1735], "date": "2015-02-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "8a759055-4ed6-478c-ae3d-0adbd4035ffb", "sentence": "Restoring the experience.

I went to Vegas to partake in a Show Competition and the Cosmopolitan was the host hotel. My experience at the Cosmopolitan and the treatment I received from the staff and front desk was the worst customer service I have ever seen to date. When I originally booked the room months in advance I requested a nonsmoking floor and refrigerator and followed up with phone calls and emails to confirm these specific requests and was ensured that everything was all set. When I arrived at the hotel the room had no refrigerator besides the mini bar and I was told that I would be charged a 250 fee to remove the contents from the mini bar for use as my refrigerator. They told me there were no refrigerators left and that to me is unacceptable after I specifically requested and followed up multiple times regarding this issue. The person I traveled with is a diabetic and needed to keep medication and food cold which I indicated on the request form when booking the room. When someone finally did come to remove the mini bar contents it was over an hour later and I had to purchase a bag of ice to keep the food we had to bring cold so that it did not spoil. I was told I would need to pay 20 per day to use the Wifi in the hotel and there were many times when the wifi would not even connect. On my floor there were hotel guests smoking marijuana and running up and down the halls screaming. And although I understand that the hotel can not control the guests I thought that since there were people there for business in particular the show that we would be kept together so that we were not surrounded by the guests looking to party. The night prior to my competition I could not sleep due to the disruptive guests and alarms going off throughout the building. I called on Saturday to speak to the front desk about my experience in hopes that I could be moved to another floor AFTER my show day and they said I could. I went to the desk later that afternoon and the front desk employee basically told me that I could check out at 11 AM the next day and move to another hotel. Coming with such a large group I was hoping that we would receive much better treatment than being told that I could leave if I did not like it. I spoke with the front desk manager and told her about my experience. I expressed that I have traveled to many different hotels and have never received such poor service. Since I did not change rooms I asked about being compensated for the three days of Internet use totaling 600 and she said that she would take care of it for me and that I would not be charged. I think that was a very minimal request for the disrespect and inconsideration that I received throughout my stay. When I checked out in the morning I was told that she was not able to comp the Internet and the best she could do is give me 300 off one day of the room price. I know multiple guests that had a very similar experience and expressed their concerns to the front desk and received over 100 off their internet bill. So to be told that it was all set and then find out that she could not do anything for me that was very disappointing and unprofessional. I was trying to not be an inconvenience to the hotel and decided to stay in the room I was in and only asked for a reimbursement of the Internet charges. The rooms were filthy. They did not clean the floor or shower ONCE during my stay. There were soap marks on the shower floor that were there from the first day there and remained the entire time. They never cleaned the bowl or tea kettle that I requested on my first day. There were remnants on the floor that were never picked up. From this experience I will warn you that if you expect high quality service a clean room and professionalism DO NOT STAY HERE. I have never had such an awful experience and for being a guest with a large group of people I was hoping to receive much better service than I did. They basically said to me we get 120 people in and out every morning in other words you are just another 1 of those 120.", "offset": [3813, 3961], "date": "2015-08-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "ddfe7e30-a099-4a4e-ac90-ad30ca42d5c0", "sentence": "Amazing.

Please forgive the length brevity is not my strong suit. I am the type to extensively research anything I pay good money for and my Vegas hotel choice was the perfect indulgence for my obsessive tendency. I decided early on that this was my first true Vegas experience and I wanted to go all out and stay in one of the 5 star offerings on the Strip. My trip was the weekend after Thanksgiving and the prices were relatively friendly. After reading reviews on all the popular options I settled on the Cosmopolitan. My wife and I are 25 and based on descriptions it seemed the atmosphere was most fitting for our age we are not huge partiers. but I think this was still an accurate choice more on that later. We went to gamble eat good food see a stellar show or two and experience the vibe in general. After choosing Cosmo I moved on to deciding where to book the stay and which site would give me the best deal. They were having a 3 for 2 night promo on their own website which beat all the third party offerings but I also looked into the option of booking through Visa Signature and Chases luxury hotel and resort collection LHR. This is where things get a little confusing but bear with me because this is some of the info I could not find in my own research. To start the rates on both these collection sites are the exact current rate on the hotels direct website INCLUDING resort fees and taxes. The price will be the standard rate WITHOUT any promos and this can be verified by choosing your dates and going through the checkout process on Cosmos website again not using any promo offer. The final price should match the hotel collection price to the cent. Despite not giving the promo discount the collection option offered perks and freebies like free breakfast and spa passes along with complimentary upgrade and early late check in out upon availability. Because of the nights I chose 3 nights Sat thru Mon the price difference was about 125 more to book through the Chase luxury hotel collection which I chose over Visa as the perks were better value but I decided the value of the extras was greater than this difference. The only drawback was there was no way to book a fountain view room vs regular and part of the reason I chose Cosmo was for the prime Belagio fountain and strip views note that this was particular to the Cosmo other hotels on the collections sites had view designations for the room options. So essentially the LHR collection booking was for a regular aka no fountain view terrace one bedroom this was what I deemed to be the sweet spot option as suites were a significant price jump and it was just the two of us at 125 more for the whole stay vs a fountain view terrace one bedroom booked through Cosmo using their promo. The value of the LHR perks was definitely more than 125 so I decided to go with this option hoping that the complimentary upgrade would give me the fountain view and all would be well I did check availability when making this decision and it looked to be a light weekend so my chances for upgrade looked good. Now for the actual stay and how it played out including a walkthrough of my experience checking in with an LHR collection reservation. Our flight landed about 930am and we arrived at Cosmo a little after 10 am so I got a chance to test the early check in again this was Sat 126. There were plenty of people in the check in line and I headed to the autograph lounge for special check in a perk of the LHR booking. I went straight to the desk no line in the lounge and they did not blink an eye at my early check in time and pulled up my reservation and asked for my ID and credit card no 20 sandwich attempt for me since I was already supposed to get upgraded if available. The man then made a phone call and said I have a signature guest and want to know if there are any upgrades available. After a few seconds he nodded and hung up and hurriedly told me there were no upgrades because they were completely booked for the night. Hold on all 30 of your rooms are booked and paid for. On this particular weekend that claim was preposterous and I still can not believe he said it to me with a straight face. Even if they did not want to upgrade me for whatever reason I would have been much happier with just a no instead of a flat out lie. I knew I would not get anywhere with him so I let him confirm my free breakfast and spa passes and took the keys and left. We went and checked out the room on the 57th floor as expected with no fountain view although the view was not horrible you looked out at Aria and could see a bit of the south strip like MGM etc. I immediately looked online and sure enough I could have booked any room type I wanted for that night right then and there proving the sold out spiel was total hogwash. So that was my initial check in experience as a signature guest actually booked through Chase LHR but whatever. Perhaps because my check in time was early they were reluctant to upgrade me but I think the stuffy older man in the autograph lounge just had no interest in making my stay exceptional. andor Cosmo is plain stingy. Regardless were I to do it over I would NOT go to the autograph lounge but rather straight to the regular front desk. Which brings me to attempt number 2. After confirming online that there was no way they were full for the night I went back down to the regular desk and explained that I had an an upgrade upon availability but was told I would not be upgraded due to full capacity but I see availability online and want confirm this. The young lady at the desk said yes she would check and they should have something. She typed and made a phone call to the mysterious upgrade broker hung up and said she could only upgrade me for 35 night. At this point I decided the view was a pretty big deal breaker for me and reluctantly agreed to pay the extra. She put me on the 40th floor in the same west tower as the other room. but on the north side and we moved our bags to switch rooms. The view was all of what I had hoped and we noticed the balcony was much bigger than the non view room which was really nice. I think the views are even better in the east tower since it is right on the actual boulevard and may give you a more straight shot down the strip but our view was fantastic nonetheless. I was satisfied with the room but definitely not about the fact I had to pay for it. Because of the hassle and impression that they were out for themselves and not me I stopped by the desk one more time late that evening on my way out to confirm that I would still have everything else supposedly included in my LHR booking. I was helped by another young lady and I explained what I had already gone through and why I wanted to confirm the rest. She pulled up my reservation and said yes you still have the buffet and spa and then asked me incredulously if they had really made me pay for the upgrade. I said they did and she said it says right here that you have a complimentary upgrade you definitely should not have been charged and we will take care of that for you. FINALLY an empathetic person that actually made sense and wanted to help me. Glad I asked. but third times the charm should NOT be the rule at a 5 star hotel. Everything else went smoothly and I charged the Wicked Spoon buffet and spa passes to the room as instructed in order to be comped. Then on the last night I got back to hotel around 4 am and headed to the desk to confirm that I would have late check out since it was another based on availability feature. I explained this and the girl said they almost always have late check out but claimed she had never seen such a thing like the upon availability she saw listed in my reservation. This amazed me as I can not possibly be the first person to book through the LHR collection. Regardless she gave me no trouble and granted me check out at 3 pm she said this was the latest they offer and told me I would need new keys which she handed over and threw away our old ones. We headed up to our room and the new keys did not work. Not what you want to happen at 4 am. Back down 40 floors to the desk and yet another girl makes us more new keys. She says that she hopes they work but if not we could call security from the elevator and they will come let us in without the hassle of going back down AGAIN. Honestly going to the elevator and calling security and waiting sounds like even more of a hassle. But moreso my mind is blown once again in a bad way that this girl can not guarantee my keys will work. That seems like the most basic function of the front desk of a hotel. Luckily they worked but the contingency speech was just another non reassuring blemish on the stay. Finally check out arrived and I braced myself for the bill that I had zero confidence would be correct the first time around. I would have loved to check out online and skip the line which is an option but my lack of faith told me I had to go in person. Sure enough no pleasant surprises as the girl shows me my initial bill. She said we got comped for the buffet but that the first day shows we had two extra people dining with us and it could not be comped. Are you kidding. I assured her it was just my wife and I every day we went and she said she would check with her manager to see if they could do anything. I then pointed out that we had also been charged for the spa which she said she would also check on. This is after she had already confirmed we had spa passes. I am baffled once again. As we stood there waiting quite unhappily the guy working the adjacent desk noticed and offered us some water. A small token of the service I expected from the rest of my stay at a 5 star hotel. The girl returned and told us the discrepancies had been taken care of. Another sigh of relief that should not have been needed in the first place. I will note there was no sign of the upgrade charge so that had already been fixed as promised. All said and done we ended up receiving the perks and paying what we expected the only added charges to the total I booked on the LHR site were the tips for the buffet. So technically booking through the LHR collection was a success but it was very tiring having to awkwardly explain and ask for things repeatedly only to be met with confusion and errant responses. No one wants to be the guy asking for freebies constantly and if they are already meant to be there I should not have to be. One more positive note the bell desk is located conveniently right by the main door to the taxis and rideshare and we had no trouble leaving our bags with them after check out since we were not heading to the airport for another few hours. While I obviously can not give the service at the Cosmo a positive review the physical hotel and casino itself were for the most part excellent. There was a smell of smoke in the hallways of the upper floors and some carpet stains and scratches scuffs on the walls that gave pause to the feeling of luxury. However its Vegas and I am sure most of the hotels have trouble keeping things pristine. The room itself had no smell or any issues. The bed was quite comfortable with plenty of pillows. The Japanese soaking tub was interesting and I feel it might be a love it or hate it type thing. It was fine for me I am only 56 but a tall individual may find it awkward and cramped. Because it is square and has seat ledges it is not meant to be the kind of tub you can stretch out and lay in but rather sit and soak hence the name. The window next to it is nice but the view is not that great because 1. The window is tinted presumably to block the Vegas sun and 2. When sitting in it your eye level is below the balcony railing which adds another tint obstruction. I did like the unique openness to the room from the tub and shower and loved how the shower and tub were one big area. A couple odd things about the room that were a bit annoying were 1. The doors were SO heavy and particularly the one to the water closet was set so that it would persistently close itself without any stopper and there was not one provided maybe my wife and I are the only total weirdos who like to be able to converse if one is on the toilet 2. There were no drawers if you like to unpack your clothes and the mini fridge is completely stocked great if you want to buy from it. so you can not put anything of your own anywhere except the freezer which does in fact freeze unlike some hotel freezers. 3. Lastly all the lights can be turned on or off at once convenient except the closet light which is motion sensored. This meant every night climbing into bed with the light still on and having to wait for it to turn off on its own you could close the doors but as noted there are no drawers and setting up your suitcase on the racks means you probably want to leave the doors open unles you want to stuff everything way into the back. Small annoyances overall the room was great. The only Cosmo dining options we tried were the Wicked Spoon buffet thankfully it was comped because it was actually fairly pricey 42 per person on Sunday. 27 weekdays with the no alcohol option and the secret pizza. The buffet was AMAZING the best I have ever been to I think. All options from breakfast to lunch to dessert many main staples alongside unique and creative offerings all delicious. We always ate fairly late around noon they are open 8am2pm3pm on weekends no worries about sleeping in. so the lines were not long but the entrance setup looks like a Disneyland queue and I would not want to be there when it was full. The secret pizza was pretty good but was 5 for a slice of cheese so we opted to pay 26 for the whole pie even though we knew we would not finish it. I will conclude if you even made it this far with a quick summary of the atmosphere casino and location. The Cosmo is designed to have a very glitz and glamour feel as opposed to some of the other nicer hotels like the Belagio and Venetian which go for an opulent palace vibe. While those might make you feel like European royalty Cosmo wants you to feel like a modern Jay Gatsby or James Bond. it is glitter and diamonds vs gold crown moulding and marble statues. Aria also had an ultra modern feel almost futuristic and high tech less glam. I think for the younger crowd these newer modern options are probably more in their wheelhouse generally speaking. The Cosmos casino was decent but actually relatively small and stretched out so that it was long and thin meandering along the south side of the whole building complex. As with most of the higher end hotels casinos the minimums are high 15 65 blackjack and craps 10 roulette and the slots seemed pretty tight. The dealers were great though. We found much friendlier table rules at Balys and Cromwell. I liked the feel of Arias casino the best as it felt huge and open. Belagio came in second for casino ranking as it was also big and sprawling. As for location you really can not beat the Cosmo. it is right in the middle of everything and there is not much that is not walkable. Cosmo had sky bridges to Planet Hollywood and Crystals shopping the center connected to Aria. I wanted to see the Venetian and it was quite the walk to get all the way up there and I was glad I did not stay that far on one end. Places like the Wyn and Trump were even further as was Mandalay Bay the other direction. The Belagio pretty much marks the place to be location wise so I would suggest staying somewhere fairly close. TLDR. The Cosmo is glamorous and perfectly situated on the Strip with the opportunity to have one of the best views possible of the Belagio fountains Eiffel tower all the way up the north end of the Strip. Booking through Chases luxury hotel collection gave me a great value of extra perks and while I ended up receiving everything including the view upgrade it was clumsy and frustrating getting there. Whether it was because of my booking method or not I was dissatisfied with Cosmos service as they routinely inconvenienced me made errors and generally did not make me feel like my experience was their top priority these are not things I associate with a luxury hotel experience. The Wicked Spoon breakfast buffet and prime location views are things that would bring me back but I will certainly look long and hard at other options the next time I go to Vegas.", "offset": [0, 106], "date": "2016-11-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "0c95adee-6ea8-4b18-8e93-746c65a4d8c9", "sentence": "Cosmopolitan experience with upgrades and booking through a hotel collection ambiance vs Aria Belagio etc. I have never written a review for anything in my life but I am writing this one because it is one I wish I had found when booking my stay in Vegas.

The man then made a phone call and said I have a signature guest and want to know if there are any upgrades available. After a few seconds he nodded and hung up and hurriedly told me there were no upgrades because they were completely booked for the night. Hold on all 30 of your rooms are booked and paid for. On this particular weekend that claim was preposterous and I still can not believe he said it to me with a straight face. Even if they did not want to upgrade me for whatever reason I would have been much happier with just a no instead of a flat out lie. I knew I would not get anywhere with him so I let him confirm my free breakfast and spa passes and took the keys and left. We went and checked out the room on the 57th floor as expected with no fountain view although the view was not horrible you looked out at Aria and could see a bit of the south strip like MGM etc. I immediately looked online and sure enough I could have booked any room type I wanted for that night right then and there proving the sold out spiel was total hogwash. So that was my initial check in experience as a signature guest actually booked through Chase LHR but whatever. Perhaps because my check in time was early they were reluctant to upgrade me but I think the stuffy older man in the autograph lounge just had no interest in making my stay exceptional. andor Cosmo is plain stingy. Regardless were I to do it over I would NOT go to the autograph lounge but rather straight to the regular front desk. Which brings me to attempt number 2. After confirming online that there was no way they were full for the night I went back down to the regular desk and explained that I had an an upgrade upon availability but was told I would not be upgraded due to full capacity but I see availability online and want confirm this. The young lady at the desk said yes she would check and they should have something. She typed and made a phone call to the mysterious upgrade broker hung up and said she could only upgrade me for 35 night. At this point I decided the view was a pretty big deal breaker for me and reluctantly agreed to pay the extra. She put me on the 40th floor in the same west tower as the other room. but on the north side and we moved our bags to switch rooms. The view was all of what I had hoped and we noticed the balcony was much bigger than the non view room which was really nice. I think the views are even better in the east tower since it is right on the actual boulevard and may give you a more straight shot down the strip but our view was fantastic nonetheless. I was satisfied with the room but definitely not about the fact I had to pay for it. Because of the hassle and impression that they were out for themselves and not me I stopped by the desk one more time late that evening on my way out to confirm that I would still have everything else supposedly included in my LHR booking. I was helped by another young lady and I explained what I had already gone through and why I wanted to confirm the rest. She pulled up my reservation and said yes you still have the buffet and spa and then asked me incredulously if they had really made me pay for the upgrade. I said they did and she said it says right here that you have a complimentary upgrade you definitely should not have been charged and we will take care of that for you. FINALLY an empathetic person that actually made sense and wanted to help me. Glad I asked. but third times the charm should NOT be the rule at a 5 star hotel. Everything else went smoothly and I charged the Wicked Spoon buffet and spa passes to the room as instructed in order to be comped. Then on the last night I got back to hotel around 4 am and headed to the desk to confirm that I would have late check out since it was another based on availability feature. I explained this and the girl said they almost always have late check out but claimed she had never seen such a thing like the upon availability she saw listed in my reservation. This amazed me as I can not possibly be the first person to book through the LHR collection. Regardless she gave me no trouble and granted me check out at 3 pm she said this was the latest they offer and told me I would need new keys which she handed over and threw away our old ones. We headed up to our room and the new keys did not work. Not what you want to happen at 4 am. Back down 40 floors to the desk and yet another girl makes us more new keys. She says that she hopes they work but if not we could call security from the elevator and they will come let us in without the hassle of going back down AGAIN. Honestly going to the elevator and calling security and waiting sounds like even more of a hassle. But moreso my mind is blown once again in a bad way that this girl can not guarantee my keys will work. That seems like the most basic function of the front desk of a hotel. Luckily they worked but the contingency speech was just another non reassuring blemish on the stay. Finally check out arrived and I braced myself for the bill that I had zero confidence would be correct the first time around. I would have loved to check out online and skip the line which is an option but my lack of faith told me I had to go in person. Sure enough no pleasant surprises as the girl shows me my initial bill. She said we got comped for the buffet but that the first day shows we had two extra people dining with us and it could not be comped. Are you kidding. I assured her it was just my wife and I every day we went and she said she would check with her manager to see if they could do anything. I then pointed out that we had also been charged for the spa which she said she would also check on. This is after she had already confirmed we had spa passes. I am baffled once again. As we stood there waiting quite unhappily the guy working the adjacent desk noticed and offered us some water. A small token of the service I expected from the rest of my stay at a 5 star hotel. The girl returned and told us the discrepancies had been taken care of. Another sigh of relief that should not have been needed in the first place. I will note there was no sign of the upgrade charge so that had already been fixed as promised. All said and done we ended up receiving the perks and paying what we expected the only added charges to the total I booked on the LHR site were the tips for the buffet. So technically booking through the LHR collection was a success but it was very tiring having to awkwardly explain and ask for things repeatedly only to be met with confusion and errant responses. No one wants to be the guy asking for freebies constantly and if they are already meant to be there I should not have to be. One more positive note the bell desk is located conveniently right by the main door to the taxis and rideshare and we had no trouble leaving our bags with them after check out since we were not heading to the airport for another few hours. While I obviously can not give the service at the Cosmo a positive review the physical hotel and casino itself were for the most part excellent. There was a smell of smoke in the hallways of the upper floors and some carpet stains and scratches scuffs on the walls that gave pause to the feeling of luxury. However its Vegas and I am sure most of the hotels have trouble keeping things pristine. The room itself had no smell or any issues. The bed was quite comfortable with plenty of pillows. The Japanese soaking tub was interesting and I feel it might be a love it or hate it type thing. It was fine for me I am only 56 but a tall individual may find it awkward and cramped. Because it is square and has seat ledges it is not meant to be the kind of tub you can stretch out and lay in but rather sit and soak hence the name. The window next to it is nice but the view is not that great because 1. The window is tinted presumably to block the Vegas sun and 2. When sitting in it your eye level is below the balcony railing which adds another tint obstruction. I did like the unique openness to the room from the tub and shower and loved how the shower and tub were one big area. A couple odd things about the room that were a bit annoying were 1. The doors were SO heavy and particularly the one to the water closet was set so that it would persistently close itself without any stopper and there was not one provided maybe my wife and I are the only total weirdos who like to be able to converse if one is on the toilet 2. There were no drawers if you like to unpack your clothes and the mini fridge is completely stocked great if you want to buy from it. so you can not put anything of your own anywhere except the freezer which does in fact freeze unlike some hotel freezers. 3. Lastly all the lights can be turned on or off at once convenient except the closet light which is motion sensored. This meant every night climbing into bed with the light still on and having to wait for it to turn off on its own you could close the doors but as noted there are no drawers and setting up your suitcase on the racks means you probably want to leave the doors open unles you want to stuff everything way into the back. Small annoyances overall the room was great. The only Cosmo dining options we tried were the Wicked Spoon buffet thankfully it was comped because it was actually fairly pricey 42 per person on Sunday. 27 weekdays with the no alcohol option and the secret pizza. The buffet was AMAZING the best I have ever been to I think. All options from breakfast to lunch to dessert many main staples alongside unique and creative offerings all delicious. We always ate fairly late around noon they are open 8am2pm3pm on weekends no worries about sleeping in. so the lines were not long but the entrance setup looks like a Disneyland queue and I would not want to be there when it was full. The secret pizza was pretty good but was 5 for a slice of cheese so we opted to pay 26 for the whole pie even though we knew we would not finish it. I will conclude if you even made it this far with a quick summary of the atmosphere casino and location. The Cosmo is designed to have a very glitz and glamour feel as opposed to some of the other nicer hotels like the Belagio and Venetian which go for an opulent palace vibe. While those might make you feel like European royalty Cosmo wants you to feel like a modern Jay Gatsby or James Bond. it is glitter and diamonds vs gold crown moulding and marble statues. Aria also had an ultra modern feel almost futuristic and high tech less glam. I think for the younger crowd these newer modern options are probably more in their wheelhouse generally speaking. The Cosmos casino was decent but actually relatively small and stretched out so that it was long and thin meandering along the south side of the whole building complex. As with most of the higher end hotels casinos the minimums are high 15 65 blackjack and craps 10 roulette and the slots seemed pretty tight. The dealers were great though. We found much friendlier table rules at Balys and Cromwell. I liked the feel of Arias casino the best as it felt huge and open. Belagio came in second for casino ranking as it was also big and sprawling. As for location you really can not beat the Cosmo. it is right in the middle of everything and there is not much that is not walkable. Cosmo had sky bridges to Planet Hollywood and Crystals shopping the center connected to Aria. I wanted to see the Venetian and it was quite the walk to get all the way up there and I was glad I did not stay that far on one end. Places like the Wyn and Trump were even further as was Mandalay Bay the other direction. The Belagio pretty much marks the place to be location wise so I would suggest staying somewhere fairly close. TLDR. The Cosmo is glamorous and perfectly situated on the Strip with the opportunity to have one of the best views possible of the Belagio fountains Eiffel tower all the way up the north end of the Strip. Booking through Chases luxury hotel collection gave me a great value of extra perks and while I ended up receiving everything including the view upgrade it was clumsy and frustrating getting there. Whether it was because of my booking method or not I was dissatisfied with Cosmos service as they routinely inconvenienced me made errors and generally did not make me feel like my experience was their top priority these are not things I associate with a luxury hotel experience. The Wicked Spoon breakfast buffet and prime location views are things that would bring me back but I will certainly look long and hard at other options the next time I go to Vegas.", "offset": [962, 1055], "date": "2016-11-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "5072fbda-e78b-4b74-b4cb-4b2ddaf34199", "sentence": "Great Hotel with great service.
