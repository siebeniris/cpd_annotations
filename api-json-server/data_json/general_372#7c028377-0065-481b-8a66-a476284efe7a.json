We checked in under our corporation for conference and all my co workers checked in without a problem I was the last in line and had issues checking in. I asked for a room on a top floor I was finally put on a higher floor only to look at a concrete wall in front of me. After an half hour I was finally in a room. We were staying for 4 nights.

My overall rating is 35 stars. While the front desk staffs service was excellent the place is a bit worn down and mattress seemed aged old and has lost its firmness. In what seems to be a cabinet for a small refrigerator it was vacant with no back panel which gave me the impression that they used to make refrigerators available in the past. When I stay at a hotel for more than couple nights I like to have a refrigerator to keep my water bottles cold and miscellaneous food items fresh. I could not believe their fitness center a tiny room with couple treadmills and hardly any equipments and not exactly conducive for more than 1 to 2 people to use at a time. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who does not need the amenities mentioned in this review as it is conveniently located in gaslamp district and again staffs excellent service makes up for other areas where they lack. Their restaurant was nice although it is with just one bartender serving the entire bar area plus the general dining area. As a foodie I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their food and this is another aspect that makes it worthwhile to stay with this hotel when visiting downtown San Diego. Service Near gaslamp district and close to many things including N Harbor Drive. Just 10 minutes away from San Diegos Sea World and Whale Watching boat tour Condition of mattress rooms and fitness center.", "offset": [203, 379], "date": "2015-10-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "23ea10f5-63d0-44ce-b829-97e1059cd074", "sentence": "Great Place to Stay in the Gaslamp.

The rooms were extremely small and hot. The AC would not drop below 75 degrees anytime of the day.

We had partiers on both sides of our room and felt like walls were paper thin. It was SO loud.

We stayed at the Bristol Hotel for 3 nights for a weekend getaway. Room 702 was comfy quiet and cozy.

Though we did not use it it was a nice amenity. The location is quiet central 2 blocks to Horton Plaza for shopping 5 blocks to the Gaslamp District and a short walk to the waterfront. There are plenty of restaurant options just steps from the hotel. At the time we stayed at the Bristol there was construction happening outside on the sidewalk. I do not know if this was due to the construction but the hotel provided ear plugs on the nightstand which was very thoughtful. We did not need to use them the construction was not bothersome at all.
