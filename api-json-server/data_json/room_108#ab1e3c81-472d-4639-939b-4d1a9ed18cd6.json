We usually dine at Linger Longer a classic upscale steakhouse which is a short stroll from the lodge along a lighted path. We have never been disappointed. The spa is the best around.

The spa was the only experience that caused a slight thought to keep this from a five star review. The service was not as RitzCarlton esque as one could expect from the phone interaction of the scheduling to waiting for front desk employees to finish a conversation before being greeted at the checkin desk to the distracted locker room ladies to the treatment provider dropping something during the massage that caused such a loud sudden noise that it affected the relaxation aspect of the treatment.

There is a wide range along with fruit a hot dish little dishes of things like shrimp chicken Caesar salad etc. Drinks are provided all day from 7 am to 10 pm.

Gaby \u2019s is a restaurant by the lake where you can dress casually and we enjoyed pizzas and burgers here. There \u2019s also tacos and lobster.

There are segregated steam and sauna rooms which I indulged in a lot and a plunge pool and hot tub in each of the changing rooms. The indoor pool is good when it \u2019s raining and the open fire by the hot tub is delightful. As with all Ritz Carlton hotels the service and standards were excellent.
