We know the beds are comfortable there. Hurricane Dorie was hitong the shore nut we planned on taking advantage and sleeping for most of the day. We arrived early and was ableto check in right away. Unfortunately our room which was on the 37th was next to the north tower of the hard rock and the storm coming off of the shore created a wind tunnel between the two buildings. The noise coming through the window was too loud for us to be able to sleep. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone right up. 45 minutes later we called again and they said someone was on the way. 25 minutes after that I went downstairs to the concierge desk and they switched our room right away. However after an hour and a half we finally get into another room and we got the SAME exact room. Only this time on the 35th floor. As soon as we opened the door you can hear the same blowing and whistling noise as the first room. At this point I was very irritated and was ready to check out. The bellman was very nice and said he would be right back and will take care of it. 15 minutes later he came back and put us in the room opposite. Since there was not another building on that side of the hotel there was not a wind tunnel and the room was quiet.
