The view off the side is incredible the yachts in the canal are an incredible site in the evening. The rooms are impeccable and the service is attentive and helpful.

We asked for some cooking supplies. The frying pan supplied was dirty and old. There was no tea towel or dish cloth supplied so no way of cleaning the pots pans plates etc. There does not seem to be a standard set of supplies in store for guests wishing to cook and the requests seem to be met in an ad hoc fashion.

The manager was extremely prompt in escorting us to a different room on a different floor. Unfortunately at 330 am the neighbors came back from wherever they had been and continued partying with loud music and lots of laughter. We called down to the night manager and security asked the neighbors to be quiet. The music stopped but the loud voices did not. There was no other room to move to.

Nach langwierigen Diskusionen mit dem Butler Service der Rezeption sowie der Parkhausgeselschaft wurde mir der Zugang zum Hotel Parkhaus verwehrt. Auch konte mir keinerlei Alternativen angeboten werden. Kundenservice ist inexistent. Ich muste die 250 Harley in einem angrenzenden Park auserhalb des Hotelgel\u00e4ndes auf einem unbewachten. nicht \u00fcberdachten Fahradstelplatz i m Regen stehen lasen. Das Hotel ist stark \u201a verbraucht \u2018 und m\u00fcste dringend renoviert werden.

The attentiveness to the beautiful rooftop has definitely fallen and I feel as though it is not kept up as nice as the Viceroy has. The only customer service I had a bad experience with is when we went upstairs to Adikt to grab a cheesecake at night and the lady that was a hostess was super rude and not helpful at all which caused us to head back to the room and order room service instead costing us probably 20 bucks extra but not having to deal with the attitude was worth it.
