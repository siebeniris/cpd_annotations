I get to my room to find out that the executive tower where my original room and the upgraded room are located has not had hot water and will not have hot water for days. I ask why they did not put me in the other tower when they knew my room would not have hot water. No answer but they did move me to the other tower on the second day. I think every guest should have been told that there was no hot water but especially since I stay a lot at Mariot hotels you think they would want to to inform me as well. Overall the location worked for business travel to avoid some of the city center traffic. The lounge was big and well attended well stocked with breakfast and evening food and drinks. However I was interrogated several times about why I was in the lounge. I gladly gave them my room number and name but was still asked repeatedly if I really had access It seemed a bit rude.

After researching Trip Advisor on Hotels in Doha we decided to be loyal to Mariot as we have always had very good experiences. The welcome to the hotel the check in process to an Executive room all went perfectly. The room overlooked the pool and port and was more than comfortable. Well appointed with everything one would need for a short or longer stay. However the restaurant selections and the choice of meals was dreadful. The buffet was appalling and unappetizing and the other restaurants do not exactly invite one in to try. We chose to have room service lunch and continental breakfast on the balcony and this was by far a better option. The Executive lounge also provided a poor choice for guests. The staff presentation and attitude overall was excellent and nothing was too much trouble. We have stayed in many Mariots around the world but the cuisine needs to be addressed to meet their high standards.

We stayed at the Doha Mariot for 3 nights with our children. Check in was a bit slow. Two prepaid bookings were made one for 2 nights and one for 1 night. We had the booking reference for the 2 nights but initially not for the last night. We were asked to pay for the last night although it has been prepaid because we did n\u2019t have the booking reference. I found this ridiculous given that both bookings are held under the same name and anyone should be able to check in using only their proof of identity. We finally managed to find the second booking reference. So a tip is to print the booking reference as the hotel seems to still follow ancient bureaucratic administration protocols. The hotel looks very tired and old from outside but the lobby and common areas are nice. Although good sized the rooms are screaming for refurbishment especially the bathrooms. The bathtub taps and showerhead are dull and tired. We had a good view of the gulf but spoilt by the layers of dirt on the windows. Unlike hotels in many countries people still smoke in the lobby common areas so expect to run the gauntlet through the stench of smoke as you get to your room. How modern hotels allow smoking in this day and age baffles me. Complementary Internet is slow and you have to pay for an upgrade if you need fast Internet. Room service. Food is average somewhat overpriced and the menu can be misleading. While it says that you have a choice of side with grills you do n\u2019t really and you are convinced that the side is the sauce that already comes with the main so you do n\u2019t even have a choice here. Cheeseburger for children is only cheese in a bun without the burger. Avoid the warm Arabic Meza with the shrivelled falafel and greasy dry pastries. We were very disappointed to know that the pool is closed for maintenance until further notice. Families book hotels for pool access and this can ruin their holiday plans. The hotel should have had a notice on their website to warn customers of this. If they have to shut down facilities like this then their customers should be compensated. The beach is far from being pristine and there was rubbish in the sea. The playground is worn out and the outdoor paved areas are taking their last breath of life. The key to our room did n\u2019t always work and had to be changed at least twice. I wanted to give the Mariot Doha 2 stars but I will raise this to 3 stars as some of the staff were friendly and because overall my children did enjoy the exhausted playground and beach.

Being one of the older hotels in Doha we thought it may be used to the Eid crowd usually experienced during this time of the year. Were we wrongAlthough check. in was smooth and fast our bags were dumped in the lobby and we had to take it up to the room ourselves. The room we booked was an executive room and though it had access to the Executive Lounge that is where the executivenes ended. Our room was on the 5th Floor and not the Executive 7th Floor which meant a lot of elevator waiting in a crowded hotel. No Welcome amenity an empty mini bar and a view from the back of the hotel overlooking the highway and some HVAC pipes. Even a call to Front Office regarding amenities and the empty mini bar did not result in any action. The hotel as stated is past its prime but the room was clean and the beds very comfortable. Due to it being the Eid break the hotel was extremely busy and it reflected on all areas of the hotel. The poor staff at the Executive Lounge was overrun and any items placed on the buffet literally flew off the plates. The staff did a great job in catering for the guests though but items were slow to be replenished. Surely such busy periods are anticipated and planned forAs an Executive Lounge member one can choose to take breakfast in the Executive Lounge or the Cornish Restaurant. We decided on the latter and the first morning of our stay breakfast was overcrowded. Again the staff did a great job in service but one could not help but feel there were far less staff than there should have been. The second day of our stays breakfast was much better as the Eid period ended and check outs were taking place. Food was average and definitely not 5star quality and really nothing extraordinary about any of the items on the breakfast menu or Executive Lounge buffets. The pool was equally busy and it appeared a lot of guests were leaving their towels as a booking on most loungers and gazebos a practice that really should not be allowed by the staff. The beach was less busy and a great alternative to the pool.

When you walk into this hotel you are greeted and made to feel welcome by very friendly personnel.

After not having been able to sleep the first night because of the Boat like mattress I had to do a first of in my life of staying in hotels. I had to ask for the mattress to be changed. Which was done very quickly but the mattress that was brought then was so hard I could have slept on the floor. I did not want to make a bigger scene and lied by thanking them for a Wonderful mattress. I stayed in the hotel for two weeks and during this time had enough time to play the roll of the secret hotel guest and these are my findings1. Spot the difference I like doing this exercise. Take the photographs from the Hotels website Which we as customers look at when we make an online booking and believe that we will get and find the specific spot where the photograph was taken and spot the diferences2. The restaurant menus. The world wide tendency is for locally produced fresh produce. All Qatars fresh produce is imported which means that the worlds fresh produce is on their doorstep. This is however not reflected in the restaurants menus3. Franchised value offering. The value offering is dictated from the Mariot head office. Can you believe it there is a photograph of Mr J W Mariot Snr and Jnr in the foyer first time that I see this in a hotel. This means that there are NO room for change at the local enterprise level. I visited the Mariot at various occasions and the menus at all the restaurants in the hotel has not changed over the past 3 years4. 5 Star Expectation vs Reality. The question that you pose in this instance is when you leave the check out counter on the last day is the following. Do I feel that I had a 5 star experience. Yes or No If not how do you rate your experience and why. My answers to these questions are as follows. No 3 star It is an old hotel with excellent personnel trying their best to do the best job with what they have5. In the room experience The bathroom as clean but needs maintenance Loose toilet handle black mold on the silicon seal around the bath makeup mirror loose water damage on the wood work around the basin. Stand in the bath shower with a small glass splash panel. Shower head needs replacement. Carpet has seen a lot of traffic pull the bed away and look at the diference6. Entertainment offering Apart from the usual CN SKY etc news channels the only other entertainment that I as a english speaking guest could watch was the travel channel and Fox Movie chanel7. Room Service VERY limited and un inspirational offering it was however always delivered on time apart from the time that I ordered the Fried Chicken. The waiter was very apologetic saying that it takes a long time to prepare the chicken which I do understand but then replace it with an alternative dish on the menu. The fish and chips is nice.

On the way to dinner we mentioned the lack of towels etc and were assured they would be sent up.

On our second arrival into this hotel I mentioned the previous problem but was assured that all was in order. Into our room and noted that sufficient towels were available but no bathrobes. I then received a courtesy call from reception asking if all was OK. I mentioned the lack of bathrobes. They would be sent up immediately was the reply. 6 hours later and still no bathrobes I went to reception and again was advised that they would be sent up. By bedtime they still had not appeared. Next morning on the way to breakfast I mentioned the lack of bathrobes again and was again told they would be sent up. 1 hour later 1 bathrobe appeared when I said we had asked for 2 we were told another one would be brought up. Needless to say that second bathrobe never appeared. On checking out I asked for some adjustment on my bill as I felt the service was far from acceptable.

I went to the Mariot Doha to celebrate my brithday. We were planning to spend the day by the pool and then book a room. The first impression I had when I saw the place was that I could nt believe this was a Mariot. We decided to move to the beach the beach is dirty even in the sand is impossible to walk the sea is disgusting all the chairs and tables were dirty with food. So after 5 minutes there we move to the pool. The pool is small and crowded even if it was nt weekend. but I thought it was okay to stay by the pool in the chairs that seemed to be very comfortable while having some drinks. Nobody was taking care of us so I went to the restaurant by the pool to ask for the drinks and food and for my last surprise that day we can not have drinks near to the pool. That was the cherry on the top so we decided to go.

Hi I would join and share almost all nice comment about Doha Mariot hotel until this point. When the swimming pool is now closed due to emergency repairs for 11 daysI doubt for this as how that can be scheduled that it for 11 days already. And If that is really EMERGENCY just do it what its necessary and open again asapthat is another spot why nothing is happening then to minimize this period as that has been almost done anything yesterday. Another point is short notice for this close time 1 day in advance. There was no information mentioned outdoor staff had not informed us. Only letter left in room in the evening. Also jacuzi is not working however that was information would be. Moreover some people say also that such repairs takes every year this time well. Disappointing if you planned this MAINTENANCE and surprise people this way. Especially for people who are attracted with your nice offers and coming right now with children to enjoy sunny time outdoor. Ok you have offer Sharq pool use and transport there use instead. Still not nice impression about all this situation.

Relaxing and refreshing weekend getaway in this hotel. Stayed for two nights and had good experience.

We stopped overnight to break our return journey from the Maldives to London.

Interconnecting rooms were clean and beds comfortable but generally due a refurb and update. We ate in the Asia restaurant and the food and service were both good but the air conditioning was set very cold the family that arrived after us all had to put extra layers and jackets onThe pool was very busy but the attendant did find us 2 x sun beds when we arrived shortly after lunchtime. that is all that was good about our pool experience. The pool music was way too loud for us and it had to compete with a second restaurant beach bar also blaring out music it was not clear if this was connected to the hotel or not. The cacophony of noise drove our kids back to the room after just 10 minutes. The bar service at the pool and again later in the evening was dreadfully inefficient and it seemed poorly organised and badly run. it is difficult for anywhere to compete with the Maldives but I would expect much better from a 5 star hotel. In the evening our kids opted for a movie and room service but unfortunately there were no pay movie channels and therefore no movie.
