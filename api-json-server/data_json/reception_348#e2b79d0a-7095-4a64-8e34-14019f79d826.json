Driving into the Corktown area we were immediately apprehensive as the area is not what is depicted online. There are a few newer bars in the area but it is mostly run down grafiti covered buildings. We arrived at the hotel and it looked pretty deserted except for the man leaning against the building drinking a beer. We sat in the parking lot calling other hotels and there were none available because there were back to back concerts that evening. At this point we had no choice except to stay. We went to the front door and had to wait for someone to buzz us in. They have tried to dress up the lobby with large lighting fixtures but nothing can distract you from the bullet proof glass completely surrounding the front desk with a small slot to pass your credit card through or the distinct aroma of marijuana in the air. We checked into the first room small dirty disgusting with stained sheets and the paint was peeling off the walls the toilet did not flush and the walls so thin you could hear neighbors on both sides talking. I called the front desk to complain and they moved us to a king room. The room was larger but still dirty. The walls were stained and the paint was peeling the sheets looked clean but the box spring no bedskirt had huge stains of some sort. We continued to call other hotels with no availability. We decided to make the best of it got ready and called for a taxi. While in the lobby waiting for a taxi three other couples checked in went to their rooms and checked back out. One lady stated there was something resembling feces smeared in her carpet and part of someones weave in the closet. We had a fantastic time at the concert. it is a short taxi drive to downtown however when we returned we had to wait outside for the on duty manager to buzz us in because the card reader at the door was broken. This is not an area you want to be standing around outside at 2AM. I read reviews on this hotel prior to booking it and can only think the positive reviews are completely bogus.

Was in town for the Garth Brooks show and decided to stay here. It was nice to see that you have plans to renovate. Your property definitely needs it. We had a good stay though. The staff was very nice and helpful. I do not think the maintenance guy left the whole time we were there. Nice guy. I come to Detroit occasionally for sporting events and concerts so I will probably give this hotel another shot.

Was in town for a conference which meant that most hotels in the area were booked. Grabbed this one based on the price. My first thought when I saw the bulletproof glass was that I had made a mistake. I went up to my room and my first thought was that this is the type of place that old washed up rockstars come to die from an overdose. Generally the place was kind of sketchy but the staff at the desk was outstanding. I mean they went out of their way any time I asked for help with anything and were very pleasant to deal with. it is in a bit of a rough neighborhood that is gentrifying so the sketchy nature should improve in time. The renovations should help bump up the caliber of people hanging around so that is something to look forward to. I would actually stay here again if I needed to find a room near downtown Detroit at a reasonable price if for nothing else to see its transformation once the renovations are complete. Desk staff was great reasonable price on the hipster side of town BREWERY across the street. Just a few blocks away you can find loads of excellent dining options in an up and coming part of town. there is a brewery just across the street.

The front desk staff said the Hotel would be upgraded within the next year upon checkout. It was OK for 2 nights tolerable at best. The sign out front says A Fine Hotel which it might have been back in the 60s. They turned a tub area into a tiled shower with a cheesy curtain. The sink counter had a burn mark and everything was OLD and tattered. There is only so much a coat of paint can hide. The bed was warn and there was what looked like a bullet hole in the headboard. The plug ins were on the floor and not grounded. The TV was an old tube style unit and the furniture was easily 25 years old. The HVAC unit worked just fine and the room did not smell that bad.

I was pleasantly surprised by my stay last night at the Trumbull and Porter hotel. it is definitely different from any hotel I have ever stayed in before and that is not a bad thing. It had a unique flavor. half industrial half European. I almost felt like I was not cool enough to stay there. The floors were concrete which was something I have not seen in a hotel before but I did not mind it. Everything was clean and modern with a great shower and they even provided a super soft robe and slippers. Nice touch. The room was not big but it was just the right size and I kind of liked their use of space. a clothes rack instead of boring closets and a rolling tray in the bathroom instead of counters. It did not feel cramped it felt just as it should. I think comfortable would be the best way to describe it. I heard they had a great coffee bar but unfortunately I did not get to experience that I do love a great cup of coffee. But they do have a restaurant with some great breakfast choices computers in the lobby if you need to do some last minute work a really cool outside patio and a little food pantry if you need a late night snack. The only complaint would be that the doors do stick but considering the positives I think I can live with that. Definitely a great place to stay in Detroit that is a short walk or Uber ride to Comerica Park and Little Caesars Arena yet off far enough to be quiet and quaint. They have only been open a couple months but seem to be doing things right.

When we got to our room it was cold. We found that the heater plug had tripped the breaker on the cord. My husband reset it and the heater appeared to have reset but it did not come on. We went to the front desk and we were given another room. We went back to our first room to get our stuff and the heater was on and working. We went to the other room anyway but the keys did not work. We went back to the front desk and returned the keys to the second room and opted to stay in our first one. This was not changed in the computer system because when we checked out there was confusion on our room. We were still listed as staying in the second room. Good thing the one we DID stay in did not get rented out. Someone could have walked in on us. Ugh. I also noticed there was only ONE robe and ONE set of slippers. Why when they knew there were going to be TWO people in the room. I asked at the desk and the girl told me that is what they provide and she could go dig around in housekeeping and find me another set if I wanted her to. Seriously. The pictures on the website show TWO people in robes and slippers. The descript of the room also says ROBES1 Queen Bed Non Smoking with Free High Speed Wireless Interior Corridor In Room Safe Recharge Device Iron and Ironing Board Refrigerator Hair Dryer Desk Robes Flat panel TV Wake Up Service Sports Channel. I nearly broke my neck on the rug in front of the bathroom sink. It is a cotton rug on cement floors and is EXTREMELY slippery. I can not believe someone has not been hurt before. My husband slipped on it as well. I ended up kicking it out of the way. I went into the bathroom and there was literally streaks of brown stuff running down the walls. It looked almost like someone threw a cup of coffee on the wall. I also noticed it out in the sink area but it was not AS bad. I took pictures of it and showed the girl at the front desk upon checkout and told her I was not even comfortable taking a shower in the room. She offered coupons for the restaurant for breakfast but we had already eaten there. There was no other compensation offered. There was a big long black hair on my towel cart. Neither my husband nor I have black hair. There was also no coffee pot in the room. I did not appreciate having to go out of my room for coffee first thing in the morning. I have NEVER stayed at a hotel with no coffee pot in the room. The hotel staff was very friendly and the restaurant staff were exceptionally friendly. My breakfast was terrible the eggs were SO overcooked that I did not eat 50 of them. I did not complain mostly because I just wanted to go home. But I noticed the server looked at my plate and I could tell she was looking at my eggs. I expected her to ask but she did not. But we had dinner there the night before on Thanksgiving and the food was really good and the service was excellent. I have to say that I was very disappointed over all. I was SO excited to stay there and looked forward to it for days. With all of the issues we had and the gross brown stuff on the walls I seriously wanted to just go home and could not wait to leave in the morning. We travel quite a bit and I am not normally so critical but I was just really disappointed. I read all the reviews on Trip Advisor before I book anywhere and the reviews were good. I felt it my duty to post this review for others.
