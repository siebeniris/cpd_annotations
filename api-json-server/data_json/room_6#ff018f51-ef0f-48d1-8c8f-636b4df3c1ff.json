The hotel is very clean the rooms are spacy and the staff is perfect and very helpful. This hotel has a nice wellness area pool gym and sauna. The pool area is great. The sauna area is somewhat small. So the sauna is nice to use when you are at the hotel anyway but ist is not worth booking the hotel just because of the sauna facilitites. We booked the Treudelberg arrangement vis the hotels homepage which seem a good value for money. The hotel is located 10min by car to Popenb\u00fcteler s train station. You can also take a bus there. It is about 30min by train to Hamburg city center without changing trains. The hotel has a quite spacious golf course.", "offset": [79, 165], "date": "2015-01-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "54dd1cbf-2de6-4d49-a81f-7794bc0cc4e2", "sentence": "Beautiful hotel. but. This hotel looks lovely and is very clean the staff were also very friendly and helpful. We paid for a larger room as there were three of us including our son who is very tall over 6 feet. The room was big enough for our needs. Unfortunately none of us managed much sleep over the two nights as the room was far too hot even with both windows open making it noisy between 060 and 230 due to proximity of airport. This may just have been our room that was on the 3rd floor above the pool area.

I have stayed in this hotel more than 10 times in the period 193 202 with my parents while they were travelling for work. The hotel was in that time real high class a fancy golf hotel. Coming back to the hotel now you see that not a lot has changed and I mean it in a positive way. The hotel is still beautiful in a traditional style. They have added a new part in the hotel called atrium where you can find beautiful modern rooms. The restaurant is relocated in the golf clubhaus. But everything is still good taken care of as it was in the past. The hotel does not feel so high class anymore the hotel market has improved a lot in 15 years but that did not matter that much. The spa swimming pool is really like it was before. Not a lot has changed but it was all clean. Connection to Hamburg is easy take a bus and next the S bahn in Popenbutel.
