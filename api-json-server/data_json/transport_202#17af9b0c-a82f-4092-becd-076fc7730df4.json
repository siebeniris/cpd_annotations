The review for this hotel is a bit tricky as the impression is quite mixed. The positive things are The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and we got our room before the official check in time. The hotel is clean and the rooms are quite big and well equipped for a hotel on such a location. The bathroom is small but that is not a big issue. The hotel itself is on a great location to visit San Francisco and of course this also means there is not complete silence during the night. The really big issue is the noise during the night we did get a room facing the bus terminal and to make things worse we also got a corner room with an additional street on the other side. It was almost impossible to get any sleep during the night. There was an extreme noise all the time. On top of the noise from the street there was also quite a bit of noise from the other rooms as the walls are very thin. This would have been acceptable given the location and the fact that it was a weekend but in combination with the street noise simply a kilerUnfortunately this ruined our entire trip to San Francisco as we were too tired to enjoy the city the next day. We complained during the check out process and they apologized and told us that they can not tell the bus terminal to be quite. This means they are fully aware of the situation and do not do anything about it. Given the fact that you pay quite some high prices for the rooms which again is the way it is on such locations and we were fully aware of it I am sure they could afford to at least change the windows to sound proof ones for the sides facing the streets. There are also more quite rooms available and if you get one of them it can be a very decent stay. My advice is if you get a room facing the bus terminal insist on getting a different room if this is not possible change the hotel.", "offset": [1203, 1330], "date": "2015-06-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f86ac03b-0e3d-44d5-ade9-7b1af33bc4cc", "sentence": "Good Touristy Location.

This is a nice place close to all the tourist venues at Fishermans Wharf in San Francisco.

We could only get a king bed room so my 17 yo had to sleep on the floor another outrageous fee for a rolaway. Stay a little bit further out and get some comfort. City busses are pretty easy to use.

We stayed in room 403This was the last of five hotels we had staying in during our 3 week LA to SF trip so have a good basis for comparison. Small bathroom we have traveled extensively throughout the world and this was the smallest we have experienced for quite some time practically need to climb into the bath to be able to shut the door behind you. With respect slightly larger people would not only find it difficult to access the toilet and bath area but also find it difficult to get them selves on and off of the toilet. the gap within which the toilet is situated is very narrow. Cheap soaps and shampoo products. Room was in the loft so no natural ventilation can not open window. Window blind either open or shut. no privacy when open but due to slope of roof window no other form of blinds available. A C unit VERY noisey indeed. Had to stop using it as it kept us awake at night. Took 1 hr and 40 mins for staff to find room that was ready for us. a very frustrating wait after a long journey. A voucher for a coffee was nice but rather missed the point. External fire pit seating areas are great but most of the time completely taken over by smokers which precluded us using these spaces. Breakfast seemed expensive so we ate out on each occasion. No in room complimentary tea bags limited refills of coffee and the usual lack of milk for coffee shame to have cardboard cups within the room but seemingly becoming standard practicedid not use clothing hanging space as it is within the wash basin area with no separate door.", "offset": [0, 44], "date": "2018-09-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "933480e0-6a69-464f-b02e-704ecb7b01b0", "sentence": "I decided on this hotel because of location and the option of self parking.
