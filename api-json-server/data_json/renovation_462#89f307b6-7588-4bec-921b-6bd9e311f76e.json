This is a different type of review for me because I am used to leaving very positive reviews. My family and I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Atlanta Perimeter while our home was undergoing repairs. The hotel had pretty good reviews however my experience was a little less than average. So I check in and the front desk person writes the wrong room number on the key card envelope. This was quickly corrected. We go to the room on the 2nd floor and it looks nothing like the renovated rooms that were advertised. The room was old very dimly lit and just felt creepy. I immediately called the front desk and asked to be moved to a renovated room. The front desk promptly took care of this request and moved us to the 3rd floor. We open the door to a very nicely renovated room and it reeks horribly of Marijuana. I could not believe it. I immediately called the front desk and asked to be moved once again. They gave us another renovated room on the 3rd floor. 3rd times the charm. The room was nice and comfortable however the hall reeked of Marijuana the entire stay. The fire alarm actually went off the next night because someone was smoking Marijuana in their room. There were tons of No Smoking signs throughout the hotel but I guess that did not matter. There were definitely some sketchy patrons visiting this hotel so we definitely will not go back. Not what I had expect in Dunwody. I can not believe they are able to charge what they charge. One positive point They had nice washers and dryers.", "offset": [947, 1000], "date": "2015-01-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3f9c6fae-5dd2-4ee8-895d-ac2531478977", "sentence": "Fantastic location for where I needed to go.

Clearly the hotel has been renovated updated recently. The decor is fresh and modern. Our room was very spacious. Lots of different lighting. Nice TV with a great channel line up. I was with my teen son so having the extra sink outside the bathroom helped alot. He had a ball with the Kuerig machine. I appreciated the bottled water as I drink water as soon as I wake up.

Unles you run a campground if you rent places for people to sleep during the summer in Atlanta Air Conditioning is part of what the customer pays for. At least a campground has the opportunity for an occasional breeze. This hotel does not quite understand that AC must be working all the time. As part of a several day stay many people in our party as well as others we spoke with suffered through intermittent AC outages. Sometimes at night people would wake up in oppressive heat. Coming back to the room in mid day to shower was met with no AC in the room. Indeed AC and the crumbling d\u00e9cor of the hotel was the main topic of the stay. Besides the AC the lobby has not been renovated for decades. The elevators smell bad and the wallpaper is peeling from the hallways. The room wallpaper is also peeling. The room carpets are damp. While shower pressure is good tub drainage is not. One day in a horribly hot midday room was a cold shower and ankle deep water in the tub. The staff really did not care all that much. When one person in our group went to the front desk to report an AC outage the response was Sorry there really is not much I can do. The bartender spent most of her time speaking to two regulars rather than waiting on other guests and then suggested that her not doing her job was somehow acceptable. they are regulars. Now what do you want. Even after being told not to clean the room until we left for the day I returned from breakfast to find that very same housekeeper in my room. When we got back to the room later in the day she did make up the room but left clearly dirty towels under the sink.

The best part of the whole experience was the breakfast. While they were very busy when I went down at 745 and all the tables were dirty. They cleaned one off quickly for me. The omelet was perfectly cooked and the next pet was the pastries specifically the croissants. were extremely fresh. Most hotel breakfast have frozen pastries which is super annoying and cheap. This breakfast was amazing. The staff was incredibly gracious and helpful I think my servers name was Juan. Good guy and I should have made a point to mention him to the manager.
