We definitely will be back and highly recommend this hotelThere was not really anything we did not like.

My Mom and I stayed here over a weekend and loved it. We normally stay with family when we visit Oakland but arrangements were made for us to stay here because of the wedding we were attending. We stayed on the 3rd floor in a double queen room. The room was clean and nice and they include a one cup coffee machine in the room as well as a small fridge not stocked and an even smaller microwave. Very nice in case you bring back leftovers from one of the great restaurants or want to keep some snacks in your room. There is free wi fi though I never used it. The outdoor heated pool was also still open while we were there. The lobby has a one cup coffee maker with assorted coffee and tea pods cream sugar and several large urns with regular and decaf coffee and paper cups for taking with you as well as a large urn of ice water just inside the entrance with plastic cups to quench your thirst after walking around Jack London Square. The first night we both normally have trouble sleeping in hotels after a day of travelling. We made the mistake of unwittingly leaving a window open yes the windows open. and letting the train noise in so the first night was not very restful. The next two nights we made sure the window was shut and we had no problem sleeping as the windows do shut out most of the outside noise. The hotel does provide earplugs if you are a light sleeper. The hotel is older but has been well maintained. I did hear some hallway noise but it never lasted long enough or was late enough that it disturbed sleep. The windows open to let in that fabulous bay breeze and in October the weather was nice enough to want them open. The staff was wonderful always greeting us whenever we walked through the doors and our housekeeper Monica tried to anticipate our needs every day by leaving extra coffee pods cream cups shampoo whatever we had used the day before. We did have several problems with our room key card becoming deactivated over the 3 nights we were there. I am not sure if it was my cell phone or the key card reader but since it is not a huge hotel it did not take long to either run down and get a new card or have maintenance come up or sometimes Monica would let us in so we did not have to wait. The location of the hotel is fantastic. Right on the water we would watch the birds boats and people while having coffee out on one of the several benches just steps from the doors of the hotel. The ferry terminal is right there also and was a fun diversion one day. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. All in all if I needed to stay in a hotel in Oakland again I would definitely stay here. it is a little pricier than other hotels in the area but the location can not be beat. And being steps from the water was a huge plus.", "offset": [2530, 2595], "date": "2015-10-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "c4ff4cd4-8588-42dd-8734-915da8fd0e6c", "sentence": "Wonderful Hotel Experience.

Our trip began in San Jose. We took Amtraks Capitol Corridor to Jack London Square and decided to stay overnight in Oakland to get an early start on the ferry to San Francisco the next morning. We could not have chosen a more relaxing quiet clean and comfortable hotel. We took the easy and short walk from the Amtrak station even though the hotel offered to pick us up. We were greeted warmly at the front desk and check in was a breeze. Staff members were all polite and helpful. Our room overlooked the heated outdoor pool and the marina. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. In the room was a safe a refrigerator a nice desk a table with chairs and free wi fi. The hotel is centrally located and close to all the restaurants and shops in Jack London Square. Even though the hotel was close to a large viewing party watching an NBA championship game Oakland vs Cleveland we could not hear any fan noise at all. Room service is available but it is so much more fun to walk on the esplanade which is beautiful and peaceful and to explore the variety of restaurants.

My husband and I booked a room mid week to see a show at Yoshis. we are from the Bay Area but did not want to do the long drive late evening after the show. I booked a room through hotelscom and was really happy with the room. There are 2 buildings and we were in the building next to the one with the hotel lobby. The room was generous in size with 2 queen beds and a little balcony looking out onto the street. The room was very quiet. It was nicely appointed with a large desk dresser unit. Plus it had a round table with 2 comfortable chairs as well as an easy chair next to the balcony. It was really comfortable for us to read in and use our devices. The wifi was terrific. I wish all accommodations had wifi that was this good. There is a Keurig cofemaker in the room which I find to be so civilized. There were only 2 coffee pods for the morning so I requested more at the front desk. They were very accommodating and Housekeeping dropped off additional ones. One drawback is that parking is valet parking and costs 30 per day. A second drawback is that there is no breakfast included in the rate. There is a small cafe by the hotel restaurant that offers coffee and some breakfast fare which we did not try. Everything worked well for our stay here and we would definitely stay here again.

It was something I wanted to visit for many years had to wait till I retired. The Waterfront Hotel is a seafaring themed hotel hesitate to say nautical themed.

I opted for the sea view which encompasses not only Jack London Square it \u2019s located in the middle of it just a few feet from the sculpture of the famous author but the ocean Alameda distant San Francisco. On Friday early evening to the weekends the sea view allows you to take in the three day festivities festooned with tents shops street food American Creole Soul dancers music the energy of people. The rooms are equipped with the standard fare but there is a nice dorm room sized refrigerator hidden in the cabinet beneath the large screen TV37 \u201d or larger. Next to it is your safe large enough for laptops other items. Below the safe is a 4dreser drawer ensemble. Two bottles of Kala Springs water is delivered daily.

There \u2019s an extensive wine list a selection of beers. The staff is knowledgeable especially for allergies they try to accommodate everyone. I gave it 4stars only because 15blocks away a rail line shared by Amtrak Caltrain freight shares rumbles around.
