I came here for a convention last month and the hotel was convenient clean very nice room and bathroom was large with great lighting. The convention rooms across the street were very nice and the food was catered and was delicious and still warm. Many times banquets have cool or cold food. The last night I was there we attended an installation and the Chinese food they served was wonderful. I highly recommend this hotel and if you enjoy nature the grounds and golf courses were beautiful. A duck pond was right outside our convention room so I enjoyed watching the birds when the rain came.

Was here for a large conference. So I did not experience most of the amenities except the pool and golf. The rooms are pretty spacious with plenty of room for 2. The pool is nice and the golf is good for a resort facility. Having done a lot of conferences and having eaten a lot of bad chicken dishes I will say the food and service at this hotel was better than most. It is not easy to take care of a few hundred people a day. I would say they tried to put some thought into the meals rather than just making sure they had enough plates and do the bare minimum. Service throughout the hotel was friendly and efficient. My only complaint was that they did not seem to expect the pre dinner rush at the lobby bar on a couple of occasions. Tough to staff for a one hour onslaught I know. But you have to expect that there is going to be a rush pre dinner and 2 bartenders could not keep up.", "offset": [181, 241], "date": "2018-11-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "c04350b3-b226-498f-bef0-d54fbce03e0a", "sentence": "Great Hotel for Kids Families. Another family and ours decided to do a quick weekend getaway from LA to the Palm Springs area for Presidents Day weekend. Found out about this hotel from Red Tricycle which has a nice article summarizing why this is a great place for families and the article was spot on. All the kids immediately noticed how impressive the pool area is. We only arrived in the late afternoon and did not have a chance to experience it ourselves until after dinner. However even though it was a cold night the main family pool with a small beach and graduated entry stayed warm. And the jacuzi was hot but not too hot so that was nice. We had dinner at the on site pizza restaurant. There was some confusion about corkage when I called down to the front desk they called the restaurant and then got back to me that there was no corkage so we happily brought down our own bottle only to be told that they do in fact charge a 25 corkage fee. When I explained that I had called and was told there was no corkage they kindly waived the fee. The service was a bit slow considering only one other table was being used when we arrived and the drink menu strangely did not include any wines nor did they bring us a wine menu after we asked. But the place is kid friendly and the pizzas were good. The rooms were nice with good showers and the hotel was able to provide our families with adjoining rooms which was great. Our rate also included breakfast for 4 for only 12 more per room so a great deal so we were able to enjoy a nice buffet that included lots of fresh fruit and an omelet bar. One other great feature of this hotel the gym. it is one of the largest hotel gyms I have ever seen. It includes the usual equipment treadmills bikes elipticals as well as some weight machines free weights rope tension equipment a screen where you can select video workouts and even 2 Peloton bikes. And they provide free earbuds as well.

The Residents Indian Wells Resort Spa in Palm Spring California was an awesome place for my family to travel for spring break. It was about two hours away from downtown Los Angeles and I would definitely recommend this hotel for families of all ages. It was an old hotel that was recently renovated and was a very nice hotel. It was located in a very nice part of town as you can definitely walk to nearby restaurants. The customer service was excellent along with its amenities. All of the workers were always so helpful and kind. It had an awesome pool area for all ages as there were always enough chairs and also had polside cabanas. The property was also very nice as there were tennis courts a basketball hoop golf and a mini beach. There are lots of places to hike with mountains everywhere. Also in the middle of the pool there was a bar that you could swim out to and enjoy a nice drink or some food. Inside the hotel there were three restaurants. One casual sports bar an italian and a sushi place. All three were great options to eat at as all were kid friendly had excellent service and had large menus. There was also a very large lawn outside towards the back part of the property. This was a great spot as we saw a wedding one night then a business conference the next. The rooms were nice and spacious and some also came with an outdoor patio. The scenery and the views were beautiful as you can see the sunset as well as giant mountains out in the distance. Overall this was an awesome hotel with lots of great activities for all ages. It also had awesome restaurants and beautiful views.
