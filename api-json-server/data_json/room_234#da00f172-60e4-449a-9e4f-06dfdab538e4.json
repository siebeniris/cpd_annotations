The cause was service related not in the spa where we really enjoyed the massages. It was a big stumble in hotel operations and front desk management Our three night stay in mid January was planned to provide some stress relief to one of my wifes cousins who lives in Austin and just because we enjoyed a similar three day Christmas getaway in 2012 at Barton Creek. The whole complex works at 4star efficiency and is generally of 4star quality in the accommodations dining and spa services. I gave it an excellent rating on TripAdvisor in January 2013. It also got a good review in an article I wrote for a consumer travel magazine Heres how Barton Creek failed us. Before we left home on the morning of the first day of our trip we were driving to Austin we received a call from the hotel informing us that instead of two upgraded rooms in the main hotel tower we were being moved to a three bedroom villa half a mile away for the first two nights. The reason for the move The hotel was sold out to group business and they needed the two rooms we had reserved. The home part of the time shares in what is mostly the upscale residential community around the hotel was very nice. It was spacious with a huge kitchen in an open floor plan and far more beds than three of us needed. The master bath was great. But the location also meant driving or taking a very long walk for meals in the restaurants and to use any of the other amenities. The trouble started when as we had been warned we would have to move out of the villa after two nights but my wife and I would be given a very nice suite in the main building for the last night her cousin had to go home by then. We packed up and vacated the house well before 10 am on our third day as required and arrived at the front desk as directed. We then spent almost four hours sitting in the lobby or strolling its hallways a cold steady rain fell all that day because the suite had been occupied the night before and was not ready. In about hour three a check with the desk clerk determined that the housekeeping staff was at lunch. You hear entirely too many one sided phone conversations and Fox TV news reports in four hours in the Barton Creek lobby. When we finally got in the suite just before 2 pm it was a profound disappointment. It had plenty of room in both the living room and bedroom but had very drab furnishings virtually nothing on the walls a small cramped bathroom sink and a small closet located in the bathroom and was next to the elevators. We recently became Omni frequent guest program members but are unlikely to return to this property again.", "offset": [2402, 2624], "date": "2015-02-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "0563bdc2-e45c-407f-99d3-43560282e8a9", "sentence": "Barton Creek Resort Spa. The staff are great. We were greeted immediately and our bags were taken to our room as we checked in. If you do not use the valet service it is quite a walk to park your car and retrieve it. Our room was on the third floor 323. We could see one of the golf courses and hills from our window. The room was very large with king bed and a twin hide a bed sofa. The sofa was not very comfortable to sit on. Not much furniture for the size of the room. Plenty of space on the desk area for writing and lap top. The bed was horrible. Mattress was terribly uncomfortable. If it was a pillow top you could not tell. You could definitely feel springs. One sink was located outside of the bathroom which was nice but the sink was cracked and drained slow. I am fairly short and the counter seemed very high for my height. The full bath was nice. Very little water pressure in the shower. No make up mirror. The room always seemed very still with little air circulating even with the fan on. Pay attention to the price list for things in the mini bar. The list on our mini bar indicated the bottled water was 150. At check out they had to look the price up and told me it was more than what was listed. If you are able purchase water elsewhere and take it back to the hotel. The tap water in Austin is horrible. Maybe I am spoiled by the water in Arlington TX. We have great water. This is a great place if you are a golfer or play tennis. It is quite a ways from any shopping or restaurants other than those located in the hotel. Nothing within walking distance. The nature trail is beautiful. We did see a deer. I am sure it is even more beautiful in the spring and summer. The pool is large and there are two hot tubs. Only one was heated during our stay which is probably all that is necessary this time of year. Lots of lounge chairs and views from the pool. When the weather is warmer and the pool is open this no doubt is a wonderful place to hang out. The indoor pool was fine. Lots of exercise classes offered and gym was nice. Checking out was a breeze. Getting our bags into the car was a challenge. For whatever reason people pull up to the door and leave their car. This blocks other cars from pulling forward to get their bags or leaving the area. All in all I felt this was an average hotel. I expected a little more for the money.", "offset": [1691, 1736], "date": "2015-02-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "833516b8-050b-4879-8091-4c4f4a4f18e3", "sentence": "Poorly managed property. So many things are wrong with this place that did not have to be. It all comes down to very poor overall management. it is a shame because the property has some great things going for it and this hotel could be a great spot but it needs major updating and a cultural change. Most staff behaved as if they did not care and did the bare minimum. Worst of all was being nickled and dimed at every turn. Room was spacious and clean. Mini bar and coffee in room which is a plus. you will be charged an additional 50 a day for a resort fee which came as quite a surprise. The main dining room charges an automatic 21 gratuity even for the breakfast buffet another surprise. Food and service in the main dining room is bad. Food in the 1821 restaurant was good and the staff friendly unlike in the main dining room. Jacuzi area in the spa had water all over it with towels and warning cones not attractive or safe. Steam room was barely warm. Carpets on the room floors in bad shape. Beware that the property does not manage its own website so activities listed are not necessarily available a big disappointment to the kids. Pool area was poorly managed. Towels piled up and dishes and glassware stayed around for hours. I wish I had taken pictures. there is a great concierge by the name of Jean. She was the highlight.

I wanted to love you but I just could not. There are many wonderful things about this hotel like the food service and the people who work in the golf pro shop. However there are also many problems. I will try to break it all down for you. Service Overall the service was somewhat lacking but I knew I was not staying at the Four Seasons. However when the front desk tells us that someone is coming upstairs with a key to our new room there was an issue with our first room I kind of expect that person to show up. In general the front desk here could use some help. There were multiple times when they said they would do something and just did not. I will not go into how long it took to get my bill straight. Front desk is your first stop at the hotel and I kind of think this should display the best service the hotel has to offer. Rooms. This was actually my bigger issue. While the room was modern it just did not feel clean. One of the bathrobes had clearly been used by prior guest and not replaced and there were a few places where the room just did not look clean. Again I try to keep my expectations in check but I have stayed at Holiday Inns that feel cleaner. Food The food in general was good and the food servers were terrific. I would recommend moving some of them to the front desk. Pool Grounds. I was there over a holiday weekend and the pool was crowded. I did not come here sit by the pool but if you are going during a weekend when there may be a lot of families just be warned it may not be relaxing. The grounds in general are beautiful and the hotel is without a doubt in a beautiful location. Golf If you are a golfer then you will love it here. The two Fazio courses are superb. The golf staff is also great with the exception of one individual who managed to ruin our round by accusing us of being on the wrong course. I sensed some tension with having non members or maybe just women on the course. The hotel and the golf staff were very apologetic about this incident and wanted to make up for it. When you have limited time unfortunately there is little that can be done but I would not let this stop me from playing here again. Spa I got a decent massage here but it is hard for me to judge the overall spa because the day that I was there they were having repairs done in the ladies locker room. Overall I think the reason to come here is for the golf. The tennis facility looked nice too but I did not get to play. With a couple of tweaks I think this resort could be amazing.", "offset": [359, 534], "date": "2016-06-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "73df4bdb-f746-4eaf-9ecd-a10833e560ee", "sentence": "Read the fine print carefully.

As a hospitality major a consultant and an experienced Chef my eye for detail is microscopic. Barton Creek has great potential with its prime location in a hot city. The hotel and spa needs an update if they want to live up to a 5 star 4 diamond resort. Walls are thin and noise is an issue. Spa and gym are old and wear and tear is apparent. Especially in the mens locker room. Hot tube was dirty and under temp. The design of entire spa and gym is inconvenient and dangerous in spots. The hot tup requires climbing slippery steps in order to enter tub. The jet timer is at bottom of steps. Very bad design. Only 3 showers and a steam room that smells of mold. Entire locker room smells and is often messy. Dust on many ceiling fans and other decor. Carpets old and dirty. Restaurant is mediocre with bad service however the breakfast buffet is well executed.

Unfortunately I think lots of golfers left their room at 3 4am and when they left their room doors slammed shut with very loud noise. I was constantly jilted by the sound noise. That was not good at all. So I requested a changed room. The new room located on 8th floor because the walls are so thin I can hear children talking next door to me.

Driving up to the hotel the grounds are beautiful. Welcome to a restful weekend getaway. After being able to check in early which was a positive we went to our room. It smelled moldy or like mildew. We turned on the AC hoping to remove some of the odor. I am highly allergic to mildew and mold. We quickly changed and went to the pool. The pool area was nice however it would be nice to have an adults only area OR enforce that children have on a swim diaper. It is disgusting to be around a pool with kids that may not be potty trained and could defecate in the pool. For sanitary reasons I just feel a swim diaper is appropriate. But hte pools do have an amazing view. While at the pool we ordered drinks after over an hour of waiting not exaggerating and having to ask about our drinks 3 times the drinks showed up and were terrible. The pina colada tasted like just ice. No flavor to them. I had to send mine back and ask for more mix. They were not worth the price 60 for 4 small blended ice drinks. Now the horror begins. After returning from the pool we went to take a shower and to our dismay I found hair on the shower walls and a used towel with blood or fecal matter on it hanging over the shower rod. There was also a washcloth with blood on it in the tub. I called the front desk and requested a room change. We were offered maid service. I needed to be moved because if the bathroom looked like that what was on the sheets and in the carpet. I was not willing to chance that. I was told that there were no rooms available. Then I was told we could be moved. The bell hop came and moved our things and asked to see the bathroom and the towel. We felt like maybe he was checking because someone did not believe us and our report of our findings. I found it insulting that we were told there were not any rooms available then magically one is available. Hm. Interesting. Then in the new room the fridge was not cold not even after making adjustments. We just dealt with it because it was better than the filthy bathroom in the other room. Whoever the front desk person was is not friendly. At check out when asked how the stay was I relayed the bathroom cleanliness issue and was given credit for the horrible drinks at the pool. Thanks for that at least there was an attempt to make things right. But in all this location has a beautiful look to it and a wonderful location I just do not know that I would ever go back here.

Varied Restaurants and Buffet breakfast good and has an omelet station and they let you take coffee and Juice to go. They have outdoor fire pits and you can buy smores packages in the lobby store. there is a great lawn that you can use if it is not reserved for private parties. Cons. Traveling with young kids it was tricky although the grounds and hotel itself were beautiful we found a few things that could be improved the pools that is the main and really only thing to do here with young kids. Although the outdoor pools are heated in the winter they tend to do maintenance so you may not get to use any or only 1. The indoor lap pool was heated but felt very cold to us I lasted 15 min and it was down several flights of stairs not stroller friendly as well. It would have been amazing it they had an indoor hot tub or steam rooms. We tried going for walks on the grounds but since the sidewalks are shared with the golf carts which are stealthy quiet and you can not hear them coming so we felt in the way often just trying to go for a stroll. Restaurants we went to a cheaper lunch cafe for lunch and for a family of 4 with 2 kids meal items it was close to 100 dollars. IT was actually cheaper to do Uber Eats which is what we ended up doing for the remainder of the trip. Breakfast buffet was covered by conference so that was nice. we had no car and its about a 30 min drive from the city of Austin so I felt a little stranded there with not much to do but relax but the kids were going stir crazy.
