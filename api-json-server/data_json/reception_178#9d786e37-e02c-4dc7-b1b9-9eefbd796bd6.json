I booked a King room on Hotelscom. When I got there and checked in I was told that I was not going to get the room I booked because I used Hotelscom and therefore my reservation was not guaranteed. So I was booked into a room with 2 full beds. I could not even sleep next to my significant other. When I tried to go back down to the registration desk to come to some sort of a compromise I was again told nothing could be done. I get that its a busy weekend for hotels but offer me something. Comp the Valet or a meal. SOMETHINGThe other really bad part about all this is when I tried to call hotelscom about this there was an hour wait time to talk to a rep. I was given the option to have a call back which I took. They did call me back when they said they would but I was again placed on hold and I hung up after waiting an additional 7 minutes to talk to someone. Which I never did.

My 3 yr old daughter loves to swim so I decided to take her to a hotel in Downtown Indianapolis for a two night stay. I looked at the pictures of the Westin and booked my weekend.

I called the front desk and was informed the pool would be open first thing in the morning. No big deal I informed my daughter we could go in the morning and swim all day. I got up the next morning and still observed the pool was closed. I assumed it was taking longer to fix than expected so I decided to take my daughter to the childrens museum. The cost to leave the parking garage was 40. A couple hours later we returned and she took a nap. I again go check the pool and seen it was still closed. I called the front desk and was informed the pool was going to be closed all weekend. I went and checked the local aquatic center and seen they were open. I spoke to a lady at the front desk who stated that she was sorry but there is nothing they could do. I informed this lady that I have to leave the parking garage again and I would like to be able to do so for free. I was informed that she could not do anything since The Westin does not own the parking garage. The best she could do is comp me breakfast the following morning. So I spend another 30 to leave cost is 30 for 3 12hours. The following morning I eat my crappy buffet breakfast and pack to leave. As I am walking towards elevator the fire alarm goes off and we can no longer use elevator and have to walk down 7 flights of stairs.

We got late check out so the boys could swim but our key cards quit working and we could not get into the pool.

Second the check in desk was over staffed to prepare for the huge influx of people they were expecting to come in that day for the competition. I appreciated the noticeable increase in staff as we have been to several out of town competitions where we have had to wait upwards to an hour in line to check in. Not only was the check in desk well staffed they were very friendly as well. The hotel provided all guests with free internet for the weekend just for the competition which I thought was an awesome unexpected touch. We were provided a handicap room which was fine especially given the fact that we booked the room on another site for a heavily discounted rate so I was happy to just have a decent room. The shower head was loose and kept sliding down which sprayed water all over the floor. I say all that though to compliment the maintenance staff. When I called the very busy front desk they had someone up to the room for repairs in less than 10 minutes. We stepped out for dinner and came back to a perfectly working bathroom shower. The proximity to the convention center can not be beat the beds are the traditional Westin beds which sleep like a dream the pool fitness center and hot tub were great and the room service breakfast fast and delicious. My only complaint would be the elevator wait times. We had to wait a while for elevators that were not filled to capacity. We took the stairs one time up from the pool because we do not mind walking and were tired of waiting for the elevator but the stairs are locked to the floors apparently are for emergencies or outdoor access only so we ended up having to go back down to the ground level to get out of the stairwell walk outside in wet bathing suits hair in the freezing cold around to the front door.
