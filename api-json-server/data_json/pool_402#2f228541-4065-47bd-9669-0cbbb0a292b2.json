My son and I stayed at Oaks on Market whilst attending the Australian Open a birthday present for my tennis crazed teenager. To make my sons experience even more special we were upgraded to a room with a view and a King Bed on the 21st floor. The room was very spacious and had everything we needed. We did not cook but there were adequate facilities to do so if we had the inclination. It is a very short walk to Southbank and Flinders St station. there is also a myriad of shops nearby including a Subway open until 5 am and 7 Eleven. I would suggest asking for a room higher up as it could get noisy on the lower levels due to trains and general traffic. do not forget to ask reception for a towel for the indoor pool and spa as there are not any towels by the pool. The spa was set at 26 degrees a bit tepid for us but it was large and still enjoyable. The staff were courteous and helpful. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend the hotel to others. Spacious convenient well priced great facilities. No suggestions. Great location. Walk to trams trains Southbank Collins St cafes etc.", "offset": [691, 802], "date": "2015-02-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b926f415-f266-4a59-8fb7-48a4c51f8f51", "sentence": "Holiday. The hotel staff we great. we could leave our luggage before check in and there were no hassles with anything. It was a great home base for a week long holiday in Melbourne we walked everywhere inclduing the Vic market. However there was constuction noise in the early morning right across the street which made sleeping in beyong around 6 am hard and we were somewhat disappointed to discover that the spa pool is only 24 degrees not hot because it flows into the pool for some reason. The sauna is aweome though. Location Location great for central Melbourne. we walked everywhere. The bathtub could be bigger. The spa pool could have been hot.
