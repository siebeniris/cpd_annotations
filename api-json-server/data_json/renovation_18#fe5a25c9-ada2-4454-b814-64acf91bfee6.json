I stayed at the NoHo Ramada for a night I wish I had a reason to go back there. It was obviously built as a Resort of some kind and it still retains that charm from so long ago. Granted it could use a little updating but if you look beyond that you can see where it must have been quite the destination spot. The staff is nice and helpful the pool is not heated but it is crystal clear and large. As a previous reviewer stated it is like having a private pool no one else is interested in a swim. Rooms are large the flat screen HD Tv was really nice and clear. I was on the 4th floor and had great water pressure. I forgot some business items and the front desk helped me out with rubber bands paper clips and printing documents. the Gym is small but looks as though it was just rehabed. I enjoyed the stay very much it was very quiet and I got some much needed rest on a very comfortable bed which is important because my day starts at 4 am.", "offset": [340, 470], "date": "2016-01-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "a941d730-9609-40d4-9d06-2bbd54254f30", "sentence": "Hotel Morning staff where not accommodating and do not communicate well. I was given a shuttle ride to Starbucks since they could not accommodate me for early check in. it is great that I got a ride while waiting for my room but what is annoying and got me irritated is that they do not communicate well to get me pick up. It basically took 1hr just pick up me for an 10mins ride to the hotel. I noticed it needed some renovation for their bathrooms. it is convenient and closed to the Airport.

My last two experiences as I am sure your records show have been very disappointing. I will no longer rent a room without at least looking at the facility first. The shower had no volume or temperature control on the inwal valve even after I had the maintenance department send someone up. He never came back and never fixed it. The ac was so noisy above the bed in the wall with rattling I had to completely turn off the system to sleep. The whole bathroom facility was in need of repair and painting with the shower head falling away from the wall. Not in anyway representative of a Wyndm property. No bar which one would expect if not there due to a remodel then at least make the client aware especially after a hard days work and Monday night football.
