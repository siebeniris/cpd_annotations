Excellent location. If the owners seriously invested into the hotel it would be great. Staffing levels poor for the volume of business and market mix. Needs to consider people travelling from overseas etc. Can not at least register prior to check in time of 150. You find this out after waiting 40 minutes in a line. Express check in computers is great. I recommend it. But you need the hotels confirmation number to access it. My agent booking reference of course would not work. Someone did come and help. If you arrive early you need to store bags. This comes at a price of 5 per bag. Tickets are to be bought at the reception desk the one with the big line. My room was old and tired. Bed sheets were clean as well as bathroom linen. Room furniture old and tired and the Bathroom itself requires refurbishment. Old half peeled sticker on the wall etc. Lovely hot water but can not use tub as it looks gross. Sound proofing to the next room is poor. On check out there was a huge line. Wanted to use the Express Check out and store luggage. Went to the Bell Captain and learnt I needed to buy the luggage tickets at the reception desk. Seriously. Back in the line I went. On check out the GSA processes your bill without letting you see it first. I discovered I was over charged 40. I returned in the afternoon and had this corrected. Look. I understand NYC is expensive but the lack of service with sloppy processes and poor bathroom quality is no excuse. I will say that the 2 gentleman in the luggage room downstairs that you have to look for were excellent. I would suggest management have a chat with them as they were the only accommodating staff without looking for a tip that I had met.

We happened to be there during the World Pride March so the hotel was extremely busy. I believe there are over 170 rooms. There are 12 elevators and we never had to wait for an elevator. The breakfast was about a block away at a restaurant. They were very prepared for the hotel guests and I had a huge fresh fruit cup and wonderful pastry each day we went there.
