I \u2019m going to write this review without looking at my previous review. First let me say that we have been on over 10 cruises and this is the only all inclusive we \u2019ve ever been to so my comparison is to a cruise ship and my personal expectations. Secondly this is not a Ritz Carlton so if that is what you are looking for you will be disappointed. We were able to stay for 7 days late June 2015. We had a direct flight out of Cincy on Delta transfers to and from the resort and our 7 night stay all for 4k. I believe that was a fantastic deal. This will be a long review so if you do n\u2019t want to read it all here \u2019s the bottom line. I \u2019d go back a third time. We really enjoyed our time here. On our first visit we stayed across from the pool bar in swim up suites and had requested those same rooms this time. Unfortunately they were already taken but they offered to move us when they became available. We were put in building 1 and our friends in building 2. Both rooms were swim up suites in the cascade pool. This property has two pools the main pool which wanders through a large portion of the property and the cascade pool which is more of a traditional pool and is quieter and on the other side of the property. We enjoyed the location so much that we decided to stay in the rooms we were initially given. The only negative is that some of the rooms do n\u2019t get much sun right outside so you ca n\u2019t lay out right outside your room like you can at the pool bar location. Building 2 had more sun than building 1. Neither time have we upgraded to the Excellence Club. The property is beautiful and well maintained. The rooms are really nice and due to the location in the tropics you will encounter some bugs and our room had a slight musty smell but was n\u2019t an issue. Bring an air freshener. As others have mentioned the beds are hard but you can request a mattress topper to help. The rooms are large and the showerhead is a rain type along with the standard wall mount. There is also a jetted tub. Many people have commented on the beach and there is a lot of seaweed that comes ashore each morning but the grounds crew does a good job cleaning it up. I think the red flags are up each day but I did n\u2019t think it was warranted. If you are used to swimming in the Atlantic Ocean you will be fine. I really enjoyed the waves. You can walk off the property and find other areas where it \u2019s not as rough. The beach does n\u2019t get too crowded as most people hang out at the pool. We typically went to the beach in the morning then spent the afternoon at one of the pools. Food. This is where you will find the biggest difference between a cruise and other American hotels. I thought it was hit or miss. Some was really good and others not so much. But there is so much to choose from you can just go to another restaurant or get take out Pad Thai as I did twice. Once because I did n\u2019t enjoy my dinner and the second time because it \u2019s so good as a snack during the shows. We ate breakfast at the buffet each day and there are things you \u2019l recognize and things you can try that you probably have n\u2019t seen before. Lunch was usually at the Beach restaurant and I \u2019d highly recommend this. They had something different each day along with pizza. One day we ate at the Grill and they had a larger menu and it was very good. For dinner our favorite was Spice and our least favorite was Toscana I would n\u2019t go back. We also ate at Barcelona Agave and Chez Isabele and they were all very good. We also ate on or near the beach twice. The first one was a Dominican Republic themed dinner on the beach and it was very good. The second themed dinner was Arabian nights and it was ok you need to like Indian cuisine which I do n\u2019t. That \u2019s where take out Pad Thai from Spice comes into play. We did n\u2019t encounter any bug issues on the beach as others have mentioned or as we previously encountered on our first visit. We brought bug spray just in case. Alcohol \u2013. Presidente beer is the only one available except in the sports bar where they have 11 others to choose from. You can request drinks made with specific brands but if you do n\u2019t they will make it with their house brands. They have Bombay Crown Royal etc. for no extra charge. My wife loved the Iceberg. Its \u00be Presidente beer and \u00bc Frozen Margarita on top. Shows \u2013 sit all the way in the back for a great breeze off the ocean. You wo n\u2019t be able to see as well but in my opinion you wo n\u2019t be missing much. I \u2019m not a fan of the shows on a cruise ship and these are n\u2019t even as good as those. Wifi \u2013. It was spotty and lost connection many times. I had booked an excursion online and needed to check the reservation and had trouble finding a reliable connection. I hesitated even mentioning this as you are on vacation and should n\u2019t need to be connected but in this day and age it \u2019s expected to have access if you want it. Excursions \u2013 they have desks on site that sell excursions and people walk around asking if you are interested. We booked our own before we arrived through an outside company that was highly rated. Checkout Hispaniola Aquatic Adventures for a great excursion. Service You can go anywhere for the sun food and alcohol but the thing I enjoy here is the service. You really should spend time talking to the people that work there. They really try to make your vacation special and work long hours doing so. We did n\u2019t run into anyone that was n\u2019t willing to help even if they struggled with English but there were some that made our vacation special. At no point was tipping ever expected and I never noticed any difference in service from those who tipped or did n\u2019t but I know they were appreciated. Every morning we started out at the buffet being greeted by Stephani who \u2019s English is better than some I run into in the states an always had a smile on her face. I started out each morning with an omelet made by Ramon who works three pans at a time making custom omelets. At the bar by the cascade pool we were taken care of by Pedro and Jose who did a great job making drinks and I enjoyed talking with them each day. Order a Samy Sosa at least once and if you run into Jose in the Grill or at the Cascade Pool ask for a Jose Especial. While we were away enjoying the sun Maria Isabella would make up our room and leave towels folded into animals on our bed. This was a nice touch that I \u2019m not sure everyone got. And at the end of the day while watching the shows Sonia would bring us drinks. She had a great personality and was a lot of fun. These are the people that made our vacation special. Spend some time getting to know them and you \u2019l have your own list of people that made it memorable.", "offset": [1409, 1571], "date": "2015-07-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "684fd6e4-9598-4365-939e-8508eaa3cd09", "sentence": "Excellence Punta Cana. Not what we expected. Travelled May 1 8 2015 with my sister. This was my first trip to The Dominican Republic but not hers. We chose Excellence Punta Cana as had an awesome experience at the Excellence Riviera Cancun in 2012. Sadly by comparison we were greatly disappointed. We upgraded to Excellence Club as we did in Mexico but upgrading in Punta Cana really was not worth the extra and I felt ripped off. The Excellence Club lounge was FAR superior in Mexico. There are no computers for use in Punta Cana they had only iPads. When trying to bring our e boarding passes to leave we were unable to print from the iPads they provided. We had to inconvenience the employee in the lounge to use their computer. There is NO pool pool bar dedicated for Excellence Club members in Punta Cana. They say there is an area on the beach that is exclusive for Excellence Club members but we were only asked our room number name once and it was our last day at the beach. Not once were we asked before leading us to believe that anyone could just go to this section not just Excellence Club members. Also there are floating loungers available for use at the pools. Albeit there are not enough for the number of guests. There are also 2 types of floaters one being a thicker more comfortable premium floater but there were very few of these ones. As a paying Excellence Club member I would expect that there would be enough. On our final day at the pool my sister searched for a premium lounger and found one not in use. About 45 mins later an Entertainment Crew employee came and told my sister he needed to take that premium lounger for a game in the activities pool. She was laying on it at the time. He guilted us into giving it up. We were dumbfounded. So much for being Excellence Club members. The resort should invest in more loungers if they do not have enough to run the games without disturbing the guests who are using them. Also as Excellence Club members in Mexico we could order snacks polside or beachside from a menu. They only snacks that were provided polside or beachside in Punta Cana was pizza. the same each day same for all guests. Good was great at all the restaurants and we like the idea of not having to book in advance. Rarely was there a line up. Our favourite was the Asian cuisine. Rooms were ok nothing special. Clean. Rooms were much better in Mexico more updated. I do not think there was any difference in the Excellence Club rooms vs regular rooms in Punta Cana. So again not worth the. Stay away from the jewelry store. they will con you into thinking its Sterling Silver but infact its shiny Steel. I got duped. Spent over 500 for a mens ring 2 bracelets and necklace cross only to find out from the jeweller at home that it is steel. Buyer beware. Maybe our expectations were too high but we were hoping for an Excellent resort like we experienced at The Excellence Riviera Cancun. but in hindsight we wished we had revisited the Excellence in Cancun. If you do decide to come here I would NOT recommend paying for the Excellence Club upgrades not worth it.", "offset": [1112, 1176], "date": "2015-07-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "72b767f3-109f-4949-8e5c-504c1ae62ed9", "sentence": "Beachfront resort with private beach. Excellence resort was slightly disappointing. We had a very long check in process 2 hours from the time we arrived until we were allowed to go to our Excellence Club Junior Suite with Swim up Ocean View. Our room was okay there is a jetted tub that is in the middle of the room. Also the restroom and shower are enclosed together and the shower has a glass window into the bedroom so there is no privacy which also makes it difficult in the middle of the night because turning on a light would certainly disrupt your partner. The other major disappointment was that our room was not truly an ocean view you could only see a sliver and swim up. meant leaving your sliding doors walking across your deck down 5 stairs and across 5 feet of tile to reach the pool. To us upgrading to Excellence club was worth it. My partner enjoyed the upgraded liquor in the room. We also appreciated the excellence club we frequently swung through to grab a drink or a bite to eat it also included a free hydrotherapy session in the spa for each of us. You could also borrow movies without cost. The best part was the private area of the beach waiters would come around to serve drinks. The pool loungers were more comfortable. There were also day beds some of which were shaded. Excellence club level. The variety of the restaurants was nice the quality was mostly fair but we did not get sick. The beach privacy. The spa is lovely. There is horseback riding. Excursion prices are negotiable if you have cash. The quality of the food. The excursions we had a bad experience with a snorkeling trip.

We had a great time at the resort. Very tropical feeling loved the beach and used the beds at the pool beach. Food was good. we enjoyed the pizza place for dinner and went to the buffet for breakfast and lunch lots of options. Downfall for us was that there was not really much music playing at the pool except for during water aerobics so it was more quiet than we would have liked. Some people might like that but we wish we would have brought our own speaker. They do have rafts for the pool which we used and loved. Rooms are spacias. we did the basic and were happy with it. We were on the ground floor so we had our own hammock which was awesome. We did the excellence club which was pretty nice. We had liquor in our room that we could switch out for different fifths so we switched black label for baileys more our style. We also liked the private club room because they always had food there and drinks. Room service was good.

This is a return visit for us. First visit was in 2014 and we looked it see my previous review. Then on a cruise in early 2015 a port of call was St Martin we fell in love with the island and returned every year until Hurricane Irma destroyed a lot of the place. They will rebuild however in the meantime we still needed to get the heck out of the cold weather here in the northeast. It was great. We celebrated our 23rd anniversary and my wives 29th birthday again. Management and staff did everything possible to ensure we had a great time. From an Anniversary Banner across our room door champagne in the room flowers balloons etc. And if you have ever been the entire resort is impeccably cleanI have read some negative reviews. How can you be negative when your in the sun and not shoveling snow. I have read the pool water is cold closer then your pool water in the Northeast. the ocean is rough did i d have ice chunks in it the rooms are damp you in the tropics etc. Whatever.

Got back from a 10 day stay at the Excellence Punta Cana last week. We stayed at this resort last year and loved it especially the excellence level of rooms and the fantastic Excellence Club Lounge. We knew the resort was having a major renovation done last fall and could not wait to return. could not get the Ocean View Jr Suite on the excellence side of the resort that we were in last year so we upgraded to the Honeymoon Suite. At arrival we were taken to the total opposite side of the resort that the Excellence rooms were in last year. We were shocked when brought to the new excellence club for check in very cold atmosphere cheap finishings very uncomfortable furniture basic bar. Unlike the previous version this is not a place that you would want to spend any time in. When taken up to our honeymoon suite we were incredibly disappointed. Firstly the area behind our bed where the jacuzi tub is located was in the process of being flooded. Water dripping from the ceiling and from the bottom of one of the walls. There were towels on the floor to keep the water from entering our sleeping area. Told that it was the guests above who left the taps running in their tub. totally untrue. Told us to come back in an hour. Had lunch and returned to the excellence club to be told by the staff that our room was good to go. Went up to the room with a staff member only to find that the water had now circled our bed same totally soaked towels on the floor and water still running inside the wall. Nothing had been done. what is even more shocking is that they wanted us to stay in this room. Unbelievable. Insisted on a new honeymoon suite and moved in. do not WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A HONEYMOON SUITE. Apparently the resort was trying for a more modern look with this recent renovation. What they ended up with was a cheap cold uninviting look coupled with a space that ended up being totally dysfunctional. Everywhere you look you see brown melamine covering the walls. The walls that are not covered with this cheap fake wood are bare and white. Not a picture to be found anywhere. There are no dressers or drawers to put your clothes in just one small walk in closet with 3 shelves. The furniture is shameful for a suite costing as much as it did. One very uncomfortable wood rocking chair one very uncomfortable retro looking couch and a plastic chair behind the incredibly cheap looking melamine desk. After one night in this new suite we had to go back to the excellence club and ask them why our room smelled like rotting hay very strong pungent offensive smell coming from the A C unit. Kept me up all night. Apparently they are having a problem with the HVAC unit and many of the rooms smell like this or are very humid. None as bad or as strong as our suite however. We asked them if they could get us a diffuser like they use in the spa. no problem. We returned to find two very little ceramic tea light units that hold a small amount of very flammable eucalyptus oil. They also left us several packs of matches which were unusable due to the humidity. We were left a very small amount of oil in the bottom of a water bottle that did not last the night. I guess we were expected to get up every two hours or so to refill the oil and replace the tea lights. Really Excellence. We had to request more oil the next day. We also had to purchase a lighter as the matches will not work here. The story gets better with a dehumidifier being brought in that blew all the power in our unit leaked water all over the floor would not shut off when full and eventually burned itself out. After 2 3 days of complaining and trying to downsize reimburse us the difference with no success we gave up and tried to make the best of our smelly uninviting room. We actually dreaded going back to our Honeymoon Suite pretty sad. Excellence gave us a free couples massage to make up for the ordeal. Nice but not appropriate for the hell we went through from the very start. Beware of the mosquitos. It seems that half of us have an allergy to their bite this year and I was one of them. Never in all the years that I have been to the Caribbean have i ever been bitten so bad and had such a strong reaction. Take repelentWe are really torn because we love this resort. Great location good gym and tennis courts beautiful setting. The food is very good and the specialty restaurants have stepped up their game since last year. Your can not complain about the food here. The staff in the buffet and restaurants are fantastic. If you are thinking about staying in the excellence suites with a plunge pool beware. The resort has added a new excellence pool and rooms on the ground floor with plunge pools. You are on public display with these rooms and have absolutely no privacy. No one was ever in their own plunge pool. One of the very nice ladies in the buffet area brought over an Assistant Guest Service Manager to see my bites they were that bad and itchy her name was Diosmery. The next day Diosmery she is not from the excellence side but from the main reception tracked us down and arranged to take me to see the resort doctor no charge. I was given some cream to help with the swelling and itching again no charge. We told Diosmery about our first 3 days at the Excellence side of the resort and she was mortified. She quickly came to our room in 2 minutes had several people come in with sprays set up the dehumidifier properly with eucalyptus oil in the unit did a number of other things to try and rid the room of the smell. Moral of the story. if you have a problem while staying at the excellence side of the resort go to the front desk and ask for either Diosmery or the Guest Service Manager Yeifrid Ogando who was also very helpful. Unfortunately by the time we got our room sorted out we were nearing the end of our stay. The last night we received a message from the manager of the excellence side asking us if there was anything he could do for us as far as changing rooms etc. Really. The last night of a ten day stayOveral we are really disappointed with what they tried to do with the excellence side of the resort the closing of the one thing that brought us back. the fantastic excellence lounge and the manner in which the excellence management dealt with our ordeal. Who ever approved the design materials and overall plan of the recent renovation does not understand anything about comfort atmosphere and functionality. it is a real shame as it will be the really hard working and friendly staff that try so hard to please at this resort that will eventually pay the price. I am sure our stay would have been much more enjoyable if in the Jr Ocean View Suite next door.", "offset": [880, 980], "date": "2018-04-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "35e1869d-1115-42d2-bd77-8f9504ea7457", "sentence": "On the short list of great resorts in DR. We are Dominicans by birth so we travel a lot to DR to visit family and on many trips we will spend part of it in a resort so we have been to many resorts in DR and this one is exceptional and we would gladly go back. We paid USD370 a night in early March. I think this is important in a review because at that price we felt it was amazing value. Hotel is also not at capacity at that time of the year which also makes it a better experience and the staff is more relaxed. Easily 90 of the staff looked genuinely happy and it showed in their work. They told us that the owners kept them on the payroll and paid them the entire time the hotel was being remodeled even though they were not working because they respect the staff and have spent a lot of time and money training them. This is especially good to hear because the owners are Spaniards I heard and Spaniards are usually abusive to Dominican staff. not these owners they are doing an amazing job. We got the mountain view room with the club upgrade. There is no actual mountain and there was construction going in the back no noise. This was fine by us we did not feel it was worth the price for ocean view. The Club upgrade is 100 worth it as it allows you to access areas pools dining not available to those who did not upgrade. We have stayed in an Excellence resort in Mexico and this one was much better. in part because the staff was a lot friendlier and more attentive. The bathroom products were Bulgari. Quality soaps and shampoos are great when you are cooking under the sun sand salt water. They close the casino they had there which always sucks in resorts and opened up an amazing Starbucks clone only they serve Cafe Santo Domingo the amazing local coffee. So you can have yourself a caramel machiato with some great deserts whenever you want included in the room. We thought this was a brilliant idea. They have nespreso pods in the room. would have been better if they served the Cafe Santo Domingo pods. Probably cheaper for them than Nespreso because it is local but the product is superior. The rooms have a full bar. There are hundreds of dollars of premium alcohols in sealed bottle and mixers which is a huge value added. I am sure some people just drink at the resort and just throw the bottles in the suitcase on the way home. The food is top notch for a resort. It obviously can not be as good as heading to your favorite fine dining place but they really do a great job and the quality of the ingredients they get in DR is far superior to anywhere else in the Caribbean. If you do not want to go to any of the restaurants or buffet you can order room service. The room had an ingenious closet with two doors. They could drop off your room service and knock and then you go get your food without having to interact with the staff. If you are half drunk sleepy and half naked this is a huge bonus. Another bonus is a clothes steamer in the room if you want to dress up at night and get those linen pants presentable after being smushed in a suitcase. The entertainment and shows staff were pretty amazing. Usually those resort shows are so cheesy it is cringey but these were very talented performers and very well designed shows for the budget. There was a Michael Jackson night a knock off Cirque du Soleil etc. As for the beach itself Uvero Alto is know for having a lot of waves and the small strip in front of the hotel was like that. This is the main reason why prices are cheaper than some other resorts in DR even though the overall experience is better. Most guests were not bathing in the ocean because the waves but if you looked down the beach maybe 300 feet there are reefs that block the waves and you can swim in relatively calm waters. At that point it is technically not the hotels property anymore but you close enough to the hotel that you can throw a rock and hit it. My only warning would be to avoid the free water massage which is just something they use so that they can try to sell you spa services. the only rip off here. They could actually charge a fraction of what they charge and they would sell a LOT more people would use it and be happy. To conclude if this hotel was a on a calmer beach you would be paying US 60 1000 night during high season.", "offset": [3588, 3776], "date": "2018-06-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "071527e1-5ed0-49c3-98dc-5804ad69aec9", "sentence": "Great Relaxing Holiday.

We ate at all the restaurants except Magna they varied from very good to excellent. Our favorites were Chez Isabella Soloman was a great server Spice we did not eat in the hibachi section as it required a reservation and The Grill. My filets ribeye steaks were perfectly prepared quite tender at Chez and Grill \u2013 other cuts are notably tougher according to other guests. Breakfast lunch buffets were great at the Kitchen with a huge selection \u2013 Jose Antonio was friendly prepared great omelets. Flavor Market serves Spanish tapas \u2013 very tasty \u2013 this is a new restaurant since our last visit replaced the Dominican one. Dominican Night dinner buffet entertainment was also very good. Our only disappointment was the Lobster House \u2013 one of us had a lobster dinner which consisted of only a \u00bd tail which was overcooked an tough and I had turf surf which added an overdone tough flank steak to the \u00bd tail. During previous visits this restaurant was one of our favorites with seafood nicely prepared and even extra tails available sometimes. Hopefully this will improve. BEACH POOL \u2013. Red flags were up all week as it was quite windy at times with large waves. The beach is beautiful and well maintained with a lot of 2person palapas. Since our last visit they \u2019ve added a boardwalk along the beach as well as many new larger palapas along the boardwalk around the pool. There are also cabanas pool side.

There is a beautiful \u201c Eco garden \u201d with paved walkways where one can stroll and enjoy the varied flora and fauna. ROOMS \u2013. Prior to our arrival I emailed room preferences to the concierge. Requests are honored as much as possible depending on availability. Furthermore rooms are assigned the night prior to arrival not at check in so even though we did n\u2019t arrive until early evening we got excellent rooms. We had requested Bldg. 10 11 or 14 which are in a more quiet area at the northwest end of the property. A bar is there plus they are very near the beach. We had opted for 1st floor pool side \u201c swim up \u201d rooms as we had done on a previous visit. We were in Bldg. 14 and were pleasantly surprised that all the swim up rooms in Bldgs. 11 14 had a bonus \u2013 our own private cabana just outside our door \u2013 a few feet from the pool. No other pool side buildings had these. We had a great view of the ocean and the pool. The rooms have been nicely upgraded since our last visit. Bldg. 14 is the farthest from the restaurants but no more than a 4 5 min walk. STAFF \u2013. The staff is VERY friendly and cordial. Even the support staff eg maintenance ground keepers greeted us with \u201c Hola \u201d when we passed them. They really put in an effort to make one \u2019s stay very enjoyable.

The room and balconies were clean and spacious and the views were breathtaking. Each staff member that we came in contact with were friendly and helpful. We spent most of our days by the main pool. The entertainment staff were the best of any resort that we have been to. Jose went above and beyond to make our days extra fun and special. He was so much fun to be around and took time each day to talk to us and all of the guests. We loved all of the pool games. Nicki Minaj was so much fun and always made sure we were included. Shaky shaky CocaCola Junior and the rest always kept us entertained and smiling. Pedro at the swim up bar Andreas Richardyumy yummy guy Luchi and the night time bartender at the circle barcanot remember his name along with many others kept our glasses full with delicious drinks all day and night. The nightly shows were fantastic. Each restaurant was delicious. It was hard to pick a favorite. We were so impressed with the hard work by the guys on the beach keeping everything looking wonderful. We loved our stay and there is no doubt that we will be back. Thank you so much for a wonderful week of much needed relaxation and fun.", "offset": [225, 336], "date": "2019-05-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "223be054-25df-4354-8d4e-c33eaddee67e", "sentence": "Excellent Holiday. We stayed here for one week during June 2019. The resort is adults only located aproximatly 40 minutes drive away from the main International Airport of PUJ. Airport procedures on arrival are not too onerous and exit from PUJ took us about 25 minutes including collection of luggage from carousel. Resort is immaculately clean throughout and kept that way. We were booked into the Excellence Club area and we believed that it is worth the extra 70 P day. We had a Garden view room in block two each block is two floors and serviced with a lift. Minibar in room is stocked each day and all with premium brand drinks and snacks there is also 24 room service and order what you want whenever you want to your room. Rooms are fairly large and very clean modern with balcony or private garden balcony area. Ground floor rooms mostly had own plunge pools as well to each. Grounds are very nice and well worth looking walking around. The beach is lovely there is no seaweed and kept clean each day. it is pristine. Sea has gradual gradient from beach but is quite wavey all day. On resort facilities shops Spa etc all quite expensive and comparable to airport prices. In fact the included massage for booking the Excellence Club was the only disappointment throughout the whole week for us. This was primarily due to the staff employed within the Spa itself as everything was rushed and the massage was very average. That aside the resort itself is great. 11 on site Restaurants and evening entertainment each night good standard Ice cream Parlour premium Ice cream Yummy. Food is awesome wherever you eat and good standard with huge choice to cater for everyone. In the Excellence Club booking you get access to private exclusive area of beach with premium loungers and service including food drink brought to you if you want on the beach. all day. Several different pools around resort with several jacuzies. Lots of sports if you want including full size tennis court mini golf basic table tennis dart shooting pool and a couple of others. Must wear shirt and trousers in most Restaurants in evenings only for dinner. All Staff were very friendly and could not do enough for you. A special thanks to Juan Carlos and Roberto on the club beach who always came and asked if we needed anything and ensured only Club members used the allocated beach area. Elbin provided us with lots of ice cream in Aroma and Rosana in Kitchen Table always ensured we had a ready supply of Coke at lunchtime. The management of this resort are really on the ball and will address any guest concerns immediately. Well done to both managers Manuela and Gagandep. A special thanks to Gagandep for looking after us and making a holiday very special. We travel a great deal around the world and this is probably one of the best run resorts that we have had the pleasure to stay at. We will be returning. Resort is very safe and secure. There is plenty of bottled water therefore it is advisable to steer clear of the tap water. Possibly concentrate on improving the Spa area otherwise stay as it is as the service is exceptional. Thank you to everyone at the resort who made our holiday so wonderful.", "offset": [1862, 1922], "date": "2019-06-15", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "41cc82e8-18bc-4a11-9fe0-78d8a970fdff", "sentence": "Very nice place.

Where do I start. This resort is beautiful amazing and fantastic. We checked in and opted to pay for a upgraded room with no regrets at all. Our room and pool were fantastic and with a quick step we were on the beach. Our housekeeper Nieves sp was the sweetest person I have ever came across. She was such a hard worker and always with a smile. She is a gem to this resort. Our room was spotless and we always had what we needed. The food WOW. We never had any complaints and we never got sick absolutely enjoyed everything we ate. The service was perfect. The entertainment staff they were the icing on the cake. Yellow Boy Evan Junior and JC spoiled us like no other. Always had time for us and made us laugh. The bar service was top notch Ines EC service Felix and Luby bar outside David sports bar and every one at the Martini Bar could never do us wrong. I am sorry I missed most of the names of the servers for the Excellence club beach and pool they always had a drink and a laugh for us. The beach was beautiful very well kept and so were the grounds. They were working all the time to keep everything spotless. Swam in the ocean it was fantastic. We came to celebrate my 50th Birthday and this resort took some extra steps to help me. We went to the disco just as I was turning 50 and they played 2 Birthday songs for me it was the best way to turn 50 and I will never forget it. They also decorated my room and sent a Happy Birthday cake. We were there when the scare of the Hurricane was coming they calmed our fears being from the middle of the USA Hurricanes are not anything we worry about and they kept us up to date on everything. We noticed them filling up sand bags and putting some furniture away but other than that it was normal day to day activities. Thank goodness it missed us praying for the Bahamas. We enjoyed the shows as well. The Michael Jackson show is one that should not be missed. If you are looking for an amazing trip you must go to Excellence Punta Cana you will not be disappointed. We are planning a return trip next year let the countdown begin.", "offset": [878, 1013], "date": "2019-09-11", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "4103ad3b-f43b-45ad-8e0c-394aae01c2e5", "sentence": "Phenomenal resort and value for money. We were a bit worried coming in October but found the place spotless the beach pretty much seaweed free and what little there was got picked up early in the morning. The staff is all great we did not have a single bad experience. The resort is very nice because while out is sizable there is more than enough beach and pool area for everyone and you are never know than a minutes walk from the beach which is 30 seconds away from the pool. I was disappointed in the use of plastic through the resort straws plastic bags for the daily newsletter etc. I think this would be easy to improve and leave a better impression for younger travelers.", "offset": [269, 478], "date": "2019-10-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "36d2549d-3511-4166-acc1-6e4a7c0438a8", "sentence": "very clean and extremely friendly staff plenty of lounge chairs at pools and on the beach. great variety of restaurant and food.", "offset": [0, 90], "date": "2019-11-26", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "618f65a6-d586-418b-b0f5-82ab0c730f1b", "sentence": "Nothing short of excellence.
