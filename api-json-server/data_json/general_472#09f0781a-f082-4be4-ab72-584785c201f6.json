I stayed in this hotel for a three day rr trip. It was definitely everything I expected and more. It is in a beautiful location across the street from a stunning beach. Check in. We arrived a bit earlier than the early check in time and were not expecting our room to be ready but we were very happy when the staff member checking us in let us know that the room was ready and waiting. She was so friendly and we received such outstanding customer service from her. The person checking us in gave us a map and took the time to explain to us where everything was located which was great. Room. We had a suite booked and WOW was it ever gorgeous. It was oceanfront and beyond spectacular. It was very spacious and had two balconies. We took advantage of both balconies as one side had very large lounge chairs. The room was very clean and had the delightful bliss toiletries. Our room had a very large shower as well. Pool We only used the main pool and had a great time. The staff helped us find chairs and an umbrella so that we did not have to waste any of our time looking around. there is a bar and also waiters coming around to take your order. We opted to walk to the bar and try the mojitos. They were made very well and were definitely worth it. The pool is a good size and the water was cool and refreshing. Cafe. We went to the cafe one morning for breakfast and it was very good. I like the grab and go concept that it has as you can be on your way in a fraction of the time instead of waiting around. Hotel. The hotel is absolutely immaculate. You can definitely tell that the staff work hard to keep the hotel in such great shape. Overall I LOVED my stay at the W Fort Lauderdale. It is a stunning hotel and it is great for both rr and someone looking to be part of the action in Fort Lauderdale as it is close to the main strip of bars restaurants.

Hands down the worst hotel experience I have ever had. My husband and I stayed at the W Fort Lauderdale from Dec 12 14 prior to departing on a cruise. When we arrived we were told the king room reserved was not available and that there was a room with 2 queens instead. As this is not a huge deal to us we happily agreed to take the room being offered which had a very nice view of the water. We dropped our bags and headed to the beach strip to check out the area. When we returned we found that we had no TV remote and were unable to call the front desk as our in room phone did not work. Around 10 pm I went down to the front desk to advise them of this and they said someone would be right up to take a look no one ever came. The next morning I went back to the desk to let them know of the situation the night before and how no one came. They were of course apologetic and ensured someone was sent up shortly after. The service staff brought us a remote and looked into the phone. It turned out to be an issue with the entire unit so for about an hour we had service staff coming in and out of the room to rectify the issue. We left for the afternoon and when we came back the remote we were just given stopped working. Now that we had a phone I called down to request another one be brought up and the concierge asked me aside from this incident how our stay had been overall. I informed him how frustrating our experience had been so far and he offered me a 50 credit to my SPG rewards account to make things right. I mentioned that this was not really of use to me as I am not an SPG member and would be checking out early the next morning. He said this was the maximum authority he had and would call me back shortly as needed to check with his manager to see what else they could offer me for all the inconvenience. Can you guess what happens next. They never called back. When we checked out there was no mention of the inconvenience or apology you think there would be some sort of note on the file so that all staff is informed of what is going on with their guests but this does not surprise me at all. We really are not picky people but considering how outrageous the price is to stay here it was quite irritating that there was absolutely nothing that seemed to make what we paid worth it.

My wife and I travelled down to Fort Lauderdale for our anniversary. The W makes most of the top lists for best beach hotels to stay at down in FL. I had called a day in advance after reading the renovation construction information on the W website. The receptionist mentioned that there are no disruptions to any of the amenities. When we arrived and upon check in the receptionist Caesar indicated that the main pool was closed the spa was moved into a hotel suite as a make shift version and the W Caf\u00e9 was also moved to be in the bar area of the restaurant. The next Saturday morning we called down to ask what time the W caf\u00e9 was open until the response we got was noon time. We went downstairs to the restaurant only to be told by the hostess that the caf\u00e9 closed at 10 am and she \u2019s not sure who gave us that information because it was wrong. So we ate in the restaurant and ordered coffee at 5 per cup. When we returned to our room there was a placard on the desk that said very clearly \u201c. W Caf\u00e9 hours till noon on Sat Sun and complimentary coffee provided \u201d. I went down and showed it to the hostess and for her to aggressively question where I got that from. She was completely unapologeticaly and casually said it probably refers to pre renovation timing. I replied that whatever the case may be how are we supposed to know when given different answers from everyone. At the very least they could have credited me for the coffee when it should have been complimentary. She rolled her eyes and begrudgingly went to get her manager. This was a very pleasant individual with glasses and a goatee and he realized the mistake and was very sorry and rectified it. The next day Sunday we had reservations at the spa for a couples massage at 130am. We arrived and the receptionist Nicola Australian accent was not in the least bit welcoming. She could not even be bothered to smile or say hello. I knew there was a table of water and refreshments from when I stopped up the day before to make a reservation. Nicola not only ignored us but we had to awkwardly ask if it was ok to have a glass of water. She then rushed us into the suite and stated that we have use of the entire suite and private bathroom. The massage commenced and several times the audio equipment went off requiring the therapist to pause the massage and leave for several minutes to fiddle with the speaker or ipod connection. After that point it was evident the therapist was rushing through the massage because she lost so much time trying to fix the ipod speaker. After the massage finished my wife wondered if she could take a quick shower in the private bathroom. Before even getting the chance to disrobe there was a loud knock less than 5min after massage finished. It was Nicola and my wife asked her if she could take a shower. Nicola replied that they \u201c do not offer shower services and we have to hurry because there are others waiting \u201d. I \u2019m not certain what shower services are but this seemed to contradict her earlier statement that we have the entire suite and bathroom to use. After that we had to rush to get our clothes on as Nicola was standing right outside the door. When I went to speak with her there was no smile or question as to how we liked everything. She just rang us up and said she included 20 gratuity. I asked her to hang on and expressed my disappointment at the service and especially her refusal to let my wife use the facilities that we were paying for. Nicola literally rolled her eyes at me and said the showers are not for us. Not until later she asked if we are guests of the hotel and then she proceeded to say \u201c there you go you can use the shower in your room \u201d. I responded by telling her she did not know we were guests when she said no and rushed us out of there. It is safe to say that this was the opposite of a calm and relaxing experience. In fact it is one of the worst spa experiences we have ever had. We were incredibly offended by her treatment which was wholly undeserved. I \u2019m not sure any guest or honestly anyone really deserves to be treated like that. This is the last time we will ever use a Bliss spa. On Monday we checked out of the hotel. At the reception desk they printed my folio and I asked to check it over. I identified an error in the room rate it was much higher than my confirmation and what Caesar had quoted when we checked in. I asked the receptions young woman from Israel to look into it. She quickly dismissed and said I would have to call customer service. Finally she left to speak to her manager and came back and said it was a \u201c computer error \u201d. She was unapologetic and through her facial expressions and body language seemed upset that I had brought this up. She barely spoke to us after that and just continued typing and printed an updated folio and just handed to us. There was no \u201c sorry about that \u201d or \u201c thanks for staying with us \u201d. I simply do n\u2019t understand why I am made to be the bad guy or to feel embarrassed for pointing out an over charge. We checked the folio grabbed our bags and walked away without turning back. Perhaps the wounds are still fresh but that is the sentiment we carried out.

Arrived to the W Hotel for my brother in laws 40th. Thinking the W was a reputable brand we were looking forward to a pleasant weekend. I had emailed the concierge on 9th March to enquire about cribs for one of the rooms I did not receive a reply but thought nothing of it. That was obviously a sign of the complete lack of customer service that we are now experiencing. On checkin the receptionist was miserable rude and chewing gum. Completely unhelpful. The receptionists do not wear name badges obviously so they can not be held accountable for their shoddy service. The one we had the pleasure of being served by was an older Hispanic lady with glasses. We asked if any upgrades were available and we were happy to pay she said the hotel was full. Funny how when we asked 15 minutes later with another receptionist we were able to upgrade with a choice of rooms on different floors. The first receptionist should find a job in a different industry her attitude does not suit hospitality. One of our original rooms did not have a balcony the other had a tiny one but was filthy. Also the balconies do not have a light so at night you either sit in the dark or use your phone torch. On our second day after breakfast we returned to our room to find the key card did not work. We went to reception which is a ridiculous trek using three separate lifts. Were given a new set of keys without even giving our ID just needed to tell them our room number. Very secure. Went all the way back and they still did not work. Security came eventually and we were told the room had been locked because of a problem with my payment card. How we are supposed to know this if no one has called us or even left a note. We went back to the reception and sorted the issue and were given not a single word of apology by our third miserable as sin receptionist. Absolutely disgusting that this would be done to a guest obviously a sign of the hotels usual low standard clientele. Back to the room the keys still did not work. Three calls down to reception to chase security and 20 minutes waiting we finally got back into our room. At least the security guard apologised. Shame the front desk are not as bothered.

My review is to be read in light of numerous experiences made at this hotel in the years 207 209First when you book a W you expect a pretty unique experience in terms of service and accommodation. That W uniqueness is why one goes there especially having stayed many times and having had this property in mind as the greatest at FL beach from earlier years. Meanwhile ver regrettably this hotel has lost on all aspects and I can not see any of that W uniqueness anymore especially comparing it with the Ws in. eg Singapore Bangkok or Mexico City to name only a few. Pre arrival we got an email after our cancellation deadline expired informing us of works being done. A lovely and thoughtful act whilst obviously there is little one can do at that late point in time. Started to raise some very minor suspicion already then. Arrival chaotic. Due to the works being done and the blocked drive way they reserved two parking spaces for Valet parking. Made very uncomfortable experience at that point with another guest shouting at the Valet staff as he was not able to pull his vehicle in the space. Check in Efficient. Had a handful of questions regarding an upgrade and when trying to get to the bottom of the story it all became slightly annoying. We only later noticed that the rate for the Suite we were told at USD 300 per night. was the full rate whilst at our rate of USD 180 we would have only needed to pay an additional USD 120 per night which we would have done without hesitation. As mentioned when trying to find this all out the clerk became inpatient and said to us is there anything else I can do for our before serving the next customer. obviously ones very own choice whilst I leave it up to the reader of this review to interpret the degree of arrogance this sentence implied. Upgrade policy As SPG platinum you get as per program rules the best room available excl. Suites. In the past that always worked well. Not now anymore. Upon asking see story above we were told that the Tower 2 with the suites is now a Residential tower and they can not do upgrades anymore since they are to generate revenue for the owners. I do not want to elaborate on how much revenue is being generated when the suites are vacant but I guess that again is a profoundly thought through decision on how premium guests shal be treated. To my little surprise we then also saw throughout the 3 nights stay that most of the suites were indeed not occupied. The nice part of the story is that the gentleman checking in besides us got his Suite upgrade being SPG platinum. Raises question especially that we stayed there many times before which was apparently not on their records anymoreBreakfast as part of the status SPG gives you free continental breakfast. That is what the terms of the program says and what is also printed on the breakfast vouchers that are standard all over the world. Not here. Here you get a USD 25 discount for a party of two which will buy you just about nothing. There is no buffet breakfast. either a full service one in their restaurant or a grab n go option. The latter without choosing many items costs way above USD 25 for two. No further comment to this one. Housekeeping inconsistent and making lots of promises without following up. They also claim they do turndown. We made the experience that this only happens if you call and insist. Then a highly unmotivated lady shows up slamming doors and making lots of noise so that by any means we do realize beyond doubt that our request does not make her happy. Also fridge of minibar did not work so we had one brought up to our room. Getting settled in the room also takes time we arrived on a booking made for two there was only one bathrobe only decaf nespreso capsules internet did not work so we had to get a code and so on and so forth. Wet pool deck. East towards the ocean. a messy and dirty childrens playground. We found lettuce leaves french fries and other dirt some of it can hurt your feet when walking without flip flops on the sun chairs and the floor. The deck is in a very questionable state and cleaning seems not to be anyones duty. West quiet as it always was slightly cleaner but in the same maintenance state. Building at large dirty on the in and the outside. The carpet in the hallways is dirty and stays dirty. Did not see nor hear a vacuum during the 3 days little surprise the dirt did not go anywhere on its own. Balconies especially the sliding doors and dusty and so is the balcony floor. Feet are dark after having walked on it. Check out quick and efficient. Clerk did not bother to ask how the stay was. Is that simply not on the agenda anymore or part of the protocol or are they simply trying to evade the discussion and feedback conversation. I do not know either one is not W like at all. In all fairness one has to acknowledge that for a rate of USD 180 per night one could well argue that having such high expectations would be inappropriate. When booking I did assume that this is the low season rate during rainy season hence I did not even think of this lower rate compared to. USD 300 at the time being apparently the natural consequence of a severe and significant downgrade of this hotel at large. Very disappointed indeed. Will not go back ever not that a Four Seasons opens next door which will likely become a valid alternative option. Very sad on the other side as we have this W in such great memory.

After Hurricane Irma my husband and I decided to get a room at the W Fort Lauderdale Hotel to conclude my birthday weekend. Therefore we booked the Fantastic suite for one night and the Mega suite for another because the Oasis was completely sold out.

I am guessing this was contributed to the hurricane. If that not had been the case the view from this particular room and its furnishing would have been top notch. Bryan front desk manager was extremely helpful in his attempts to accommodate us as we brought concerns about the moldy smell.

The lobby is definitely five star as well as the night cap parties. The in room dining Steak 954 was also great. The pool area provided a cool atmosphere although I had to go the residential area to use the jacuzi. Moreover I was charged 100 extra on top of my bill to secure payments of my room.
