I was in town for a convention and the hotel was booked to capacity. The hotel staff was friendly and polite. The layout of the hotel includes ballrooms and hotel guests rooms on the third floor. The ballroom guests and hotel guest rooms utilize the same elevator and the ballroom portion of the third floor is open and overlooks the main entrance foyer and front desk on the floor below. When I returned to the hotel about 10 pm a function in one of the ballrooms was just beginning. I should have suspected a problem when the guests were being screened with a hand held metal detector. The music and noise in the hallways and elevator foyer on the third floor continued until 2 am from guests entering and exiting the ballroom and waiting for the elevator. Finally at 2 am the event ended and the hallway was quiet. Unfortunately the ballroom guests made their way to the front entrance and continued to be very loud on the front sidewalk below my balcony while awaiting their vehicles from the valet parking. This continued until 3 am and included car horns and loud conversation. I also ordered room service when I returned to the hotel at 10 pm and although 2 salads were ordered only one set of silverware was delivered with the food. Checking out the next morning at 7 am the front desk staff was overwhelmed with guests checking out and attending the same conference. There were 2 hotel staff trying to assist a very long line of people trying to check out of their rooms. Their computer systems were running very slowly locking up and they were never able to print a copy of my bill. The front desk staff remained friendly and apologetic. This hotel had a reserved block of rooms in conjunction with the conference I was attending. The hotel valet parking logistics is chaotic. The parking drop off pick up area is not large enough to allow traffic to freely flow around guests cars waiting to check in out or for valet cars that are in cue for their owners. I paid an extra fee for a balcony with a city view. The balcony was very narrow concrete no chairs and if there were chairs the concrete wall was too high to actually sit and see anything but the concrete wall.

Despite not having actually stayed at this hotel I frequently visited for the US Open chess tournament between August 3rd and August 5th. Overall I considered everything to be suitable and fine during my experience. To begin it is 100 worth noting that renovations are in progress so if you see signs explaining this or if areas look under construction that is why. However since I did not ever sleep in a room here I can not comment on how the rejuvenation has affected the rooms. Apparently there are renovated living quarters and NON renovated living quarters so it might be worth a shot to request to be in a renovated room if possible. I am excited to possibly spend the night when construction is completely doneThe service was generally fantabulous. Well sorry I should rephrase and take out the generally. I think the staff did an EXTREMELY professional and awesome job accommodating me and telling me about stuff. This is nearly a fact. The front desk staff was willing with a smile to store my chess bag behind the counter when it was getting too heavy for me to transport around the building. Not only that however a Sheraton shuttle driver was actually able to take me to a restaurant during my dinner break. amazing. I am forever grateful. Obviously everyone was friendly and excellent at customer service. In fact this hotel likely floats around in the top ten hotel customer service experiences I have ever witnessed. With the above said I feel so bad to state the negative. How about I merely warn guests that the Wifi in the lobby only is absolutely terrible. The connection was always interrupted and every four or five minutes I was forced to reconect. When I had a connection sites like Facebok were very very slow. There are two potential reasons for this so many people were using the network or the network itself is just weak and needs to be replaced. I hope it is the formerOveral. though this hotel EXCELS at service it gives its customers. The only thing they might need to improve is the Wifi.

The Sheraton is one of the host hotels for the event and is educated about who we are and what we do.

After a significant wait I was checked in thanked for being a rewards member and told I had a harbor view room. I got to my room which had all the natural light of a cave. My view was of a tree that blocked the entire window which was facing. well I do not know because I literally can not see anything. On initial glance at the room I could see it was not serviced for a new guest. There was 1 decaf coffee packet no sugar setup no shampoo body lotion hand soap. I went to the front desk and asked for the room to be serviced while I went to the opening reception. When I returned I saw a large bag full of about 20 sugar sets 3 decaf coffees and 1 regular coffee. Still no shampoo or conditioner. I turned on the TV and the majority of the channels indicated No Signal. Not the premium Showtime no Bravo etc. The bed sounded and felt like it was going to collapse when I sat on the edge of it. I was afraid to get in it. The next morning I showered but could not wash my hair. Used one towel and a washcloth. I stopped at the desk on the way to the meeting and again asked for coffee shampoo and conditioner. The wet wash cloth from my morning shower was right where I left it. Figuring housekeeping would be notified to be sure the room was properly serviced. When i returned to the room at 530 the coffee set up was done so i hoped the bathroom was as well. Unfortunately I was given a body wash lotion and 2 bars of soap still no shampoo or conditioner. I called and asked to have housekeeping bring it up. I went to dinner at the main conference hotel went to their front desk and asked for shampoo and conditioner and was immediately handed two bottles of each.

I must mention Shelton Daniels. He was professional kind and accommodating to our group. He made it a point of offering local suggestions for food entertainment etc. and constantly checked on us making sure we were okay. I could n\u2019t believe how he even checked on us on his birthday. From contract negotiations to the end of the retreat Shelton was accessible. Sheraton truly has a jewel in that one. When Shelton could not be their he left us in good hands with Rhoda Rul. She was very professional and greeted us with the biggest smile. She made us feel right at home. The staff from the valet reception room service and banquets were excellent.
