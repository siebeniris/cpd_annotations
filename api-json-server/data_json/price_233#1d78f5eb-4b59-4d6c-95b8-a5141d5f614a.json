I have been staying at the Element regularly over the past few months for my business travel. My review is based on the business traveler experience and not necessarily reflective of a tourist experience. That being said here it goes. The Element has some of the nicest staff you will meet. Being a staunch Starwod girl I have spent many nights at the W and dealt with the snootiest of people and the staff at the Element is a breath of fresh air. They are always very kind and willing to help with a smile. If I have encountered any issues they are dealt with immediately. Management should be proud of the group they have there. Now to the important stuff the specifics on the hotel To simplify this here is a list of pros and cons. Pros Wifi gym and breakfast are included. Many hotels charge for these amenities for someone without status so this is a huge perk for which anyone can take advantage Great for extended stay. The kitchenettes in each room are a nice touch even if you do not need them. it is nice to be able to buy a beverage and keep it cold in a fridge without having to risk being charged for trying to maneuver your personal drink within other hotel mini bars Clean hotel gym and rooms. Free happy hour. The snacks vary from day to day but it is nice to be able to grab a free glass of wine or beer and relax at the end of the work day Location the area used to be pretty sketchy but has been cleaned up over the past 2 years with new businesses opening. You are also around the corner from Port Authority subway stop to get around the city as well as other stops just a couple blocks over The rooms are small but that being said this is NYC. NYC is known for its Lilliputian lodging. The pro here is that though the rooms are small they do not feel super cramped. The space is nicely planned with a work area sleep area and plenty of bathroom shelf space a must for any make up toting woman. Frankly I also find the rooms simplicity aesthetically pleasing. Another note is that the 2 bedroom room has more space if a king just feels too small to you Rooftop patio enjoy a view of the city on a nice night if you need to step away from your computer for a few minutes for some fresh city air Starwod property this means you earn points as a member and get to earn bonuses during their various promotionsCons The elevators are lacking BIG TIME. There are 3 for the whole hotel so plan on allowing extra time to get to and from your rom Dogs are allowed. I happen to love dogs but have had issues with someones yiping pet and trying to sleep through that to be fresh for your meeting the next day is not cool. which leads me to. Can be loud. I would say the vast majority that stay here are tourists which means later hours some drunks screaming children etc. This is a risk in any hotel but I have noticed it to be a bit more prominent here probably because of the acoustics of the bamboo floored hallway. I recommend using a sound machine at night to try to block some of that and slamming doors The mini ironing boards. Seriously from hell. There are only 4 full sized ironing boards for the whole hotel and if you do not arrive and claim one on Monday you are out of luck. The minis do not fit clothes there is no room to use them by a plug in many room set ups and the darn things collapse constantly. As a business traveler a proper ironing board is a must and ironing should drive no one to tears ever No room service or mini bar. There is a pantry in the main lobby that works for the mini bar but it is worth mentioning if that is an important thing to you. The lack of room service can be a pain when working long hours but there are a few restaurants within steps from the hotel and ordering via Seamless is always an option. The drawback is that you have to leave your room to take advantage of either option If you plan on having breakfast there get there very early. They can not replenish the food fast enough for all of the large families and groups that stay there. They used to offer a separate room for Gold and Platinum Starwod members that never ran out of food and was away from the riff raf but they ended that recently. Overall I think the value you get with this hotel in a very overpriced city is fantastic and though there are a few cons you can live with some of these and work around them seriously. the ironing board situation MUST change.", "offset": [813, 962], "date": "2016-02-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "748d23fa-a6f8-4b8d-948a-2d9311fed6c0", "sentence": "Wonderful.

We waited nearly 15 minutes for the elevator to come before we decided to take the steps 14 floors down for breakfast. Breakfast was crowded so we got our food to take to our room. The line for the elevators in the lobby was huge. My 6 year old and I climbed back up the 14 flights to avoid the huge wait. I am glad we were not on the 39th floor. We had a similar experience at check out. We had our bags so we had to wait for the elevator. After watching it zip by our floor countless times without stopping we decided to take it up.

I did not expect anything fancy for a hotel in New York because in NYC you pay more but you get less. Surprisingly the room we got in Elements was better than I expected. We paid around 390 for our 2night stay and that includes a few room charges from their pantry. it is pretty affordable for the features of the hotel. The bed was super fluffy and they generously give you 5 long pillows. Their TV has all the channels you had like. They have a cute sofa overlooking the other apartments outside and it is actually a pretty decent view. They have two cordless phones that makes it convenient for anyone to answer calls. The bathroom was very clean and they provide a generous supply of shampoo conditioner and body wash. The lights in the bathroom mirror were gorgeous it made me feel like I am in a studio. The best feature of the room is the kitchen. YES A KITCHEN. The refrigerator was so clean and they even have an induction stove. Safe for children because if they accidentally touch the stove while you are heating something they will not feel anything Elements also provided the rooms with salt and pepper utensils plates bowls glasses and mugs. I do not even know what else to ask of them. Everything exceeded my expectations. Also the location was good. You can hail a cab anytime the uber has a spot where to stop and the subway is walkable. there is a Park place in front where you can get a discount. Just have your parking ticket stamped at the front desk. As for the staff everyone was friendly. We brought our two small dogs with us and they were allowed to walk in and out the hotel on a leash. The management does not require dogs to be put inside carriers which is very convenient for us because placing our babies in carriers is a hassle and it stresses the dogs out. The Elements hotel also has a gym underground and an ATM machine which is very safe for tourists. ANOTHER GOOD THING.

She told so book it online. I asked her if it was possible for her to match the price on the hotel site she said no and continued working When I got home I filled up the hotel survey and mentioned this situation and said if they needed more information to contact me manager wrote to me that he would look over situation and that customer service is very important to the chain I wrote back and ask how he would take care of the situation if he never contacted and never got the full story.

We picked the Elements Times square hotel firstly because of price and secondly because of its position. The price was reasonable and it is position fantastic. It was only about 200 metres from the center of Times square so close to taxi ranks. We had a Very comfortable King size bedroom which had it is own kitchenette. Had Breakfast included and free cancellation in the price. As I have Gluten Intolerance I asked one of the waiters and within minutes I had a couple of boxes of cereal and a tray of muffins.

Staff was very helpful in providing suggestions on where to eat. Which streets you can easily flag a taxi etc. The exercise room in this hotel has plenty to offer cardio equipment free weights exercise balls and a yogi class at a scheduled set time. People can look out over part of New York City from the top floor open air lounge or sit and socialize with guests in the lobby. In your room you have easy access to your Netflix account to view on their big flat screen TV at no additional charge. Signs posted by the elevators inform you when is the busiest times for breakfast due to limited seating. This Hotel has 40 floors which makes the 3 elevators very busy around 10 am which many guests do not plan ahead for this delay. Also if you are a light sleeper I would recommend become used to sleeping with a white noise machine at night several nights before your trip. This will help drown out the vehicle horns and occasional sirens from the street below. You are in the middle of a city after all.", "offset": [424, 542], "date": "2020-03-02", "cpt": "3", "category": "price"}]}
