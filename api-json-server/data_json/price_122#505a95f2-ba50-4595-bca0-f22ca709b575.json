Each time I have been to New York I have stayed at a different hotel. The Martha Washington lured me this time with price but she certainly delivered in other areas as well. The whole place was apparently renovated in 2014 and it shows. the design is fresh and contemporary eg the big round back lit bathroom mirror. yet with obvious historical touches referencing the propertys eponym eg the framed silhouettes above the bed. And who knew the Mother of our Country smoked and drank booze. Now I admire her even more. The Superior Queen Room is generously sized for an NYC hotel and the bed is very comfortable. The shower is interesting it is only half enclosed with glass half open. Perhaps this is for those willing to dash out of the shower and lunge across the room dripping wet to grab a phone call. Anyway. The restaurant off the main lobby is Marta. the Italian version of her name which in itself seems to suggest great food always seemed to be filled with people having a good time. I tried it for breakfast and was not disappointed. The toast with an avocado spread was delicious and the Counter Culture brand coffee they serve is outa this world. For those accustomed to free continental breakfasts NYC is not a place where you will find many. But this one is not too pricey by local standards. The in room provisions. Now that is a different story. The location is great with a station for the 4 5 6 train just around the corner. Although I did not spend much time in the immediate vicinity this trip this whole NoMad NOrth of MADison Sq. neighborhood is a perfect place to be based for any stay in Manhattan. Each of my destinations Upper West Side Theater District the Village and Financial District was no more than a 15minute subway ride away. The Martha Washingtons greatest asset by far however is the people. Friendly courteous and professional they really take care of you. Special kudos to Almira at the front desk and to Zaman who stored retrieved my luggage when it was time to check out. Great job all around.

I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights last week. I read LOTS hundreds of reviews before selecting this hotel. I considered the Evelyn James and Nomad among others. This was a girls trip and my main criteria was plenty of room for all of us good location close to subway and no boring hotel chains. Do n\u2019t stay in a basic chain hotel when you can stay at a place like this for a comparable if not better price. Nomi was amazing for check in. We arrived early expecting to leave our bags and come back at normal check in time. We had reserved 2 rooms and were pleased when she said that one was ready. In an effort to get us on the same floor as requested when I made the reservation she gave me a complimentary upgrade to a queen suite that was ready next door to my friends. Early check in and complimentary upgradeOne note. I had read in someone else \u2019s review that they stayed in a room with 2 bathrooms. Since I was only reserving 2 separate rooms so that the 3 of us ladies would n\u2019t all have to share a bathroom I called the hotel to inquire about this several weeks before the trip. I was told that there were no rooms with 2 bathrooms in the hotel. My queen suite 103 had 2 bathrooms. I was shocked to discover this. The pull out sofa obviously would n\u2019t have been as comfortable as a bed however we would have only reserved one room had we known this ahead of time. It would have saved some money. I really wish the person I talked to would have been a little more educated on the rooms. As you can see from the photos the hotel is beautifully designed. It was a pleasure to come back after a long day to such a beautiful room. I \u2019ve seen several reviewers comment on the 30 daily resort fee. I \u2019m not sure how people are surprised by that as it is listed in the fees section when making a reservation and it is n\u2019t hidden on their website. But I guess if you are n\u2019t booking direct it could be missed. On that subject it is stated that among other things that fee covers 2 complimentary bottles of water a day. We had to ask for the water both times we received it. And we did n\u2019t get any the days we did n\u2019t ask. So if that is going to be advertised it really should be followed through. As other reviewers noted we were charged for mini bar items we did n\u2019t use. We were VERY careful not to touch those items as we did n\u2019t want the charge. They reversed the charges when we called to tell them that was a mistake. I would definitely stay here again. Little mixups can be fixed and I allow for those things on a trip.
