Our family of 4 2 adults2 teenagers originally booked our hotel room in May for over 500 per night standard with 2 double beds. When we arrived we were given a small garden view very outdated room in building 3. The carpet is old and worn the furniture needs to be replaced and the shower leaked and water puddled in the grout in the middle of the bathroom flooring. The next morning we asked for a room change and was offered an upgrade to a spacious and updated ocean front suite on the club floor with breakfast and happy hour included daily all for 125 a night additional. The upgrade was well worth it. The ocean and mountain views were fabulous from our top floor room in building 6. Breakfasts included scrambled eggs sausage pastries fresh fruit dry cereals and a variety of beverages. Happy hour included beer and wine crudite and typically a hot hors doeuevre. The all you can eat breakfasts and happy hours were valuable since there were four in our family including 2 teenagers. A huge compliment goes to Dyane the hostess in the club lounge who was very friendly helpful and upbeat. The ocean was warm and great for snorkeling. The kids enjoyed jumping off of Black Rock into the ocean. The pools were unusually cold. The polside bars and service were good we preferred the Cliff Dive Grill over the Mai Tai bar food. Housekeeping was excellent very polite and thorough. The concierge was helpful for making a couple of dinner reservations. We did not use the concierge for other services since we have been to Maui before and had booked activities on prior trips. Valet parking is free the first night. Overall the Sheraton was fine after the upgrade and we expected to pay more during peak season. We had to make a number of dinner reservations a few weeks in advance due to the busy Christmas holiday season. Roys in Kanapali Lahaina Grill Lahaina Fish Co were all excellent. For less expensive meals we ate at Aloha Mixed Plate Lahaina Pizza and Maui Tacos. Beware of Kula Lodge near Haleakala food was terrible and it took an hour to be served our entrees even though the restaurant was half full. We loved Kanapali Beach and weather was picture perfect but in my opinion Haleakala was the highlight of our trip. We went mid day and avoided the crowds and 30 am wake up call. It was amazing to be above the clouds and hike the trails in the crater with only a few other people.

First of all what a great location. Right next to Black Rock Beach which has fantastic snorkeling and is home to a family of very cooperative sea turtles. It was amazing to snorkel next to the sea turtles as they lazily swam along. Got some awesome footage on the GoPro. You can also jump off the rocks into the ocean and indeed every night they have a torch lighting ceremony and a cliff diver. The resort and hotel is HUGE. We staying in a lovely suite in a central location and it was a workout in itself just to get to the gym but we could walk out pretty much onto the beach. There are lots of facilities and restaurants and a great beach for swimming or tanning or even morning yoga. There are spectacular sunsets and when I think of beaches and Hawaii this is pretty much what I imagine it. If you want to get your romance on then this would be a great placeThe resort has a pool but we hardly went in it because let \u2019s face it why swim in a pool when you can swim in the oceanThere are a number of hotels all next to each other and there is a path along the ocean that connects them all. Aprox half a mile along the path is a place called Whalers Village which has lots of shops. A short drive south gets you to the Cannery a factory turned mall and a few streets further is the town of Lahaina with lots more stores and restaurants. Something that kind of spoiled it for me a little bit were the new water machines all over the resort which require you to use your room key to activate and cost you 002 per use. Not sure how much water you get per use. Now I know what you are saying 2 cents is not much and you are right it is not but as we are already getting charged over 260 USD per day for a \u201c resort charge \u201d then you think that could cover the water. Note There is at least one regular water fountain in the lobby area and there may be others. But really you can not beat the location. This was the second week of our Hawaii vacation and we just wanted to relax and swim and that is just what we did. Tip. Go to Boss Frog \u2019s at the Cannery for snorkel SUP or other rental equipment.

The staff at the restaurants bars pool spa were nice and helpful. However that was about it. All started upon check in. We get to the resort around 6 in the evening. The line at the front desk is short however the staff was painfully slow. Finally get greeted and the lady ask us if we were okay with a double bed even though I had requested a week before for a king room and it was just my wife and I celebrating our 5 yr anniversary which they knew. We told her we want a King room she said they had one for upgrade pay or extra of course. an ADA accessible room. Not wanting to spend more than we already had we agreed to the ADA room. Total downgrade. Bathroom was a nightmare with no counter space. I went back within 10 minutes to ask for the upgraded view room the lady offered earlier. She tells me it is no longer available but she can switch me to another room the next day. How does that even happen. I know this was a lie and she probably did not want to upgrade me. So we are stuck with the current room for a night. Room was right by elevators and there was a huge womens conference on that floor which was so loud through that night. Woke up constantly throughout the night due to disruptions of people screaming and running around. After asking for another room they offered one for next day and the lady moves us down just a few doors. Had to get stern about all the disruptions and moved us to a decent room on a different something we should have gotten in the first place. Wasted so much time over this. Second night we gave the valet our ticket to get our car. I had stepped away and told the valet I would be back my wife waited for the car. The valet called out the name and my wife gets into the car exact same car as our rental. Upon entering she noticed the car was different from the interior so she opened the door to get out the valet approached her and rudely started telling her he had called out the name Lee which sounds really close to my last name Ali. and the car was the exact same make model color. He could have been nice about it after all we are guests of the hotel. Lastly the final night we were there we return from a long day to our room to realize our bathroom amenities have not been restocked. To summarize the service at this hotel was horrible. The front desk staff besides a guy named Noah he was very helpful upon checkout valet bell desk needs customer service training. The resort pool and beach areas are nice.

We just finished up a 6 night stay at the Sheraton and overall it is a very nice hotel. it is about the same quality as most Sheratons I have stayed at. I will list the positives and then the negatives. Positives LOCATION. Located right on Black Rock where you can snorkel with turtles daily. We saw them everyday. TIP. Best time to snorkel is between 7 9am. Gets crowded after that. In addition the resort is within walking distance of Whalers Village where there are several great restaurants. Hit the Monkey Pod at Happy Hour for the best Mai Tais on the island. it is a short drive to 2 other great snorkeling spots Kapalua and Honolua Bay and they offer a free hourly shuttle to the adorable little town of Lahaina. The shuttle makes 2 other stops at the Cannery Mall and the Outlet Mall. POOL. The pool set up is pretty cool with the canals winding around the resort. There is no swim up bar but you can swim to the stairs leading to the Grill or Mai Tai bar. TIP Stock up on towels and then head down early to save yourself a prime lounge chair spot. It gets full fast. They had just put out all brand new cushions and cabana furniture when we there. There are dispensers of reef safe sunscreen available for you to use. it is REALLY thick but works well. Although it got all over my black swimsuit so I would bring a lighter colored suit next time. BREAKFAST. I thought the buffet breakfast was very good. Great assortment of food. The Belgium waffle maker makes the BEST waffles. Love the coconut syrup. Also they make made to order omelettes and breakfast is available from 6 1am. ROOMS. We stayed in a Deluxe Ocean Front King room. The room was very clean and the view was incredible. Especially at sunset. The beds are pretty comfortable for a hotel room. Rooms have a mini fridge microwave and coffee maker. The bathroom was nice. Loved the water closet with the Japanese toilet. The shower curtain and rubber bath mat are ready to be replaced but overall it was clean. They provide 2 bathrobes also. SERVICE. Upon checking in we were upgraded from the 1st floor to the 2nd floor and given a free service of sparkling wine for our anniversary. We had a couple of issues with the safe and toilet but someone was up to fix both problems in less than 5 minutes. The waitress at the Mai Tai bar would greet us by name and everyone at the hotel went out of their way to ensure our needs were met. A couple of the young staff members at the pool area still need to learn about customer services but overall the staff is great. Our concierge was awesome and helped book a fantastic trip around Lanai. She was extremely knowledgable about everything available. Negatives EXTRAS Everything extra at the resort cost money. Bring your own snorkel gear or you will pay 20 a day. An umbrella and 2 lounge chairs on the beach with run you 45 and they run out fast. Paddle board is 55 an hour. Even a pool floaty will cost you money. I recommend bringing what you can or heading to the ABC store nearby. Most of the good seating by the pool are cabanas for rent. I did not even ask how much those were. Again if you head down early before 8 you can throw some towels down and save a good spot. RESTAURANTS AND DRINKS. Food and drinks are not the best. Not horrible but not great. Most of the time we headed to Whalers Village or went into Lahaina. The only happy hour drink with any alcohol is their Mai Tai. Avoid the other tropical drinks unles you just want a frozen smoothie. Overall I would recommend this hotel and would totally stay there again. Especially now that I know all the tricks to a perfect stay. it is a good hotel for families or couples. It has good Hawaiian vibe and you can not beat the location.", "offset": [1541, 1618], "date": "2018-10-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "f8d2484f-2923-4c22-b0da-a1e0cc24619e", "sentence": "Workers on strike and there \u2019s little concern for guests. I was so excited to stay at the Sheraton Maui for my Honeymoon. I picked it so that we could enjoy the resort feel and my husband and I could just relax knowing everything was taken care of. We paid more than we would normally pay because we were interested in the amenities a resort provides. I really wanted it to be a special trip for my husband. Our first two days were relatively uneventful but not without hiccups. When we arrived the staff was pleasant but there was no lei or little special treat to make you get into the resort mood that I have experienced at less expensive Hawaiian resorts in the past. I let them know it was our honeymoon and we were n\u2019t even congratulated. We found our room and it was fine except that the AC is either on full blast or not at all. We went down to the pool and enjoyed one of the pool bar restaurants where the waitress was very nice and gave us some great recommendations for places to visit. We did notice as everyone else has mentioned that there were not enough pool chairs at the pool. The next day we noticed a steep decline in service at the restaurants. Our waiter in the morning seemed distracted and missed my husbands order. Finally we would n\u2019t care but we were in a hurry to get to the ferry and could n\u2019t wait for them to cook it for him. The waiter was very nice and offered for him to get whatever he wanted from the buffet but my husband was feeling grumpy and we had to go. The next day we tried to eat at the buffet again and my husband enjoyed his food but they ran out of a lot and had long wait times to replenish it 10 minutes for more oatmeal and no one came to refill our coffee or water which was frustrating because again we were in a relative hurry and the buffet was rather expensive. The next day we skipped breakfast at the hotel and ate off property but we came back to the bar restaurant we had previously enjoyed. This time the staff seemed again distracted no one came to greet us once we did flag someone down and ordered it took a while to get our food and no one came to refill our water or our drinks. The man who was working was covering too many tables which I think was the same issue at the buffet. The entire experience up to this point was not living up to what we expected service was lacking it did n\u2019t feel special and every little thing was an upcharge or a hassle. But we were still ignoring the bad and just enjoying the vacation and Maui in general. The next morning things got much worse. We were up early to take a day tour and noticed a paper posted in the elevator that said there was a work stoppage and that housekeeping service would be effected as well as the restaurants. It was worded in a way that made it seem like services would be slightly impacted and did n\u2019t spell out what was actually about to happen. When we got back from our trip there no more information slipped under our door or left in a message. There was trash left down our hallway and a pile of towels and toiletries on a table near the elevator. What the strike actually meant is that there is no housekeeping service to the rooms you can pick up your own towels though. All the bars and restaurants are closed. They do have a bunch of what appear to be teenagers serving a limited menu of maybe 7 items in one of the buildings and running the buffet. No one from the hotel thought that maybe they should consider people with dietary restrictions when making up their menu. The kids working the room seem nice but burgers in take out containers being served with plastic cutlery is n\u2019t what I signed up for when I paid more to stay at a nice resort. When you come back from a tour you do n\u2019t want to arrange for transportation to other hotels so you can eat somewhere else. The closing of the pool bar saddens us the most because we came here for the pool and planned to spend the last few days of our honeymoon out there enjoying the amenities and relaxing before heading back to work. Tonight they left trash bags by our door without any explanation. Judging from the debris in the hallway I think we are supposed to bundle up dirty towels or maybe the trash and throw it out there. It would be nice if they told us or updated us at all. I went to the desk last night to ask what they were going to do to make this better for the guests and all they offered was to waive the 26 daily resort fee. I feel like this is a good beginning but they act like not having these amenities is n\u2019t really a big deal and that they \u2019re doing us a favor by offering anything. I think that \u2019s BS. People paid more to stay here precisely for the things that are no longer available and the price difference when I was booking between hotels with fewer amenities and this resort was much more than 26 a day. I plan to approach the front desk again tomorrow and will amend this review if they do anything to rectify the situation. I bear no ill will to those on the picket lines. If this is how corporate for this hotel sees fit to treat paying guests I can only imagine how they treat their staff.", "offset": [3208, 3248], "date": "2018-10-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "4bdc9f8f-ed21-4adc-9113-293fdaec6082", "sentence": "We paid for a resort experience that we did not get. Beyond frustrating. I have never been so disappointed in a vacation hotel experience. Just got home from the Sheraton Maui. We arrived there on Saturday Oct 6th and had dinner and then a lovely day on Sunday by the pool having drinks lunch etc. We headed out very early on Monday to drive the road to Hana and got back 11 hours later exhausted. We learned about the strike when we got to our room and housekeeping had not been there. Thought it was odd and then called room service to order a glass of champagne to enjoy while we cleaned up from the day and mention that housekeeping had not been there. That was when we found out there was a strike and no housekeeping no room service restaurants were closed etc. So for the rest of the week we picked up our own coffee toiletries etc set out near the elevators bagged our trash and towels and set them outside the door etc. This is not the resort experience that we paid for and it is so extremely disappointing. It was our 20th anniversary trip. We do not normally spring for the big resort experience but this time we decided it was the time to do it and went for the resort and upgraded our room to an ocean view room. During planning months ago a family member even offered us their time share but we declined because for this special occasion we wanted the resort experience. Right on the beach drinks served to us while we lounge by the pool restaurants on site etc. So we were willing to pay and get all that for our special occasion. All that resort experience that we went for was gone. They continued their breakfast service on a partial scale and on paper plates. The only polside service was drinks at one of the bars the other was closed. And no food at the polside bar. The only food available was boxed hamburger hotdog lunches that you could to get in the inside bar. And the inside bar was only serving beer and soda. They told us we had to go outside for any wine service. The outside bar had awful wine and I get it it is not the place you go to for a glass of good wine. But being a wine drinker and seeing the case full of great wines in the restaurant that we could not get was another frustration. The notification on this is our biggest complaint. We knew nothing prior to going that this was a possibility and even after it happened the only notification was signs posted by the elevators in the lobby etc. I do get workers right to strike but this has severely impacted us and hundreds of others that spent big money and had our dream trips thwarted. KEEP YOUR GUESTS INFORMED. it is that easy to preserve good will. One other strike related event that was not right The striking workers were walking their picket line and not bothering us guests as we went in and out of the hotel. But one night there was an event on the lawn a reception for people that were there for a business convention. As we were headed out for the night on the beach walk we saw the striking workers had re positioned themselves from the hotel beach entrance to move down onto the beach just outside the reception that was taking place. They were yelling into the reception and trying to cause disruption to their event. Beyond rude. Just like our hotel room that event was I am sure booked months ago with no knowledge of the impending strike.

This was honestly the worst customer service experience I have ever had. The staff was on strike during our stay which was for our wedding week and they did an excellent job of making sure that no one could enjoy their vacation anywhere near the property. In addition to almost all of the restaurants and room service being closed there were protesters screaming into megaphones on the beach every single day of our ten day trip multiple times a day. Try relaxing while listening to people chant for an hour it is great. We were initially disappointed to learn about the restaurants being closed but could have gotten over that. The protesting made it absolutely impossible to enjoy your time at the resort. I ended up talking to the protesters at some point and was told that they announced that they would be striking this month to the hotel 6 months ago if negotiations were not held and the company did absolutely nothing to negotiate with them until they started striking. So the hotel knew for 6 months that all of their guests experiences would be ruined this month they did nothing to work with their staff to resolve things did nothing to replace their staff and did nothing to notify their guests that their stay would be impacted by these activities. In addition they were not even extra accommodating to make up for it. We got breakfast at the one restaurant that was open on our wedding day asked if we could take it up to our room because we wanted to start getting ready and were told no this is not room service. Yeah thanks we had planned to order room service on our wedding day if only it was actually available. I am just glad my actual wedding was at a restaurant and not on the property. Some other poor bride did have her wedding at the resort while we were there and had protesters shouting at her wedding. She was sobbing. How absolutely unacceptable is it to know that this will be occurring and not give your guests a heads up. I have traveled quite a bit and have stayed at a lot of hotels ranging from quaint bargain places to nice resorts and I have never in my life been even remotely this dissatisfied. I would highly recommend avoiding this hotel. Clearly any hotel that does not bother notifying guests until they check in that their entire stay will be impacted by something this drastic does not value customer satisfaction and is not a safe choice to book.", "offset": [1670, 1747], "date": "2018-11-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "baf65768-f8d8-4dd6-b219-579f160f91ff", "sentence": "Lovely location limited food options.

Pool was great but a current in the lazy river part of it would have been nice and I heard others people saying the same thing. We did a Snorkel trip which was the best we have ever done. Very clean boat equipment etc. great reef. we also did a helicopter tour which is very expensive but well worth it.

Room 3614 Building 3 6th floor excellent view of the yard below and the beach ocean beyond and Black Rock. Easy to get from our room to downstairs although at first the elevators and buildings were confusing to navigate. Nice beach with no rocks snorkeling was just OK better in other places on Maui. although we did see sea turtles. Great restaurants on site with many more nearby in a few minute walk to Whalers Village the Beach Path. a paved sidewalk went north and south of the Sheraton and was very convenient for walking. The housekeeping staff was extremely friendly every time we walked down the hall. Separate recycle and trash cans. Every evening they have a narrated torch lighting around the outside patio that ends with the torch lighter jumping off the cliff at Black Rock. Both the Rock Salt restaurant and Cliff Dive bar both on site had excellent food drink and service. Beautiful pool area. Nice fitness room once you figured out how to get there. Cons When we checked in the clerk convinced us to upgrade to another room in another building Building 6 west side for more and complimentary breakfast coupons he said it was the best of the best. We agreed to switch but once we saw it changed our minds. At the time we checked in around 3 pm late July. the sun was directly in our eyes on the Building 6 lanai and would have been hot to sit out there and although there was a view of the ocean but that was about all not the beach nothing else. The Bld 6 room was bigger than our room in Building 3 plenty of room here but the view was definitely not as good. And Building 6 was much farther away from the main hub of the hotel so it took a few elevators and some walking to get there it was confusing. We felt like this was a bit of a come on and wished it had not wasted our time. Self parking 24 day. Laundry facilities were OK needed more washers dryers. Also needed more showers at the beach pool area often there were lines of people waiting to rinse off.", "offset": [1007, 1203], "date": "2019-08-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "7e6ec64a-a812-4ac0-a78c-e07caa4a76ba", "sentence": "Wonderful week at a very good resort. We arrived around 5 pm on 113. Check in was easy fairly quick. Because of the construction this was done in an open air area one level above check in parking. We used our suite night awards to upgrade to an ocean front room located in building 6 top floor. Room. Pros it was roomy appeared to have been renovated in the last year. View was outstanding overlooking Blackrock. Service was friendly mostly on time each morning. Had a fairly close walk to the fitness room. Our only gripe would be that our only option for this room was 2 double beds. Had these been queen size it would have been fine but when you are use to a king a double can be a little snug. I have seen many have issues with the length of the walk from building 6 to pool bars etc. Yes it is a hike but the privacy quietness made it worth it for us we do a lot of walking anyway. Pools. Were great we never had an issue finding a place to sit. If you wanted to get chairs that were also covered by an umbrella you had to play the put your things out early game which we did a couple of times. Since we were spending 400 per night we did not mind taking our yetis to the pool area frankly many others did the same. We did order a good lunch a couple days from the pool bar service was always friendly. Most lunch items were 1520 beers are 7. The only Con I can think of is they could use some more of the water pillows as these were hard to come by at times. The free sunscreen was a great amenity. Beach could not be better. Very wide this time of year if you like to snorkle you could not beat location. We had brought our own gear so we did this at least a couple times each day. Current waves were manageable. We actually went all the way around the blackrock outside area. Tons of fish. if you go earlier in the morning 8 10 there is a good chance to see the large turtles. We stopped at Wal Mart 1 mile from airport bought two beach chairs for 13 each an umbrella for 10 less than the cost of renting for one day on property. We did notice a short walk down the beach path. in front of another property they were advertising 2 chairs umbrella snorkle gear for two boogie boards a cooler for 99 for 5 days. IMO that would be a bargain even if you only used it sparingly over your week. Restaurants. The only meal we ate on property was at their Japanese Restaurant. Typical chef show ours was very entertaining. Food was more than plentiful quality was very good. Only Con is pricing but we knew that when we went there. My wife I are not huge eaters so we generally split entrees when we dine out. There was a 20 split fee here so she ended up ordering the veggie dinner which was only 22. I had the shrimp lobster which was 42. Wine split was 28 my beer was 8. One of the most enjoyable perks was we received free breakfast buffet each day because of my Mariot status. This was great. Not sure what the normal charge would have been but I am sure it was pricey. They had anything you could possible want. Made to order omelets egg frittatas scrambled eggs 4 or 5 choices of meat bacon sausages our favorite fresh mahi mahi tons of fresh fruit yogurt cereals pastries juices great coffee. Overall Resort. Excellent considering it is over 55 years old. Sure there are some areas that could use some additional renovation but overall we were more than pleased with our stay. Local Area. As great as the property itself is we really enjoyed the convenient location to visit other areas. Only a 10 minute walk to Whalers Village which has many stores several restaurants. We only ate here one evening bar at the Hula Grill. it was very good. As with all dining in Hawaii prices are fairly steep but we did not have a bad meal. One great perk with the Sheraton is they have a shuttle that runs every hour until around 100 in the evening to Lahaina. We used this every night to go out to dinner. It makes a stop at the Westin the Safeway the Outlets last stop is the Wharf. it is free you can catch it back if you plan your timing right. We ended up using Uber to come back each night that ran 13Al in all just a very good visit for our first time to the island.", "offset": [2532, 2609], "date": "2019-11-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "a56e0525-0147-48b3-99d7-55ec7c8e88c1", "sentence": "Totally worth it.

Our ground floor room has a patio that had beautiful views of the ocean and area where they hold the luau. Pools are great with lots of chairs.

There are several casual food and fancier restaurant options on site and the resort is a short walk from Whaler \u2019s Village which has even more restaurants and shops.
