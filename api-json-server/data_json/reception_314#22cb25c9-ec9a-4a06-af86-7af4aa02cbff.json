Room was fine as the bed was ok and comfortable anyway. View was a nice specially on a new high floor. When asked for charger no one assisted and the answer I got from operator is to go down to reception so they can charge my mobile there. Main restaurant was a very nice restaurant to dine at the restaurant manager is one of the best as well as his staff are well trained very helpful and professional. Food was not nice at dinner Cesar salad or beef tenderloin. Lettuce was not cuted and instead full leaves with dressing on top Asked for well done tenderloin received it medium rare. Breakfast buffet was delicious. Concierge Bellmen or doormen were very friendly.

It is a room where the shampoo and body wash are nowhere to be found and they have to send a staff member with it in bagies to your door. It is a room with 2 grey stains on the white cover of the bed on the right. And above all it is a room with dirty used toilet paper stuck inside the supposedly cleaned toilet.

The second shortfall is sadly the hotel itself. I felt that the decor was very 80s not that that takes away from the quality of the stay but the aesthetic appeal was sorely affected.

Upon arrival we parked out front to unload our luggage we did not receive a hello or a would you like me to assist you. We got absolutely nothing. We made a mistake while booking our room and instead of putting four adults we put three and when we arrived they out us in a room with only one bed. I seen that there was a fridge in the room so i opened it and it was full of their overly expensive drinks. There was a fridge magnet attached to the fridge that basically said if you take any of these items you will be charged. But if you need a personal fridge call 0. I called 0 and i simply asked for a fridge and the lady said they ran out now that is not bad ill get over not having a fridge but what takes place is worse. We go down to the front desk to ask them about the parking situation and they are charging us 12 to park in their parking lot for their guests. So we accepted that and moved on and i asked them if we could be moved to a different room to accommodate the extra person. They said all the rooms were full which made sense but then we asked for a cot or anything spare we could use to sleep on and they had nothing how does a massive overly priced hotel not have enough equipment to function. So now we have no cot no fridge and are paying to park but what gets worse is we called to see if they have a extra 2 or 3 blankets to make a bed on the FLOOR but nope did not have any blankets in a massive hotel. I have had an awful experience. For the next 3 nights my buddy has to sleep on the floor with one small sheet and a small pillow my other buddys in the small cardboard like arm chair. And i sleep in the stiff uncomfortable bed and we have to rotate every night. I will NEVER recommend this hotel to ANYONE even my worst enemy. I have plenty of experience with traveling and this would be the last place i would choose. They charge massive amounts of money for everything and they treated us like complete dirt like outsiders.

This hotel was suitably located for me in North York. It is a nice hotel and we had a good view of the city. Most of the staff are friendly and helpful but the checkin process leaves room for improvement. Our room booking included the buffet breakfast but we did not get our breakfast coupons until the next morning when I went to the front desk to ask about it. The coupons were actually sitting in an envelope with my name on it waiting in the reception drawer. Luckily I am a regular traveler so I was aware of the need for those coupons before going for breakfast. The buffet breakfast is delicious and there is enough variety if you plan to stay for a few days. We had one incident where the waiter told my husband he was not entitled to the hot items in the buffet but apologized later for his mistake when I arrived. Luckily we are very forgiving people because this was a major embarrassment for any guest. The hotel has a couple of restaurants but we did not try them. Wifi is free for SPG members who book on the SPG site. There are quite a few eating places within walking distance. Tim Hortons is on the same side which we liked. And across the street is Five Guys Burgers and a few other places. We enjoy Caribbean cuisine when we visit Toronto so we ate at other restaurants further out. This hotel is also located on the bus route that takes you to York Mills subway station. From this station we were able to get to Union Station without transferring and to the waterfront and downtown Toronto.

Traveled to the GTA on business again and decided to give this hotel another try. Was greeted on arrival by friendly associates at the front desk who were attentive.

Hans Groh bath fixtures throughout with a rain shower shower head made for a luxurious shower experience. Bath amenities were run of the mill nothing spectacular.

Hopefully these will be replaced as a part of their remodel plans. Common areas of the hotel are spectacular and are what can be expected of a Westin property. One disappointment again is the pace of service in the bar on the lobby level. SLOW beyond belief. Sat for 10 minutes not acknowledged even though a server walked by several time. Finally decided to just stand and order pay immediately and take it to my room. Takes forever to get the check. Always seem to be out of Stella Artois and other beers on tap or something is wrong with the tap or some other excuse.
