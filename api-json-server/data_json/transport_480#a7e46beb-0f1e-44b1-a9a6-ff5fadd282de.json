We stayed here over the New Years Holiday when we attended the Peach Bowl. It is located just north of downtown on a major freeway. The access is a little strange requiring you to run down a feeder road and turn back toward the hotel. Other than that the hotel was a good value. Clean and well appointed. We were able to get the Georgia Dome in 10 minutes which was great. Right next door to the Hotel is the Silver Skillet. It is a famous breakfast place that has had several movies and TV series filmed there. The food is classic southern food but the best part are the waitresses.
