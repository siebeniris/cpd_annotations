My husband was attending a conference in Norfolk so we decided to tag along and see some of Norfolk. The Mariot was fully booked so we ended up at the Sheraton across the road. I would have given this hotel a 35 if possible. The hotel appears to be undergoing a renovation. The carpet and bedding looked to be new but our room definitely still needed some TLC. The door in the bathroom was missing a chunk near the bottom the vinyl on the headboards was peeling the furniture had a significant number of dings as well. Overall the hard services and walls looked like they needed to be spruced up. The walls are also very thin making it possible to hear much that goes on in the adjoining rooms and hallways. Seeing a large bridal party was staying at the hotel things were a bit load on the Saturday night BUT. the staff did come up and attempt to quiet down the individuals it was well after 11. The hotel also was out of foam pillows and getting out of the hotel when driving was an adventure. We had a street view so I can not say the view was good from our room. Now for the positive The gym was decent with new equipment towels TVs and free headphones. The breakfast buffet was excellent and very reasonably prices. I think the buffet might have been my kids favorite part. The lobby was modern and inviting. The staff throughout were very good from the reception desk to the valets to housekeeping to the servers in the restaurant. everyone was professional and friendly. The room was definitely clean and big enough to accommodate the four of us. My kids also loved the balcony and the Starbucks coffee in the rooms was a big plus.

Our Navy association held a reunion in Norfolk and selected this hotel for the group to stay with. It is a large hotel that offers all the services friendly staff great restaurant attractive rooms and large facilities to host conferences and other major events. I enjoyed the place and found almost everything that I wanted. The only two down points which lowered the score here was the fact that I received no room service at all. I arrived on Friday afternoon checked out on Sunday morning and NEVER ONCE had my room cleaned. My bed remained unmade my entire visit. Now to be fair this is really only one day as Saturday morning is when they should have cleaned and made the bed. But I must admit that I was very disappointed that they neglected my room. And no I did NOT hang out my Do Not Disturb card. They just missed it. The other problem I had here was not much of a problem but slightly annoying There was a loud BANG BANG BANG noise that happened outside my room next to the building. It was fairly frequent several times a day. Once or twice it did happen at night and it did wake me up. I think it might have had something to do with the renovation of the Watersides project next door. But it was not bad and it did not disturb me too much. Lots of good points with this hotel though including the restaurant the VERY friendly staff and other facilities.

Before this visit I associated Sheraton with a luxury brand. I have stayed at budget hotels in better condition in third world countries. When I tried to check in Sunday around 6 pm no room was ready. We were a big group with an advance booking so that seemed really odd. The bathroom had not been cleaned with a pile of sticky goop right in the entrance plain as day. The vinyl headboard had dark brown streaks the color of po over the pillow. I called for housekeeping then went to dinner but when I returned all was unchanged. Two more calls 30 minutes later a polite apologetic guy came and took care of it. There has been a filthy food waste covered table in the corridor outside my room all week. piles of crumbs grape stems dirty wine glasses stained a feast for vermin. The toilet seat is the cheapest quality ever made. It will not stay up emasculating every male guest. You have a choice to either sit like the ladies which means you do not empty or splash all over the seat which is totally gross. Makes you avoid using it. Reported to another man I was told that was the engineers issue. Another engineer issue the shower head BLASTS water and there is no way to reduce the stream. I like to listen to news while I shower but over the blast it is impossible to hear it. By the time I finish a 10 minute cleanup the tub is full. In an ear of global climate change and recurring cycles of drought right here in Virginia the wasteful shower power is incredibly irresponsible. I have noticed too three days into five days of meetings the table cloths have not been changed or even brushed of food residue. This is definitely one of the most neglected and unsanitary hotels I have ever stayed in. There is no free shuttle even for our large group to and from the airport.

Bathroom is NOT family friendly. Sink and vanity are not separate from bathroom facilities makes getting ready for the day a challenge with more than one person in the room. As an SPG Platinum member was disappointed that during the busy holiday week the hotel reduced their staffing and posted a notice on the Club Lounge that it would not be stocked or staffed for the week. They did however have someone attending to the lounge the last two days of our visit. While rooms were clean the service was generally lacking. One day we did not receive any room service clean towels or fresh coffee. We requested additional linens TWICE and they never arrived. New Years Eve Day was LOUD and hotel did nothing to temper loud guests in the hall on the top floor after 2 am with repeated requests. There was a fire alarm that sounded New Years Day in the AM and the staff was confused and did nothing to ensure guests were out of the hotel safely. It turned out to be a false alarm but had there been a real emergency it would not have been a good outcome with staff standing around trying to ascertain if it was a true emergency and telling guests to sit tight. On the 10th floor with a fire alarm sounding you do not sit tight. Emergency training needs to be done. The on site restaurant is reasonably priced with a good selection of food that was well prepared and open late. The gift shop is closed website needs to be updated to reflect. Self parking is a little bit of a walk but reasonably priced compared to 24 night with valet. For long term stays self parking is the most cost effective option.

I do not do reviews often and I do not recall ever giving a bad review. it is not my style. But the operations of this property was so bad my eperience so bad. that now upon returning home here I am. The property is undergoing a renovation the scope of which is not accurately displayed on its website. The site used to mention that the club level lounge was under construction until April 2017 checked website on May 20 2017. It today shows nothing as if the property is in regular working order. In fact the front desk is non operative they are working off of three computers in the little sundry store the hotel restaurant is in a meeting room with a bar that is long enough for two barstols and has so few tables that breakfast was a 45 minute wait and the club level lounge is still not open more on this later. This is a pet friendly hotel which is nice. We travel with our dog so we booked via a third party bringfidocom owned by expedia. one night on the club level for a room noting that we had be bringing a dog. Then it went downhil1. You should know if you book at this hotel that if you are bringing a pet you do not be up on the club level even if you have already paid for it. The club level is on the propertys 10th and highest floor. you will be on the third or fourth floor do not expect a view of the water. I wish that website would have been clear about that but it is not 2. Apparently my reservation did not get into the Sheraton system noting that I had have a dog. Upon my arrival at 40 propertys check in time I was informed my room was not ready. Just come back in 30 minutes I am told. So the family and dog hang out with our bags in the hallway that now substitutes as the lobby since the front desk got moved. Nothing more fun than waiting in a hallway with an impatient child and hyper dog for half an hour for a room that is not available after posted check in time3. I get back in the longish line a half hour later. When I get to the desk I mention. did you get the note about me having a dog. Oh no we did not. Now we do not have any rooms on the pet level ready. We. did finally clear up a room on the club level though. but that is not for you even though you booked and prepaid for that. Wait a while longer4. Another nearly half hour later we get a room for a room on the pet floor. it is a pretty standard room as far as rooms go. We ask the front desk hey so we paid 100 more for a room on the club level. You just now mention that there is no club level lounge because it is still under renovation even though your website says that it will be done in April. it is the end of May what gives. The reply was that they had have people shuttle snacks and drinks up to our room in lieu of the snacks and drinks in the club lounge being available 247. Here are your coupons for breakfast buffet in our restaurant in lieu of breakfast in the cub lounge5. A couple of hours go by and no snacks. did not know what was going on. I call the operator who confidently assures me that they will surely bring snacks and drinks up to the room. Of course they never come. We go out to dinner come back at 10 still nothing. By then it is the kids bedtime so we completely give up6. We wake having paid for an overnight at the club level having had none of the benefits. Okay let us head on down to the restaurant to have breakfast before heading out. Upon arriving there are people lounging around outside waiting and you know it is bad news. The line represents a small meeting room converted to a restaurant and which can not come close to accommodating demand. At the 55 minute wait point for a htel breakfast we give up. The Sheraton Norfolk Waterside wins no mas. We go upstairs and pack. Try to check out via the system on the TV system of course it is not working. One last final kick on the way out of the hotel. I ended up pre paying for a night in at the club level and got zero out of the upcharge. The property failed at every juncture. Again search my reviews and you will see that I am not a complainer. This property is that bad. Up the street are a fine looking Hilton and Mariot.

There was a broken outlet behind the bed and most of the furniture was not in great shape the bed was really squeaky even when you were just turning over.
