As we arrived we discovered that the hotel was over booked and we were offered to stay at their other hotel The Mariot. Obviously we did not agree and Robert the Front of house manager went out of his way to find a solution. At the end we stayed at the Ritz for half our stay and the rest we spent at the Regent Which was supposed to be at the same level as the Ritz but was much less in my opinion. They upgraded us to a beautiful suite that was amazing the bed was one of the best of all the hotels around the world we stayed at. we were missing a cofemaker or coffee making facilities in the room. We were also invited to the club lounge which was spectacular and provided a high end service. The breakfast was outstanding with great verity and all you need. The spa was great my husband got an amazing massage and the fitness room had all you need for a good workout. The hot tub was great and the pool very pleasant. Although the stay was wonderful we since returned twice to Berlin and chose different hotels because of the overboking and the fact that it wasted time and nerves for us.

The location is ideal for sightseeing as you have Brandenburg Gate and the Holocaust Memorial just around the corner. Almost everything is within walking distance. The staff is very friendly and attentive from the porter to the concierge and have the Ritz Carlton school to learn from.

Summary. We stayed here during our trip to Berlin and I had recommend it the place for everyone from tourists to road warriors. it is elegant quiet and in a great location. The only minor quibble is with the A C at night but at least the hotel has A C to begin with. Location 55. On a relatively quiet corner of Potsdamer Platz. it is walking distance to pretty much all the major sites from the Brandenburg Gate 5 min to Checkpoint Charlie 15 min. it is also on top of several subway stops including the U2 line which seems to get you to post of the tourist areas if you do not want to walk. The hotel itself is across the street from the Sony Center which is both a blessing and a bit of a curse. The convenience to a quick bite to eat is nice but for about an hour every night 8 9pm ish there is a lot of noise from the place. Lots of restaurants and shops are very close by. Mall of Berlin which just opened is just a block away. Hotel 55. Elegant. Updated. Good repair. Absolutely no complaintsthere is a pool area and fitness center downstairs which is nice accurate pictures are on the website. I think there is a steamrom but like all of berlin the spa is co ed. Service 55. Great friendly staff from the doormen Hi Terry to the front desk to the concierge. Restaurants 45. The main restaurant is a French Bistro type place. We had both breakfast and dinner there. Breafast was pricy for a buffet 38 Euro. I personally would not pay for the buffet but if you can get it included into the reservation AmEx or Virtuoso that had be the way to go. it is pretty standard for the Ritz egg station deli meats pastry etc. Weirdly from an American perspective there were never any potato dishes out. We asked for hashbrowns one day no further charge and they came out promptly and were good. Dinner was good but honestly not to our taste. This is the kind of place that uses truffles and foie gras. neither of which I care for. Room 455. We had a King bed overlooking Potsdamer Platz. The room was spacious with a desk and armchair. Comfortable bed. Electronic control of all the room lights from the nightstands. Small flatscren TV though. I think it was only a 36 incher at mostThe only real issue I had with the room was that the Air Conditioning seemed to be turned down go off. intermittently at night. It never got HOT per se but I like my room cold at night and it was definitely warmer at 2 am than it was at 9 pm. I dropped the room a 12 point for that. Minor issue and the hotel at least has A C. Not all of them do in Berlin. Bathroom was a marble wrapped 4 piece with 2 vanities. Excellent water pressure. Housekeeping 55. On the ball every day. Internet 55. Free throughout the hotel and relatively fast. Fees 55. None. No service fees or resort fees.", "offset": [1009, 1135], "date": "2015-09-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "19cd08ec-ed87-480e-be56-e85923a4562c", "sentence": "5 nights over Christmas.

I found the breakfast buffet annoying because you could not order off the menu and the cook taking and preparing orders seemed distracted. I had both an omelette cheese barely noticeable and pancakes not very warm were pre prepared. For 30 euro or more I would expect a better experience. Overall for dining I would recommend the Midtown Grille in the Mariot. One complaint. the Ritz needs to improve access to electrical outlets in their rooms. I use a CPAP device for sleeping and accessing the outlet was difficult and confusing. Additionally all outlets for charging near the desk are difficult to access.

We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Berlin for 5 nights during our visit to Berlin in July. This hotel is excellent in terms of many things here are the facts and recommendations I gathered1. Excellent location situated at the Potsdamer Platz. Right above of the S Bahn station. a few mins walk to the U bahn station. Walks to Philharmonie Checkpoint Charlie Topgraphy of Terror Jewish Museum Brandenburg gate Reichstag are within 10 15 mins. Mall of Berlin is 5 mins walk and it is across from the Sony Center. Shops and restaurants downstairs. Very convenient location. 2. We took a taxi from TXL to the hotel the fare was 25Euro tips in at around 620pm on a weekday. Then going back to TXL was around 265 Euro tips in at around 215pm. 3. Hotel itself is grand comfortable and luxurious. Hotel staff were always helpful and friendly. 4. Our room was a superior room and it was very spacious and clean. Entry way big marbled bathroom hardwood floor throughout. Lots of storage space as well including big closet and dresser. The bed was very comfortable. Desk area and sitting area too. Complimentary bottled water. 5. Daily breakfast buffet was superb. Excellent choices of food from made to order omelettes and pancakes to cold cut prosciutto fresh fruits cereal couscous hummus smoked salmon a table of different pastries and bread and many more. The restaurant is beautiful and service was of high standard. that is just the best thing to start the day6. If you need to buy the welcome card you can get it at the concierge. No need to pre buy online or to find the tourist center at the airport. 7. Supermarkets Kaiser and Rewe nearby. Kaiser is inside the mall of Berlin and Rewe can be access through the S bahn station. I do not recall the name of the mall at the station but if you explore a little bit you will find it. Inside the very same mall of Rewe you will find a lot of eateries as well. 8. Room service of the hotel was excellent. We ordered room service for 2 nights and they were very good. After a long day it was always nice to enjoy a nice meal in the comfort of your own beautiful hotel room. 9. There is a pool sauna gym and hot tub at B1 as well. 10. There is a restaurant called Facil inside the Mandala hotel which is just a few minutes walk from the hotel. it is a Michelin 2 stars restaurant. I recommend a visit during your time in Berlin. If you happen to stay at the Ritz Carlton it will be a very easy access for you. Please book ahead as they are always full. 11. If you are taking the airport bus from TXL to the airport I would recommend you taking the S bahn as a transit. You can also take the U bahn but the station is farther especially the exit with elevator. However S bahn is just right next to the hotel and that it has escalator so you wo nt have to haul your luggages up the stairs.

I picked the Ritz over the Mariot next door where my colleagues were staying to give it a try and get the 5 star treatment.

I think they could have moved that person aside or moved me somewhere else so it was less awkward. Overall the hotel was classy and had a great breakfast. I also picked the hotel based on the fact it had a pool and I expected a better gym given the class of hotel. Turns out both were under renovations. There was no notification in the booking process on mariotcom. Even though the gym I used seemed to be a temporary one in a next door residence I used it once and went to the park for a run once which were ok. The gym lacked cold water when I went which is fine but unexpected for a RC. I also did not like the way they made the beds and thought at a RC turn down service should not be only on request. I had a king size bed and they made it with 2 separate comforters that were folded see pic in a way that you had to unfold them to cover your body with 2 different coverings. I was alone but would have been weird if with my spouse were with me. I called down to ask about why they did nt use a top sheet and make they bed in a normal fashion and they said it was a European style. I have traveled extensively in Europe and do nt recall this sort of style but whatever. Colleagues reported their beds at the Mariot next door were comfortable and made in a typical fashion. I had hoped that after I called and requested turn down they would make the bed differently but they did nt. Not a huge one but made the bed somewhat uncomfortable for me.

Horrific Service. This was our first time to Berlin and being a seasoned RC guest I was excited to try another RC property. However the entire experience went downhill as soon as we walked into the club lounge after check in. Spoiler alert it did n\u2019t get any better for the next few days. The club lounge is one of my favorite things the RC has to offer that is for the properties that actually have a club level. I like the feeling of \u201c home \u201d when you are in the club lounge and the concierge greeting you by name getting to know you. However this club level did n\u2019t care to know you at all or be able to anticipate any of your requests. Need something or have a request. It will most likely be followed up with \u201c Uhm I will have to call and ask about that \u2026 \u201d. and then you are left to wonder if the \u201c call \u201d ever actually took place or if your request was simply ignored. We were only one of 3 different couples that we saw \u2026 visiting the club lounge. Surely it is n\u2019t that hard to identify us by name. At only one instance did someone ask for our name and at no point during the three days that we were there did anyone ever address us personally in the lounge. How hard is it to make a handful of people feel welcomed. The club lounge boasts many of the similar offerings that you will find across the entire RC portfolio breakfast lunch snacks dinner drinks. However I was very sad that this property does not offer a dessert setting post dinner for guests. This is the first club lounge that I have ever been to that does not provide desserts in the club after dinner \u2014 a MAJOR letdown. You may however find left over cookies still out from lunch or a single dessert offering that has been sitting in the refrigerator all day long for you to take if you wish \u2026 just do n\u2019t take the guacamole in a small ramakin on the shelf next to it because God knows how long it has been sitting in there turning into a flavorless pile of green gunk. Another mistake we made was scraping the bottom of the mustard jar that probably has been near empty for months now. But the dry mustard or should I say sand. pairs great with the guacamole if you want a flavorless and odorless meal past the date of expiration. If you \u2019re able to get over the no dessert offering in the club that \u2019s only step one. Step two is trying to order a drink. Never in my life have I had an issue asking for a drink in the club lounge. In fact I have had club level concierges go out of their way to make sure that I was able to enjoy my favorite tequila in the club EVEN IF the hotel did n\u2019t carry it. NOT AT THE RC BERLIN THOUGH. When I asked for a simple cocktail a margarita my request was met with some hesitation \u201c Uhm \u2026 I\u2019m not really sure about that. I \u2019d have to call down to see if we can get that from the bar downstairs \u201d. Since WHEN does a club concierge not have the ability to make a cocktail as simple as a margarita. I told her that I would kindly wait to enjoy a margarita even though she said that \u201c It \u2019s going to take a little bit \u2026. \u201dFirst thing there was NO ONE else in the club at this point. Second thing every time we went downstairs and passed through the lobby bar there was hardly ANYONE even there. It must have been a very slow elevator ride from the lobby to the 10th floor. I would never in my wildest dreams think that a simple request such as a margarita would cause someone such distress and take so long to complete. Tanja every time you replied with \u201c I \u2019l have to call and ask about that \u2026 \u201d it was as if I was asking you to do something illegal. We are n\u2019t in prohibition folks. Make a margarita. And for heaven \u2019s sake learn the wines that you have to offer in the club. The guest rooms have a beautiful bath tub. Many other RC properties have bath salts as requested bath amenities. Tanja had to call and ask about that no response. One of my favorite things to do in the club lounge is play games cards or board games while enjoying dessert. Well you can obviously cross out the latter but what about the cards. She had to call and ask about that as well. Tanja did you literally just arrive to this hotel. I saved everyone some headache and went downstairs to the hotel concierge and asked if they happened to have a deck of cards. Nope. This is literally the first RC I have ever been to that the club lounge does n\u2019t have ANY games. Is having fun illegal in Berlin. Good thing there is a shopping mall across the street where I was able to score a deck of cards for less than five euros. I was even able to pick up a few desserts to enjoy whilst playing cards. PSA if you \u2019re looking to stay on the club level here be prepared to a provide your own desserts b bring your own activities c. mix your own drinks if you want them in a timely manner \u2026 EVEN IF you are the only one in the club lounge at a specific hour. Oh and you might as well just call yourself to ask guest services for whatever you need because the Club Concierges are less than helpful. If that is not convincing enough then perhaps you should utilize the Les Clefs d\u2019Or concierge in the lobby who had WONDERFUL recommendations if you ca n\u2019t read my sarcasm already then perhaps you should \u201c call down \u201d to understand more \u2026. As a person who travels often I always trust the concierge \u2014 especially staying at the RC and even more so if they are sporting the fancy Les Clefs d\u2019Or keys. I spotted them instantly on the lapels of the gentleman at the concierge desk and knew he would have great recommendations for places to get dessert not a difficult request right. WRONG. He asked us what we were interested in \u2026 ice cream cake etc. I said it could be anything \u2026. but something that he would recommend us to try. After all it was only 7PM we had an early dinner. and I did n\u2019t think it would be such a hard request to follow through with. A bakery. A restaurant with great desserts. No. His first suggestion was the Italian gelato place in the mall across the street. I had to pass on this one as I LIVE in Italy and simply can not fathom eating gelato outside of the motherland. His second recommendation \u2026 STARBUCKS AROUND THE CORNER. I hope I did n\u2019t embarrass myself when he said this but I literally had a visceral reaction. Never in my life would I EVER think to have a Les Clefs d\u2019Or concierge recommend STARBUCKS to a guest. If I was his manager I would rip those keys off of his lapels so fast that he would n\u2019t know what to do. In fact it really makes me question the legitimacy of Les Clefs d\u2019Or \u2026 or shal I call it Les Scam d\u2019OrWe ended up finding a bakery on our own in the neighborhood to grab a dessert and bring back to the hotel of course to play cards. Tanja was sweet to ask if we wanted any after dinner drinks \u2014 yes absolutely yes. But then disappeared after she brought them and never checked to see if we wanted another or perhaps something else. But honestly it \u2019s for the better because she probably would have to \u201c call down and ask \u201d for the something else. The RC Berlin is a beautiful hotel and everything seems to be updated. They even have one of the best Nespreso machines I have ever seen in a hotel room. However aside from the beauty and the Nespreso machine I would caution anyone from booking a room at the hotel especially if booking club level. At the end of the day I think the Motel 6 can recommend a place better than Starbucks for dessert and certainly would n\u2019t have to call down for every simple request. Oh by the way we had to ask twice for shirts to be pressed which was complimentary for club level rooms and then came to find that the hotel billed us for the complimentary service. Upon check out I inquired with the lovely gentleman at reception regarding the error on the folio and he made sure to remove it. Fun fact the hotel still ended up charging my card for this \u201c complimentary service \u201d and it has yet to be refunded. What A Scam. It is an experience like this that questions my loyalty to RC and Mariot. Perhaps I have been spoiled by some of the best RCs in the world and the rest fail to measure up. Or perhaps I need to take some time away and experience other hotels and brands. When I do come back to Berlin however I wo n\u2019t be staying here. The Hotel Adlon Kempinski seems quite nice and hopefully their housekeeping understands to unwrap the slippers when placing them at the side of the bed for turndown service. Or is this some new RC rule that was recently implemented \u2014 to provide turndown service with plastic wrapped slippers. I guess it goes hand in hand with plastic wrapped desserts from Starbucks.

We were originally going to spend 4 nights but decided since our time in Berlin was non consecutive we had do the 3 nights at the neighboring Mariot where we had had a great experience in 2015 to save the 450 Bonvoy points for a rainy day. The Mariot turned out to be so middling that it only made the Ritz shine brighter in comparison. The rooms were recently redone and we just loved the modern decor including beautiful hardwood floors. The bed towels everything was exceptionally comfortable. We loved the Nespreso maker too. The room was just the right amount of luxury without being so over the top you can not bring yourself to leave. Luckily our flight back to the US was in the mid afternoon but they gave us late check out so we were able to stay up late and enjoy a leisurely morning with a big breakfast and some lazing around the room. The breakfast was fantastic and the hotel bar the Curtain Club really impressed us. It also had a really cool vibe. I went into the spa area and the only thing that was disappointing was the tiny pool. Still took a quick dip and used the steam room to relax after a week of travel and excitement.

Stayed here for 2 nights in December. Brilliant location with A Christmas market on the door stop. We walked to the other 3 main markets near. Also next door to Berlin Mall.

I have stayed in several club level Rooms with different views and configurations. They all offer abundant space exceptional Bathrooms and modern technology in the Room. I have also stayed in a corner Room and a Potsdamer Platz View Room both were excellent with comfortable Beds and were very spacious. The 24h room service here is outstanding and the food is the same at 020 as it is at 170. The failure of other Hotels ability to match this is something that drives me crazy and really makes me appreciate this hotel. The burger and chocolate cake with a bottle or 2 of Becks is a go to for me. The Schnitzel is also very good as is the Curywurst and Club Sandwich. Breakfast is also fresh and fairly priced. Potsdamer Platz SU Bahnhof is a couple of metres away making it ideal to catch a train to anywhere. There are multiple places to run and exercise directly accessible from the hotel if the spa and gym are not your thing and you prefer to be outside. I have to say that the Ritz Carlton in Berlin is my favorite hotel on Earth. The ladies and gentlemen running this Hotel are the best in the world. This is something I have never imagined saying on a review on Google. I suppose I should also mention that both the WLAN and the working space in the room are exceptional making it easy to have more free time to enjoy the city after finishing work. it is not a complete visit home without spending a few nights here.", "offset": [971, 1119], "date": "2020-01-13", "cpt": "2", "category": "fitness"}]}
