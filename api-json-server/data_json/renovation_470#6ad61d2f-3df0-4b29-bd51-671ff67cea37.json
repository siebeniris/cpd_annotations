It is close to Disneyland and has many food options close by. Hotel and pool could use updating. We had very rowdy neighbors that wanted to hang out on the balcony late at night but as soon as we called down to the front desk they resolved the problem quickly. The prices are great but the parking is crowded. Same price for self or valet but definitely not enough room for everyones vehicle. While this hotel satisfied the dates we needed we will definitely go back to the Grand next time we visit. Proximity to Disneyland and restaurants Mimis Cafe Denys IHOP and McDonalds very close by.

Overall it is convenient place to stay especially for disney visitors. We had credit card fraud during our four nights stay we reported to front desk second night when we found out that and told them the card on file has been cancelled due to fraud at that moment the front desk manager told us no need to do anything we even offered to update the card he said no need we just need to present in person when check out to pay remaining 24 dollars of parking charge. Then next day when I was rest in the room late afternoon a security guard knocked on the door saying that there was some billing problem and front desk asked me to go down. I said ok I will go down to front desk. Then after few mins he knocked again when I opened the door he said I thought you are following me. I was surprised he was this pushing. I then said ok I will go down but can I use the restroom first he said I will wait for you here then he literally followed me all the way down from my room which located sixth floor sorta like escorting I feel so embarrassed since he dressed in uniform and follow me like I am a criminal. It is quite insulting the way he acted. When I arrived front desk turned out they just want to put a card on file. For 24 and we were still stay in hotel for one more night it is really no reason to treat a guest like this.

The property is old and in desperate need of renovation. They are updating the lobby and all front desk services are in a tent. The room I was given was an upgrade because of my Mariot status. The last time this upgrade had been renovated was at least 10 years ago the furnishings and carpet were worn. I thought it was clean until I returned after my first full day out of the room. The ice bucket was still full of water the coffee service had not been replenished and a dead light bulb had not been replaced.

They are under remodel the noise is incredible. Its like someone is jack hammering non stop right next to your hotel bed why. Because they are. And there was no warning of this at the front desk nor online during booking. If you are hoping to walk back for quiet time away from the park during the day or to let your littles ones take naps book somewhere else. There were a couple other hiccups here but the hotel did they are very best to make up for it so I will not bash them for any of it.

Hi This was decent hotel rooms were clean and recently renovated very comfortable. Nice breakfast included. Heres the negative. Specifically asked for a quiet room on notes for booking and during check in bc we have a child with autism who is noise sensitive and has difficulty sleeping. They put us in a room that backed the elevators which was very noisy every 30 secs. All day and most of the night sounded like a train going by. So we did not have a great sleep for 4 nights. I bought sleeping pills and used white noise ap. My son was so wiped from Disney that was ok at night but he would wake up at 5 from the noises rather than 7 when we would want to get up and wake us alI did not notice until I had unpacked everything. Hubby had tv loud. Or would have tried for a new room. so avoid rooms that back evelators like 701.

We decided to stay at this hotel because of the proximity to Disneyland. We walked everyday to the park and back and I would say from the front gates it is approximately 5 7 minutes. That was the Main reason why we chose this hotel. I initially reserved this room with get away today and had requested a room with a view of the park But by the time we got there 45 minutes after the hotel check in time they only had a view of the mountains. well that was at least the glamorous definition we got of the view when checking in with the front desk. Really you get to look down into buildings and parking lots and the freeway. Oh wait in the far off distance there are some mountains. But cmon let us call it what it is. the backside of the hotel no view. The front desk area was nice looking and updated and they had a mini mart in the main level as well. Everything is just as expensive as in the park here though. If you do not want to spend a fortune on water drinks snacks breakfast etc. I recommend visiting a grocery store or having some delivered to your room. It will save you a lot of money. This hotel does not offer a free breakfast however if you are hungry there is a place you can get some breakfast sandwiches coffee juice. whatever. It is also a Dominoes but their hours are not convenient for those that have been playing at Disneyland all day. If you want to order a pizza you had better hope you get there before 9 pm or they are closed. Needless to say we never ordered any pizza. We were going to order from them after a long night at the park and ended up walking over to Panera that is located just in front of the Fairfield Inn by the way this was at about 10 pm. There are several other options as well close to the hotel. On your way to the park you pass a McDonalds I Hop Captian Kids Buffet and one door down from the hotel is a Mimis Cafe. The room we stayed in was fairly nice you could tell it had been updated recently. We stayed in the 2 Queen room and the oversized chair unfolded into a twin bed maybe even a tad smaller nonetheless a bed for our 14 yr old son. The beds were comfortable we all slept like logs but after long days at Disneyland you are exhausted. The room had a fridge a safe a hair dryer and a desk. We did utilize housekeeping twice and they were very quick and niceOveral I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Disneyland.

My family and I recently stayed at Fairfield Inn by Mariot in Anaheim for a couple nights. Once we found the place it was a pleasant experience. it is important to note the hotel is set back from S Harbor Blvd. So in order to reach the Fairfield you have to pull into Panera Bread and then proceed straight through their parking lot to the guard stand. Since we were traveling to Disneyland we arrived well before our scheduled check in time. Surprisingly our room was ready and we received a free upgrade to a Jr Suite. Since this hotel does not really have indoor corridors I was surprised to learn they offered this room category. But the room was nice spacious and recently renovated. The beds were comfortable there were ample outlets for charging the air conditioning worked well and the shower had better than average water pressure. Nothing spectacular but nothing to snub your nose at either. Unsurprisingly the best feature of this hotel is its location. It is within a block and 3 minute walk of the main entrance to Disneyland. Panera McDonalds and IHOP are all on the way too. Not the best options per se but not the worst either. On our day of departure we were given the option to check out and leave our vehicle on premises until we returned from the parks late that evening. Obviously we had to pay the daily parking rate but it was uber convenient and well worth the nominal fee.
