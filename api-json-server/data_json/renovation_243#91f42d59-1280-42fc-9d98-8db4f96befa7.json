The room we got had a musty odor and the bed shared a wall with the ice machine at the end of the hall. Per our request we were moved to a quieter room with a nice view of the harbor. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Decor was stark and sparse with a very worn desk and dresser and stained carpet. The mini fridge was dirty inside and we had to call housekeeping to get it cleaned out. Other reviewers have mentioned problems getting hot water. Our room lacked cold water. The shower had instant hot water which was nice but the sink had no cold water at all. Housekeeping staff was very friendly and valet staff was excellent. The gym had a nice location overlooking the marina but was small for such a large hotel. Only three treadmills two elipticals one recumbent bike which was in need of repair and some weight machines. This hotel has the potential to be a four star property with some updating of rooms and more attention to detail.

There is no onsite coffee only the chintzy one cup in room service or a short walk to Einstein Bagels for overpriced coffee where there was no place to sit inside important on the very cool and windy mornings we had. The location is nice if you want to be away from downtown and have a car. It is a mile walk to anyplace interesting outside the hotel which is fine if you are fit and like to walk but would be prohibitive for many. Parking at the hotel is an outrageous 35 per night. We were told by 3 of the Hyat staff that there was NO other parking option that would allow us to park our rental car overnight without paying that fee which simply was not true. There is a small free unrestricted lot in back of the hotel that we were not told about and at least one other free unrestricted lot down the street. I find that unacceptable.

We liked being able to order food and cocktails near the pool however it was 150 for one drink plus the 4 sur charge added to help cover the increase in the min wage plus taxes and tip so you expect it to be a little more expensive at pool side but not that much more. We also ate at The Red Marlin restaurant on site that was good food. One thing we really liked was every time we came into the tower to head to our room there was always an elevator door open you did n\u2019t have to wait. I \u2019ve never seen that loved that.

If you do n\u2019t upgrade you \u2019re in one of the two story buildings with exterior motel style doors that anyone can access from the street with views of the parking lot obstructed at least by pretty tropical trees. If you upgrade you get a view of the marina. We parked here for a couple hours before we were aware of the parking fee and they tried to charge us 24 for those 2 3 hours. Ridiculous. So the rest of the trip we parked overnight at the nearby Home Depot and had to take a 6 Uber to get to our car each day. There is free on street parking around the hotel which we used if we were stopping by the hotel during the day but of course you ca n\u2019t park there overnight there was a sign up saying they towed between 2 am and 4 am. Of course. For pool towels you had to use a voucher to redeem them each time and they were ratty and thin. A lot of effort by Hyat to protect towels literally no one would ever steal.

My family and I recently stayed 4 nights at the Hyat Regency Mission Bay. We were very impressed from start to finish with only a few details that offered small detractions from an otherwise excellent stay. We arrived on a Sunday and were immediately pleased with the bright fresh lobby and beautifully landscaped grounds. Our check in was efficient and pleasant. Our room was very clean and well appointed. We were particularly pleased with the decor and have taken some ideas back for our own home renovation. We had a view of the harbour which was so gorgeous on all the lovely sunny days. Our daughter was excited for the pool and water slides which she rated the best of all our stays on this trip. I enjoyed the fact that all the pools were no deeper than 4 feet so felt confident with my daughter \u2019s safety in the pool. The afternoons were windy though unfortunately and cold. We enjoyed sitting in the gardens in the evening reading and having a snack. We also loved the games provided on the pool deck ping pong connect 4 etc and the fire pit. We did n\u2019t find the dining options great for a family. Both places were fairly expensive for family dining. The pub style restaurant was small with little ambiance. I can appreciate it \u2019s more for quick bites while pool side but I think the menu could do with a revamp. We found it odd that there was no breakfast restaurant option. We walked to the little market coffee shop which was an enjoyable jaunt but the coffee was really very poor. We enjoyed the pastries though. Recognizing that this is a resort and prices are higher because of that I still felt that the snack gift shop was way out of line in pricing. You should n\u2019t have to pay 450 for a small bag of chip snack mix. Maybe 350 for the convenience. We really loved the chilled fruit infused water offered in the lobby each day. The bell staff were very kind and attentive the tower where we stayed had new and attractive carpeting and the rooms were kept up nicely. We did hear some noise between rooms on one of our nights and always heard the seals but to me that \u2019s the plus of staying ocean side. A bar of soap was discovered propping up a panel in the ceiling above the bathroom door. Not sure how that got there. Convenient to SeaWorld and Mission Beach. A longer Uber to Balboa Park zoo. Not much close by to walk to but that was fine for us on this particular stay. Overall this hotel was a beautiful stay and we were quite pleased with our whole experience here and in San Diego.
