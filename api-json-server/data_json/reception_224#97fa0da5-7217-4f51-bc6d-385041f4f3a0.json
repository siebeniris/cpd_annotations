The Conrad is a very well run hotel. The staff are gracious and very willing to assist in particular Pong the concierge and all the staff at reception. The rooms are spacious and comfortable but it is the overall landscaping that is a standout. Beautiful to look at and very relaxing. We booked using the Luxury Escapes package and it was very good value. The package included sampling all 3 restaurants and 2 visits to the Spa which is very good. The cocktail evening was extraordinary. We thought our package would include one free cocktail each but instead we could keep drinking cocktails for the entire 2 hour period. The only reason for not giving this resort 5 stars is that its beachfront is not the greatest in the area. This did not worry us unduly as being from Australia where we have fabulous beaches anyway we were not after a beach holiday. On our walks along the beachfront it seemed the that the closer you got to Nusa Dua the better the beaches got. On the plus side though being in Tanjung Benoa means you have better access to Bali stretlife and local restaurants. Other reviews have made mention of the lack of free Wi Fi in rooms however we found this to be easily solved. The receptions staff suggested we simply join the Conrad rewards program which is entirely free and we instantly had free wifi in our rooms.", "offset": [84, 198], "date": "2015-07-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "8c86a081-a103-4ec8-9cd3-874fa75552f3", "sentence": "Birthday holiday perfection.

We attended 2 of the free cultural activities held in the water gardens and greatly enjoyed having a it more time to talk to the team and get to know about their culture and lives Sadly we were the only ones there which was a shame as it really added an additional dimension to our stay. Breakfast daily as well as a meal at every restaurant were included in our package and without exception everything was delicious. I would especially recommend the Bali Buffet and Cultural night at Suku I got to try a small bit of everything and loved it although I ended up very full. I was injured prior to our trip and sometimes needed wheelchair assistance and a couple of times fell off my crutches the staff were all incredibly helpful and would offer me water wheel me around get me plates of food from the buffet and generally showed great concern and compassion. I would like to mention Suryana and Wisnari particularly but there were many others. We had 2 massages at Jiwa spa and again the team showed great interest in making sure we were comfortable and our needs were met. I was fortunate to be treated by Juniari on both occasions she seemed to really enjoy her work and made sure I got the most benefit possible from my treatments.

We had such fond memories of Conrad Bali that decided to visit it again. Especially as it is the one pace that my son always refers to as his dream holiday. I have earlier review of the same property and everything in it still applies but let me add a couple of additions related to our suite. It had been 8 years since our last visit and my then small boy had grown into a teenager. Last time we stayed in a normal ocean room but this time decided to treat ourselves with Conrad Ocean Front Suite and it was a right decision. What an amazing location and suite. The view was absolutely breathtaking and the suite was very spacious and well maintained. It is a bit far from the main building but the exclusive Conrad Wing provides a lot of privacy and quietness which we appreciated very much. And the walk to the main pool and lobby is only about 3 minutes by the sea so it is nota lot but maybe too much for elderly of people with disabilities. The Conrad Suite price included unlimited laundry and afternoon tea and evening cocktails that were of excellent quality. They do not compensate for dinner but sometimes if we had a bigger lunch like the one we had in Bumbu Bali. we actually did not need any dinner at all as the cocktail nibbles were enough. So the facilities location and food was great and the free wifi. but what really makes Conrad Bali so unique is the service and friendliness of staff.

To make extremely efficient check in was By Agung. Sincerely he apologised the inconvenient circumstances which I had to wait quite long to wait for my turn for checking in. On top of I was impressed by his engagement skill. He made a positive impression upon arrival. I was escorted room by Suaudi. He fully explained all facility information and room orientation was made by him. Even his English skill was not so good but I really felt his genuine hospitality. Cleanliness in the room was fantastic. Even one hair can not see during my stay. I realised compare to another hilton worldwide property size of bed was different. It was quite bigger than any other properties which made me happy. Regarding room condition I will be pending for next visit due to fully aware on going and started renovation work. At night I went to reception to borrow some stationary due to no business centre in this property. Efie was the one who assisted me with speedy and prompt action. She is also the one who really can engage with guest and she can make emotional connection. Breakfast venue was very clouded. I was a bit disappointed due to coffee was not served even staff came to approach me. Finally I waited almost 30 mins to get coffee.

After staying at the Anantara in Uluwatu I can definitely say that the Conrad does n\u2019t live up to all the other reviews I have read on here. Firstly the check in was slow and we were n\u2019t met with friendly faces the receptionist appeared stuck up. We stayed in an ocean view double room however I was not impressed when I entered the room. It was really small and compact. Upon entry we could hear a hammer banging from upstairs and I immediately asked the porter what that noise is he appeared to be ignoring it and was ready to leave until I stopped him. He then said he will call and find out. It was still going on for another 10 minutes then I decided to call Reception and a few minutes later we heard someone shout something abrupt from above in anger and then the thudding stopped. Ridiculous. So now we had some peace and queit. The hotel itself is beautiful however not as clean as you would expect. There was dust on the lampshades above the bed and our fruit platter has flies crawling all over it that we had to call reception twice to come and take it away. Breakfast was okay at the Spice restaurant however I will mention breakfast at the Rim Conrad Suites a little later. One evening we returned to the room and there was drilling and banging going on upstairs and I filmed it on my phone and went straight to reception to complain. They immediately said they will move us to a suite much to our delight. The suite is wonderful and spacious however we were n\u2019t provided with all the suite amenities such as the Free shopping bag no shower cap and no loofah. I \u2019m expecting if you are moved to a suite you should have the same privelages because of the bad experience. We went to the breakfast area located on 1st floor and there was very little choice. No bread hardly any juices and hardly any fruit. Very very limited the choice in spice was so much better. Me and my husband ordered omelettes which took 20 minutes to arrive and we had to ask one of the waiters where it is and he was being very rude to my husband who is hard of hearing. He was a bold guy in his 40 \u2019s. I said to him there is no bread and he walked off with a smug look on his face. When he gave us our omelettes he put the plate on the table and flicked his hand in a rude manner as to say \u201c here take it \u201d. I was very shocked by this stupidity and I ca n\u2019t shake off how angry this service has made me. A lot of the hotel is under construction so everyone is cramped into one pool and there \u2019s a lot of kids not a relaxing holiday or luxurious if that \u2019s what you \u2019re expecting. Very disappointed will not be recommending this hotel and will not be coming here again. The Anantara in Uluwatu was 10000 better than this and me and my husband wished we stayed there for the rest of our stay. Also the photographer is very rude. He will try and force you to buy all the photos for millions of rupees even if you do n\u2019t want them or do n\u2019t like them he still forces you to buy it and then got aggressive saying what \u2019s the point etc. Maybe we did n\u2019t like the photos.

I spent five nights at the Conrad Bali at the beginning of November and I must say as a solo traveler still getting used to that situation I was made to feel like family. From the moment I was picked up by their pre arranged transport until the moment I checked out staff could not have been more accommodating. The resort itself was most relaxing and quite tranquil despite some ongoing renovations. Walking to breakfast every morning was always a treat as staff would greet me in such a warm and genuine manner. The Balinese I encountered on this trip were such a kind and gentle people helping me in any way they could even if it were not in their own self interest. Sekar the hotel concierge went out of her way to engage me in lively conversation whenever our paths crossed. She helped me resolve a billing issue with such grace and aplomb making me feel far more important than warranted. Within the second day of my stay I was already being addressed by name and my specific preferences at the Suku restaurant Executive Lounge and Suites Pool committed to memory by staff. I was mightily impressed especially given the size of the resort. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I was upgraded to a beautiful suite really too large for me on my own but appreciated nonetheless. It overlooked the Suites Pool and the large balcony was most inviting with a table chairs and large settee. A breeze often created a comfortable temperature in which to watch the setting sun. Quite romantic for guests traveling as a couple which almost all were. Everything in the suite was in perfect working order and a wet bar two mini refrigerators a capsule coffee maker dinnerware glassware and various other kitchen oriented apparatus were also provided in the dining area. The bed was superbly comfortable and although described as two twins actually was comprised of two king or queen sized beds joined to form an enormous unit easily large enough for four. The rainfall shower provided a steady supply of hot water and the quiet HVAC system was efficient in keeping the room at a perfectly comfortable setting. Buffet breakfast at Suku was always a treat that I eagerly anticipated after rising in the morning. Staff were so friendly plying me with the French press coffee that I so urgently needed to keep up my energy level. The selection was extensive and changed daily. As in most hotels in Asia Western Asian and Japanese fare was offered. Lamb beef chicken fish and vegetarian dishes were in the daily rotation as was sushi cheese and cold cuts. One could order \u00e0 la carte or from the egg station and I thoroughly enjoyed the Eggs Benedict made with chicken rather than pork back bacon. Bread and pastries were also of a high standard perhaps not as good as some venues in Europe but certainly better than most in the Americas. In the evenings the Executive Lounge provided canap\u00e9s and snacks as well as an assortment of beverages including wine beer spirits and mixed cocktails. It was always such a pleasant way to end the day. Staff there were always solicitous and polite to a fault. Staff at all the pools were quick to bring cold water and wet towels to refresh both ones thirst and extremities. There were always loungers available and the chaise cushions and towels were thick and very comfortable. Umbrellas were set up for all loungers providing ample shade from the hot sun. The grounds were immaculately maintained and the shrubs trees flowers and extensive landscaping were most attractive in providing a beautiful tropical setting.

The room was a beautifully decorated oversized room which compromised of a insanely large bed bigger than our super king at home a huge walk in wardrobe which we took full advantage of a very large bathroom with a large marble bath tub walk in shower and separate toilet. there was also a decent office space in the room to work out. One of the best parts about this room was by far the ginormous terrace with large comfortable seating and direct access to the pool which is shared with about five other rooms but as we were in the corner end bit it felt very private. The staff left a laughable in a good way over the top towel decoration on the bed of swans and teddys surrounded in fresh flowers which spelled Welcome To Bal a jar of macaroons and a welcome cake.

Great value if you are sushi lovers as you can order as much as you like. and we really didLocation is great if you want to be a bit out of the way of the hustle and bustle and just relax but there is plenty of restaurants and shops within a ten minute walk big shout out to Bobs as they do fantastic ribs and burgers. There is also a sports bar nearby with great evening music and drinks. The biggest shout for the Conrad is it is staff members from the grounds keepers to the fantastic ladies and gents who looked after us every evening for the executive happy hour they were actively pushing drinks and making sure everyone got a few rounds when they were close to closing. They were all very helpful friendly and could not do enough to make your stay easy and enjoyable. I would take the negative reviews here with a pinch of salt as some people do have unrealistic expectations and demands especially concerning children under 12 not being allowed in the executive pool area and restaurants. Speaking personally there are five pool areas to choose from and there were also a lot of children during various points of the trip and they have fun make lots of noise run around and enjoy them selves which is great to see but it is also nice having a peaceful space to go and relax by the pool for those without children so i feel there are a few over entitled parents giving poor reviews here. There is only construction going on near the Conrad suites area as they are renovating a large building but they do not start too early or go on too late and you can not hear them from any of the pool areas. Our first but definitely not the last here.", "offset": [86, 268], "date": "2019-09-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "7b06d009-2a23-4a2e-ad3c-65b913f1574c", "sentence": "Beautiful resort however. This resort in Nusa Dua is beautiful. Its staff are what make the stay memorable. They are such hard working and dedicated people who at times are so poorly treated by some customers. At peak times and maximum capacity there needs to be more staff to assist. I strongly suggest that when they have \u201c large groups \u201d from a particular nationality staying that they find and alternative to where these people eat. There behaviour from noise to taking large amounts of food which is then left on the tables wasted to smoking in non smoking areas outside need non smoking signs on outside tables where people are trying to eat and queue to enter the restaurant with total disregard for the staff asking them to move to the smoking area provided over the other side of the restaurant. Let \u2019s no get me started on the hacking and spitting which is enough to put anyone off their meal and stay. Hotels in Singapore have \u201c dos and don\u2019ts \u201c handbooks in the hotel room to tell these customers what is n\u2019t acceptable behaviour. Food at Suku Spice RIN and 8 degrees south was amazing as were the cocktails from the pool bar staff. So thank you to the staff at the Conrad for looking after us for 11 days. No thank you to some very uneducated humans.", "offset": [210, 284], "date": "2020-01-07", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "b7d8366d-904f-436d-8616-58e9a271268e", "sentence": "Worth every penny. This is the perfect luxury getaway in Bali. The staff is attentive but not intrusive. You can look to spend quality time by yourselves in the resort and enjoy the many facilities. The beach and pools are clean and well maintained. The hotel is well located to get to other parts of Bali without getting into the very busy traffic regions. The check in and check out process could have been better. Given that we had notified our time of arrival and departure in advance we would have liked to be greeted more personally without having to dig through systems.

Stayed here 6 nights in a standard room. Had booked a hotel pickup from our other hotel. We arrived at around 1 pm and the room was not ready which some would expect when they knew at what time we were coming due to the arrange car pickup. Then again the hotel seemed quite full. The receptionist took all our details and charged the deposit and said that the room would be ready in 20 minutes. He then noted our phone number to call us when it was ready. After an hour when they had not contacted us I went to the front desk which was now staffed by another receptionist who did not know we had checked in already and tried to take us through the whole process again including handing us the welcome note and trying to charge us the deposit. Anyway we got our room and on the positive note we got the exact room that I had requested in advance a standard garden room but in a specific locationSo off to a bumpy start with check in. Our room was spacious clean and quiet. The wifi could have been a bit faster as we had issues some times with streaming. The complimentary water bottles provided were glass bottles which is a nice detail and something I would wish more hotels would have. The gym was adequately equipped. I was disappointed to find out that the the sauna and steam room were unavailable as the block containing the spa facilities was being renovated. Since no notice had been posted on the hotel website regarding the steam room and sauna not being available I brought the issue up with the GM who made sure appropriate service recovery was provided. The breakfast at this hotel is great. We especially liked the large range provided including a good range of warm dishes with different proteins. They also had guava juice which I think should be a minimum requirement for any upper range hotel in a tropical climate. Generally the staff we were very hospitable and service minded. I loved the long beach front and the large space between the different building blocks. This made the hotel seem much more spacious and less full though the ongoing renovation of a whole building block of course also helped with this. Compared to the Sofitel where we went for Sunday brunch the Conrad seemed much nicer and lees crowded. The same goes for most of the hotels we passed when walking along the beach. For example the Westin Melia and Laguna all seemed to have a quite compressed beach front with too many people. I would recommend this hotel if you need somewhere to relax.", "offset": [292, 406], "date": "2020-02-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
