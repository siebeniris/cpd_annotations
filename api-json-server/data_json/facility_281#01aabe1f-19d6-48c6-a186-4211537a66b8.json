The place was clean and the grounds were beautiful but I was very disappointed with the customer service. When our keys did not work one day I was made to feel like it was my fault and did not get a smile or acknowledgement any time that I went into the lobby after our initial check in.

We booked two nights at this WorldMark timeshare before moving to the Sheraton Vistana Resort for a weeks staythere is no comparison between the two resorts as the Vistana is far superior in amenities facilities activities unit size and layout. Of the 49 WM resorts we have been to this falls in the lower quarter of said resorts. Apparently it was a hotel operation before being purchased by Trendwest WorldMark a few years ago. Our two bedroom unit was supposed to have a King bed in the Master bedroom but instead it had two Queen beds. The King bed was in the much smaller guest bedroom. That is an unusual set up. The unit was Ok as far as function but the kitchen was smaller than most with cabinents situated such that a person of short stature would have difficulty accessing the china and glasses. No washer and dryer in the unit but available on site. On site facilities consisted of two pools a kidie pool and a hot tub next to the reception building housing check in a timeshare sales desk lounge area game room and room with two computers with internet access and a printer. On site internet is available for a fee. A very small fitness room is also housed in the reception building. There were no on site activities put on by the resort. The location is such that a car is necessary as grocery stores etc are distant from the resort. The most positive feature about this resort was the bed being comfortable to sleep in. would not return as there are many other resorts in the area offering nicer facilities and features than those at Kingstown Reef.", "offset": [1501, 1630], "date": "2015-04-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "5a7bb1d4-7150-4765-991f-63bd7ed80cf8", "sentence": "More than I expected.

We recently rented a 2 bedroom condo via our vacation club. The grounds could use some work the landscape around the building was lacking and looked like no one had taken the time to do anything with it and the buildings could use a bit of a facelift walkways need swept floors needed mopped and the stucco was cracked chipping in multiple places. While we were there some sort of liquid was draining out from under the door of the mechanical room for the elevator. Rather than cleaning it up they just put wet floor signs around it. We used the pools. They were ok but there were quite a lot of bugs in them. The splash fountain is quite loud and it and the music from the pool area could be heard in our room. The rooms themselves were nice. One room had two queen beds a mini kitchen table and chairs small television and a bathroom with a shower. The other room held a full living room full size television full kitchen with cookware a dining table and chairs a breakfast counter with barstols a king size bed and a full bath. It was clean and nicely arranged. Both rooms were clean and sufficient for staying a few days. The balconies of both rooms had plastic chairs that were not overly clean. Smoking is allowed on the balconies so we were unable to enjoy ours because a neighbor was enjoying a cigar on theirs. We reserved our room for 7 days but only used it for part of the time. Somehow our reservation in the system we used and their system did not match resulting in being charged for housekeeping fees almost 64. A phone call and having to speak to manager got that straightened out and our money returned. Be aware that they will hold 100 on your card for potential fees when you check in. Internet is NOT included unles you are blessed with code and can not be deducted from your 100. It is very pricey and did not work well. Parking is limited in front of the building and it was not busy when we were there. I can not imagine what it would be like if it were.

I stayed here with a friend who has a timeshare for my first visit to Walt Disney World. We are big Disney fans and go to Disneyland regularly. If you have been to Disneyland and stayed at a nearby hotel you had know that there is a cheap reliable transportation option that takes you to and from the parks every 15 minutes or so. This is not the case in Orlando. The week of our trip I realized there was no transportation options to and from our hotel besides a renting a car b taxi c Mears Shuttles or d uber lyft. On top of that everything in Orlando seems to be much more spread out than in Anaheim. Even the Disney property is spread over 29 square miles according to our airport shuttle driver. The room itself was amazing. Spacious full kitchen stocked with anything you could possibly need to cook two bedrooms full living room with a pull out sofa bed three TVs and two bathrooms. I believe parking is complementary. One major downfall is there are no food options within walking distance and they do not offer an airport shuttle. My suggestions for anyone staying here1 rent a car if you are staying here you are most likely here with your family and will need transportation to local attractions. Everything is a 15 20 minute drive away so do not plan on finding a place to eat near by. 2 Stop at the grocery store that is two blocks away if not for food then at least drinks. There are vending machines in the lobby but if you get thirsty after a long day at the park and the lobby is closed you will be sol 3. If you are planning on hitting up the Disney parks give yourself PLENTY of time to get there. We like to be the first people there so we left at around 8 am every day. It takes about 10 minutes to get on property and another 5 to get to the park depending on what park you plan on going to. Give yourself even more time if you are going to Magic Kingdom because you will have to park take a tram to the monorail and ride either the monorail or boat to the park. Do not fret if both lines look long the boat fits more people so I had go with that one 4. if you are NOT there with a large family using uber or lyft would be cheapest easiest. Mears will run 12 a day per person and you have to schedule specific pick up times. My friend and I used uber and we were able to come and go as we pleased and split the fairs. Plus if you never used uber before you will most likely get 15 off your first ride so basically you first ride is free. This resort is pretty much smack dab between Universal Disney we went to both so it is a central location but if you plan on spending most of your time at Disney I would go with one of the resorts on the Disney property.", "offset": [1444, 1578], "date": "2016-03-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "af208a64-3b96-4f1d-b83b-644da673dc69", "sentence": "Safe clean comfortable relaxing but.
