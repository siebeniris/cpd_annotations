I was here on a business trip for three nights 729 81 2015. I will list the good and the bad. Unfortunately the bads outweigh the goods. The good The property is attractive and the staff are very nice. The room was comfortable and reasonably clean. There is plenty of free parking in the hotels lot. Wifi is free despite what other reviewers say. Just click complimentary web access when logging on. The hotel is very close to many restaurants stores businesses as well as convenient to I4The bad I will start with the most recent situation. I paid extra for a room on the seventh floor. one of the two the executive level floors. It was fine for the first two days. Business people would gather for complimentary continental breakfast in the mornings and snacks beverages in the early evening. It was nice and quiet. However today Friday a large group of people checked in for a family reunion. They parked themselves in the executive lounge and proceeded to camp out for hours. They were talking very loudly and children were running up and down the halls and dancing. I spoke to two front desk agents as well as the manager on duty. The MOD did come up and ask them to keep the noise down. It helped a little but as of this moment I am writing this from my room. they are still down there making enough noise to disturb other guests. I can not help but wonder if they all purchased rooms on the executive levels or if someone sneaked them up with their room key card which you need to access this floor Makes me wonder why I spent extra when it sounds like a public park down the hall. Oh and they conveniently cleaned out the little fridge full of water sodas for executive level guests leaving none for the rest of us. Moving on. Food and beverage was poor for the price paid. I did not go to the restaurant but I did order room service twice. The first night I ordered a simple green salad and fish chips. The salad was indeed simple something like I make at home. Nothing special at all. The fish was OK but could have stayed in the fryer for a few more minutes because they were a little soggy inside. A very small handful of fries were thrown on the plate and were understandably cold when they arrived. They also did not send up ketchup or any other condiments. Two plates thrown on a tray of mediocre food and the bill was over 320. Wow. I took another chance last night and ordered the Harvest Panini a hot veggie sandwich. It was better and was served with cold sweet potato fries. I also ordered the Shrimp Bisque. It actually cost more than the sandwich 90 but was not worth that price. The bowl was small and the bisque itself was OK but marred by the five shrimp that were tossed in there. They were obviously previously frozen because they were mealy and flavorless. Needless to say I ate out tonight. By the way the room service waiters doubling as restaurant employees were both very nice and the food came relatively quickly. it is not their fault that the food was lousy. The snacks in the executive lounge were OK except for the chili that seemed like it was made weeks ago too thick and greasy tasting and fried calamari that was in a covered chafing dish thus rendering it limp and soggy. But since that stuff was free I guess I should not complain. The room 746 was pretty spacious and comfortable. The furniture has seen better days and is showing signs of excessive wear tear the room door was also beaten up. The bathroom was ridiculously small. In order to use the toilet I had to close the door to even sit down. I was travelling alone so there was no need to close the door. But I did anyway because I was forced to do so. I had a mini fridge and a cofemaker nice to have. The TV was a decent sized flat screen. The TV menu and the remote were kind of a pain in the butt to operate and the channels were not always what the guide said they were. Oh housekeeping came very late each afternoon. Yesterday they were not even on my floor yet when I returned to the room at about 2 PM. Today they came around 3 PM. Since I was already in the room I simply traded in some towels had them empty the trash and got some extra soap. Late afternoon is far too late for the room to be cleaned. I guess it sounds like I was displeased with this hotel. That really is not the case. I just know now never to book the executive floor again on weekends anyway. it is just not worth the extra. I also know to plan on eating out for all my meals. With that knowledge I could probably have a better stay in the future.", "offset": [3718, 3756], "date": "2015-07-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "da6497cc-8b0e-4ba5-8595-ad4a7df30905", "sentence": "The hotel was beautiful and the room where the wedding reception reception was absolutely gorgeous and the waitstaf was wonderful.

Restaurant bar is excellent and the food is amazingly good. Staff was pleasant and welcoming and very down to earth. The hotel was easy to get to and there was plenty of parking. The two things that made it not so perfect all my co workers were offered a room on the executive floors but I was not. and that is ok but it made no sense to me since we are all at the same Honors level. It would have been very nice to have coffee for the horrendous drive on I4 each morning since I was on the road by 630 even before the coffee shop opened. In retrospect and now knowing about the noise from I4 at night I should have asked for a room facing the other side.", "offset": [0, 60], "date": "2020-01-30", "cpt": "3", "category": "room"}, {"id": 35, "uid": "f9f7ce97-e451-4463-a9e2-0e689a9f35d5", "sentence": "Great weekend.
