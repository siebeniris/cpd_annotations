OK this is one of the top hotels in the world and you get what you pay for. But there is no stuffiness here just a genuine warm welcome and wonderful service from all of the hotel staff. Unlike other establishments where my wife and I have stayed where you get made to feel that you are in the way and an inconvenience to the running of the hotel. Its not the prettiest building I have ever stayed in but the location on the waterfront in Kowlon is incomparable. We booked a room with a view over the water to the Island it is the most enchanting view ever. We loved it. The hotel will probably be going through some updating and refurbishment over the next year or so. Lets hope its charm does not disappear out of the door during the refit. But as ever its the people that make a hotel never the building. Its the most important part of any stay and I judge the hotel almost totally on that point. So mentioned in dispatches are Nirmala who was our own butler and looked after our room through most of our stay. What a super girl. Nothing was to much trouble for her and the quality of the housekeeping was first class. I hope that she goes far in the hotel world. Then Tony at Breakfast always a smile and very attentive service without being over the top. We had nothing but praise for the front door team knowledgeable and efficient. Front reception were always flat out busy but very helpful when spoken to. The concierge were very willing to assist in any matter and must be congratulated on their professionalism. We met several of the senior management team including the GM who poor man had to put up with a typhoon battering his hotel. All the problems caused by the typhoon were dealt with very seamlesly under his leadership well done. So what more can I add. If you want to stay in a superb hotel in one of the worlds great cities you really ca nt go wrong here.

Congrats GM Pedersen Tip for guests at the end. This year we decided to celebrate New Years Eve in Hong Kong and made plans way in advance to stay at the Intercontinental which sits right on the Harbor. I reached out to GM Pedersen way in advance and you can always tell when a Hotel is outstanding regardless that Conde Nast has it as a top 10 when a busy GM takes the time to respond to all of your requests. Located on the Kowlon side right on the Harbor if you can not pay for the upgrade to a room overlooking the Harbor opt for their Dinners and you get the most amazing view of the fireworks from the various boats on the River. We picked the Harborside restaurant which has a courtyard right outside for an incredible view. The buffet was simply awesome party hats provided and very attentive service throughout. It was a wonderful evening with access to the Lobby Lounge where a live band rocked all evening. The Property is within walking distance to the Golden Mile with close access to the subway. Restaurants all over with convenient access. Taxis all know the Hotel and it \u2019s very safe walking around late at night. As an Ambassador we were upgraded to a premier room which was very comfortable. Now to what makes the Hotel stand out. and it \u2019s a tribute to the GMs leadership and it \u2019s the Concierge Staff who are simply amazing. All of them under Chief Concierge Luis there is nothing they can not do from finding a power cord for a Dell at short notice to taking care of tours making reservations and giving lots of tips. All are great with special kudos to Andy who spent hours with me on the phone and e mail. Giving great advice and taking care of all requests. Wilson. Making sure we got on our tours on time as well as providing advice. Tiffany. Always there smiling and providing precise directions so my wife did not have to climb stairs at any of the subway stops. Vanessa. Very helpful throughoutPS I gave a small token of my appreciation to each of the 4 for really first class service. A shout out to Joyce in Guest relations and Joyce in Dining Services. Ivy Patrick Calvin are others who deserve mention. There was someone in the Lobby Restaurant Bar which has a great view who did not live up to expectations and I provided her information to the GMOne of the nicest surprises was the handy phone provided as a courtesy which provides a Wi Fi hot spot anywhere on the island as well as the ability to make international calls. We used is all the time. Asia is so ahead of the US with wireless technology. A tip for guests not on a meal plan or access to the Lounge who just want something quick early in the morning before a tour. The Hotel has complementary coffee as well as some Danish early in the morning up to 7 am. if you have to buy it later 25 US at least. Thanks Wilson for letting us know. Celebrating a special occasion GM Pedersen was kind to send up a special welcome for us. Very kind. Asian Hotels typically provide among the best service worldwide and this Property with GM Pedersen delivers.

The Intercontinental is located in Kowlon directly opposite Admiralty on Hong Kong island. It has an unrivalled view of the harbour and the city lights at night. The East Tsim Sha Shui MTR station is right next to the hotel.

Shopping at Nathan Road Canton Road and Harbour City are within easy walking distance. View book a harbour view room.

The panorama windows stretch the whole length of the suite though the morning sun can make it a bit hot on the days when the sun does deign to apearThe Club. a quiet oasis on the 2nd Floor. Breakfast is very good with a choice of Western and Asian food. Try the Chinese or Japanese dishes which tend to be better. The eggs benedict had a tad too much vinegar for my taste. Carnivores may like the breakfast steak. do not eat the corned beef hash very salty not like anything I have tasted in the USTea and dinner are also served. Light eaters might fill up at dinner snacking on the various offerings. The smoked salmon was excellent. Not so good points. Though generally the service was very good there were some odd lapses. The Hotel kindly provided a cake for my wifes birthday good but Housekeeping cleared it away before we had a chance to finish it bad. We had been saving it for the last night. The Duty Manager Mr Hong was very apologetic and even offered to send up a replacement but it was quite late at night when we got back and we were not inclined to stay up to wait for it. The point is that they should have asked before taking it away. The cake was still covered on its cake stand and hardly touched. Addressing by first names. Whatever the custom may be in the US Australia and increasingly nowadays in the UK it was odd and off putting that my wife and I should be called by our first names in a Chinese city. My generation was brought up to address guests and older persons respectfully. If the conversation had been conducted in Cantonese Mandarin Indonesian Korean or Japanese this would have been the case. Just because a guest speaks English it does not mean that he has adopted Western ways wholesale. This kind of inappropriate over familiarity comes across as disrespectful. Far from making a guest feel welcome it is uncomfortable and disconcerting. The most serious lapse was that the Finance Department thought fit to charge my credit card with HKD150 without even the courtesy of asking. I was alerted to this by my bank. With commercial fraud so rampant an unauthorised charge will raise red flags. Again I am surprised that this should have been done. Assistant Manager Hong did apologise but it nonetheless was something that should not have been done without first informing the guest. On balance should one stay. Answer assuming that the lapses are rectified yes. The hotel will be re branded to Regent in 2020 or 2021.

What is to be said about this really good hotel. I am no stranger to Intercontinental hotels but had not stayed to this one prior to this occasion. We stayed here for 3 nights on the way back to Melbourne from Europe and we picked this hotel with a harbour view room because my wife had not visited Hong Kong so I thought it would have been fitting to have such a great position overlooking Hong Kong island. And it proved to be a very successful choice. The view was amazing the room immaculate the bed was fantastic as the quality of the sleep. The service promptness and mannerism of the hotel staff was fantastic and they exceeded our expectations in helping out with a couple of requests we had. This also considering that we stayed there during the Mid Autumn festival with the hotel packed due to the public holiday. The location of the hotel is rather great which of course helps in making things a better memory of a short but yet really pleasant stay. In terms of food the breakfast was very comprehensive with a generous offering of varieties and of really good quality. We did also try the room service and once again the quality temperature and size of the meals was as excellent. Despite the trail of mess and some damage left by typhoon Mangkhut around Hong Kong just a week earlier than our arrival the hotel as pretty much most of all things in town was clean and working in perfect order which is one more credit to the efficiency and professionalism of the team.
