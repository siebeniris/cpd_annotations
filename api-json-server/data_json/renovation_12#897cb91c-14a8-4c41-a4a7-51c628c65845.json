I stayed at the Milenium Mayfair during a few days of business visit to London and found it suitable for this type of visit for a few reasons mainly its key location in the heart of such a wonderful neighborhood as Mayfair grants east access to all the good things London can offer within walking distance or within underground station reach. The hotel is practically 2 minutes from Selfridges which gives it a few extra points to begin with. Additionally the hotels services are really great the breakfast is generous in all terms of variety and cleanliness the reception staff is friendly and helpful and the room service is doing a great job in maintenance. I must also add that the hotels additional services were very good washing and ironing services made in a snap and prepared a set of dress shirts and a suit to a great condition after long haul travel refreshing. and room service was in great level and even alas tasty. The hotels bar is a place one would enjoy even if not actually sleeping over. Last thing is about the hotels decoration always an important factor for myself and particularly in a city like London here it is presented in full glory of the citys Victorian design legacy. It is very well preserved and I believe visitors are enjoying a genuine 360 degrees scenery of the citys old days. This does not come without a few minor faults elevator not the quickest textiles in the room such as curtains and bed covers could be refreshed more often. but these honestly do not interfere with the experience. Would return to this hotel even for a longer stay perhaps in a private vacation as well.", "offset": [1346, 1501], "date": "2015-12-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "7227f31d-db28-4ac8-ae18-25c049b8ad51", "sentence": "Millennium Hotel London Mayfair.

I stayed 2 nights on a business trip. I had booked a club room with access to the club lounge. Upon arrival I was greeted nicely the receptionist told she is giving me a nice room with a view.

The club lounge was also old however service was excellent while snacks variety was limited correct. The breakfast was normal nothing extra. The next morning was surprised that the club lounge was closed as they suddenly decided to start renovating the 7th floor. They kept promising to open in another place All day.

I reported that to the Holton. Com and at least I was rewarded with some points to be added withing my membership.
