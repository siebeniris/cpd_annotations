Then the next morning keep in mind it was a Sunday morning there was all sorts of construction noises. I think Sunday should definatley be a day to not disturb your guests. It woke us up. And the Wifi was not very good either. The person who accompanied me had some work to do that he could not complete due to the wifi not working well.

We made a last minute decision to spend 2 nights at this hotel over the weekend and are more disappointed than not. First the god Location is convenient to all the main bars and bands. just a few blocks. We like walking so we do not need to be 1 block away Room is clean and comfortable. Nice big quality TV. Good space for our King room. FYI I am a Hilton Honors member and stay at Hilton properties more than any other brand. However not all was as promised do not list self park as a hotel feature when this really means park on the street or a local ramp which is unaffiliated with the hotel and has no discount or in out feature. do not list Complimentary Bottled Water on the Hotelscom description when it is not true. The bottled water in our room has a 4 price tag on the cap. Fortunately we brought up a few warms sodas to drink. Bad news there the ice machine on our floor is broken. The shower is truly bizarre. You have to step up about 6 inches to a flat shower floor no tub and the shower head is below my chin. I am 6 2. so I am used to a little bending over in some hotels but nothing this severe. and it is not a room for physically challenged people. Upon check in we learned that construction was underway and we need to be prepared for loud noises during the day. Not an issue for us so far but this should be clearly communicated when people are spending 250night for a hotel. Finally upon check in with our King Room reservation it was clear things were nearly full as they spent a fair amount of time finding us a room. After carrying all our stuff to the room we walked in to a very small double bed at best. We had to hike all the way back to the front desk and it took about 10 minutes to get us into a proper room. There was nobody else at the desk so no reason for this. The guy at the desk challenged my wife wondering if she was sure it was not a king bed. It was not even close. If this is how you treat your H guests I guess I would be very concerned about booking a room here if I did not have any status. I hope our second night experience is better than the first.", "offset": [2070, 2130], "date": "2015-03-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "8899446f-69a4-4cec-ac38-b57a415a4936", "sentence": "Great Location. My experience with the hotel was lackluster. The best part was the location. The hotel is undergoing renovations which I was not aware of when booking. You must walk a little distance from the parking drop off area to get to the makeshift check in counter. The real problem was the noise. Loud drilling and construction started at 8 am and sounded as if it was right outside my door. Later in the day I had a meeting in one of the conference rooms which was also interrupted by the construction. I could not recommend the room service breakfast either. Very average for a 30 omelette and coffee. They forgot the toast but did deliver it upon a phone call. The front desk staff was helpful and kind.

In spite of the renovation rooms smell musty. my room and 2 of my co workers experienced the same odor issue tubs do not drain well prepare to be standing in inches of water by the time you finish a short shower and the exterior of the windows are filthy. My room even though recently renovated was not exceptionally clean either. it is obviously been a long time since someone thoroughly vacuumed lots of dirt on the floor near the back of the desk area and my room was not vacuumed at all during my 3day stay. Internet connectivity is horrible throughout the hotel guest rooms and common areas and drops on a regular basis.
