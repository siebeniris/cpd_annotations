They do not have a spa. It is more of city business location so let us assume people are visiting relaxation amenities. The rooms are fine average for a high end hotel but nothing stunning. The event space is very disjointed. There are some rooms on the second floor which is easily accessible from the main event space. The main event space connects to the parking area and something else like a shopping area maybe. so random people are always wandering through. The location is actually really convenient. it is 20 30 minutes from the airport and the Buckhead neighborhood is super cute. The biggest frustration is the bar cafe staff and the kitchen. They are borderline incompetent. I have visited the Buckhead 8 times maybe more and eaten at the cafe well over a dozen every time the service and food is crap. They are extremely slow. It often takes 5 10 minutes before they even acknowledge you and the slowness just keeps going from there. When you finally get your food it is either wrong or badly prepared 70 of the time. There is often a gratuitous use of truffle oil. it is just so frustrating to eat there. The banquet food on the other hand is excellent.", "offset": [429, 525], "date": "2015-05-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b78c79dc-1b87-4702-82e5-47349cb3283d", "sentence": "Great stay for business. I attended a 2 day conference and stayed here. It is a lovely hotel but if you are looking for amenities that you find at other Ritz Carltons you will not find them here. The sheets were not very soft and the bed was not like the Ritz Carlton in Cleveland. I did not bring slippers because I thought that they would be provided. They were not in the room however when I asked for them they were delivered to my door. The cleaning staff was excellent. The food at the conference was over the top delicious and the variety was amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel for business travel. There are many restaurants around and it is walking distance to Olympic Park Coca Cola CN and the aquarium. The concierge steered us in the right direction for dinners. There is no pool or spa but there is a gym and steam room in the locker rooms. No car is needed as you can walk everywhere and it is quite safe.", "offset": [616, 723], "date": "2015-09-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "59eb44dd-79fa-4e68-849e-346915a04d7d", "sentence": "Always great. The Ritz Carlton Buckhead Atlanta is just as one would expect from a time tested upscale hotel name such as Ritz. Rooms are VERY clean and comfortable. The room attendants are very quiet respectful when cleaning along with most of the staff. Located directly across the street from Lenox Mall and within walking distance to another nice mall eating and finding things to pass the time should not be an issue. Oversize overflow parking is available across the road in Phips Parking and can even accommodate tour buses tractor trailers. The staff is always most helpful. Dinning in the lobby lounge was great. A live band musician was performing most days and the restaurant bar could not have been better. Food was perfect. I really can not say anything other than wonderful things about this property.

What better way to celebrate a girlfriends engagement than high tea at the Ritz. Damon was our server and he was superb. You are always treated like royalty at the Ritz and just going for tea is no exception. A bonus was on our way out we were able to watch the entire Saints football team come in. I would highly recommend the tea for a special girly event or just take your mom for a treat. They also offer complimentary valet and validate your parking ticket. It could use a little refresh. They should still keep it the style they have it but the d\u00e9cor and furniture is looking a little tired and there were some water stains on the ceiling in the area we were eating and the bathroom smelled a little musty. that is why I am giving it only a very good rating.", "offset": [416, 485], "date": "2016-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "7ca1cb78-1c97-4a7e-831a-d21623c06393", "sentence": "Wonderful Wedding Weekend.

In town for a quick overnight to see concert at Chastain Park. Morgan immediately set the tone by securing a room upgrade through my AmEx Fine Hotels and Resorts program which lately never seems to happen.

I always know Elena will leave a wonderful assortment of chocolates in my room if I miss the evenings reception. Keep up the excellent work ladies. As I always stay on Club the current construction did not affect me but I was very disappointed to hear the fireplace in the Lobby Lounge is not being preserved.

It had been a while since we had been to the Ritz at Buckhead so I decided to stay here for a couple of days to celebrate my wifes birthday in Atlanta. The first thing you should love about this location is that it is a short walk from Lenox Square Mall Lenox Marketplace and Phips Plaza. Just leave your car parked cross the road in any direction and in five minutes you are knee deep in enough shopping opportunities to satisfy most people. From Neiman Marcus to Target you are cover. We drove over to Canoe for dinner but we certainly had dozens of options right outside our door for dinner. Enough for locationlet us talk about service. It was classic Ritz Carlton. Ritz service is as consistent as it gets. Even with our 10 am arrival we were taken care of personally. When we drove up a bell attendant emerged looking as alert as he might at 1 pm. He passed our bags to an attendant inside who showed us to our room and rapidly took care of a couple of items we forgot. On the next day we had a house keeping issue and the house keeping supervisor visited immediately inspected the issue sent staff to resolve the issue and promptly followed up. He also without prompting made an effort to make it right and offer a bit of compensation for our inconvenience. Exactly the right thing to do but unfortunately some other properties would not have done that. It is obvious that the Ritz organization focuses on a culture that is customer centric and focused on excellent leadership. Just a quick side note I personally enjoyed the snacks on the lobby table in the afternoon. Coated pretzels malted milk balls and several other treats. Delicious. Anyway. The rooms are nice albeit a bit dated. I should note that dated in the Ritz Carlton sense is much like visiting the home of a wealthy aristocrat perhaps the furniture is a little older but it is classy well appointed and build with great materials. At the Ritz marble is plentiful the furniture is solid and the bed was magnificently comfortable. The shower was outstanding as well with a giant head 2nd hand head head great flow and strong pressure in a clean glass enclosed stand up shower. The greatest indicator of age was the color pallet and the carpet. You can see that the colors in the carpet as not as vivid as they once were. Overall this is a strong property. There are others that are a touch more modern but you could consider carefully. We purchased a package that included our room valet parking and breakfast.
