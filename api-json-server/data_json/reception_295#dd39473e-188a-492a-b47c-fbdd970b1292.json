The Paradisus is a large all inclusive hotel in the middle of the hotel zone. The main section of the hotel has a relaxing tropical vibe. The hotel reminds me of the Hyat on Maui or the Mariot in Palm Desert. The truly exceptional aspect of the hotel was the Royal section. The best way to describe this is that it is a hotel inside of a hotel. The Royal is an adult \u2019s only tower that is on the far end of the hotel away from all the general commotion. In our lobby we had a system of fish ponds that were surrounded by wood floors with tables and chairs. There were plants and flowers for a tropical feel to the lobby. The lobby was great for snacks and cocktails from our private bar and buffet. The bar had premium liquor and above average wine. The bar tender made fresh cocktails without using sugary mixes. It was the only place to get a really good margarita in the whole hotel. They also had an espresso bar. The buffet was excellent. They served breakfast and then heavy snacks the rest of the day. There was always fresh fruit smoked salmon raw tuna caviar smoked meats and a variety of cheeses to choose from. In the morning there were more breakfast items and in the afternoon there were pastries and deserts. We had personal butler service which we did not really use. We also had access to our own concierge desk and check out. The Royal section also comes with a pool that is designated only for the Royal guests. We did not spend much time in the pool because we prefer to be on the beach and in the ocean but it seemed to be relaxing without the obnoxious MC trying to coerce the guest into playing games. Near the pool there was also our own restaurant and bar. We also had a portion of the beach that was sectioned off for just the Royal guests. We had waiters that took care of all our food and drink needs at the beach. The service was quick and friendly. The food from the outdoor restaurant was pretty good. The fish they served were Mahi Mahi and grouper. They prepare it fileted as ceviche or in a sandwich. They also served wraps chip and guacamole etc. I am snobby when it comes to good food not necessarily fancy food but high quality food and Paradisus was above average especially for an all inclusive. We ate at three places in the main section of the hotel. The Japanese restaurant and the Spanish restaurant are good enough that I would have eaten at either one of them a second time. The buffet was not that great. The liquor in the main part of the hotel was average quality which is what I would expect from an all inclusive. The beer was not very good. Dos XX was the premium beer. Negra Modelo wan not even an option also there were no imports to speak of. The one thing that the hotel was lacking was water sports. It would have been nice if they offered Hobie Cats paddle boards or kayaks for the guests to use. Overall my wife and I had a very relaxing time at the Paradisus. I would go back in a heartbeat for a getaway without kids or a couple \u2019s vacation.", "offset": [1311, 1370], "date": "2015-09-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b0356565-299b-4093-a12a-f184624d0b25", "sentence": "Exceeded expectations.

Always a smile and a pleasant conversation and a willingness to make sure that we had everything we needed. The entertainment was pretty good with the two shows that we saw a circus type show and the Michael Jackson Review showed that there was lots of local talent ready to entertain their guests. The only negative comment had to do with the food near the end of the week. On one particular day the buffet seemed to be running short of food. Either not enough was prepared or there was more traffic than could be handled. In any event the pickings were getting slim.

This is our 4th time vacationing in Cancun in the last 4 years. The first time we stayed at Fiesta Americana the last two times at Nizuk in Moon Palace and this is our first time staying at Paradisus. Tips for newcomers is when you get off the airport avoid talking with anyone and go straight out the door so you will not be distracted by the tour guides. Our transportation to the hotel from the airport was USA Transfer a very safe and decent pricing transportation we have used for the past four years. We stayed 5 nights 6 days in the 4th pyramid in two rooms with two twin beds with an ocean view in the beginning of July. We love to visit Cancun because my family and I love the beach and the service all inclusive hotel. So if you love the beach and the absence of burdens of finding restaurants shops and paying the money every time. All inclusive is for you. This hotel is by far our favorite. The hotel itself is beautifully structured spacious air conditioned and the interior is absolutely breathtaking. Our rooms were very clean. We had the ocean view and it was truly amazing. The view was unbelievable the ocean was so blue and the view was almost too good to be true. The beach was so clean with few to little seaweed the best beach we have seen at a hotel. The waves were not as rough as the ones we experienced at Moon Palace. Also despite how crowded the beach would usually be in the summer there would always be open beach chairs and the beach was too crowded. Some restaurants need to be reserved beforehand I suggest calling the restaurants two nights before or the first night you are staying and just reserve the restaurants beforehand for your entire trip. the restaurants are actually not that crowded so when we were hungry before our reservation time by about an hr we just went and they sat us down. We recommend visiting every restaurant that requires reservation because the food was wonderful. Our waiters were exceptional and gave us the best service especially Roberto from Mole Bluegrass Leobardo from Vento Pablo from Naos and a fellow from Bana in the picture that we did not get the name of Bana was our favorite the food was delicious. We spent most of our time at the hotel just swimming at the pool and beaches and eating a lot. The service was exceptional from the beach to the restaurants every worker was so kind and helpful. We noticed though that the staff is a little weak at english but they can communicate with us. This is hotel is very family oriented and majority of the guest were families. Though the hotel was almost all booked you would not notice how crowded it was because the hotel is so big. It really did not seem crowded at all. This is why we love all inclusive. The hotel had so much entertainment from live music on the beach yoga volleyball and more many times a day. We look forward to every night because the shows were amazing. Especially the ones at the Red Lounge. The shows were not amateur but very professional and engaging a packed audience every time. The shows were live bands impersonations dancing light shows. All wonderful. We also spent one day to Isla Mujeres which was okay. It takes up the whole day. And honestly was not as fun as we expected. We had to take a boat to the island and the boat ride was fun and great however the island itself was okay. The beaches were very dirty and we could not swim the shops were overpriced and we bought 3 shot glasses for 15 when we could have bought it at the hotel a set of 2 shot glass and tequila for 10. Overall the hotel exceeded our expectations and it was the best Cancun trip we had. We will definitely go back there next year.

We highly recommend this place if you are a family. Besides the facility being located in the MOST beautiful place the pool the beaches are THE MOST beautiful ones i have ever seen. This facility is VERY VERY kid friendly always making sure our daughter was happy and the staff were always asking if she wanted to do things. There were 2 people that made our trip unforgettable and we have remained friends with them after the trip. Fernanda was AMAZING. She was one of 2 butlers that came with our service and she was AMAZING. The Cabana at the pool was amazing. The best person we had was Alejandro. He along with Victor Jorge and Didier made this trip the best. The entire staff was friendly and wonderful. The food was wonderful and the staff was always friendly. I recommend the butler service and ask for Fernanda. We also recommend the Cabana service by the pool ask for Alejandro and if i were to have any negatives it was that i was not prepared for the size of the hotel along with the openness it was warm. I did not feel AC in some places but at dinner i was always comfortable. The staff the food and the beautiful nature of the facility made up for the lack of AC in my opinion. I just needed to acclimate to the temperature. Our room had Great AC so we were always comfortable. This place is really very beautiful.

Our family of four we have 2 boys ages 5 and 9 years old spent 7 nights at this property on August 21. The best part of the resort for us is the people who work there. They work so hard to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. They are friendly and work very hard. The hotel itself is beautiful but its outdated. They need to do major DEEP maintenance work. We had to switch rooms after night 2 because water kept coming from the ceiling as you entered the bathroom. One of the times I almost slipped because we were coming into the room and did not know there was water all over the floor. At that point we requested a room change and the hotel responded efficiently. We did the Family Concierge Service and our concierges Maria and Gloria were great. They were constantly checking on us making sure everything was going smoothly. They took care of dinner reservations for us and even helped us move our bags when we had to switch rooms. They regularly left little surprises toys bathtub ready and decorated with fun balloons etc for the kids in our room. Family Concierge has a lounge for those who have the service. They have a pool table wi snacks coffee drinks etc. It is a good place to go hang out with the kidos at anytime. They need to perhaps get some new pool balls and new sticks as well. But the lounge is beautiful and they constantly replenish the snacks. The Family Concierge upgrade is the way to go if you are traveling with kids. The food at the resort was great overall. Naos is the buffet restaurante and breakfast is great. Thank you to Cristhian L Pascual Martin for superb service as waiters. By the second morning they remembered us and would make my coffee exactly how I like it bring fresh juices to the table for the kids and for myself and were so so so polite fun and attentive. Our kids were sad to say good bye to them on our last day. The pool area of the resort is nice but there was some construction going on. We did not mind but I think they should let guests know ahead of time before booking a reservation there. The bali beds by the pools and beach are for rent and they are 130150 or so PER DAY. It is ridiculous. We ended up renting one by the pool the day before we left. The fee includes lobsters with shrimp or a bottle of champagne. We chose the lobster and let me tell you. IT WAS AMAZING. They bring you soon much food. We felt that it was our treat and well worth it. We had three attendants taking care of us Victor Veronica and Nurby and they treated us like kings and queens. The resort restaurants that require reservation are good for the most part. We absolutely loved Fuego and Mole. The sushi restaurant was good too try the house sushi it was super yummy. But the other restaurants were just okay. We had fun at this place. The beach is gorgeous but a bit strong. I would probably would want to try another Paradisus before returning to this one but would definitely recommend it if its your first time AND find a good deal.

We had a last minute call for a reservation in a restaurant my moyordomo knew about my food allergies and he made a reservation on a restaurant that was not for me at all.

Playa del Carmens service was completely different this is why I am giving a low rate to this location. Plus when I arrived to the hotel our room had old towels by the balcony doors the towels had MOLD. Day care was good but the rooms smell was away too strong because the hardwood floor was new.

Just missed out on 4 stars. A lovely hotel but needs updating think website and travel agency \u2019s are a bit misleading on this. To begin with we had a nice bedroom located in the 4th tower. Room was nice bit dated. A couple of days into the trip the aircon unit started to leak \u2013 it got considerably worse as the day went on until there was a mini swimming pool by the door. We also had a lot of water coming in through the balcony doors due to the rain. We complained and asked to move rooms. This was sorted and we were moved to a room in the 3rd tower. This room was better and was more modern. However after a couple more days in this hotel they started doing building work above us \u2013 which started really early in morning and went on until the early evening. Once again we complained but nothing was really done about this issue and in the end just decided to get on and enjoy our holiday. We found it really strange that they moved us to a room which they knew would be disrupted by the building work \u2013 not very good customer service. Tip \u2013 if you are planning on staying here the rooms in 2nd and 3rd tower are not very quiet as they are above all the bars. Food. Overall the food is good and does well for mass catering. Couple of places to stay clear ofBlue Algarve \u2013 food had absolutely no flavour. Vento \u2013 again really really bland food Enso \u2013 hit and miss \u2013 some dishes are ok and some again need flavour. The rest of the restaurants are great including the buffet. Tip \u2013 on arrival they say you can book restaurants 1 day in advance this is a lie you can book up to 23 days in advance so do n\u2019t get caught out. Reservations go quickly as not every restaurant is open every night. Swimming pools are excellent. There is an adults only royal service one a quieter pool the main pool which includes a swim up bar and music and the kids pool which connects to the main pool. There are a lot of beds round the pools \u2013 the beds round the main pool are usually all gone by mid morning but people come and go throughout the day. There is a serious lack of umbrellas. Cabanas are available to hire they are part of COCOs beach club. The beach is lovely and there are staff on hand to serve drinks. Entertainment \u2013 hardly any of the activities that they advertised on the daily board actually happen \u2026 Evening entertainment is what you expect from a hotel. There were a couple of nights where the entertainment is exceeded expectations. Vibe \u2013 there is a real mix of dynamics at this hotel couples families stag and hen groups wedding groups. Staff \u2013 really friendly and mainly very helpful. Overall this was a good hotel. I believe they should have done more to compensate for the room problems but we could not be bothered to spend our holiday in reception complaining.

Alex and I just got back from the beautiful and sunny Cancun. Getting away from the snowy DC was sensational. We stayed at the Paradisus all inclusive. We chose this hotel because it was gorgeous online and had plenty of restaurant options. Being foodies we also chose it for Tempo a restaurant operated by a chef holding eight Michelin stars. Here are the pros and cons of our trip. Pros 1. Aesthetically gorgeous hotel. The greenery flowers and koi in the ponds all around the resort are exquisite. The layout is beautiful and it \u2019s right on the water. Looks just like the pictures online. 2. Staff is so attentive and nice. While being there we learned about countless servers bartenders staffs families where they are from and their way of life. There are plenty of people to help you out or just get you a drink. Every meal we had we had a friendly server who spoke English very well and was outstanding. Daniel was an incredible manager who really cared about his staff and cared about the guests. One morning I even asked for some citrus for my gin and tonic and he brought ALL the citrus LOL. Also Edgar was very good as well. He was very attentive and kind always going the extra mile. These two made the entire trip awesome3. Expansive pool options4. Alcohol free flowing. If you would like a bottle for the room you can just ask downstairs and they will give it to you with cups to enjoy on your balcony. Tried a lot of new drinks. Like all all inclusive resorts that go light on the pours so we always asked for doubles. My favorite was the Hendricks GT double with a lime and an orange5. Restaurants. Fuego delicious see pictures. Enso meh. Mole ok too good. Will have more individual reviews on their Yelp pages. Cons1. While there are a lot of pools there are n\u2019t a lot of pool chairs. We are not morning people but forced waking up around 830 just to get a spot around the pool. It was always packed. One morning we waited until 915 to go down and we were screwed. Oh and pools FREZING2. The Clientele Rudest people I have ever encountered. EVERYONE staying at this hotel was a jerk. Most self indulged and insufferable people I \u2019ve ever encountered all in one place. I have been to Mexico several times including another all inclusive and never seen such ugly hearted people. I do n\u2019t know if this is due to the cultures the brand attracts or because it was high season so the amount of people attracted to Cancun was higher I ca n\u2019t pinpoint it. Was here for 4 days and met only one nice older group from Canada and that was it. We are a very friendly couple and love meeting new people but guests at this resort made it impossible. We even had an incident at dinner one night with a 40something year old dad who was sitting at the table in front of ours. His table was in our line of sight of the beach and when he got up to leave confronted Alex saying \u201c you have a staring problem \u201d. We were floored. After some back and forth and him not quitting the staff had to get involved. Do n\u2019t need this while on vacation. You are on vacation people this is supposed to be the most relaxing time. 3. BIGGEST CON Restaurants. As I said it was high season and every night 2 to 3 of the restaurants are closed. Sunday Blue Agave Bana and Fuego all closed. You have thousands of people and the only offerings at 47 restaurants are available. Not to mention as all other mentioned it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a reservation. We had read this so emailed the hotel the week before but no answer to several emails. When we checked in we mentioned it and was told you can only reserve from your hotel phone. We called as soon as reaching the room Saturday afternoon and all reservations were full until after our departure on Tuesday. This seems non sensical. I have never seen reservations nor a business run so poorly. Either have a way to make reservations ahead of time and set aside tables for walk in \u2019s or do n\u2019t have reservations at all. Seriously. Somehow later we snagged a 9 pm at Mole on Monday night and half of the tables in the restaurant are empty. We also noticed this when walking by Vento. Thank God we did the Royal Service upgrade when arriving because we ate at La Palapa for nearly every lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the La Palapa lounge for snacks and drinks in the evenings. Tip. The hotel should give our a brochure of restaurants operating hours what meals you can get at which and which you have to pay extra for4. Speaking of paying extra This place is terrible with the upsel \u2019s every corner we turned upsel upsel upsel. Sat thru their timeshare presentation and the rates were awful 50 vacations for 30 K at 169. As money savvy people no one in their right mind would take this. As soon as they realized we were n\u2019t going to buy they were done with us. Everyone was upsel and tip greedy minus Daniel Edgar Javier and Hugo they were just genuinely customer driven. Beware of anything you do here any photo opportunities any different wines at the restaurants or food specials of the night all uncharges. Even room service was a fee at an all inclusive. Oh and the food you get at Naos the buffet do n\u2019t even think about bringing that up to your room not allowed. So much for enjoying a nice cake or snack from the balcony5. Lastly Maid Service minibar not stocked no water available in the rooms and no robes or slippers. Saturday Sunday and Monday morning none of this existed. Maid came once a day and on Sunday I even laid out a tip and a note about all of these things and when we arrived back from the pool nothing was there and the money was not taken \u2026 maybe the maid did n\u2019t read speak English \u2026 not sure. Then miraculously Monday we walked into our room and there were robes towels and lots of water money and note gone. Then while we were relaxing on the balcony we get a knock on the balcony door and its the maid ready to do turn down service wha. turn down service is now a thing. last night and now it happens \u2026. She turns down and leaves we walk in and there are now more items and chocolates on our pillows. where the F has this been the whole time. Service is so spotty but heck we chalked it up to being in MexicoLast tip before I leave you. They do n\u2019t tell you but I realized the last day when I was full out itchy that the toilet paper is scented. May be a nice perk for some folks but unfortunately for a girl with a scent sensitivity would have been a great heads up. All and all was a nice time but had we been given the level of service that was shown on Monday after 3 pm and restaurants were n\u2019t such a disaster to make a reservation at we would likely be back. We love traveling and love relaxing and after this will likely try a different resort next time. To put it in perspective we even received a free 4 day3 night stay for listening to the sales presentation and are debating even using it because we would rather go somewhere else.", "offset": [6114, 6207], "date": "2019-02-20", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "617e1a2e-dcd9-4ea6-b76d-251f5338b2f7", "sentence": "BEST HOTEL EVER.

This was our second trip to a Paradisus Melia resort. Our first one was a fabulous 5 star vacation to Punta Cana two years ago that my 3 children now ages ages 7 through 11 still talk about with a strong desire to return so we had high expectations. Our first two days were a huge disappointment. Although we had family concierge service our assigned butlers had the day off. We were checked in by an inexperienced staff member who dropped the ball. We arrived around 7 pm tired and hungry. No one showed us where to eat and the sofa bed was not made up upon our arrival. My husband stayed in the room and ordered room service while my eldest daughter and I wandered desolate halls looking for food. We had a long hike to a very ordinary buffet. Substandard when compared to the fabulous buffets in Punta Cana. We later learned that there was a restaurant in our building that did not require reservations where we could have eaten if only someone had told us. We had also booked a room for five people but the room only accommodated 4. We had a king sized bed and had my son sleep in it with the adults. The girls did n\u2019t want to share a sofa bed so my youngest daughter pulled together two armchairs and used towels as blankets to sleep there. We had only 5 pillows for 5 people even though we usually use more. The second night housekeeping made up the armchairs with sheets and blankets for my daughter and provided us with more pilo. On the third night after I complained to our butler about the lack of sleeping accommodations we learned that the hotel provided rolaway beds at no charge. I am still puzzled as to why no one thought of providing sufficient beds for a family of five even after they saw that a child was sleeping in arm chairs. On our first full day we spent the day off of the resort and returned in time for a dip in the pool before dinner. We could n\u2019t figure out how to get towels and by the time we got out of the pool it was very chilly. When we tried to get towels by the pool we learned that we needed to exchange cards provided at check in for towels. We had not been provided the cards or given that information at check in. After some pleading and shivering children the towel lady agreed to give us 2 towels for 4 people and said she could not give us more without the cards so we shared. The next day we connected with our butlers Gloria and Rodolfo and they managed to turn our experience around and salvage our vacation. We obtained a very comfortable rolaway bed with a real mattress for my daughter and pool towel cards. We were able to obtain reservations at all of the restaurants although they could only get us reservations at La Palapa by far the best restaurant at the resort at 830 pm and only days in advance. The kids loved Rodolfo. He was very attentive to our needs and Gloria went above and beyond our expectations. When we asked her if she could find someone to run 8 minute miles with our 8 year old son a nationally competitive cross country runner who is afraid of the treadmill she found Rodrigo the head of entertainment a very nice young man who patiently tried to convince my very reluctant son to run through a golf course around tennis courts and on the beach at no charge. Our butlers sent complimentary bottles of wine and champagne cheese and cold cut platters and chocolate covered fruit and marshmallows to our room provided the children with lovely Mexican toys bathtub full of bubbles and balloon figures and bedtime milk and cookies. They also helped us reserve ocean view Bali beds and spa services. The resort even has a kids spa that we stumbled upon where we treated our girls to pedi mani and facial spa packages. We also were lucky to find Luis a fabulous waiter who helped us get a table every night at La Palapa as soon as it opened at 630 pm so that my children could stay awake and enjoy the dinner. We also had excellent waiters at Bana and Mole restaurant although I was not a big fan of the food and excellent room service by Alexis. Overall I would give our individual butlers and other service providers and the chef at La Palapa a 5 star rating but the resort as a whole a 4 star rating due to our rough start and not so great food at most of the restaurants. I certainly would never want to go without family concierge or royal service and given a choice would rather go to the Melia Paradisus in Punta Cana.", "offset": [640, 767], "date": "2019-10-18", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "c288f7d3-e097-49fb-8c9e-cf87a0e5893b", "sentence": "Will not book my wedding here. My fianc\u00e9 and I came here to potentially book our wedding. I \u2019l start off by saying I filled out several requests to speak with a wedding coordinator before the visit and received no response. Pros1. Most of the staff was amazing. Martin at the buffet was great and generally all the wait staff was fast and accommodating. 2. Beach and location. It \u2019s close to the airport and the beach and water is fantastic. 3. Coffee shop was cute and staff there were nice. Cons1. Hotel is under construction and 3 of the restaurants are closed. The employees do n\u2019t know that apparently because twice I asked where 2 different restaurants were they gave me directions and sent me to a closed place. 2. Check in was long and they try to sell you a timeshare3. Rooms are dated lighting is terrible and outlets are hard to come by4. Pool is outdated and it \u2019s impossible to find a chair if you are not there at 8 am. The hotel was n\u2019t even that busy so I ca nt imagine what it \u2019s like when it is5. You need a towel card for the pool. I figured for the level hotel they advertise you would n\u2019t need something like that. It \u2019s a pain to go get your towels and when you do they relentlessly try to sell you an adventure like jet skiing or parasailing. It was so annoying that it was the main reason I did nt want to host a wedding there. No one needs a high pressure sales environment when they \u2019re trying to relax at the pool. 6. The timeshare pitch does n\u2019t stop at check in they call you and let you know someone has a gift for you at the front desk and just ask for Carlos to pick it up. Sure be right there 7. You need reservations at most of the restaurants Overall great location and if you pay for the royal service I \u2019m sure it is better. Was surprised at how high the rating was for this location. Did n\u2019t waste my time meeting with the coordinator because I knew it was n\u2019t the place for me. Was decent for a quick getaway but definitely not my favorite.", "offset": [1445, 1605], "date": "2019-11-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "ca99351b-e6b4-4514-8946-07f25d3b52e9", "sentence": "Beautiful Family Vacation. Beautiful resort. Our family had a great time enjoying the property all last week. Only downside was it rained almost every day. A huge plus that we did not know about was there is a kids club 5 12 and a baby club 1 4 you can stay and play with them or drop them off. My 2 yr old LOVED the baby club and getting to play with all the toys finger painting lots of activities and the jungle gym. She made us go at least once a day. May was excellent and made us feel very safe. The wait staff was very helpful. We had excellent service a few times and I had like to single out Laura from the club melia beach area for being so amazing with us and our kids. Also Abraham from the Blue Agave was amazing with our family and how crazy it can be at dinner with kids. Blue Agave turned out to be our favorite place for a meal. The tacos and quesadillas were delicious. Enso was a favorite for breakfast. Dinner at Enso was delicious as well but you will need reservations. Bana has a beautiful ambience but it takes a long time for your food and the portions are very small so make sure you order more than you think you would need. One sushi roll is only four small pieces. The manager Christian again was amazing with us and helping to get my kids milk from the cow haha. If you have time I highly recommend visiting the spa. David gave an excellent massage. Make sure to bring your bathing suit with you. it is a full service spa with a hydropol saunas and cold baths. When you book you have access for the full day. Someone came around at the pool and book me a spot also giving me a discount. If staying with club Melia book the Bali beds. They were definitely worth the small cost. We did one day on the beach and one day by the pool. Would have done it every day if it did not rain so much. Eliot was great at helping us to arrange this once we came down every morning. The only thing we found confusing since the resort is so big was where we were supposed to go for help. there is club Melia concierge then RCI concierge and it is in 2 different buildings and the lobby is the main building is huge with a front desk but also desks near the elevators. Halfway through the trip we were able to start figuring it all out. I am sure of we have not checked in at midnight there would have been a better run down of the property with us. We saw lots of hotel staff walking people around explaining everything. They have workers for everythingcanot wait to go back.", "offset": [2000, 2179], "date": "2019-11-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "2f7c6f4c-4251-42c0-aae7-12201e6be3f4", "sentence": "We just got back from vacation. I have reached out to corporate about something that happened with two of the staff members. Pros. Beautiful beach beautiful view everything is very well kept and clean. Many options to choose from for excursions. Cons. Only half of the lights in our room worked. The outside latch to the balcony door was gone so it was hard to get back in. The electrical outlet for a hair dryer or other items was coming out of the wall. The food was a big disappointment. it is like your typical cheap hotel food. I am unsure if I am aloud to make this public or not as I have not heard from corporate yet but it is completely disgusting. While my husband was asleep in the room I went to the Red Lounge to cut loose and dance. It had been a stressful first few days. I requested a song to the DJ and he said he would play it only if I danced on him. I ended up hanging out with the younger crowd because I sadly felt more safe with the kids there. Eventually I got tired and ventured off to find my room. That place is so confusing. I got lost and saw a staff member and asked him if he could show me where my room was. DUMB IDEA. He was more than happy to help and when we got to my room I thanked him opened the door and he grabbed me and kissed me I vividly remember his tongue making it in my mouth. I yelled at him and told him my husband was in the room and he apologized and took off. He was wearing a black uniform with some red on it and had been pushing a cart around for trash or something. I will NEVER go back there. it is sad I felt more safe walking downtown than I did in the parameters of the resort. It makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it. I was scared to report it because I am in a country where I do not know who I can trust and obviously staff was not trustworthy.

I just returned from a 10 nights vacation at the Paradisus Cancun. The facilities were clean and well maintained. The staff were great and the buffet meals were ok. The specialty restaurants were a plus and I enjoyed the meals they served. I have vacationed at many 5 star hotels from Hawaii to Jamaica. I was disappointed at having to request goods and services automatically offered at other 5 star resorts. I had to request bathrobe and slippers as there were none in the room upon arrival. I was lead to believe by the snack guy replenishing the fridge that the only snacks available were chips. I had that corrected quickly by calling the front desk staff. I spent the first 2 nights with no turndown service and cleaning in the evening and had to call the front desk again to request the service. At other 5 star hotels the service is automatic. Upon arriving at the Paradisus Cancun I was greeted by a rep who introduced me to the facilities at the Paradisus lokand later attempted to give me a timeshare pitch. I was not impressed. Pool towels were not properly checked out and in by staff by taking room numbers from hotel guests. As a result rather than guests returning towels to the staff in the towel shack the towels were left on lounge chairs making other guests believe that the lounges were being occupied and not available. Quite a nuisance. I understand many towels were stolen by hotel guests too.", "offset": [1208, 1409], "date": "2020-02-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}]}
