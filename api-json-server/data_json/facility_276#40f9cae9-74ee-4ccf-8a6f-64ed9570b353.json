The hotel itself sets along the canal and is surrounded by nice businesses and is walking distance from most. However my stay was far from pleasant. Three representatives I contacted prior to my stay assured me there would be three items a fridge a sofa and a microwave. When I arrived none of those items were in my room. The room had an odd smell and the beds reeked of body odor. We had the water side so we had a balcony but it was tricky to open. I had to have the bellhop unjam it for us. The hotel water irritated our eyes and skin and we were not informed the bodywash would have lime in it so one of my room guests had a hive break out. Our food we brought with us spoiled as we had no fridge we were promised 50 down the drain already. Spending over 450 for this room for 2 nights while we received next to nothing we asked for. We had several flying ants which was the only thing management seemed to care about after I complained a couple times to not only check in staff but a manager as well. I was severly disappointed in my stay. I should not have to pay so much for so little. I was furious that representatives would promise amenities that the hotel did not even have. To have flying insects and an unclean room is just disgusting for what this hotel stands for.

I spent several days here while attending a conference at the Tampa Convention Center and really enjoyed my stay. The proximity to the Convention Center was perfect. Being part of a conference I was staying at a negotiated room rate which typically means a lower floor and no view and this was true. One side of the hotel has nice water views and the other side overlooks the city and a parking area. The standard room with 1 king bed was nice but a few minor dings in the walls furniture and the rolling closet doors would not stay shut on their own. Annoying but tolerable. I do not think the room was worth the published rates that they would have been charging. 385 night I believe outside of the discounted conference rate. The desk was nice plenty of plugs for charging electronics were available there and throughout the room. I was surprised to see a fine layer of dust on the phone lamps in the room. The in room coffee maker was shoved in a dresser drawer when I arrived which I thought was odd. The furnishings were fine. An ottoman would be a nice touch to accompany the chair near the bed. The room did not have a fridge per say but had something that looked just like one with a sign that said it was meant to cool items to a specified temperature and maintain them at that temperature. It kept my bottles of water cool just fine The air conditioning seemed like it took awhile to cool down but maintained temperature well after that for the remainder of my stay. I enjoyed the onsite restaurant Champions a couple evenings and always had good food and good service. Any bar I went to within the hotel made me a wonderful Mojito. I was excited to have an onsite Starbucks but as it turns out it is not a full Starbucks so not all options were available and payment via phone ap was not possible. Another nearby hotel had a full service Starbucks I was able to talk to thankfully. The hotel staff were all pleasant. The housekeeping staff was a bit loud in the hallway during the day but it was not an issue when trying to sleep. The bell staff was very helpful as well. They could use a larger luggage holding area though upon checkout they had so many bags that they ended up roping off an small area in the lobby to hold bags. Not the most secure way to do things. The grounds of the hotel were very nice and well kept. Nice outdoor patio and pool. I enjoyed the Riverwalk and took daily walks along the water when the weather permitted. There was also a workout room available. Wi fi is a paid service. Mariot rewards members get free basic slower. Wi Fi. If you are not a member join just for this reason.

Again the property does not disappoint. Location for the race events is PERFECT. You are next to the Expo and literally 4min from the start line of all events yes 4min maybe less. And the trolley is across the street. So park your car see my comments below about that and walk or trolley the entire weekend while you enjoy an outstanding property. ROOMS. No updates since my last visit. We stayed on the 16th floor with a balcony and water view. Requested a refrigerator and it was perfect for race weekend drinks snacks. Bed is comfortable and bathroom roomy. Balcony is relaxing and the view is amazing and weather was perfect. INTERNET. Free for rewards members and plenty fast for the basic packageCUSTOMER SERVICE. Again this property never disappoints when it comes to the staff except for the valet see below. Horace at check. in was efficient professional and friendly. Chris at the front desk was professional as well. did not bump into any staff member that was not pleasant to engage unlike the last visitFOD LOCATION. did not eat at the property but food is available. Nothing really close to the property BUT take the trolley to Ybor and more than enough restaurants are available. PARKING. See my previous reviews about parking my advice remains the same. DO NOT PARK at the hotel. 24 day for poor valet service is not worth it. Even if the Valet service was timely it is still to much to pay unles you are doing in n out. Park at the City of Tampa South Regional Garage across the street from the Hotel where the valet park the guest vehicles. A change in 2016 if you enter the garage without paying at the entrance special event payment of 10 bucks you will have to pay the daily fee upon exit on Sunday a change from my last 2 reviews were parking was free because the gates were up on Sunday AM. The City of Tampa installed a credit card payment machine since last year and when you enter the garage and pay at the entrance they give you a ticket to engage the exit gates for no charge so in essence you are paying 10 for the entire weekend. But for me I was stuck with the daily charge. a whole 9 bucks a day yes only 9 bucks. And the garage is across the street from the Hotel. So when I left this morning after coming in on Friday today is Sunday. I was charged a whopping 23 bucks. the extra 5 bucks was for the difference in the 24hr period. If you do not plan on leaving the property park at the garage. you will not regret it unles you have money to burn and alot of time to wait for your car. it takes 5min maybe to walk to your car. I witnessed again and talked with guests that had to wait an extended amount of time for their car and witnessed chaos approaching the hotel during check in timeframes. There are numerous reviews regarding the valet service at this property and rest assured they will do nothing about it same valet company same problems. This is the only downside with this property if they would just fix the valet service imagine how many happy customers there would be. In the end I will always stay here while in Tampa. I highly recommend the property and can not talk enough about the excellent staff. Parking problems can be avoided by parking across the street on your own.

My family of 5 stayed here the night before a cruise out of the Tampa port. The location is ideal for both port accessibility and right across from Amalie Arena. Lovely area with shops and restaurants to explore. My issue is with the website stating very clearly that the double rooms can accommodate a rolaway. We booked the room 6 months in advance and requested a rolaway for our third child. Upon our arrival we were told the room could not accommodate a rolaway due to fire regulations. I was baffled as to the fact the front desk only offered the solution for us to book two rooms. Upon my pressing she conceded they could provide an air mattress for our son. I have never seen an air mattress in a hotel and seeing how it is twice a large as a rolaway have no idea how this is not a fire hazard when a rolaway is but I accepted the solution. An air mattress was delivered an hour later and when I attempted to inflate it the motor died. I tried multiple times but it was broken. I called the front desk and they promised to send up a different air mattress. In two hours a second air mattress was delivered. I was able to inflate this one and then realized no bedding had been provided with it so I called down to ask for sheets and pillows which eventually arrived an hour later. By the time we had the bed made it started to deflate. This time I went down to the front desk to speak with the desk clerk and she promised to send up a third air mattress. By this time it was getting late and I wanted to get the kids to bed. After another 90 minutes of waiting and still no air mattress I once more went down to the lobby and insisted on speaking to the manager. Once I explained the situation to the manager and showed her the website that still said a double room could accommodate a rolaway she conceded the website was misleading and offered to move us to a suite. We accepted and were baffled as to the suite upon our switching of rooms. There was no actual bed at all my husband and I slept in a murphy bed pulled down from the wall my son had the pull out couch and my daughters each were given a rolaway. The kitchen had one small refrigerator no microwave the basic double had neither. and the bathroom was small. We were fine and happy to have a place to sleep for everyone for the night but this hotel has some major issues to work out with their rooms. It is a shame because the lobby and pool were beautiful and the attached restaurant was great. After all that hoopla we had a quick drink outside and the view by the water was fantastic. However I can not recommend this hotel based on how long and tedious the process was to try and resolve our issue.

To me the Tampa Mariot Waterside Hotel was a major disappointment. This is not a cheap hotel. it is a high end hotel but I definitely get better service from some of the cheaper hotels that I stay in from time to time. First issue I had was with the room. I was at the Waterside hotel on a business trip and was going to have to spend a lot of my time working at the desk in the room. The size of the room and most of the furnishings were fine. The chair for the desk though was broken. I asked as soon as I arrived for a new chair. I was told the maintenance people had left and that they would leave a note so they would get to it in the morning. The next morning I left the hotel for business and came back in the afternoon. Guess what the broken chair was still in the room. Of course when I called this time I was told the maintenance people had left and it would be the next day again. About 2 pm the next day they still had not replaced the chair so I went down to the desk and requested the chair be changed for a 3rd time and finally it was replaced. The room also had what I guess was a chiller. in it. It looked like a refrigerator which is always great to have in a room. However inside the box was a sign saying that it was not a fridge nor a mini bar but that it would SLOWLY lower the temperature of whatever you put in it to 50 degrees. My thoughts it is a broke refrigerator and they are too lazy or cheap to fix it or replace it and putting a sign in it was an attempt to explain it away. It did not even cool anything down to the 50 degrees. I put my water in it and two days later it was still room temperature water. There were other occasions like this where the service was just not what you expect from a hotel where you pay this much to stay. Of course like most of the high end hotels you have to pay for everything. Parking valet only is 25 a day. Internet is another charge per day so be prepared to pay a lot more than the room rate if you stay here. There are some benefits of the hotel. The location is nice and the water and yachts next to it are great to look at during the day. They have a patio where you can sit even fire up your own grill and hand out with friends. There are also some great restaurants to eat at nearby. The hotel is a beautiful hotel it has all the sparkles luxury look that you could want. The pool area is on top of the roof and is a great place to hang out.
