The wine tasting was inside of the winerys facilities and the industrial look added to the experience. There was food whiskeys and a delightful band outside under a tent about half the size of a football field. We were dry under the tent but if was a little cool. The hotel is large with open areas which provide nice views within the hotel. Staff was polite and attentive. The room was spacious with a quality bed. The TV programming was dated and with a generic hotel setup. it is a small complaint because few people go to a resort to watch television. The hotel more than made up for the poor TV by providing free wifi. I did not attempt to stream media but normal web. browsing went along nicely. I am a sucker for free wifi. The bathroom was spacious and made with quality materials. The bathtub was large enough for two as is the shower. We had dinner at Paddys Irish pub. I was not impressed. We had potato soup and pretzel bread with cheese dipping sauce. The food was on par with Aplebes. The soup was bland and uninteresting. The pretzel bread was clearly made in a factory and microwaved. This might be something that I could overlook but the cup of soup was 8 and the pretzel bread was 7. The staff was nice. Overall I was impressed with the wine festival the grounds hotel and room.

Wifey and I were looking for an overnight destination near our home to get away from house and family stuff for our anniversary. Chateau Elan is only 30 minutes from our house and we had never been. The hotel is attractive and once you get inside you see it is big really big. The atrium area is a massive 3story space under skylights. The Versailles restaurant takes up about half of the floor space and the other half was used for a couple of weddings the afternoon we were there. Our room was king bed. The room is big and has all the amenities you had expect. The bed is comfy and tall. My wife who is vertically challenged laughed about the trouble she had climbing into bed. Any shorter she is 53 and she had need a step stool. The room was absolutely silent. I do not know if there were not guests on either side of us or if the soundproofing is good but the room was so quiet. The air conditioning was almost unnoticeable noise wise compared to some hotel rooms where the AC compressor shakes the windows. We ate dinner and breakfast in the Versailles restaurant and had nightcaps in the Lauberge Lounge. I review those separately but I was pleased with everythng we had. We used valet parking since it was in the upper 90s when we checked in and the self parking area is a decent hike. Getting out car took just a few minutes and the cost was 20. Not unreasonable. Overall it was a nice stay. The service and staff were excellent. Since it is a resort the prices are a bit high but we knew that going in.

If you \u2019re looking to attend for the wine tasting tour day experience though it \u2019s worth a read. So my significant other and I planned on doing the wine tour and tasting. We went today a Wednesday. so the tour was at 230. First off their website was correct for everything so that \u2019s a positive. So we got there and paid and by the time that happened it was 234. We got our first pour of the Old World wine flight and caught up with the tour. However the tour was 20 min total and went to the grapevines between the parking lot and the cellar a mural by the bathrooms and stood in the production area. FUTURE SUGGESTIONS if your party has ever seen a winery tour skip this one. If this is your first begin the wine tasting 30 min before the winery tour. Bring your third tasting on the tour. Some overall winery concerns. the staff we were served by two different pourers have never tried the flight and therefore could not speak to it farther than the paper we were given on each wine. Also I \u2019m not really into wine but at home I have different glasses for different types of wine. I \u2019m concerned that they served all wines red white ros\u00e9 out of the same glass despite different glasses bringing out the specific types of wine. Additionally there was nothing to clear the palette between wines even the different COLORS of wine. This was a big one considering when discussing the wines my SO looked at me and said \u201c the only notes I get from this are the previous three wines we tasted \u201d. Anyway not a good look. Because we went at 230 we decided to go to lunch. We asked two staff members what they suggested and decided to go across the estate to grab lunch. It was cool that we were able to bring our glasses to the table. Upon sitting we were bombarded with flies. FLIES. I understand that it \u2019s June and whatever but the restaurant area was in the downstairs of their HOTEL. why were there flies. Our server was very nice and tried her best but we were tragically underwhelmed by their food selections. We ordered a Cesar salad with chicken tomato soup and a side of fries. However the Cesar salad was just Parmesan cheese and Cesar salad dressing soup on a side plate. The soup was decent but for 8 I expected more than a diner cup serving size. As there were EIGHT DIFFERENT FLIES buzzing around us my date looked at me and said \u201c If this is how bad the salad is I do not want to try a sandwich. The side of fries with hot sauce is the highlight of this menu \u201d. Anyway the tasting is fine if you time it correctly and do not have high expectations. If you need to eat bring a picnic lunch.

It was better than the mattress but for a place like this they should have a very plush soft bed. My mirror closet door was slightly off track and the toilet was messed up I had to reach in the back of the toilet every time I flushed I did not want to move or have a maintenance person in my room taking up valuable time so I just told them when I left. The buffet at the restaurant was so so very expensive for the quality. I was not impressed.

Ice machine on the floor did n\u2019t work so had to go down a floor hasle1 then I started to pay attention to the hallways always dirty. I literally found shoes in the hallway and a few fake fingernails which stayed there for 4 days meaning they never cleaned the floors. Went to the jacuzi and there were someone \u2019s underwear and socks right next to it. figured ok some one left them but 4 days later THEY WERE STILL THERE.

The things that were reported stolen did not add up to more then 500 which is not much money to me and was not the point it was the principal of feeling unsafe and violated that we had things stolen from us and yes we searched everything we had and the entire room for hours to make sure we did not misplace them before reporting to them. Another night had family we have n\u2019t seen visit us and were TALKING NOT YELLING loudly and the guy in the next room called and threatened us then KICKED the adjoining door and threatened us with violence. Cops were called situation was resolved and they moved the guy. WE WERE PHYSICALLY THREATENED. Not even an apology from the hotel. Spoke to the manager the last day of our stay hoping to get some type of apology and compensation for such a horrific time we had and again was treated with utter disrespect and was told again they want the cops called to search our belongings for the things we claimed were missing. I have traveled all over the world and stayed at resorts that make this resort look like a motel and have never been treated so horribly FOR THINGS THAT WERE DONE TO US.

It was poor timing as we were already drinking coffee and my 90year old grandmother had to leave. But late is better than nothing so we thought and the \u201c manager \u201d said she would box up a couple slices of rare prime rib for us to go. We were grateful until we got home and opened the container. honestly I \u2019m still speechless. I do n\u2019t know if this was a joke or what but what we were given was a slap in the face from a restaurant where we just spent 10 and left hungry.

Your \u201c chefs \u201d left the plastic casing on the mortadela when they sliced it. Every single slice of mortadela was encompassed with an invisible thin string of plastic surrounding it just waiting to be caught in someone \u2019s unsuspecting throat. First we called the server over to let her know and told her to immediately inform the manager to take the mortadela off the charcuterie table to protect everyone else. About 15 minutes later I went back to the charcuterie station and noticed that nothing had been done. So I called over the manager and told her about it but she did n\u2019t understand \u2014 she said she had never eaten mortadela and did n\u2019t know anything about the plastic casing on the meat. I then picked up a piece of the meat and peeled off the plastic while she watched in awe and I think she finally realized the impact that this giant mistake could have had. She just kept saying \u201c I had no idea \u201d. but I told her that the chefs should have known it should have never made it out to the serving table that way. Lastly it was obvious that several other foods were pre made in advance and just re heated in the morning. The Mac and cheese was so dry that it was inedible and pig pork and turkey were also overcooked.
