I stayed at this hotel on the night of March 30 2018 and it did not meet my expectations for the following reasons1On the day before my arrival I was sent an e mail asking me to check in and select a room which I did. I selected an end room on the first floor and I received a response saying it was available and confirmed. The room was confirmed with a credit card so the room was paid for. Upon arrival I was given a room on the 2nd. floor. When I asked why did I bother to go to the trouble of checking in at their request as well as selecting my room when I was not given the room that I selected and was told it was confirmed I was told that they were aware that I had used the advance check in and room selection process but the room was not available. I find that very poor customer service especially since they had my credit card and had I not showed up I would have been charged for the night2Had I checked more thoroughly I might would have known this particular hotel is \u201c pet friendly \u201d and it smelled like it. The Housekeeping staff told me that pets are suppose to be in certain rooms but often times people sneak their pets in and hotel management is not aware. Personally I think the same rule that applies for people smoking in a room should apply for pets in unauthorized romsa huge fee should be imposed3The next morning I was getting coffee and a woman walked up with her dog in her arm and she was maneuvering trying to pour her coffee while her dog was smelling the cups and sugar and then he shook his body. I found that so unsatisfactory that my husband and I decided to by pass the complimentary breakfast and go to a restaurant that was cleaner. The woman finally put the dog down on the ground so she could pour her coffee without spilling it and then she and the dog walked through the lobby and out the door. I must admit I have never seen this at a Mariot property4The entire hotel had a \u201c pet odor \u201d which can be a real TURN OFF to people who do not care to smell pets. So glad I only stayed for one night and from this point on I will stick with a Mariot property where if a pet is allowed to lodge it is a service pet. Staff Comments. The housekeeper who had cleaned our room just before we arrived was very friendly and helpful. The front desk clerk was pleasant however he offered no real explanation as to why I could not get the room I had selected or at a room on the first floor. Very out dated room. Housekeeping should pay closer attention to making sure that the Kleenex box has more than 4 5 Kleenexes left so that guest does not have to go to the front desk to get a box.", "offset": [1694, 1859], "date": "2018-07-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "8f903649-eb6c-484a-b88f-d20e9576299c", "sentence": "Do n\u2019t stay here.

I \u2019ve stayed at this Hampton Inn many times every spring fall for past 5 6 years historically ave made it my hotel of choice among about 8 hotels available at this exit. However last weekend when we stayed we were in midst of major construction zone. Upon arrival we had to navigate around construction workers installing lighting in lobby. Plaster or paint was smeared across floor in reception area throughout our entire weekend visit. Construction equipment was scattered around the lobby during the day stacked up in hallway between elevator back entrance at night. Second floor where our room was located had elevator lobby area with no floor covering \u2014 carpet ripped up exposing rough concrete. No sign of current work to replace carpet of flooring during our stay. Walking down hall from elevator to room wiring was visible near ceiling lights at each doorway wall paper had lots of loose places. Entrance to our room had a piece of loose carpet sticking up. The room itself was ok except shabby. Also the room fridge was turned off so we were forced to toss food we stored overnight when we realized we had failed to notice warm fridge upon our arrival. Once we turned the fridge on it worked fine but honestly \u2014 who thinks about need to turn on a fridge before use \u2014 once installed most of us simply keep the fridge on. To be fair when we made reservation hotel did note that pool Was closed due to hotel renovations. This would make no difference as I never use the pool. However I had no idea I \u2019d be roughing it in the mess dodging construction workersThis hotel tends to be more expensive than the other hotels at this exit for years I have liked this hotel well enough to pay more to stay anyway because it has been an unusually nice one. However this time it was clearly not worth the cost. I \u2019l probably return at some point but I \u2019l be sure to confirm construction is complete.

The lobby had nearly dead house plants random old furniture dirty windows and blinds askew. THEN we got to our newly renovated room that was so small we could not get the luggage cart all the way in and there was no convenient place to put the luggage anyway. No closet just a nook with hooks and a curtain pulled over it. New furniture reminded me of my dorm room from the mid sixties sharp edges brown fake wood and orange vinyl occasional chair that was at least 36 inches wide and deep and occupied most of the space that the bed did not.

Let me start with the good point The staff at this Hampton is excellent. As good as any Hampton staff I have encountered. Now for the other side Hampton Inns are my go to hotel on the road. I have stayed at dozens of them. But I have to rank this one near the bottom of my list at this time. They are under renovations right now. which certainly does not help the situation. The main lobby doors were not accessible when we arrived after dark and a small sign advised us to use the side doors. But there was no lighting indicating where those doors were. It was a little like feeling around in the dark for a hotel door not something that inspires a lot of confidence. The pool and fitness rooms were closed for the work but that happens not a big deal. However the fact that EVERY person entering the hotel apparently had to walk directly past my door. all night long was a big deal. The rooms near the doors that were pressed into primary entry service should not be rented during the renovations. And heres the weird one. I normally find Hampton mattresses and pillows to be extremely comfortable. but I felt the bed in my room to be too soft on top and too firm just below that. I could not get comfortable and my wife mentioned the same problem in the morning. And the AC was noisy. Very noisy. It appears my room had already been renovated so I suspect the mattress and AC issues will remain.
