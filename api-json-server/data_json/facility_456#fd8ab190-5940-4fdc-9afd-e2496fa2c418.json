I can not believe there are none in lost and found. Hotel advised that I walked to CVS to purchase and it is safe to walk.

Great location in downtown. Wonderful front desk staff. I had informed them ahead that I wanted a room close to the elevator because of bad knees.

We appreciated that very much. We did not care much for the beds thought the mattresses and pillows were too soft. My wife and I both got up with stiff backs both nights because of the very soft mattresses. I thought most hotels had switched over to firmer mattresses. I guess this hotel has not gotten around to doing it yet. Other than the beds the room was comfortable and kept very clean.
