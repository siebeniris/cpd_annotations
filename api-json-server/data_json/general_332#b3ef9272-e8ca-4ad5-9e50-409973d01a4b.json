From the outside it looks grand front of house staff look smart dressed in their whites and safari hat with friendly greeting. Even the lobby looks greand then it gets worse. Check in was slow and once completed there were so many bits of paper maps tags and then you have to go to another counter to get your parking tag and there they try to sell you Bluegren membership. Where BOTH parties have to attend a presentation at 1030 where donuts and coffee will be provided but you have to sit there for 2 hours to give you free money. Who in their right mind would attend while on holidays. Just as well as the experience got worse. Rooms are extremely motel quality small and strange smell. Beds were too soft and poor sheet quality made it too hot to sleep in bathroom did not have enough hooks to hang towels when it is a beach resort and plus they encourage you to be environmentally conscious. Chair in room had sand on it. Only good thing this place has is it is location on the beach. Room had a small kitchenette and a safe. Our booking was made through a travel agents website. The room they gave us was the worse I had ever stayed in for the price we paid. Only window unopenable is by the door and they put us right by the elevator. When I specifically noted we did not want. Understandably these requests are not guaranteed however there was no acknowledgment of this request from the staff either. We could not open the window as passerbys could see in which means NO privacy NO sunlight or NO fresh air. They offered us an upgrade but for a fee. They also had no staff available to show us the upgrade room. The rate we paid was already overpriced taking into account the beach location and to other beach hotels we had stayed before in the US. If hotels are going to use agents for their bookings then manage it properly state the room has no windows. do not lure guests then tell them at checkin we can upgrade you for X Our luggage then went missing for an hour or so. They took it to the upgrade room that we did not see value in paying for. Then the air con did not work properly. Wasted more time waiting for the maintenance guy to do his thing and the temporary fix made it extremely noisy. Then our room keys did not work. Messy layout of the resort lifts had a strange smell too and not to mention took ages and you could not tell if it was going up or down. Pools did not look enticing. They also had construction going on which was not stated on their website. Having stayed at other resorts TW staff are not friendly even at check out most would ask how your stay was not at TW. The giant slide was set up which we used and also the beach cabana. As I said the beach is good that is all.

My folks and my wife and I stayed for 5 days at TradeWinds. In my opinion the value was good considering the resort itself. Lobby grounds rooms pools and beach access were immaculately clean and tidy. This resort was nearly everything that one could ask for. I only have to minor complaints. To begin with. In the adult pool there were guests that repeatedly got into the pool well into the morning hours such as 3 am 4 am. The very first night we were there there were two girls that decided to swim topless. Nearly every night we stayed there were late night. early morning swimmers. Now to the defense of security I personally watched them remove these swimmers countless amounts of time. I am just wondering if something can be done such as better signage or more foot patrols to avoid this in the future. The second thing is the poor mixology that every bartender throughout this resort has been trained with. Every cocktail tasted horrible. Their alcohol to mix ratios are completely out of whack and need to be addressed urgently. I saw a top shelf margarita being mixed with the ratio of 71. That is 7 parts Patron to 1 part margarita mix. Not only does this cause a drink to be like drinking rubbing alcohol. it causes a few serious dangers and ramifications. The danger of course is over intoxicating your guests. these are guests that are going into your pools and your beach access. not to mention para sailing jet leving Jet skiing etc. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen. The ramifications include but are not limited to. Loss of profit caused by over pouring expensive liquor. Loss of profit caused by bad tasting drinks. Loss of profit caused by customers ordering fewer drinks because they have had enough booze in the couple that they ordered.

Cons. Access to the rooms is via an outside corridor feels like a 1960s block of council flats. Carpeting everywhere including outside. Gross especially with all this rain. Access to the room was directly into one of the bedrooms with an inch of gap under the door to the exterior. See photo. We had to block up at night to avoid any visitors. Tired decor chipped paintwork door handles with chrome worn off. Sun loungers on room corridors packed around the pools can not walk between three rows deep. Smores.

They also fixed our front door which was not closing automatically when we left the room. The grounds are lovely and well groomed. The ice cream at the Pizza Hut is good but after a few years here I have gotten a little bored with the restaurants on the property. On the other hand there are plenty of places to eat nearby. Also I think the food that the hotel provides for conference events is a cut above what I am used to at hotel chain banquets. I always get a waterfront room and love looking out at the gulf. If possible we also get a suite so that my husband can stay up late on his computer while I go to sleep in the other room. There are I think five pools on the property.

I am giving the resort this rating primarily because of Angela at Working Cow Pizza Hut Brena Gibbons at the desk where you get your parking tickets and wristbands Doug Rogers and the man who helped us get housekeeping to clean our room. These people went over and beyond the average worker. They did all they could to make our stay comfortable. The check in experience was disappointing. Sarah was the one who checked us in and she did not make us feel welcome at all. I was advices to inform the guest satisfaction official. that ended up being a waste of time. Chris at the guest satisfaction desk was no better than Sarah. They were unfriendly and lacked interest in my concerns. Brena Gibbons at the desk where you get your parking ticket and the wrist bands was the best staff we met. She had a smile and spoke to us like valued guests. Konk activity center is really small. Not much going on. I believe it is geared more towards kids 7yrs and younger. I had hoped to take my husband out valentines day to celebrate and leave the kids at the Konk but my kids pleaded with me not to even let them stay there. There are lots of places to eat at the resort or even outside the resort. We went to Beef OBRADY a coupe of times. We were never disappointed. the food was awesome. The staff were fabulous. They make you feel welcome. Very friendly courteous and yet professional. there is also a working cow. Angela who attended to us was very nice and patient. The entire family was there and she smiled all through. Helped people decide on flavors. Absolutely remarkable customer service at WORKING COW BEEF OBRADYThe Flying bridge has a variety of food at an affordable price. Again nice folks. there is a restaurant called Bermudas. You can get a breakfast buffet there or ala carte. The buffet was a little pricy. The resort has a sister company Guy Harvey. it is located not next to the resort. There are two buildings between island grand and Guy Harvey. there is a restaurant there that has an tall wall aquarium. We had wanted to have dinner there but they will not seat us by the aquarium because we were a party of 5. Our party was not large enough and was not small. The kids decided not to eat there for that reason. The people in the restaurants and bars are friendly. The rooms are comfortable. there is a dunkin donuts baskin Robbins less than a block from the resort. The beach is beautiful. The weather was a little chilly the 1st night so we could not do much but the next day was warmer. The kids had lots of fun in the slides and the beach. They also loved the peddle boats. The trampoline and gyrosphere were out of order. It would surely be a better place to come in the summer or late spring. there is a lot to do as a family if the weather permits. Before coming I had asked about activities for the kids. This was because I knew the weather might be too cold to do anything at the beach. I was told there l be so many activities that the kids will be the one that l get tired. the sound of warning. do not come here because there are several activities for the kids. rather come here because there is a lot to do as a family couple. The only activity they had was at about 1 pm at the polside and it lasted about 20 mins. I hope they will be able to incorporate more because that was fun but too short. Before you park your car find out where your room it. it is a big resort and it might be helpful yo park close to your room. there is also valet for 8.

It was updated and clean. All appliances worked properly. I could definitely see us staying on this resort for a week and never leaving the property. There are plenty of places to eat you will pay resort prices but the food is delicious and plenty of things to do. There is a waterslide putt putt padleboats and of course the beach.

I would say that it is much more of a family resort than a place for younger couples however we wanted to go to just relax and lay on the beach so it was perfect for that. There are nice cabanas you can use every day and the beaches are gorgeous. At night the sunsets are probably the best part of the area. We got a room facing the ocean that we upgraded for and it was 100 worth it. The staff was very friendly and the maids were my favorite. I felt there were four big issues but other than that. I m not a huge complainer 1. First issue upon checking in the lady at the desk where you get your wristbands tried to trick us into going to some timeshare presentation so be on alert when you get your wristbands and just say no to any presentations for any FREE things. I read a few reviews before we went and knew not to do this from another couple who said they got stuck in a 5 hour presentation. 2. There was an adult pool but no adult hot tub. Only 2 hot tubs on the property and they were both in the main pool area so they were always SUPER full of kids and very small. We never were able to use the hot tubs. The adult pool was nice to get away from the loud little kids splashing everywhere. Other than the lack of hot tubs the only other issue was some tourists feeding the seagulls but that is not the resorts problem I would just say maybe more staff or signs saying to not feed them some people behind us fed them an entire pizza and they started swarming and then loudly screaming about the seagulls swarming which they caused with their own food 3. The hairdryer in the room was terrible and the stand it was supposed to be connected to on the wall broke off immediately I barely even pulled it so that was a bust and I did not pack a hairdryer since it said they had their own which was disappointing. 4. We upgraded our room for 200 additional dollars so we could have an oceanview however the balcony was SO TINY we could barely even fit on it together. They are also SUPER close to the people next to you so you do not feel like you have any privacy. there is also a no smoking rule which is fine but I think if you have a balcony you should be able to smoke without paying a fine. But back to some positive things there were a lot of food options and restaurants on site. I HIGHLY recommend the Palm Court Italian Restaurant right off the lobby. It was 5 stars and the service was impeccable. We made an early reservation for 6 pm and were the first to sit and it ended up getting pretty packed after that so I recommend you make a reservation so there is no rush. The wine was delicious and the food was amazing everything we had was great quality. There is also a deli general store on site in the lobby that has sunscren glasses if you forgot any of those things and also pretty good sandwiches and snacks they are open until 2 am so its very convenient. there is a nice little Tiki Hut Bar called Saltys that had live music right there and nice comfy lounge chairs with fire pits in them at night which was nice. Drinks were a little overpriced but it is what you expect. I did not get to try the other restaurants on site because we went to RumFish Grill at their sister resort a few doors down which was recommended by the staff and that was a nice experience very pricey but amazing swordfish and there is a huge fish tank right there you can check out a lot of fish. Back to the resort there is free mini golf free padleboats you can ride around the resort in this pond which is cute and there s swans there is also a giant water slide that is free on the beach. They offer some other activities but some do cost money so make sure to ask what is included with your wristbands. Overal It was a nice time and we enjoyed some of the restaurants and the beach was GORGEOUS I just do not think I would spend that much again because of some of the issues I mentioned above that I have nt dealt with at other resorts.", "offset": [1921, 2071], "date": "2018-01-02", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "e29f3f94-e5de-4425-b36a-3a3ef206a146", "sentence": "way overpriced and overcrowded. room keys failed twice hour long process in wet bathing suits.", "offset": [0, 31], "date": "2018-04-20", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "33577b6a-2150-4277-955d-ba057d6c740d", "sentence": "Saltys Tiki Bar. do not miss this tiny tiki bar near the pool.

I was completely pumped to try a new place to stay this year. TradeWinds seemed to fit the bill until I go there. First of all I fell for one of their packages on the website that included an activity card worth 250. do not DO IT. There was over 200 left when we checked out because nothing was up and running. The water park the floating cabanas etc are apparently run by a different company and it is their decision on when they will be up and running. The slide on the beach was the only thing fun to do on the beach that was advertised but that is included in the resort fee. Our room for the price should have everything in working order before we arrived. The toilet and the bathroom door both did not work. The walls were paper thin and I could hear people coming and going all night. I did like having a family specific pool. Pizza Hut was a nice option for lunch. Other than the manager who was at the front desk when I checked in most of the staff was pretty friendly. We went to Clearwater Beach for a few days after this our normal place to stay. The atmosphere is so much different. When I asked my 6 year old which hotel he preferred when we were flying home he said the 2nd one Clearwater Beach.", "offset": [485, 609], "date": "2018-06-19", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "1760c05c-ea4f-4670-b8d5-5303fcd34092", "sentence": "They will take every cent you have.

My daughter and I spent last Saturday at the Tradewinds Resort. Upon our early arrival our room was not ready which is to be expected. Jo Lyn was a delight to me as she checked me into the resort. She was careful to explain all the extras we were entitled to. Her upbeat energy and clear explanations were most delightful. I have stayed at this resort a few times and each time they continue to impress me. The gulf view is incredible and well worth the extra cost. The bed was beyond comfortable and the sheets were soft. I would recommend the Tradewinds as the resort you must stay at at least once. Seriously it is a living postcard.
