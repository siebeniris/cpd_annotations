There was no pressure to utilize the service of the hotel porter and we did not. There is a service fee which at first seemed unfair until we borrowed bicycles to ride along the beach paths. The Viceroy has a beautiful pool area where you can sit and hang out have drinks or dine at the hotel restaurant. We did not have breakfast or dine there.

This hotel features very luxurious accommodations for a pretty decent price. Considering we had ocean view and were just a couple of blocks from the beach. Big plus to be on Ocean Avenue. The Viceroy also gives an aire of old school royalty with the amount of fancy Europeans that were also guests at the hotel. We decided to try breakfast and lunch at least once at the hotel given that we were around some of the most amazing places to eat in the world. Breakfast and lunch were both excellent. The eggs benedict called something else were delightful. And the sandwich at lunch delectable. The pool was great but the service not so much. We were left several times for half an hour or more without ever being asked if we needed anything. This must of have been a busy day because every other aspect of the service here was exquisite. The Viceroy offers bicycles to their guests to enjoy during the day. Every single day we tried to get one but were unsuccessful. I am not a fan of what some people were doing which was to hide a bicycle between cars in the parking lot or in the bushes. Since I have to go outside often to smoke I saw people doing that and I just find it stupid silly and completely arrogant. Nevertheless the hotel should work on that because we never got to use the bicycles. The one day we did go down early there was a large group getting bikes. The room was plush and elegant. that is the best I can do to describe it. The shower bath and bed were out of this world good. The rooms are a good size too.

When I enquired about the morning yoga sessions that were advertised I was told they were not running this week.

This morning 217 some work started before 8 am and full blast work started at 8 am. I am in a room facing the back yard and pool and I can see workers working in the pool who are making the noises. I went to the front desk and asked why they are starting work at 8 am vs 9 am written on the paper right on the front desk. The front desk person went to ask the manager and came to tell me that they are trimming the trees vs construction. I told her i can see them working in the pool. She then went to get the manager who came out and admitted the noise was from construction. It is unethical for someone to run a luxury hotel by lying to its customers to their face. The hotel charges 300 a night. it is bad enough that there is no amenities whatsoever. Then start construction early and lie about it is just unacceptable.
