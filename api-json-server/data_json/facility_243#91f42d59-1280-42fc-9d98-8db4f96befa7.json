In town on business and wanted to stay with Hyat as a Gold Passport member. Unfortunately the more appropriate locations downtown were full due to a conference so I went with the Hyat Regency. The location on Mission Bay is great with tons of vacations style amenities. However it is not the best option for business travel for obvious reasons. The adjoining room was a bit loud one night during my stay but that is to be expected from vacationers. Hot water was much more limited than I would have expected. My biggest complaint though was being charged a nightly resort fee when I was not able to use any of the resort amenities. Just be clear on all the policies prior to making your reservation.

Hotel and amenities were excellent. Very clean and spectacular views from the tower. Great pool and restaurant. Our only complaint was the noise the hotel was hosting a bunch of parties and we had noise that kept us up every night. People making noise and running through the halls people in adjacent rooms with TVs way too loud no fault of the Hotel and they did take care of this and a company party held in their tent which had a DJ with very loud music. Not sure why they would host a party with DJ in their tent obviously a tent will do nothing to contain noise. They also need to do a better job of monitoring noise when they have party guests staying in their hotel so their other guests are not bothered. Also a small issue with no hot water in the shower the day we left. Spectacular view from the tower very clean excellent amenities great location. Excellent location very close to Sea World close to the Zoo and down town close to airport.

My family and I recently stayed 4 nights at the Hyat Regency Mission Bay. We were very impressed from start to finish with only a few details that offered small detractions from an otherwise excellent stay. We arrived on a Sunday and were immediately pleased with the bright fresh lobby and beautifully landscaped grounds. Our check in was efficient and pleasant. Our room was very clean and well appointed. We were particularly pleased with the decor and have taken some ideas back for our own home renovation. We had a view of the harbour which was so gorgeous on all the lovely sunny days. Our daughter was excited for the pool and water slides which she rated the best of all our stays on this trip. I enjoyed the fact that all the pools were no deeper than 4 feet so felt confident with my daughter \u2019s safety in the pool. The afternoons were windy though unfortunately and cold. We enjoyed sitting in the gardens in the evening reading and having a snack. We also loved the games provided on the pool deck ping pong connect 4 etc and the fire pit. We did n\u2019t find the dining options great for a family. Both places were fairly expensive for family dining. The pub style restaurant was small with little ambiance. I can appreciate it \u2019s more for quick bites while pool side but I think the menu could do with a revamp. We found it odd that there was no breakfast restaurant option. We walked to the little market coffee shop which was an enjoyable jaunt but the coffee was really very poor. We enjoyed the pastries though. Recognizing that this is a resort and prices are higher because of that I still felt that the snack gift shop was way out of line in pricing. You should n\u2019t have to pay 450 for a small bag of chip snack mix. Maybe 350 for the convenience. We really loved the chilled fruit infused water offered in the lobby each day. The bell staff were very kind and attentive the tower where we stayed had new and attractive carpeting and the rooms were kept up nicely. We did hear some noise between rooms on one of our nights and always heard the seals but to me that \u2019s the plus of staying ocean side. A bar of soap was discovered propping up a panel in the ceiling above the bathroom door. Not sure how that got there. Convenient to SeaWorld and Mission Beach. A longer Uber to Balboa Park zoo. Not much close by to walk to but that was fine for us on this particular stay. Overall this hotel was a beautiful stay and we were quite pleased with our whole experience here and in San Diego.
