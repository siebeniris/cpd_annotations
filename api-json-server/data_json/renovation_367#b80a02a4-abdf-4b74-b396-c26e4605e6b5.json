We did have a problem with noise from the restaurant refurbishment but this was dealt with superbly by one of the Managers Jack Conroy.

Everything started with a deception but then our stay at One Aldwych turned out to be our best stay ever in London We chose One Aldwych because of its location the swimming pool and sauna.

When we told the hotel that we were not happy about this they upgraded our room invited us for breakfast and made it possible for us to go swimming in the nearby Savoy hotel. The rooms at One Aldwych are nice and very clean. The staff is very friendly and the concierge helped us to get tickets for a sold out musical.

My son and I travelled to London for a short stay mixing business and a spot of touring. At a clients recommendation we stayed at One Aldwych. it is in the heart of the West End theatre district very convenient for many of the newer office complexes west of The City and a 15 minute or less walk from most of the core tourist destinations. The staff were uniformly courteous the concierge was helpful. The price was reasonable for all that if not cheap. I would return very happily.

Let me start by saying this hotel has a wonderful staff from management down to everyone else. They all aim to please and for the most part all do their jobs well. One thing that that this hotel has that many in London do not is a fantastic location. It is right at Covent Garden with all the theaters nearby and Covent Garden shopping. Within easy walking distance is the National Gallery Trafalgar Square the Churchill War Rooms the British Museum Regents Park Hyde Park and the War Museum plus a ton of quality restaurants. The room was wonderful except for the bathroom and the curtain design. The bathroom needs serious renovation and according to the staff that is coming soon. The problem is two fold. The tub is deep and you need to use it to shower. There is no curtain just a moving glass screen at the shower end of the tub and that screen leaks water on to the floor. It makes for a dangerous situation especially if you are not a 6 footer 18 m because of the depth of the tub and the difficulty of getting in and out. I do have an issue that most hotel rooms across the world do not have a place for 2 suitcases and a couple of smaller bags to be off the floor and opened and this hotel is no exception. As to the curtain design when we arrived in the room in the evening the one side of the curtain was pulled across the other and held there by pillows propped against it on the floor but there by housekeeping. When we looked further it was clear that you could not draw the curtains tightly against each other to keep out light from shining through early in the morning without following housekeepings lead. We found the breakfast in the dining area had a long way to go before I would consider it good. The afternoon tea was great. I think the food will get better for breakfast as the staff listened to complaints and we have no doubt they intend to improve. If the bathroom and rooms are updated and the issues fixed as promised and the breakfast improved That should be easy. I would not hesitate to return next year.", "offset": [647, 732], "date": "2018-02-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "807bc4c8-36c9-4085-b947-cd1f3cf877da", "sentence": "Absolutely fantastic hotel with wonderful caring attentive staff.
