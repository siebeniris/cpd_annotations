Ms. Kate was very polite no matter how busy she was she still wore a sweet smile and apologised for keeping the guest waiting. She even remember my name and my room number. Very impressive.

This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. This time it was following a cruise. The previous time was in 206 on our way to England. Nothing appears to have changed in the interim. I would have no problems staying here again if we ever had the need to stay in Singapore again. The reception on arrival was slow as most reception seem to be. However the staff there were courteous and the service provided was good. When during our overnight stay I could not manage to login to the free wi fi to check in for our flight home I was ushered into their business centre and provided with the use of a computer and a printer. This was very much appreciated. Our room was very nice with all the fittings you would expect and overlooked their swimming pool. This is on the fourth level I believe and is surrounded on three sides by the various wings of the hotel building an adjacent building. On the same level as the pool is their hospitality room which they provide for persons arriving early or departing late as was our case coming of the cruise. The breakfast room is on an elevated area on the ground floor adjacent to reception. The meal we had there was reasonable but not startling. I am not sure if dinner was available there also or they had a separate restaurant. The location of the hotel was not a central as it could have been. While we were able to walk to the botanical gardens and back from there it was taxing in the heat. Overall I would prefer to Hotel Jen Orchard Gateway where we stayed prior to the cruise and which iIhave separately reviewed.", "offset": [1078, 1162], "date": "2016-03-19 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "649caeab-384e-4374-acb6-538fbc75ab59", "sentence": "Worth the price for a club room fantastic staff.

All of the staff that we dealt with were helpful incl. room attendants room service laundry and club lounge. A group of us were staying here for a wedding nearby and Ian and his team at reception were fantastic in helping us sort out a few issues. He even arranged for someone to retrieve some items we left behind at the reception venue. This level of service particularly in a large hotel really sets the Orchard Hotel apart from the many similar hotels in the area. The only very minor thing I can think of is that there is no bathroom in gym. There is only a single toilet for both gym and pool areas.", "offset": [214, 323], "date": "2016-05-12 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "db0f0b54-fc33-42ba-a690-d4a8e43d9623", "sentence": "Fantastic customer service and wonderful hotel.

The hotel is in a great spot if you like shopping our room was very spacious and the hotel is spotless. We booked breakfast which was plentiful but a word of warning for UK vistors obviously this hotel is aimed at the Asian market so tables are very close together and I mean close also the although the hotel does try and accommodate British tastes the food is mainly Asian.

We stayed for 5 nights with 2 young kids 2 yrs old and 7 month old. The hotel is conveniently situated towards one end of Orchard Rd so it is an easy stroll or bus trip down Orchard Rd. Only a few minutes walk to the bus stop and there is a shortcut through the hotel into the shopping centre which has a supermarket and a few restaurants. We stayed in a club king room. It was large enough to fit 2 cots. Bathroom had a bathtub and separate shower. Overall the room was comfy and adequate for the 4 of us. Generally clean and bath tub was low enough for me to bathe our kids. The only problem was we were close to the lifts and opposite a service room so it would be quite noisy sometimes. Buffet breakfast had a good selection of western and asian food and food quality was above average. It was hard not to eat too much. Only downside was that it was often quite busy even during weekdays and so it was quite a hectic atmosphere. Getting there before 9 am would be best. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. They happily set up 2 cots for us in our room when we requested it at check in. And staff were friendly with our kids. We were also assisted quickly at check in as there was quite a long line and a staff member saw us with 2 young kids which was nice. Having access to the club was nice. We mainly went in the afternoon when they had afternoon tea which had a small but nice selection of desserts and finger food. During other times you could have tea coffee or soft drinks. We did not get a change to go during breakfast or cocktail hour but definitely a good perk to have access to the club.
