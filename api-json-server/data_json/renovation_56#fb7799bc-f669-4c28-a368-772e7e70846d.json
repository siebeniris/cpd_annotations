On Saturday we had an issue with our restroom however the hotel manager was very apologetic and provided us with two bottles of complimentary wine and champagne. However on Sunday as I was entering the Buffet line located on the 11th floor a huge rat ran from one side of the eating area into the kitchen. I immediately told the chef what I had saw and he ran into the kitchen. I reported the incident to the front desk staff and they stated that they had contact maintenance. The overall stay was ok hotel management and staff are very helpful and accommodated my friends and I for the issues we experienced.
