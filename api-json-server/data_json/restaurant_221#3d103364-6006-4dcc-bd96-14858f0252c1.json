My family was in St Louis for a college graduation and we decided to stay at the Ritz to celebrate in real style. Nearly everything was perfect. The rooms were luxurious and very comfortable. Bathrooms were wonderful marble floors large shower and vanity separate toilet area. Turn down service was accompanied by a little sweet each night with a nice note. The restaurant only open for breakfast and lunch was very nice good food excellent service and tables far enough apart to make your dining experience more private big pet peeve of mine is having tables squished together in a fine dining restaurant. But the place to be is in the lobby lounge. Great bar with big TV for those interested but the TV did not intrude on you if you did not want to see hear it. Nice comfortable chairs and couches good small bites menu and a made to order sushi bar. Wonderful and friendly service. There was entertainment Thursday and Friday nights we were there not sure of other days. Garage is available attached to hotel for self parking and valet if you want. The only error in service was room service breakfast one morning was nearly 12 hour late and served cold. Apologies were profuse and the next morning breakfast was on time hot and free. I would definitely stay here again if business brings me back to Clayton St Louis. And it is only about 20 minutes from the airport.

We had two adjoining rooms for our trip to St Louis to attend a wedding. This Ritz Carlton is perfectly appointed and well staffed and maintained. The rooms and public areas were immaculate and spacious. Staff is exceptionally friendly and professional. The food was delicious in the bar area. Right after we checked in my husband had low blood sugar from not eating at the airport and on the plane thankfully the waitress took pity on him and brought us all kinds of snacks while waiting for our food to be prepared. So nice. Beds were comfy and clean. Bathrooms had nice toiletries from London and a very good hairdryer. Coffee pots in hotel room with ample coffee. One of our rooms had a charging station with USB ports. Small balcony to enjoy the gorgeous surroundings. Would definitely stay here again. Everyone we encountered in St Louis was friendly and it was easy to get around the city. Wifi was free once we signed up for some kind of free rewards program. Seemed very fast to me.

Ever. If I could give this hotel six stars I would. My wife and I were celebrating a major anniversary and wanted to do something nice. We usually do bed breakfasts and were about to do the usual when we decided to try a Club Level room at the Ritz instead. At first I was not sure exactly how nice the Club Level would be. I could not get much info about it from reviews so I was skeptical that it would be worth the extra cost. Fortunately it was worth every penny. In fact everything about our stay was excellent. We have two small kids at home and we just wanted a place to get away to for a night where we would not have to do anything but relax and eat. Our plan was to stay in the hotel the entire time and from the minute we got there until the minute we left our expectations were exceeded. It started when we were leaving our room immediately after our very swift check in. Someone stopped us in the hall and said they had something for us. It was a tray of chocolate covered strawberries and a note congratulating us on our anniversary. We then went up to check out the Club Lounge. It was nice and quiet and a bit smaller than I had expected. At 5 they started serving hors doeuvres. Our original thought was that we would have some light snacks in the Club Lounge in the late afternoon and then have dinner later downstairs. The dinner ended up being unnecessary. We spent about two hours relaxing in the Lounge and had more than enough to eat. The hors doeuvres and other offerings were excellent. They had complimentary beer and wine as well and to top it all off a chef from their restaurant whose name was Damien brought around a tray of high end cheeses with fruits and other accompaniments and we had a wonderful chat while he served us and told us all about the cheeses including one that was from a nearby dairy farm. Apparently he does a presentation like that every Saturday and I should note that Damien alone made it worth the cost of admission so to speak. He was a delight and the cheeses were amazing. After relaxing in our room for a while we went back up to the Lounge for desserts at 8 pm. This was probably the only part of the Lounge offerings that I would say was average. There was some fondue and mini creme brules not particularly good and some other light desserts but nothing that really struck me as exceptional. My wife was in the mood for some sushi and we found out that you can order from their Lobby Lounge downstairs and have it brought to the Club Lounge so we did that. I am not much of a sushi guy but it seemed good to me and she liked it. The next morning we went up for breakfast which was excellent. They had hot and cold offerings and pastries and other whatnots. It was all good. The bacon was thick not your run of the mill cheap hotel stuff and the biscuits and gravy was amazing probably the best I have ever had in factI guess I should mention the room here. It was nice. I am not too picky about room amenities and fixtures. As long as it is clean and quiet I am fine. This seemed like an above average room. The TV was bigger than the usual hotel TV and the bed was comfy. The view from the balcony was nice. You could see the skyline of St Louis in the distance. I do not know if we would have stayed here if we were not getting the Club Level though. That was the main draw for us. Anyway after checking out just before noon we figured we had go back up to the Club Lounge to ask some questions as we were already considering coming back. However we did not think we would be able to have lunch there which starts at noon since we had already checked out. We stopped and asked the girls who had been serving breakfast about what they usually offer in the Lounge and how busy it usually is I should mention here that it was a very slow weekend when we stayed. The Lounge was often us by ourselves or usually one or two other groups at most. It worked out great for us though because we wanted peace and quiet for a day. The girls said it is usually a bit busier but I can not speak to that at all so your experience with the Lounge may vary. Anyway the girls told us about their various offerings in the Lounge and then said that we could stay for lunch and hang out as long as we liked. We had mentioned that we lived locally and were just on a short getaway and that we had two young kids at home and they were very friendly and accommodating. We tried the lunch which was mostly light fare I was still stuffed from breakfast so I really did not want much anyway and while we were eating one of the girls who we had talked to earlier came by and gave my wife some gift bags for our kids and then gave her a small gift bag as well. Hers had a very nice candle in it which just so happened to be her favorite scent. I think she was about to cry it was such a nice gesture. Anyway that cemented it for us we are definitely coming back again it is just a matter of when. But that was not even all. After that one of the girls got us a small box to put some of their huge cookies in to take home to the kids. Before this stay I had always wondered if getting a Club Level room at a decent hotel was worth it. We had actually considered it many times in the past and then decided not to usually in favor of a bed breakfast stay. While I can not speak for other places I can say with certainty that the Club Level at the Ritz is worth every cent in fact it is probably even a deal and it is the best hotel stay we have ever had anywhere including our stays in Europe. Some reviews made it sound like the Club Lounge was not worth much more than any average offering of complimentary snacks at any other decent hotel. This was not our experience. This was a luxury stay at a luxury hotel and every bit of the stay and every offering in the Club Lounge except for maybe the desserts attested to that fact. I am already recommending this stay to my other friends who are parents of young children. it is an excellent place to get away to. I only have one suggestion for improvement from the entire stay. This is not a complaint though merely a suggestion. In the Club Lounge there are three sets of french doors which open to balconies which themselves overlook the skyline of St Louis in the distance. By the middle set of french doors is a small table with chairs. This was by far the best place to sit. You could relax in the sun look out over the view and enjoy your meal. We sat here every time the table was available. The problem was it usually was not available unles we were the first ones there since it was the first table that was taken due to it obviously being the best place to sit. The other sets of french doors just had a cushioned chair in front of them with its back to the window usually next to a couch or something like that. In other words it was not setup so that you could easily eat and relax right by the windows. The only thing I would change about the Lounge would be to put a table and chairs in front of every set of french doors so that there are more great places to sit. I realize this was a long review but when I was looking for info on staying here I was always disappointed that people did not give more details about their stay and particularly about the amenities of the Club Level.

The Ritz is centrally located to have easy access to all of St Louis. There are so many great restaurants in the area that you have got a plethora of choices for breakfast lunch or dinner as well as having the Ritz itself for excellent dining. I travel a lot with my family and I have traveled much for past companies. I notice a hotels beds pillows duvets mattresses as well as bathrooms water pressure and overall ambiance at offering a respite from travels. The Ritz in Clayton is wonderful on all fronts. My kids well traveled teens remarked as well about how incredible the beds pillows and duvets are and I concurred. We had just been on whirlwind tour of cities looking at colleges and it was tiring to go from hotel to hotel college to college. YES the Ritz offers a respite YES their service is equisite YES the food is wonderful and YES their beds pillows duvets bathrooms and water pressure all meet and even exceed our hopesOK. on to the breakfast buffet before I close my review let us just say scrumptious. They offer so many fresh berries and fruit. that is my measure of a good buffet. Not just honeydew and cantaloupe but a wide array of fruit which means fresh berries. The French toast was delicious with crispy edges not just soggy egg toast which often occurs on buffets. The best though was the toppings available for the French Toast or other toasts bagels. I chose peach compote and my teenage son chose a bananas foster topping. Mine was lovely but his was over the top incredibly delicious. Bravo Brava to the chefMy son also ordered a made to order omelette which he an expert omelette maker himself said was perfect. that is high praise from this tenagerMy only comment of concern to the breakfast buffet was that the eggs benedict must have been sitting in the warmer for much too long. The English muffins were as hard as a china dish and yet the inside of the muffing was rather soggy. I slid the egg ham hollandaise off and enjoyed the Benedict flavors sans muffin but I would recommend that perhaps fewer Benedicts be made and they just be replaced more often. An easy fix to a very small problem amid so many excellent flavors in the buffet.", "offset": [1137, 1217], "date": "2017-08-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "ad3585c4-e984-405f-b32d-b36b5ea1cd8d", "sentence": "PUTTING ON THE RITZ.

The days of doormen holding the door for you and valets being front and center are gone at least from this Ritz Carlton. For the price that you pay for a room here you would expect to get free wi fi and possibly cheaper parking. The staff was relatively friendly but not what you would expect from a hotel with the Ritz Carlton name. I attended for a conference and the breakfasts that were served were EXCELLENT. The lunches and dinners were very good as well. It seems as if there are just a few pieces missing that would make this hotel into what you would expect for the name.
