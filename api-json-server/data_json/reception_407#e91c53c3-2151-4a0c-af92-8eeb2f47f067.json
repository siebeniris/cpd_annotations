We had a two room suite that gave us a King bed w master bath one bedroom with two twin beds a 34 bath. Balcony with views of the ocean was great. What made this 35 star hotel 5 stars is there staff. We had a FedEx package arivingbthe staff called my cell to let me know it was delivered before FedEx even updated there ap. The staff had great recommendations for food other things to do in the area. The staff was also kind enough to let us park the cars one extra night past our reservation at no cost while we were cruising.

This resort is nice but my husband and I are not huge fans of the size. The rooms are nice I think they have been updated at least the room we stayed in. You are not guaranteed an ocean view room. Being a big resort also means the pool can overflow with people at certain times. do not expect good WiFi. I know you are on vacation but there are some days where you are not going to be at the beach or the pool all day long or into the night and you want to watch a simple YouTube video. The internet kept disconnecting and saying there was no internet access. Mark was very helpful he did try coming to our room 2 days in a row to try to help us fix the WiFi to no avail.

The room we stayed in had a chipped balcony floor that needed to be redone. The room smelled very musty and had to be aired out our first night. There was no kitchen garbage can either. Our experience with reception was hit and miss. Several employees were very pleasant and hospitable but one employee was rude to us. I also feel like a 10 am check out is earlier than it should be. 11 am or Noon would be better. Thanks pool is nice. It is heated. There is also a hot tub tennis courts and basketball court. There is free parking. The beach area is nice but lacks chairs for your use unles you rent them when we were there no one was manning the rental station so you could not get a chair if you even wanted to pay for it. This hotel is a time share environment which has its pros and cons. We witnessed numerous tours being given all chalked full of masked hard sell sales pitches. The location is nice. There is a restaurant onsite and a pool bar. Prices are more reasonable than many other resorts I have been to. The rooms were clean. There was a fair bit of noise that could be heard coming from both inside and outside of the suite. The doors are thin and do not block much noise from the inner hallway even when the door is shut. There is a game room with pool and some video games. There is an outdoor shuffleboard and ping pong table. There are some sand toys for kids available on the boardwalk area. There were many man of War washed up on the beach so be aware of your surroundings before entering the ocean or planting your feet on the beach.
