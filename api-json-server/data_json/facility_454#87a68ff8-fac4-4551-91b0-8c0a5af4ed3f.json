The reception lounge was inviting with a fire and sofas and in the morning free tea and coffee is served in the evening free wine. Free flavoured water is available in the lobby throughout the day as bottled water is charged in the room. The restaurant next door served an excellent breakfast and was accessible through the hotel. I thought maybe a little pricey for a breakfast but this was standard pricing in this area I believe as we ate in Denys the next day and it was a similar price. On to the room both air conditioning and heating quiet comfy bed reasonable size bath was on the smaller size but shower adequate. TV and free internet available with good connection speed. The view. well there was not really one the trouble with my room was that I did not have a view of the street but of an adjacent wall which meant that not a lot of light came in to my room so if this is a problem for people maybe request a street view to let some light in. This was not a problem for my stay though as the location was convenient and I was out a lot the room was used for sleeping and cleaning. get out and explore San Fran was my motto. There is no gym on site and as a regular gym goer this concerned me but I was relieved and pleasantly surprised that we had free access not discounted as some posts seem to suggest to 24 Hour gym which was just across the road. Overall for the price I paid I was very happy with my stay here and it retained the feel of a classy respectable comfortable hotel WITH CHARACTER unlike some chains.

That might make a difference. We were there on a Tuesday. The staff is ready with smiles and very helpful. The lobby is so warm and inviting. Call ahead to see if you can be accommodated earlier. They are really nice about it. Concierge offers a never ending supply of free apples. Console table near lobby offers fruit infused ice water. Feels like a boutique dog friendly hotel. Foyer area next to elevators features a welcoming and very posh console table with flowers mirror on wall and dog treats. Cute. It feels very fancy but very warm at the same time. The hotel has an older feel to it but has been remodled and updated. Entire mirrored wall behind beds in guest room lend an airiness and feeling of more space and white feather duvets on beds are soft and welcoming. The rooms are a bit small and the closet in the room is tiny but the room is comfortable and beautiful and the bathroom has plenty of space. This room reminded us of the now defunct Maritime in Montreal QC and we loved that hotel. So a bit old but very nicely updated and posh. There is a mini fridge and mini bar and the prices on the booze and snacks are not as astronomical as we imagined they had be. Also it is the old fashioned kind there are no sensors going off if you accidentally touch something you do not wish to purchase. Our room had a window with white plantation shutters and it looked down onto a pretty enclosed courtyard with topiary. There is a comfortable chair a writing desk plenty of plug ins there is one sitting on the writing table that accommodates 4 6. electronic devices. large tv that swivels and luggage stand. There is a safe in the closet with a programable lock. There is free wi fi. There is a restaurant off the main lobby that faces the street. I went down ahead of my daughter to get a green juice. I LOVE that they have a juicer behind the bar. They gave it to me on the honor system and it was wonderful since I usually start my day with one. because I told them I was going back upstairs but that we had be down together for breakfast. The staff is all smiles and laid back but the service is quick. Breakfast was great and their fresh fruit bowl was outstanding and ampleIt is a five minute or less walk to Fishermans Wharf. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and if you book a Viator Tour that place is right on the corner about 500 feet away on the northwest corner from the hotel. Walk out of the hotel turn left then you will see a big awning it is right there. Also the intersection that the Viator Tour place is on is where you get on the old fashioned cable cars. When you get to the Viator office look to your left and you will see all of the cable cars parked there. Also there is a store adjacent to the hotel to your immediate left upon leaving the hotel.

The lobby is very nice with a lovely garden out the large window and a large fireplace. On our first day we visited the Concierge Aiyaz Ali. He was most helpful in planning our stay including our trip transportation back to a hotel near the airport prior to our flight home. It took about 5 minutes to walk the Wharf only a couple blocks away. Pier 39 was close. And loved having a grocery store and drugstore right across the street with Trader Joes a block away.

Hotel Zoe has a clean modern design yet is comfortable welcoming. Each interaction with every staff member was great from the very helpful front desk staff to the host and waitstaf at the hotel restaurant where we ate dinner every evening of our three day stay. The food there was good too. But charging the urban facility fee separate from the room charge is a deceptive way to increase the cost of a room. Calling the surcharge an urban facility fee tries to make it sound as if it is a city imposed tax which it is not. If the hotel wants to charge an extra 25 per room per night then just be straightforward about it increase the room cost. This practice took the shine off an otherwise good stay. Also not good was the sagy soft worn out feeling bed the ridiculous lack of an in room coffee maker. Every staff member we spoke to was professional polite knowledgeable. Our room was clean quiet. Location was great for walking to see sights. An easy walk to the Alcatraz tour departure pier Pier 39 to Lombard St Our bed was sagy tired although we were told the hotels beds were new. We would have slept better on a firmer mattress.

I have been looking to go to San Francisco for years. Having finally booked the flights along with 3 other US destinations. we found this hotel quite early. My partner booked this a few months in advance for a very decent price compared to what the rate was nearer the time of our stay. This hotel was probably the best one during our whole holiday in terms of the room itself. A positive for this hotel was it is location and I do not think we could have had much better for a first time visit to San Francisco. it is easy walking distance to Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39 and within an acceptable walking distance to a lot of other attractions. We got a private car to take us from the airport SFO to the hotel from memory this took around 45 minutes. We were able to use a combination of walking and Uber to get around at other times. The hotel was not particularly cheap but it was decent value for money and I would recommend. The rooms were big spacious and modern. The service was good and everything was clean. In the mornings hot drinks are available from the lobby. The lobby bar and outside area in particular is very nice for a drink rest after a long day. Our room included king double bed safe TV shower over bath various USB charging points fridge hair dryer. The hotel has a restaurant that we did n\u2019t visit. I would love to come back and visit again at some point.", "offset": [1046, 1102], "date": "2018-10-09", "cpt": "3", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 34, "uid": "c9c51063-3de7-4f00-8273-a94fed5127ee", "sentence": "Excellent long weekend in SF super attentive and helpful staff. My wife I had to be in San Jose for an event and decided to tack on 3 nights in SF. Daughter that lives nearby decided to join so it was 3 of us in the room. I had booked our stay in advance and did so in consultation with Lita. When I informed her that we may have 3 of us in the room she did her thing and checked availability and set us up perfectly. It was room 315 a corner suite that has a couch that pulls out I slept well on that. Not sure how it hapend. but I did need to touch base with Lita an unusual number of times and she was always able to respond and resolve in a positive way nice to work with you Lita. Oh one other note about the room did not spend a lot of time watching them but the room had two very large tvs that were definitely above average in quality. I also need to give props to the front desk staff. There was a paperwork mess up on my part but the Front Desk took it all in stride and were totally accommodating. Jurita forgot the other womans name. It was the kind of situation that if wrong people were involved it could have spiraled downhill quickly BUT not at Hotel Zoe. Super nice folks excellent job of staffing. We did eat couple of delicious breakfasts really good bacon. in the restaurant and also used the gym front desk gives you a day pass across the street a couple of times. The gym is not a plush look at me kind of place but it was large and had an overample supply of equipment. I remarked to my wife that I much prefer this kind of scenario vs when a hotel tries make a smallish location within their property function as a fitness room. With a legit gym 100 feet away someone made a good call on putting this option in place. Location was great not on top of Fishermans Wharf but a nice 4 minute walk away. We absolutely expect to be back and if you need a place in this area of SF I highly recommend Hotel Zoe.", "offset": [1277, 1385], "date": "2019-02-27", "cpt": "3", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 35, "uid": "d684252c-350a-43d9-9160-410f4edd47c3", "sentence": "Overall Pricey.
