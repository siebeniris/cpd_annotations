Spent one night here in April 2015. The room looked newly renovated it was well designed and very clean. Staff are friendly and helpful. I would happily stay here again if I were in the area. One thing I did notice about the bathroom is that the shower grouting was completely stained. As the room bathroom were immaculate I suspect the problem was with the grouting caulking itself that mold seeped underneath and stained it. As for room selection patrons should know that many of the rooms overlook the giant atrium in the middle of the hotel. This is nice however there are public walkways that run in between these rooms which have large sliding glass doors and the balcony. This would be a huge privacy issue for me despite the curtains on the glass doors so I was glad I had a room along the exterior wall of the hotel.", "offset": [312, 452], "date": "2015-04-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "0de973e7-8dd9-49fd-b2c4-75e6e3660fdf", "sentence": "Not bad for meetings. The hotel is currently being updated renovated in the public spaces but I have stayed here before. It certainly needs to be updated. The format is an atrium style internal with a large open area. There is a pool and a gym at one end and reception at the other. Service at the bar is always nice but I have only ever eaten breakfast in the hotel which is very standard fare. The rooms are functional but nothing to get excited about. There are several large meeting rooms which are useful for a corporate get together. Overall it does the job and covers one of the larger meeting spaces in the area.

I stayed at this hotel on a business trip for two weeks in June and I really have no complaints at all. Before I begin my review I should mention that like some reviewers have pointed out the lobby is currently under renovation but I certainly could not tell. This is a commercial entity so no one should except the hotel to close for cosmetic renovations. I stayed on the second floor and woke up one morning to find the front desk had been moved completely. There was not any noise factor whatsoever throughout my stay not unles you count the guests yelling with excitement during the NBA finals game 1 and 2. There was also one night when an Indian wedding was held there so there were a few noisy guests talking as they walked to their rooms. But that is not the hotels fault. They were not really loud anyway. The actual wedding venue was not noisy at all. I had a single king size bed in my room and plenty of space to put away the few things I needed to feel at home for two weeks. There is not a microwave in each room but I requested one and was given one for my room. The bathroom is a bit small but I did not mind it too much especially since I got a really functional restroom powerful water pressure from the shower and in the toilet. The cleaning service is quite superior as well. I typically do not have my room cleaned on a daily basis but after four days of hanging my privacy card on the door I found a basket with fresh towels and toiletries to replace what I had used. Other hotels I have stayed at do not even bother with it or throw it into a trash bag. The cleaning ladies were very efficient. Overall the service was exceptional considering there was tons of traffic in and out of the building besides the wedding there was also a college recruitment convention and a few other business meetings. Two staff members I enjoyed interacting with because they were very pleasant courteous and professional. Bridget front desk and Sep front desk are great members of staff to engage in conversations with. Sep also drove me a few times to nearby restaurants and stores to get food and gave me good options on what restaurants to visit. I left for work really early so I am not sure if this service is available daily but I do know on weekends there is a chef on site to make you an omelet and waffles to order. The breakfast buffet is pretty good as well. The hotel has one of the best gyms out there. There are at least 5 treadmills and 3 elliptical machines. Tons of weights multi purpose weight machine ear phones if you need and fitness balls. The pool is indoors within the courtyard and also got a lot of usage during my stay though I never tried it. The only thing I found odd was the sliding door which opened up to the corridor facing the courtyard. I like to open up my blinds in the day time to get some natural light but it was very awkward doing that knowing anyone walking by could look right in. But that was hardly an issue for me. If you are looking for a hotel to stay on a visit to the city this might be too far for you from the likes of Times Square or Central Park but if you are in the Long Island area or do not mind taking a train from Huntington Station the hotel shuttle can drop and pick you up from here to Penn Station in Manhattan then I recommend giving this hotel a try. Note that the Wifi is only free if you a member of the Rewards program which you can easily join at check in. On site packing is free as weldo not forget to ask for Sep if you need a more personalized help.", "offset": [302, 398], "date": "2015-06-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "291ba096-4e80-41b1-80ed-b11df9607cc9", "sentence": "Terrible.

I was here for a one week business trip. This hotel is busy and very large. You will always see someone sitting at the bar area or having dinner right next to it. I enjoyed their fitness center with their plethora of cardio equipment resistance cables free weights and spacious matting for yoga and stretching. I was in an isolated corner but the back of the room was a sliding glass door enabling me to walk out facing the atrium. I think all of the rooms have the same amenity. The hotel shuttle runs until 11 pm and can take you within a 2 mile radius. I did not have a car for the week so the shuttle was very helpful. I enjoyed the salads from the restaurant and their breakfast was very good. Most of all I really appreciated the top notch service every single staff member provided as I felt like I was staying at a 5 star resort. There was construction still going on during my stay and I had an older room that needed a facelift. Besides that this is a great location to stay for business or a weekend getaway.
