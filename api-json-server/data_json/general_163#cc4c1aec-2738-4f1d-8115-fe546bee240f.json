Currently staying at this hotel with my husband and 18 month old daughter. Upon arrival we found that there was no baby cot in the room even though I had requested a day before our arrival. I called reception and they rectified this nice and quickly. Fantastic response time. However once the cot was set up they had only left a bottom sheet and a rather large adult pillow. I spoke to reception and requested a blanket When they came up they brought only another bottom sheet. When I clarified that I wanted a blanket I was told that they can not supply us with one due to safety as babies can not have a blanket. So we now have no blanket for our baby to sleep with. I find their response odd when blankets are perfectly safe for babies and yet they left in the cot a large pillow which I immediately removed which could quite easily suffocate a childAside from this the hotel so far has been nice and staff very helpful.

My colleagues and I were hunting for a nice place to have pre christmas dinner. One of them suggested this place. Naturally as this is a hotel setting the venue looks classy. It was a night of street food theme when we visited Doha Mariot Restaurant Gallery. Not quite sure if that changes every week or it was a constant theme there. Anyhow we proceeded into the area and we were greeted by a lot of tables along the hallway which pretty much resemble that of street food ambience only with a sophisticated air to it. We dined in at Asia Live and the staff were all accommodating. On the food option you have got quite a number to choose from Mexican dishes to japanese and indian delicacies. I tried both mexican and japanese and a bit of indian food. While there at Asia Live we were told that the buffet comes with alcohol beer wine. So naturally we ordered some. When the bill came out it was sort of a separate charging. It may have meant that we can opt not to order those because apparently the buffet itself had a separate bill liner. Anyway for those who d like to try buffet but on budgetary constraints this is not your place to go to. It kind of blew me off when we saw the tab. it is pricey compared to other hotels offering buffet style meals under QR20. Yes the staff are good and so is the ambience but essentially you had go there for the food more than anything else. And that is where I think we are a bit short changed. And as the theme was street food there really was not much to look forward to other than finger foods or food on stick. Perhaps if they will bring the price lower and offer more sumptuous dishes then I guess we could try again. Until then we will just check out other hotels and their buffet dishes at a lesser price range.", "offset": [1614, 1721], "date": "2015-12-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "dafdccb8-94d7-460e-a7bf-d3f27186cb47", "sentence": "Not so bad stay.
