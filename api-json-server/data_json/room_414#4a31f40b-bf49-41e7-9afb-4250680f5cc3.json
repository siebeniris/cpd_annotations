Four of us two couples in our 40 \u2019s stayed at the Excellence Resort May 29 \u2013 June 5. This was the fourth trip to Punta Cana for my wife and me. We have also visited Puerto Plata once and Cancun twice so this was our 7th All Inclusive stay. So I would like to think that we have some decent perspective. We have only had one marginal experience and that was mostly due to poor weather in Puerto Plata. All other experiences have been very good or great. We rate Excellence as better than most of the other resorts we have been to but it did not completely distance itself from all others. Are there some signs of age at this resort. Sure. But that is to be expected. There are places where the tile may be cracking or a little rust in the corner of a bathroom but you almost have to be looking for these things to find them and if you do find them you have to really focus on them in order for them to be a big deal. But the positives far outweigh the minor negatives. We loved not having to make dinner reservations. The resort was at best half full when we were there so there was never a problem for us to find chairs palapas etc. The food was on par with pretty much all of the other resorts we have been to. I would rate it as good. Most of the staff were friendly and helpful. As you will find everywhere some are better than others. Some seem to just do their job and move on while others went out of their way to provide assistance and to make your day better. A special shout out to \u201c Haney \u201d on the entertainment staff and Victor. our favorite bartender usually in the Stars barI\u2019d like to address a few of the things that I saw on some other reviews. We found our mattress to be just fine. It was not too hard like many other people have noted. As for watered down drinks \u2026 we never experienced anything like that. Our drinks were good and even occasionally a bit strong. The ocean was rough but we thought that was fun. We never experienced an under tow that made us feel unsafe. Everyone has different tastes and obviously I can not speak for other reviewers \u2019 experiences. It is easy for me to say that some people are overly critical but perhaps I would have felt the same way if I had experienced exactly what they did. But in summary the couple we traveled with the new friends we met at the resort and my wife and I all had a great time at Excellence. We went there with a positive attitude with the expectation that we would have a great vacation and that is exactly what we got. We will likely return.", "offset": [694, 943], "date": "2015-06-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a82e0608-a70d-4fa7-87a9-13faa5a01c30", "sentence": "Awesome Adults Only Vacation. Seriously awesome resort and would go again. Service was excellent. Almost every resort employee we would pass or interact with greeted us with an hola a friendly smile or would do everything they could to make sure all of our needs were met. Our room was great. We had a garden mountain view which we do not regret. We considered getting a pool view room but I think it would have been much louder with people drinking and playing in the pool. The pools and beach we defiantly one of my favorite parts. Always clean and never too far from a frosty adult beverage. The spa was also a must do. We enjoyed a couples ocean night massages. It was AWESOME. At first I thought the price was a bit much but it included an hour of hydrotherapy before or after your massage. After enjoying the hour long massage and the hour of hydrotherapy sauna steam room several different types of showers 3 different relaxing pools and another round of massages. it was well worth the price. The bars and the restaurants were also amazing. So much to choose from. I do not think there was ever a meal I thought was just okay. Everything was delicious. My fiance also raved that the lobster was the best he has ever had. Our only major complaint were the beds. They were terribly uncomfortable. By the last night our backs ached and we were tossing and turing more than sleeping. Overall we had an amazing vacation and we would stay at an Excellence resort again. Even with the beds not being great the rest of the resort and experience far outweighs that one negative thing. I would highly recommend this resort to any of my friends or family.", "offset": [347, 474], "date": "2015-10-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b1541414-c6ac-4ee0-8098-91a0588569e9", "sentence": "Second Time Around and Still Excelente. This was our second vacation at EPC. We normally like to go to different all inclusive resorts but we came to EPC in May 2015 and found it to be so fantastic that we went again in May 2016 for my husband \u2019s 60th birthday. We once again booked the excellence club junior suite with garden or mountain view. We requested the same room we had the previous year but realized they may not be able to accommodate our request but did strongly request a ground floor room. They were not able to give us the same room as the previous year and put us in a second floor room in building 8. We explained to Edwin at concierge upon check in that while we completely understood not being able to have the same room we had really wanted a ground floor room and felt that should have been accommodated. Edwin then offered us a ground level room in building 14 with a plunge pool. Although the offer was appreciated we had wanted to be more centrally located at the resort so told him we would accept the room on the second floor. Before we started to unpack concierge called our room and offered us an excellence club swim up suite but it would not be available until Saturday we checked in late Thursday. Since we spend most of our time at the swim up bar this room was even better than the one we requested. So within 48 hours of check in they had us moved to an upgraded room at no extra charge. Although the start of our vacation was not as smooth as we would have liked Edwin did everything he could to accommodate us and we very much appreciated his understanding. The fact they made every attempt to get us a room on the ground floor is much more than many resorts would ever do. This is certainly excellent customer service and is just one thing that makes this resort so fantastic and why they have so many return guests. Service at restaurants and bars was again top notch. The staff is what makes this resort so great. They do their job with smiles and make you feel relaxed and are willing to make sure you get what you want. We would like to thank Basilio at the swim up bar Joel at the Lobster House Angel at The Grill Christian at Toscana Ricky at the buffet and Josy at Spice who served us on my husband \u2019s birthday. She made our evening very special. Our favorite restaurants were Spice Chez Isabele and The Grill but everything we had was excelente. The only thing I would criticize is they make too many waffles pancakes at the buffet and they are generally cold. I would suggest they make these items to order as they do with eggs. Food and drinks are endless at EPC. Even after a second time here there are still lots of food we have not even tried yet. We saw the Michael Jackson show \u2013 just as great the second time around the circus show and the perfect match show which was absolutely hilarious. Thanks to those brave couples who volunteered. The one thing we found that was not as good this year as the previous year was the mini bar service and housekeeping. The room was not cleaned as well this time around and the mini bar was not always stocked as we requested by our notes. The excellence club lounge seemed a bit disorganized this time and often it took quite some time for the food to be put out. We still however really enjoyed drinks and snacks at the club lounge. Club level is that extra to make you feel extra spoiled. A huge THANK YOU goes out to Roberto Puelo at guest services. We met Roberto the first year we stayed at EPC and we were so happy to see him again in May 2016. Roberto you are THE BEST. If you need or want anything just ask him nicely and if it is possible he will make it happen. He often appears out of nowhere to make sure you are having a great day and always asks if there is anything he can get or do for you. I am not sure he ever sleeps. He is so busy yet takes the time to find you and makes sure you are completely happy. Employees like Roberto are rare and EPC is fortunate to have him as an employee. He was a major reason why we returned to EPC for a second time and we hope to be back again but first we are going to try Excellence Playa Mujeres in October 2016.", "offset": [827, 903], "date": "2016-08-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "5c8bdc23-eaac-4434-af98-89a54d169912", "sentence": "Awesome 3 night getaway. As soon as we arrived to the hotel which was around 10 we were greeted with champagne and cold towels. I was thinking that maybe being so late we would n\u2019t get the full experience but that was not the case. The lobby was beautiful and they had fountains all over the property which gave the place a relaxing sound. The entire lobby bars and entertainment area is all open so always a great breeze and sound of the ocean. The hotel itself was beautiful and well maintained. Plenty of bars and restaurants we never really had to wait in line. The resort was at 80 capacity during our stay. Our room was a first floor swim out suite. In my opinion we had the best room. We were around the corner from the swim up bar so we could get there quick but no one could see our patio from the bar. We had a big grass area compared to other rooms and were right across from the lounge chairs in the water. Our patio had two chairs and a double beach bed. We could walk right off our back porch into the pool or to the bridge straight to the beach. They had plenty of umbrellas and beach huts. We never had to play the towel game. We moved from beach to pool to our patio every day. Our room was a quick walk or swim to 3 bars not including the one in our room. The room itself was great nice and updated with a soak tub in the middle and a large glass shower as well. There was maid service and turn down every day. Each room also had a fun cubby you put your room service dishes that can be cleared from the hall. This was you avoid all the trays sitting in the Hall way. We ordered room service the first night we got pizza and nachos. The pizza was good the nachos were eh just chips and nacho cheese haha o well. Our first day ended up being mostly rainy so we spent it at the spa. It did not disappoint. We got a 50min couples massage on special for 190 and I added a mini facial for 20. The whole process started with an hour hydro therapy. This consisted of different showers saunas and pool jets that massaged your whole body in different ways. Next was a heated chair with a head massage and scented oil facial wrap all before the massage. They really made an effort to make you feel relax and paid attention to detail. The beach was beautiful. They did have seaweed and the poor guys raked all day just to start over the next. Seems like a tractor would be a great investment. We were told due to some of the storms the water was rougher and therefore more seaweed. We went in the ocean once but swam more in the awesome pools and just took walks on the beach. Our hotel was secluded which was nice there were n\u2019t any properties on either side so we could walk either way and not have tons of other people. We also did n\u2019t need bracelets or to give a room number every time we got a drink or snack. If I had to come up with a negative it would have been the food. We were always able to find something we liked but some of the flavor was a little bland. We had omelets and Pizza every day which were delicious. But honestly we do n\u2019t go to all inclusives for the food. We go to relax and enjoy a beautiful place without having to worry about the cost of everything. This resort had the options for you to make it what you wanted it to be. They had shows and pool activities or you could lay at the beach and nap in the quiet. You could check out the list of daily activities provided to your room and in the lobby or you could do nothing. They had all types of up grades too to make your trip super romantic if you wanted. They had private cabanas on the beach you could rent with a fridge and champagne. And the banners for the doors if you were celebrating something too. For us this trip we wanted to have some drinks relax and get some sun all of which we accomplished. Everyone was friendly and helpful and at no point did I feel like the service was based on tips.

My wife and I stayed 5 nights for our honeymoon and absolutely loved this resort. We were greeted upon arrival with a cold towel and champagne. They were very helpful in helping us find our room and getting situated. Our room was a Junior Suite Garden View and it was very pleasant. The room layout was quite interesting with the bathtub in the middle of the room. The air conditioner worked great as long as the door was closed and the room was a comfortable temperature for our entire stay. The bed was nice and cozy. We loved the turn down service every evening. Overall we were very pleased with our room and how private quiet it was. The resort itself is absolutely beautiful. We spent most of our days laying on the beach. There were always plenty of chairs open and the beach was not crowded at all. It was nice to be able to sit in peace and enjoy the view. The drink service was good but could be a little much at times. We would have several different employees ask us if we wanted drinks every few minutes. The only thing we did not like about the beach was the solicitors. Every day there would be men with parrots and a monkey that would try to get people to take pictures and charge them for it. They even came so far as to walk up to the beach chairs and place a parrot on my shoulder without me asking. However they would usually go away if you ignored them long enough. The pools were great. They seemed to be a little more crowded than the beach but there were always open spots to relax. They were always clean and somewhat quiet. The food was good not great. do not expect the best meals every time. Our favorite dinner was Chez Isabele. We had a nice romantic dinner as part of our Honeymoon Package and the service was excellent. For breakfast and lunch our favorite was the Kitchen Table. We loved the fresh fruit they had available. Room service was not great. We ordered nachos on the first night and they came to us cold and stale so we did not bother with room service again. The entertainment every evening was so much fun. Our favorite was the circus show. They would also have live music by the bar before the shows which was nice to sit around and enjoy after dinner.

We booked our trip to the DR 10 days before we left. A family member recommended this hotel and we were so happy we booked it. We picked the cheapest garden view room and it was wonderful. When we arrived the room was spotless. We had a view of the pool our own balcony a nice bathroom and a soaker tub right in the bedroom. It may have been the least expensive option but certainly did not feel like it. Everything in the mini bar is included and there are also bottles of liquor in your room for mixing drinks that are included. They have a modern system with buttons for do not disturb and also a button for when you want someone to come clean right away. We used these and they worked. Each day someone cleaned the room and came for turn down service. Turn down service included offers from the spa which got better and better the longer we stayed. If you want to get a massage I would definitely recommend waiting to the end for the best offer. We found the cleaning service to be fantastic. My only wish was that they had removed the sand from the floor. The pool was great but a little chilly. Not sure if they heat the pool. It does stretch across the entire front of the resort and the most partying was happening at the pool bar. We also enjoyed the hot tub although it was only hot one day of our stay. We did ask about this but it never changed. Probably the only negative of our experience. The beach was great as well but the surf is rough. You can swim but lifeguards called people back pretty regularly and I found the surf a bit too strong for me. There are plenty of chairs and shade on the beach and we never had trouble finding somewhere to sit. Waiters also served us on the beach which was great. We did not try all the restaurants but found almost every one we did try to be great. Our favorites were The Lobster House and the Spanish tapas restaurant. Unfortunately the Lobster House was closed for lunch and dinner a few times when we wanted to go. When there is a big event they seem to pull staff from here which was a little disappointing. The only restaurant we found to be disappointing was Oregano the Italian. Honestly I would skip it it is pretty bad. We wished they had a typical Dominican restaurant instead of this one. There are shows every night and they are actually wonderful. There was also a fire show on the Thursday we were there. Our experience was made even better by the wonderful staff at Excellence. Diaz our server at the pool bar and around the pool came to know us by name and know our drinks. He talked to us everyday about our excursions and made us feel welcomed and special. Diaz was fantastic. Richard also waited on us by the pool bar and gave us excellent service at the French restaurant. Junior made us feel like family at the sports bar and in other restaurants.

We were at EPC January 24 3119 for our second year in a row. We just love this resort. When you know you know. This time we stayed in the Excellence Club side in the Master Suite which has 2 very comfortable double beds. I am very fussy when it comes to beds and EPC has great ones. Our room was in block 5 on the second floor over looking the cascade pool. We are beach people so we did n\u2019t use the pools but they have 2 pools on the Club side. We love the beach because we love watching the ocean and feeling the breeze. The EC beach is smaller than the non club side but the water is a bit calmer on the club side. The ocean is rough with a strong under tow but if you go around the bend to the right of the beach there is a area where the ocean is much calmer and is great for swimming. Rosy at the EC beach concierge is one of my favourite people at EPC. She will set you up with a great spot at the beach. Drink service is plentiful at the beach and pools and they have guys coming around taking food orders and delivering it to your lounger. Loungers are plentiful comfy and there is lots of palapa \u2019s For shade. No need to put out towels early in the morning to get a chair. The food at EPC is very good. Neither my husband and I got the least bit sick either time we \u2019ve been there. If you have dietary requirements they will go out of their way to help you the best they can but the language barrier can make it a bit interesting. Shout out to Jaritzabel for working with me this trip in this area. They have the best steak in the DRThe young people they have on the entertainment team work really hard to get people involved and interact with the guests. Shout out to JC and Yonathan for the dance. Rander from The Kitchen Table and Oregano was a breath of fresh air and really hit it off my hubby. All the staff are amazing and friendly and work so hard. They are part of the reason we came back for a second visit and will be back again. Be smart about your valuables when you leave your room and put everything in your safe and lock it. We use a lock on our safe called a Mylocke as a deterrent and for piece of mind. We had a professional photo shoot done with Henry and got some beautiful photos. He is very fun to work with and knows his stuff.

This resort is in the popular Uvero Alto region among a few other resorts and just down the road from Excellence El Carmen. 35 45 minutes from Punta Cana Airport. Upon arriving you receive the usual cool towel and champagne along with genuine smiles and polite friendly and helpful staff. Check in was quick and easy compared to others we have had to wait or have a 15 20 minute process. The resort layout is great in that you can walk almost anywhere within 5 6 minutes. Others we have visited could be up to 10 15 minute walk. Rooms are comfy with common amenities and services. Room service was enjoyed and service turn down are prompt and consistent. Restaurants are diverse and nicely located. Oregano is a great restaurant listed as a pizzeria but has many more other offerings. We had exceptional service here for lunch and dinner. The Lobster House has great seafood dinner menu with some vegetarian other options along with all other restaurants. Service was a bit slow and the restaurant fills up fast. Early reservation or waiting with a pager are the options. Again same as at all restaurantsWe visited this restaurant for breakfast as well and while the food was again very good the service was quite slow. Kitchen table is one of the options for breakfast. Service was n\u2019t great a few times but is obviously very dependent on who you get as a server. As a buffet it has just about everything you could imagine including egg omelette stations hot and cold foods and numerous juices. The Grill is stellar. Great steaks service and overall experience. While a bit thinner the steaks are every big as good as back home. Sides aps and desserts are tasty too. Martini Bar Prelude Bar. Beach BarsThe bars you \u2019l frequent when you see a show at the theatre stop by the lobby or while your waiting for a dinner reservation. Decent selection and common knowledge. The ocean breeze in the evenings is amazing at Prelude. The Sports Bar has great TVs excellent service but the menu leaves a bit to be desired. But in the end bar food fills the void. Las Olas is between the pool and beach snacks awesome pizza and other lunch treats. Chez Isabele leaves much to be desired. The service is slow and spotty. I appreciate the goal is a slow comfortable French meal experience but that also should come with an attentive server and some relative pace. Food was good but far from great. Personally my least favourite. Agave has fantastic Mexican food and very good service. Beautiful open space shared with The Grill. Best portions on the property and super great staff. Spice is a great little Asian spot on site with a very tasty menu and exceptional service. The tepanyaki room is a bit tricky to reserve but awesome in the end kudos Jorgi. The PolThe main pool is long and winding. A swim up bar exists but is a bit secluded away from the more fun section of the pool. The further you get down the main pool the quieter it gets. Then a bridge separates the next pool which is again quieter still. Fun staff and activities throughout the day. We found the tour people to be a bit more pushy than necessary and the service can be spotty. Francesco Brandor Wily and Richard are your best bets. And the pool side food is quite godGames are abundant and fun with an amazing special events team shout out to Junior and JoseThe disco is fun. Follow Junior he knows the way. Fun lil club. Drinks dancing great music and lasers. What else do you want. Watch the floor they allow glass inside. Theatre shows are decent fun and entertaining for 45 or so minutes. The fire show is wild. Great ways to wrap up a day. Coffee shop has all your daily caffeine needs plus iced gelato sweets and sandwiches. Front desk is a very helpful team. We did n\u2019t need much but many including Carlos were friendly fun and outgoing. After the fact we were told that groups over 6 may want to seek out reservations for restaurants to sit together however we never had much more than 30 45 minute wait and bars are near by. The beach is super close to everything on the resort property but due to the location and winds is often not safe to swim in. But it is a nice beach that is quite clean but some seaweed does come ashore. There is a nature area that has some ducks birds iguanas and a couple parrots.

We were blown away when we arrived. We had a lot of fun the first couple of days spent a lot of time in the pool at the cabanas and on the beach. The drinks were good the food was decent but we honestly preferred the room service since it was the most American style food we did try most of the restaurants some more than once. The language barrier was prominent in restaurants know your basic Spanish if you plan to go to this resort. My husband does not know any Spanish and I was translator for the week. The room was decent we were not crazy impressed we were hopeful for an upgraded room since it was our Honeymoon but we had no view and a standard room. They did give us a honeymoon sign and a welcome with champagne and cheese. Bed was mostly comfortable. We had plenty of cash and tipped everyone we talked to so they would keep providing excellent service to us. but we had SO many issues. The main thing that ruined our trip was we both came down with food poisoning. I became ill every night starting the 2nd day there. 3 days before we left I felt the worst I have ever felt in my life. scared I was going to have to go to a hospital. I avoided the doctor on site since reviews said not to go there. I spent 2 days in bed crying from stomach pains and running to the bathroom every 30 minutes so I could not sleep and had to travel home with food poisoning and no food in me. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. On top of it when we told the hotel I was sick they just told us to go buy a few things from their pharmacy at the resort EXTREMELY OVERPRICED. We ended up spending 75 on a few tiny travel size things in their pharmacy and none of it made me feel better. My husband spent one night vomiting every 30 minutes. He seemed to recover OK after a full day in the hotel bed but when we got back from our trip the food poisoning hit him as hard as it hit me. He missed a full week of work after being out for vacation for a full week. We went to the doctor and he confirmed we both had SALMONELLA from our trip. We are now stuck with 160 in medical bills from this vacation. I should also add my husband and I ate different food at every meal so there was not just one meal that got us both sick. It could have also been in the mixed drinks. We drank only bottled water. Other Issues Whirlpool tub in our room was very dirty stranger hairs and dirt coming out of the jets. I cleaned it out myself to use it but it was hard to manage temperature hot water poured out while cold water barely came out. I nearly burned my foot when I tried to get in it so I only used the tub once. The AC unit quit our last night there so we barely slept and woke up sweating. We did not bother calling maintenance since we were gladly heading home anyways. Room was very very humid throughout the week housekeeping put a dehumidifier in the room which helped but they need a better AC system. The iron provided in the room is a steam iron barely works so our clothes were wrinkled all week. Multiple people at the concierge desk treated us like we were idiots for asking a simple question. It got to the point where I dreaded talking to the concierge desk. Opening Closing times for restaurants and pools are listed differently all over the resort between signage paperwork in the room etc. do not bother asking they will be rude to you about it. Maintenance fixed our mini bar then called us and said they wanted to come back to check on it. Again acting like we are stupid for asking them to come back when in fact they called us. One reason we were excited for this resort is they have Hibachi which is our favorite. At check in they say you do not need a reservation. But you to have a reservation for hibachi and you have to make the reservation in person in a different building and get in line at 70 am to make it if you expect to get one. People wait in line for up to 4 hours hoping to get a reservation for that night. We did not bother to get in line so we never got to do Hibachi. There were a few instances where a staff member told us they had get back to us on a question or request we had and they never did. We ordered 2 Breakfasts to room service one morning they only brought 1 breakfast. After the 4th try of calling the spa I was able to schedule a massage. I had to cancel due to food poisoning and she tried to charge us for cancelling I disputed since its not my fault the resort got me sick and she did not charge surprisingly. The concierge said they had be to our room by 120 to pick up our luggage. They never showed up and did not answer when we called down to the desk. On top of it the elevator was broken so we had to carry all of our luggage down the 2 flights of stairs and I had food poisoning while doing this and had not eaten in 2 days. We had one instance where a server was venting to a bartender in Spanish. She was complaining about other guests using curse words. She was so loud and obnoxious even after another guest complained about her we gave up and went back to our room. Evening ruined. We had a lot of issues with our representative through the travel agency for booking excursions. I asked the concierge desk if we could book tours through them and they said we had to work with our representative. Eventually I saw a desk for Seasons Tours and we booked ziplining through them and he was very nice to work with. I do not understand why the concierge did not tell us we could go to the Seasons Tours desk. Again horrible customer service. When we arrived we noticed our sheets bedspread had stains on them almost looked like old blood. I called and they changed them. Another day we noticed some of the towels were VERY stained when we unraveled the swans they made on our bed. I complained and after laughing at me they replaced them but it was disgusting. TO TOP IT ALL OFF. My travel agent reached out to the resort to request a refund to make up for some of the medical bills and poor service and the resort only offered us a free upgrade during our next stay. NOT EVEN A FREE STAY. We will not be coming back let alone paying for another stay so why would we want an upgraded room. Oh and we had to use the upgrade within 1 year. So start saving up cause we need another few thousand to take advantage. If the resort had tried to make it up to us with a partial refund or even a free stay at another Excellence resort or something. I would not have posted this or shared on Facebok our horrible experience. Word of mouth is spreading and this resort will lose out on room nights because they did not feel we were worth a small refund.

However when I saw the asitant manager half way through my trip we were given a twin bedded room which was great. The Excellence Club however left something to be desired with some of the worst service I have ever encountered almost like being invisible to the staff of who there were many just standing around trying to look busy but completely ignoring clients. The guy in the Excellence Club bar could not even make a decent gin and tonic until we advised him how to do it. The Manga which was exclusivey for Club guests was one of the most disappointing restaurants I have ever been in. Twice I had to send back food as it was overcooked and not very hot disappointed to say the least. No apologies so we left and went to another restaurant.

Un fortunately only open for breakfast and lunch though which meant we were then limited as to where we could eat. Lobster House and French were great but apart from that very mediocre. Our second week however was much better. Staff seemed more aware of clients needs and were a little more profesional in their approach. Our biggest disappointment was with the management who when advised that I had been verbally abused by another guest on more than one occasion and my husband physically assaulted by the same bully did absolutely nothing to rectify the matter and I had to move my place by the pool in order to avoid this horrible man. A little more concern would have gone a long way. Whilst we had a very nice time at this hotel I fear we will not return. The entertainment was so loud and the saxophonist I am afraid was absolutely awful. So much nice music available and we were subjected to raucous singing and interminable back ground music in the restaurants and bars.

Decided we would like to try for a upgrade to a ocean front plunge pool. Attended reception and organised what we thought was the same and agreed a price. Taken to be shown room the next day which turned out not to be what we had asked for or agreed on. Was a swim up in a dark corner with little sun as was more or less completely shaded. Was told there was nothing else that could be done. Was a bit disheartened and kept our original room as told no plunge pools would be coming available. It dropped our views of the the excellence team and made it just a mediocre holiday from now. 1 day later received a call from Matais the supervisor to go see him at the club reception. Attended and WOW what a asest that man is to the Excellence group. A room had been found and would be available the next day. Price agreed and moved to room the following day. Matais is the definition of customer services and is worth his weight in gold. He checked up on us for rest of holiday and made sure we wanted for nothing. Now for the rest Rooms Excellent.

We loved our stay at the Excellence Punta Cana. Last year we stayed at Excellence Riviera Cancun and enjoyed it so much that we decided to try another Excellence. We chose Excellence Punta Cana because it was such a good deal 70 CAD less per person than ERC for a standard club room. And overall we preferred EPC to ERC. We have been to other adult only resorts in the Dominican in the same price range and find that EPC is a step above. What is important for us on an all inclusive beach holiday is comfortable and quiet room good food good wine good service walkable beach beach chairs always available and plenty of a la carte restaurants not really buffet fans and a relaxed luxury vibe. This resort was perfect for us. We stayed for one week over the x mas holidays in a standard club room. We were upgraded to ocean view. First time I have ever gotten an upgrade and I have been to over 25 resorts. NiceResort. What a great layout. Never had the impression the resort was full. Loved the tropical feel of the resort. Loved how you could see and hear the ocean almost everywhere from the resort. Loved walking in the gardens with all the birds and plants. Very relaxing luxurious vibe. Room. Room was just fine. Not as spacious as ERC but had all the same amenities. I preferred the room at ERC but was happy with the room at EPC. I liked that the air conditioning was above the bed and towards the room and not directly on you. The only thing missing would be a door for the bathroom there is a glass door on the toilet. I would not come to this resort with a friend and share a room for that reason. It \u2019s OK for couples. Food The food surprised me. It was good and sometimes very good. It was better than ERC in my opinion. It was the best food I have had in the Dominican Republic and we did not get sick at all on this visit. The breakfasts were average. We mostly ate at Magna which had a beautiful view of the ocean and awesome service. Went to lobster house only once as it was not as good as Magna. Also tried the buffet which was fine. For lunch we mostly ate at Oregano as we like a sit down lunch and it was the only a la carte open for lunch. I know most people prefer a quick lunch at the beach or buffet. But we prefer a proper long sit down lunch. It would have been nice if Magna also served lunch but that was not the case. Lunch at Oregano was average. It did not wow us like for instance lunch at El Dorado Sensimar. but it was edible and service was excellent. We also had lunch on xmas day at Las Olas beach restaurant when they roasted a whole pig. It was very good and there was live music toWe really enjoyed diner. We ate anywhere between 630 and 70 and never had to wait for a table. We loved the food at Magna ate there 2 times but the restaurant d\u00e9cor was boring as we ate indoors to avoid the mosquitoes. We loved the lobster house and ate there twice. The grilled lobster was yummy and not overdone. We always ordered a second one. Oink oink. But be sure to wear bug spray if you want to enjoy your dinner. Chez Isabele was a nice experience. Great atmosphere and food. The rib eye was really good. We also went to the Grill. It has a lovely inner courtyard with a nice hacienda ambiance. The meat was served with great sauces. We did not try the other restaurants for dinner. Drinks. We are wine drinkers. We were happy with the house wines. You could buy upgraded wines if you wanted but the prices were just silly. Shame. If they lowered their prices they might sell more. The house red merlot was very drinkable. The white chardonnay was ok. The white bubbly was really nice. The rose bubbly served at the excellence club beach bar was very good. We also like a good martini. The martini bar delivered in that department. There was also Gray Goose vodka available at the excellence club bars. In our room bar we asked for a bottle of Baileys for our morning coffee and it was promptly delivered. There is no wine in the room bar so we ordered bottles of red and white from room service instead. And for a nice treat you can get a fresh coconut with or without alcohol at the beach bars. There were always some available. Beach. Wow. Stunning wild beach. Beautiful waves. Hardly any sea grass. Could not always swim in front of the resort because of the red flag but just around the bend you could. It was really nice that there were no other resorts nearby or any vendors. When you went for a walk it was like been on a deserted island. We actually walked all the way to Excellence Playa Carmen. Very modern looking glad we did not choose to stay there not a fan of modern for a beach vacation. We loved the comfortable beach loungers at the excellence club beach. There were always some available under a palapa around 930 when we got to the beach. The beach concierges would set up your loungers and help you with anything you needed. They were great. Staff. Plenty of well trained staff that went above and beyond. \u201c Excellent \u201d service. I was impressed. Mosquitoes and no see ums The only negative thing about this resort \u2026. The days that it did not rain the resort sprayed and there was no bug problem. But on the days it rained the resort did not spray understandably and the bugs had the upper hand. YOU become the all you can eat buffet. I came home with the most bug bites ever. But this would not stop me from returning to this resort. I loved this resort. Can not wait to return. EPC vs ERC. Both resorts I would return to. But I preferred EPC because of the beach and the length of the beach frontage.

The resort is spotless and set in wonderfully kept grounds the beach is clean and exquisitely long great for walks. There are an abundance of sun loungers and palapas. The sea was very rough and we had red flags every day but it did not spoil our enjoyment of the beach. On arrival we were presented with two happy and jovial bellboys and two glasses each of champagne. Most welcome as we were delayed by a snowstorm and arrived 3 hours late. We were whisked off to the Excellence Club concierge by Joan where we were checked in painlessly then taken up to our suite. Ordered room service as it was almost midnight and the food was excellent. We would like to show special recognition to Wilmy who we met on our first morning he directed us to the Magna Club Restaurant exclusive to Excellence Club members. Wilmy is the Excellence Club pool concierge and he provided wonderful service all week and nothing was too much for him to do for us. Thank you Wilmy for your excellent attentive service and great conversation during our stay. We had breakfast at the Magna Club out on the deck every morning looking out at the beautiful beach and surf the food was top drawer and the service provided by the Magna crew supervised by Jhony was always great. Special shout out to Jose Miguel who served us most mornings and on our first evening also at the Magna Restaurant which was unforgettable. A la Carte lunch at Oregano was great we ate there twice but also had lunch delivery at both the beach and Excellence Club pool. Also tried the Grill twice first time service was fantastic. 2nd time they were very busy so not as attentive but the food was good on both occasions. Agave Mexican was also great food. Thanks to Alberto Angel and Minerva who served us at these locations. For our last night we returned to the Magna Club Restaurant food was excellent and great service from Eddy capped off a truly wonderful vacation. When we were not on the beach enjoying the great beach waiter service Jefrey at Cielo bar made us delicious drinks and taught us some more Spanish to go with the few words we already knew. We finished off most of our evenings with Soriano in the Magna Bar where we met some great people. The Martini Bar was also nice but the hotel allows smoking here and in the theatre area where the evening shows are and this was the only negative for us personally.

While the service and staff are for the most part excellent the rest of the resort fails to live up to the name. Day by day follows for the TLDR crowd skip to the last paragraph. Arrival from the airport was good we purchased the round trip option through the hotel and were greeted upon landing by a nice driver in a late model Chevy Suburban. During the ride the driver offered us each beers and cold towels as it was quite warm outside. Check in at the hotel was more of the same. Bags were waiting in our room when we got to it the concierge staff was very accommodating and I can not say anything bad up to this point. Unfortunately that will be where the praise stops. On our first night we went to The Grill restaurant. Two hours after ordering and after asking the staff about our order twice the food arrived cooked wrong apparently medium rare means well done but after a 2 hour wait I was not about to complain lest I not get my food at all. Steak quality I would rate as less than what can be bought at Wal Mart and the \u201c New York Strip \u201d. was about a 4 oz cut. Upon finishing up at the restaurant my wife and I returned to our room to find the power was out in our room. A trip to concierge and a 20 minute wait later our power was restored. On day two we started off by going to the Aroma coffee sweets shop. The coffee was ok but the interesting part was that all the coffee drinks both hot and cold came in white 8 oz solo style plastic cups. Weird but sure whatever. For lunch we decided to order room service. The hummus with pita chips turned out to be some sort of neon yellow bland paste sprinkled with paprika served with a side of stale sliced baguette masquerading as the aforementioned pita chips. The nachos were laughably worse. Far from the appetizing picture shown in the menu of freshly made tortilla chips with pico de galo what we received can best be described as stale movie theater nacho chips liberally sprayed down with ez cheese 3 jalapeno slices and a glob of what was apparently supposed to be guacamole. After this we went out to the pool area to hang out with some friends. Returning to our room to change for dinner once again our power was out in the room. Another trip to concierge another 20 minute wait for maintenance to turn our power back on. Power is restored we finish up getting ready and head off to dinner at the \u201c Sports Bar \u201d. Ordered the Cesar salad and was greeted with a romaine salad slathered in an odd amalgamation of what can best be described as tartar and sriracha sauce. After dinner we returned to our room to yet again discover that the power was out. Again we go to concierge wait 20 minutes for maintenance get the power restored wait for the room to cool down to a temperature that is capable of being slept in and go to sleep. After restoring the power the maintenance man and concierge blamed us for having our phone chargers in. Although confused that something like a phone charger could cause a circuit breaker to trip we took the advice and my wife and I took up the practice of unplugging all electronics in the room whenever we were not occupying it. Day three. The wife and I decided that a spa trip might be in order. We booked the 100 minute intensive destress couples ritual which came with a free 1 hour hydrotherapy session. This was my first time in a spa environment but my wife has back problems and gets massages at home in the states on a weekly basis. We both agreed that the hydrotherapy was a good experience. The massage ritual on the other hand can be best described by my wife as \u201c 90 minutes of applying lotion and oil with 10 minutes of somebody randomly prodding pressure points. It was quite obviously something that anybody could do after watching a ten minute youtube video \u201d. We finished up at the spa returned to our room and to our surprise once again the power was out. Cue the usual concierge 20 minute wait for maintenance get blamed that we are causing it to happen even though we have literally unplugged every electronic device in the room capable of being unplugged. Explain to the maintenance guy that nothing is plugged in his response is \u201c OK Bye \u201d. Day four. Booked reservations for the Spice restaurants Hibachi grill dinner. Was pleasantly surprised when the food we received matched the description of what was on the menu. Return to the room and once again No power. At this point concierge and the maintenance guy are just visibly and verbally annoyed with us. Still nothing plugged in in our room still somehow our fault. 20 minutes later the powers back on. Day five. At this point you pretty much know what is coming the food menu is filled with misleading descriptions and straight up incorrect pictures while the food itself is of sub par to middling quality. Come back for dinner and the power is out go through the same old routine wait 20 minutes get it turned back on get told not to use any of our outlets in our room that we are already not using. You know the usual. Day six. Checkout time rolls around and we once again head into concierge only to be told that the reason our power went out last night no mention of the other 8 times it had occurred on the trip was because my wife had apparently tried to use a curling iron in our room. Upon informing concierge that we did not bring a curling iron the issue was promptly dismissed and the list of ancillary charges to the room was thrust in our direction before we were ushered out to the main lobby to await our pick up to head to the airport. The cherry on top of the sundae here is that the hotel staff attempted to load our luggage into the wrong vehicle until they were questioned about it. make of that what you will. We arrived at the airport boarded our flight and I have commenced with writing this review. Something you may have noticed was that at no point during the review have I discussed alcohol. The alcohol situation is best broken down by beer wine and liquor respectively. Beer is incredibly inconsistent what is available one day may not be the next. Wine is a mix of middling quality Whites Reds and a single Rose offering. Liquor can be broken down in general by top shelf here being middle to bottom shelf anywhere else. On the whiskey bourbon side you have got Jack Daniels and Jim Beam. Scotch is Johnie Walker Black label. Gin is Bombay Sapphire. Vodka is Stoli Smirnof. Rum is a split between Bacardi and Barcelo. A word of advice If you order a drink and do not specify and see the pour of liquor you are going to get a well drink. Additionally all of the drinks are incredibly watered down. If you are into mixed drinks your best option is quite simply to make your own drinks with the contents of the in room liquor and mixers from the minibar. Seriously. TLDR summary. This is a mid to low tier resort masquerading as a luxury one. The food is painfully mediocre at best and does not match the description or the pictures of the menu to the point that if someone tried selling these items individually they had be taken to court for false advertising. The drinks are weak and of well quality the majority of the time. The spa is underwhelming. If you have an issue with your room it is probably going to get blamed on you and disregarded by the staff. Everything is quantity over quality and if that is your thing you might enjoy it assuming there is not something inexplicably wrong with your rooms electrical system that will be blamed on you regardless of your actions. Bottom Line I can not in good conscience recommend this resort and my wife and I will not be returning.

We made our first visit to Excellence Punta Cana after looking at some other resorts. It exceeded our expectations. It \u2019s going to be hard to go to another resort after visiting here. From the minute we pulled up someone was waiting at the front walkway with Champagne and a \u201c Welcome Home \u201d such a nice touch to be greeted with. When we decided to book a resort we wanted a swim up room so we booked one here. Rooms are amazing we had a room in building 10 non club the view of the pool and the ocean from there was amazing. A quick few steps and you were in the pool. Pool is huge and has views of the ocean from it. The resort was only at about 40 percent capacity with travel fears around the Corona virus so finding a chair was very easy. even if it \u2019s full I do n\u2019t see an issue. Chairs beds around the beach and pool are very comfortable. The rooms and the whole resort was super clean always people working to maintain it. Beach is beautiful and we walked it each day the only thing is the Ocean is very rough here and was red flagged everyday you can go in but your best not to go past your waste you can walk up the beach 10 15 min and there is a place to swim that is much calmer. The first night we arrived we went to the Grill restaurant we were served by Miguel I ca n\u2019t say enough about Miguel it was awesome to start our first night out with him he could not be more friendly and helpful I asked which Steak he would suggest he gave me two options I picked one and had an amazing dinner then Miguel shows up with the second steak he had offered I ate it too food was amazing not only here but at all the restaurants. Our very last supper at the Lobster house and who do we run into but Miguel beautiful way to end. The shows were very good the pre entertainment in the lobby was as good and sometimes the highlight of the night. The only thing I would say is that it would have been better shows with more live singing then dancing and lip syncing. would have liked to see the post show entertainment run a bit longer but overall very enjoyable. I have to give a shout out to one person in particular Dany Boy at the Sol bar. What an amazing guy he did everything for us and went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. One day we asked if there was a way to get food sent to us at the pool so we did n\u2019t have to leave he took our order right on the spot and went and got our food never had to worry about a drink he would even walk over to our room and deliver a drink sometimes without asking. He made out stay that much more special I hope he works for Excellence for many years to come. When we were leaving we all got a picture together before we headed back to Canada we exchanged info so we could connect later. We arrived in Toronto late to get a message asking if we arrived home safely wow that \u2019s above and beyond. One of the best server industry people I have ever met.
