It had been a long time since I have been to PR and to be fair I do not generally favor this section of the island I prefer the more remote resorts in places like Aguadila or on the East SEast coasts. This was a business trip with my company and about 70 of us we did our meetings here and generally entertained here. Very close 5 mins to airport. So convenient. The room was spacious and had a nice view. It was clean and the shower worked well. The dated smaller TV was not great but who wants to sit in a room in PR anyway right. The bed was not comfortable for me or my wife I think it was too soft. There is a safe a fridge in the room which is good. The beach was full of seaweed kelp of some sort as was the water someone told my wife this was a seasonal winter issue. So you needed to walk about 100 feet west to get to a clear beach and beautiful water. I did not use the pools but my wife did and they were nice with bars etc. My company had a party the first night in an area just off the beach. Was a great night with a live band. The food was not very good and not local but that could be more about what my company ordered. The bar service was good at this private party. We ate dinner the next night at the Italian restaurant off the lobby. Service and food was excellent. After dinner we went to the club downstairs which apparently is a hot local club. And it was like any major city dance club. Had a lot of fun dancing there. That party goes until about 330am. We had another private lunch and mixology event our last day and those guys were great. Great service and drinks. The breakfasts before our work sessions were next to the ballroom and were very good. The ballroom for meeting was generally good thought the AC was very loud when turned on. The casino is small. I am not a big gambler so not much more to say about that. There is entertainment in the lobby and lots of guests seem to have fun drinking at the bar and enjoying the music. There is also a Starbucks and a number of boutiques stores off the lobby. Old San Juan a must visit is about 10 mins away via cab I think 20. I have mixed feelings about the front desk service. It was definitely slow at check in. And while they took care of things brought to them I am not sure anyone ever smiled or greeted me in a way that I felt welcome. Not being picky maybe it is just a cultural thing though my wife is Spanish and grew up in PR and I think she felt the same way. But other service restaurants stores private events was very good. Overall I had say that if you were to stay in that area it is an ok place to stay. We wanted local food and found a small restaurant informal in the strip mall about 50 feet west where we got all the local food that we love very inexpensively. And members of my group went to Metropole out of hotel to the left about 100 feet or soand enjoyed it it was recommended by my wifes family from there. Bottom line Not a bad place to stay if you want to stay in that area.", "offset": [1741, 1829], "date": "2015-02-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "59b84aa6-9a66-4fa2-8107-9c4a9a633baa", "sentence": "Big Picture folks Big picture. When I stayed at the El San Juan Hotel I was apprehensive from all the negative reviews. We stayed there for a gorgeous weekend in February of 2015. I will make this easy for you. If you are 1 the kind of person that loves to stay in a hotel where everywhere you turn and look it is immaculate and without blemish this hotel is not for you. If you 2 like to spend your days and nights curled up with a book in a relaxing QUIET pool and lounge in a quiet lobby in the evening this hotel is not for you. If you 3 are not a drinker this hotel is probably not for you. We have a 2 year old son and we had a blast. Yes the room was clean but did all the bathroom tiles look spotless. No. and so what. My wifes family is from San Juan. The real San Juan is gritty a little rough on the edges but in the grand scheme of things beautiful. There was a DJ by the cool pool and access to Wave Runners and the beach. We had a blast. The lobby is the place to be at night with live music and dancing. If you focus on the cracks in the concrete do not come here. If you want to come to a hotel with a young hip vibe and immerse yourself in San Juan culture and its Island chic vibe. It am not pretty but its damn sure beautiful.", "offset": [952, 1018], "date": "2015-02-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "168bed65-fade-4588-8e22-f63aeace8f4a", "sentence": "Older large hotel near airport. We were at the Hilton \u2019s El San Juan Resort last year for a conference and returned this January for the same event. It is near the airport a bit away from the old San Juan so you have to drive there or take a taxi. It is on the beach in an area of many hotels and restaurants and is an older Hilton that looks like it would have fit into Miami Beach in the 1970 \u2019s. It is certainly a hopping place at night perhaps drawing in a lot of locals who enjoy the casino the music and restaurants. The restaurants are very nice and there are a few of them to choose from. The shops in the arcade are nice. The lobby is a bit dark and you enter into an area of the casino from the drive. Elevators are fast but one stopped mid floor and when we pushed the alarm button no one came. It seemed the button was not working but eventually the elevator went back to the lobby level and we got out. The pool area is very nice with several pools comfortable covered lounge chairs a swim up bar a spa jet pool and very well kept up grounds. The beach is generally clean but the water has a lot of weeds and can be murky if waves are high. I noticed the waves were not as high as last year but the sea here is fairly tidal and there is movement on that north coast according to the winds and weather. I was told that the sea is calmer in the summer months. However if you envision the transparent blue tranquil waters of the Caribbean Sea you have to go to the other side of the island. As for the rooms \u2013 we found much the same small irritations as we did last year Members of our group had many of the same complaints that I have about that hotel. The water in the shower was not always hot and if so it took a long time to heat up. The air conditioning was freezing so I posted a sign on the thermostat to ask the maids not to turn it on. That worked but then there is a musty smell without it on. The maids did a generally good job but did strange things like leaving pillows on the night table instead of on the bed leaving a bag of trash outside our door for a day and not picking up laundry. I had to bring it down to the lobby. The TV boasts a selection of movies when you turn it on and yet when we called the lobby to ask how to receive them we were told the movie function does not work. There is a coffee maker which is nice and they supply you with coffee but not tea. We were in room 817 a large bright room with a king bed and a slight view of the sea when you walk up to the window. The bed was comfortable. The bath is small and has only a shower with shower curtain and one sink. There is a sofa and small table night tables a safe mini bar two closets ironing board and iron. They do not provide robes but they gave us plenty of towels each day. I was comfortable enough and was not irritated by neighboring room noise. Prices are fair in general. This is not a luxury hotel. We found the people working there to be friendly especially the valet and the baggage service. They were very responsive. I would not come back here for a vacation unles I had some good reason to such as to attend a conference.

To make it real The beach side lunch took 55 minutes between inititial drink to lunch we ordered 4 hot sandwitches. we would have been OK with the delay had the sandwitch arrived hot possible even warm but they came back stiff cold. The bar in the lobby had a special event Friday with all seating reserved for non guest what about the hotel guest where do we sit. Now the kicker we ask for the Bartender drinks we two young kids with us it is a family hotel after all he looks at the kids as explains sure once I done setting the bar but kids can be here.

The best of the hotel is the staff. they are very friendly and helpful. I have to mention specially Jesie who took care of us since we arrived.

When we arrived we had to search for a bellman to help us transport our bags from the taxi into the hotel. Our room was not ready but we were able to store our bags and change to head for the pool and beach. There are two pool areas. One is more kid friendly. Be prepared to WAKE UP AT 50am to secure a chaise lounge bed with with a canopy or even a regular chaise. There are also ONLY 2 umbrellas for one pool area and 3 for the other pool area. You need to get a wristband for towels and to have back and forth access from the pool to the public beach. it costs 10 day to get an umbrella with your beach chair. You can Jet ski Parasail or Banana Boat for a fee. For 500 day you can get one of 3 private wooden hut cabanas by the pool. The food offerings by the pool are limited but decent. Food and beverage service on the beach is very slow one waitress for whole beach areaThere is a small fitness facility on the 10th top of the tower floor. It has no windows and only two treadmills and few other aerobic and standard gym equipment pieces. There were no cleansing wipes for pre or post equipment use to wipe the perspiration andor sunscreen off the equipment. I was in the gym everyday and never saw an attendant there. There is a very small Spa next to it which I only used on my last day to shower after I had checked out earlier. I had to pay 10 to use a towel. There are 6 very varied restaurants several are pricey and a casino small on the premises as well as shops and Starbucks. There is a large lobby lounge with a bar. The breakfast buffet was ok. It was included in my package and was offered over a 5 hour timespan. The concierge desk was helpful but under staffed. There was consistently a long wait. In addition the hotel wifi access was spotty. I will not be back to this one on my next visit. Island Travel Tips AT is the main service provider for the island. Verizon does not work.

The main entrance of the hotel is through the bar of the casino which is quite loud with tacky. I was happy to finally find a side entrance through the shopping area to use instead. Though the front of the hotel was overstimulating and gaudy the back was the exact opposite. The pool areas are well kept with lots of lounges and cabanas that line the pool adjacent to the beach. There are lovely green areas that are well kept on the side by the low rise buildings. The help was mostly very pleasant and wiling wanting to help. The high rise where the suites are located was noisy over the weekend with many bachelor and bachelor parties.

The hotel staff inside and outside were 12s on a scale of 1 10. This is especially true of Johnathan on the check in desk who completely filled us in on all amenities available and offered extremely welcoming and professional service. Also very true of Jesie who provided above and beyond services with our daily lounge chairs by the Encanto pool. We have never had such warm professional and close attention while at a property of this size. Grounds are lovely tropical and very clean every day. We selected an older room in the Garden Lanai section vs a 5th floor main tower room because we wanted a balcony for morning coffee which main tower rooms did not have and because 5th floor just barely provided an ocean view. Mostly just a view of the roof top of the outdoor facilities and grounds. A room above the 7th floor or so should be better in main tower. It was notable how very clean the grounds were each day and as early risers we observed the staff working diligently to make it so. What took a toll on the 3 days we were there were guests about 10 12 on Sat afternoon who were hollering and foul mouthed for 20 30 min at a time by the Olympic pool which is usually peaceful and quiet we have stayed here about 5 6 times. It was so obnoxious that several guests had to leave to avoid confrontations and we just tried to ignore it until they took off to the Encanto Pool. In all my stays over the last 30 years I have never seen this kind of clientele at this peaceful gorgeous place. It was sad to see.

They may have been trying to hard to have a vegas style party with a MUCH older crowd. It was an odd set up and they should have just played some fun music throughout the day. The room also lacked essentials like a full size mirror garbage in the bathroom and a mini bar. These seem like responsible requests for am 70plus room a night. The lobby was nice but extremely loud and cold. We originally booked a room at the Ritz Carlton and should have kept it.

Excellent staff. Repeat guests to this hotel but my first time. We were looking forward to beach dining casino dancing in the lobby. I guess the concept has changed with the new owner and that brought about some changes we did not like 1. Casino closed so that put a damper on those in our group who wanted to gamble. 2. Casino workers picketing at front entrance and on beach. They harassed you when getting your towels and were annoying with chanting. Most of the time you really could not hear them over the crashing waves or music at the pool. By the end of our stay the bullhorns were taken away so it was fine. Two things should have happened the hotel should have let us know the casino closed they gave cab fare to the Ritz and the protesters should not have punished the guests. Owner and Union lawyers need to work it out and stop using the workers as pawns. The new concept brought much higher drink prices and fewer restaurants Marea was terrible so we canceled our Meat Market reservation and ate off site the rest of the stay. Polside option of Tuna Crudo over breadfruit was super if you added a squeeze of lime or salt. The hotel gave free drinks and massages at the pool but if you were not there to hear about it you lost out. They were always coming around the pool with little tidbits and that was really nice. Also we were supposed to be given letters upon arrival notifying us of the issues with the protesters and we were not. They gave us a credit to our room for some inconveniences we experienced because we paid a very high room rate and the rates dropped due to protesters so that was helpful. The local dancing was good on Friday but slower on Saturday. This was one of the main reasons for staying there so that was a bit disappointing. I guess they changed the policy on admission for locals. Too bad because that is a unique feature they should not mess with.

I explained the situation and told the front desk person that I had emailed the credit card to a manager and that it was 10 pm I was in bed and not coming down stairs. She hung up on me and a few moments later I get a call from Yvone Ramos saying that I needed to come down to the lobby at that moment and provide a form of payment or I would have to leave the hotel that night. She could not have been more RUDE and condescending. I had to rexplain the situation to a third person and she had absolutely no sympathy or compassion whatsoever. I have stayed at DOZENS of Hilton properties this year alone and as a guest relations manager Miss Ramos was shockingly awful to deal with. I had to take a deep breath and regain my composer so I would n\u2019t completely loose my cool on her over the phone. Threatening to kick me out of the hotel. Is that how the El San Juan hotel deals with its guests. If you read tripadvisor you will see a flurry of emails stating how rude some of the employees are. Miss Ramos takes the cake on that \u2026 I\u2019ve never written in to Hilton before but this situation I felt needed to be heard. Her lack of customer service sympathy and compassion is something I think the Hilton brand needs to be aware of. To treat a guest the way I was treated a diamond member with 115 nights in Hilton hotels this year notwithstanding is pathetic and shameful and should be addressed. She will obviously have her side of the story but trust me rude unprofessional and it is clear that Miss Ramos does not care about her guests or the Hilton hospitality statement \u201c To be the most hospitable company in the world by creating heartfelt experiences for Guests \u2026 \u201d.", "offset": [872, 1237], "date": "2020-01-02", "cpt": "6", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 55, "uid": "5eeb8f51-8303-4543-b22f-d307de1cfc82", "sentence": "do not Pay for an Expensive Room. Ocean Views are a Struggle at Best. CONS\uf08f. I usually begin with the Pros but in this case the cons are Big Time\uf08f. I paid a HUGE premium for an ocean view rom\uf08f. The room I received had 90 view of a parking lot the busy main street a huge tree ugly rooftops and other buildings it was really sad. \uf08f. The room view was NOTHING like the room pictured in my room confirmation\uf08f. I guess if I had a periscope strapped to my head at a 90 degree angle then I might have had a true ocean view but hey who knew\uf08f. The ocean can be viewed if you walk up to the far right corner of the window. There is NO ocean view from the center of the rom\uf08f. This building was originally built in 1958 and the attempt to renovate it seems to have fallen short\uf0d8. Feels like an old building with a new paint job new but cheap bathroom and many missing room amenities lack of towel bars etc. \uf0d8 Lobby areas very dark\uf0d8 Room is poorly lit with inadequate lighting throughout \uf0d8. Not enough plug outlets for modern day traveling for charging your devices\uf0d8 Dingy stained carpet\uf0d8 Window glass very dirty on both the inside and outside\uf0d8 Water leaks and pools up into the bedroom vestibule area when taking a shower\uf0d8. There are hidden speakers throughout the property outside that play a 247 recorded loop of birds chirping. Too loud fake and tinny sounding. If it was softer and less frequent it might be a nice thing NOTES. Rooms Offered by the Hotel\uf08f Ocean View\uf08f. Pool view \uf08f. Drinks average 120 tips extra \uf08f. Do n\u2019t forget there \u2019s a daily taxes and fees paid directly to the hotel mine was. 450 daily\uf08f. Breakfast is NOT INCLUDED. RUNS AROUND 250 p plus gratuity. I recommend going across the stret\uf08f. The way the hotel building is positioned on the property sideways It appears there are very few truly ocean view rooms. What the website describes as \u201c pool view \u201d is pretty much the side of the building my room was on deceivingly labeled as an ocean view. Again garbage view minimal and obstructed pool viewPROS\uf08f. The exterior of the property is stunning and beautiful from the moment you drive into the entrance and beyond \uf08f. Service at every level is attentive every employee seems to always be happy smiling and \uf08f. Hotel restaurants are pretty god\uf08f. The pools are as beautiful as they appear in the website pictures\uf08f. They have a fairly new state of the art gym fully equipped in two story building plus roof top area behind the main pool. It \u2019s like being in a high end gym. The gym is awesome\uf08f Short walking distance to other very good and not as expensive off site. restaurants\uf08f. If you like the night scene it gets pretty cranking \uf08f. The bed and bed linens are high quality and comfortable\uf08f Maid service friendly but they start very early and bang on the doors so post. your \u201c do not disturb sign \u201d until you leave the rom\uf08f Room has an espresso \u2013 coffee machine and daily free bottled water mini fridge\uf08f.

Very nice beach walk through a gate at the pool area free towels chairs and umbrellas on the beach\uf08f. Awesome independant jet ski rental right there toCONCLUSION\uf08f. Not sure I would repeat due to being ripped off on the room description and having paid a premium view room price for a crap view rom\uf08f. Although I was ripped off I will remain objective and honest on the pros I mentioned. If you plan a visit here pay for the cheapest room and enjoy the outside property it \u2019s beautiful and the staff if so friendly. \uf08f. I also noticed beware that the ocean FRONT villas you can not see the ocean from a first floor unit as it \u2019s blocked by the dunes and or tall bushes. You \u2019l see the ocean from the second floor on some or most of them \uf08f. This place has a ton of mostly positive reviews I guess if you have lots of great vacation sex maintain a light buzz from the drinks and enjoy the pools the beach etc low expectations for the room you \u2019l be leaving with a happy feeling too.", "offset": [896, 978], "date": "2020-02-08", "cpt": "6", "category": "facility"}]}
