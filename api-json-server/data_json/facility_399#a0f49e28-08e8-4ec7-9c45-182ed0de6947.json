No greeting no champagne no cookie or cup cake just attitude first thing out of greeters mouth. First snafu was booking on a prepaid suite upon check in was told my reservation was not paid for. Even after showing my receipt i was still told my room was not paid for. After Brandishing my paid receipt was told my reservation was not paid for but they would let me check in if they could run my card again. They ran it 5 times and could only secure one night of my stay. M yank and already approved this transaction and was returning their unauthorized charges and preventing fraud. They attempted many times to take MORE money than what my booking was totaled too. After securing one nights lodging I refused to stay in this hotel more than i had too the people were very rude upon check in. The front desk has a large i do not care about it attitude. And it shows in management and housekeeping and all around upkeep of the property. The lobby is very nice and up to date. They say they serve starbucks coffee in lobby. But its not its cheap knockoff with a starbucks cup. The elevators are old matching the building. They are in need of paint and a overhaul. The room a bi level suite was a complete dump. I ve seen nicer rooms in motel6. The paint is peeling from everywhere the wallpaper is pealing The toilet is as loud as a freight train the bathroom door does not open or close all the way leaving one to sit sideways on the LOO. The breakfast fair on the executive level is nothing more than stern heated hours made ago food. On top of being a complete wreck in the food area bus were flying and present. IF you work late nights and get back to the property in the wee hours. You will not find parking save for blacked out spaces that scream of foul play. The 400 lb acne ridden manager is a great image for the hilton brand as well. Hiltons are for people who travel a lot and expect a level of quality and care otherwise we would be staying at cheaper less attractive properties. This was a complete failure on this properties behalf. RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. YOU WILL BE OVER BILLED. UNDERBOKED and a hilton regular would barf at this place. In town for the whole week i refuse to stay here another night.", "offset": [1059, 1105], "date": "2015-06-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "5f6a7e8c-3075-4c75-bbb6-7a910227662b", "sentence": "Probably a 35. I debated about the rating but still have mixed feelings. On the plus side I was pleasantly greeted by the quite nice front desk staff. As I had checked in online I asked for a key and was told that my iPhone worked a a key both for the elevator they had placed me in an executive floor and the room. This was nice conceptually but the key worked about 80 of the time so the system needs more work. The room was large and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was so so and had a lower height sink which is outdated although the materials were not bad. The shower likewise was outdated. The HVAC system cooled the room well but when the compressor came on it did so loudly sometimes clanking in the process so it woke me up with some frequency. Breakfast for the 7th and 8th floors is normally served in an executive lounge however on weekends it is served in the dining room. Unfortunately the sign in the lounge shows breakfast being served there on Saturdays. When called the front desk they were unaware of this and mentioned that they had breakfast coupons for me to eat in their restaurant which they had forgotten to give me upon check in. So nothing major but rather things one should not have to deal with. Since I seldom give a five to other than a five star property which this does not pretend to be I compared it to something to which I might assign a four and found it wanting.", "offset": [151, 315], "date": "2016-01-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "4ca5f208-44fc-4e06-8256-15dcd8b185a0", "sentence": "They were not Prepared.

As a Hilton Honors member and with my wife having family in the Altamonte Springs area we have stayed at the Hilton on Northlake Blvd. numerous times. We were looking forward to our most recent stay and eager to see the results of the hotel \u2019s remodeling. Due to the fact that our flight was coming in early on February 13 we contacted Hilton on Northlake Blvd. to request early check in specifically at 10 am. After receiving an email letting us know that our early check in had been approved granted we arrived at the Hilton shortly after 10 am to check in. At the front desk we were greeted by Daniel and happily anticipated a smooth check in process as we had been up since 330 am in order to be on time for our early flight. Our happiness quickly evaporated as Daniel informed us that the room we had specifically requested \u2013 841 \u2013 was NOT ready for early check in. I showed Daniel the email I had received from Hilton approving granting early check in only to be faced with a Hilton employee who did not seem to either understand or care that the early check in time we had requested was not going to happen. To make matter worse Daniel rarely made eye contact with us preferring instead to make eye contact with his computer screen. In all of my stays at hotels over the years there have been many around the world I have rarely come across a hotel front desk employee so totally devoid of customer service skilsDaniel seemed not to understand our situation or was unwilling to extend himself for guests. He acted as though we were more of a bother to him than anything and seemed to have no interest in righting this wrong. He was merely content to regurgitate a robotic monotone \u201c I understand \u201d while his demeanor conveyed the complete opposite. Joining in this abysmal tragicomedy of the seemingly lost art of customer service but also pride and ownership in one \u2019s job duties Melissa Director of Front Office was equally unhelpful and oblivious to the fact that I had an actual email from their hotel granting my early check in request. Honestly I have not witnessed so much ducking and bobbing since the Ali Frazier fight of yore. So much double talk in an attempt to discredit the email their own hotel had sent meMelisa rather than expediting readying a room we were told would be available to us for early check in told us that we would have a wait of approximately 15 hours before we could check in to room 841. We sat in the lobby for over an hour before Melissa thought to ask us if we wanted something to drink. Incidentally during our wait Daniel was kind enough to offer another hotel guest a bottle of water while we sat les than 10 feet away from him. Nice. Just as nice we were informed by Melissa at this time that our requested room 841 was \u201c not up to standard \u201d and would not be available for check in early or late or at all. We were offered instead room 842. You might think that after 2 tired increasingly unhappy guests had been waiting at this time over an hour to check in that we would actually be offered a room that was ready to be checked into. No \u2013 what would be the fun in that. We had an additional 30 minute wait to check into 842We were given the room key cards by Melissa at 130 pm without so much as a sorry for the wait or for Daniel. Not so much as coupons for a free meal in the restaurant or a free night \u2019s stay for this mess. But I guess that \u2019s ok because we were given a little brown bag with 2 bottles of water inside. Now about that eagerness to witness the results of the remodeling. I really do n\u2019t think it was worth the noise and inconvenience to all those poor guests who had to suffer during the remodeling. And who was the design genius who thought it was a good idea to have a sliding bathroom door installed that left 1 inch gaps on either side of the dorGaps on the bathroom door of a bathroom that does n\u2019t have an exhaust fan. Yep. One of the best perks of staying at the Hilton on Northlake was the executive lounge with their not bad breakfast buffet and appetizers after 5 pm. The lounge has been redesigned so that you need to use your room key to be granted access the good the water soda fridge as well as the coffee machine is right by the door creating a gridlock when trying to get in the lounge at busier times the bad the hot appetizers were a let down. glue like mystery dip and fish in a cream sauce with lemon. The fish was RAW in the middle and when brought to the attention of lounge attendant Demi we were told it was just the way the dish is supposed to be prepared. No Demi. It was n\u2019t salmon and it was n\u2019t sushi. It was a gastro intestinal upset waiting to explode. At at hotel where the sliding bathroom doors have rather large gaps the ugly. We concluded our stay with a bad taste in our mouths \u2013 and not just from the raw fish. It seems the Hilton on Northlake has adopted a new mantra. The Customer is NEVER right. Wish I could give a rating of zero. Oh to give credit where it is due thanks to Kenya for having the lobby computers up and running after we informed her they were down.", "offset": [2449, 2551], "date": "2018-02-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "4857b871-574b-48c6-a8e6-aef53979d79d", "sentence": "Needs a bit of an update but suited our purposes. The Hilton at Altamont Springs is somewhat in need of a facelift with a dreary looking exterior and some common interior areas such as the elevators and hallways that could use some updated interior decorating. Our room was fairly basic no real frills it included a fridge and coffee maker. The bedding was very comfortable. It was difficult to find the right AC setting. When the air is blowing it is blowing directly on you when its not blowing it gets stuffy quickly. The main lobby has comfortable areas for lounging. I must say the breakfast service at the hotel was outstanding. We were in town for three nights to attend a wedding in the area. Our room rate included the buffet breakfast. It was a far better continental breakfast than those of other hotels. On our 2nd day we upgraded and ordered the Eggs Benedict off the menu. both morning meals were very good. The hotel also features a nice make your own burger turkey patty or chicken breast spot for lunch with a coffee bar. The town of Winter Park which features good shopping restaurants and nightlife is a short 10 minute drivedo not expect any of the domestic and housekeeping staff to speak English because they do not. You would expect that to be a minimum requirement. PS If your thinking about a room with a polside view be advised that it may be noise as that is the side which faces I4.
