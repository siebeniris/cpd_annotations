I spent four days at the hotel and was very pleased with the service position of the hotel on the beach and food. Staff are outstanding polite helpful and nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. Rooms are roomy clean and nicely decorated just as you would expect from the Ritz Carlton hotel group. The gardens are especially nice with large palms beautiful flowers well kept lawns and a path that runs alongside the various properties where the guest rooms. It can be a bit of a trek if you are provided a guest room at the very end of the property but calling for a bell cart is just a phone call away and arrives quickly to whisk you to the reception area or restaurants. The restaurants are good too. I dined right outside Bleuwaters Restaurant. the food and wine was great. If you are visiting St Thomas just be aware that if you take a taxi from the airport it could be a shared ride in a large van with the driver stopping at other hotels to let off passengers not uncommon in the Caribbean. I booked a private car service which although expensive at 900 from airport to the Ritz was in my opinion better than a protracted journey with multiple stops. As other reviewers have said this is a great property and worth every penny.", "offset": [205, 292], "date": "2015-05-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "59d0b48b-8aff-4cec-8a30-af9955742a72", "sentence": "the perfect summer vacation. spent one week in their Destination Club with another couple.

While the resort is beautiful and well maintained and certainly the most luxurious on St Thomas I was expecting a little more because it was the Ritz. There was nothing wrong with our stay but I did not see a discernable difference between the Ritz and a Westin hotel or resort where the prices are lower. Drinks are outrageously priced. The drink of the day was 12 or 15 and a glass of wine was more. While near the town of Red Hook it was not possible to walk to the restaurants or to the ferry less than 10 minutes away. Each visit to town required a taxi. Rides were not expensive and the wait for a cab was not long but we would have preferred to walk. The infinity pool overlooks the ocean and the temperature of the water was perfect. We had no trouble getting lounge chairs regardless of what time we visited the pool. Lounge chairs with covers are also readily available on the beach. All water sports are included with the resort fee and included sailboats kayaks paddle boards and snorkeling. We took advantage of all. The staff at the waterfront is also very friendly. Right on the beach beside Sails the resorts casual polside restaurant you can create your own souvenir of your time on St Thomas. The vendor a lovely older woman will guide you in creating your personalized sand art using sea glass shells and wire. The activity is reasonably priced and a great souvenir. I was looking for David Yurman jewelry while on the island and was planning to visit Charlotte Amalie to do so. That changed when we met Daylene at the hotels Jewels boutique. Daylene was easy to talk to and knowledgeable. I thought the hotel shop would be more expensive than in town but she explained that Yurman jewelry as well as other well known brands were priced the same everywhere on St Thomas and other islands in the Caribbean as well. so there was no need to visit multiple shops and haggle with the sales people something I do not enjoy at all. Daylene did not have the ring and bracelet I was looking for but checked the other store locations and found both one on a different island. She told me she would have both pieces in the store the following day and that I still had plenty of time to have the ring sized before I went home. She also told me there was absolutely no obligation to buy. She took my cell phone number and said she would text me when the pieces arrived. True to her word Daylene confirmed the next day that my jewelry was in and I could stop by when it was convenient for me. I ended up purchasing both pieces and the ring was sized and back to me the following day. This was the easiest shopping experience I have had on St Thomas. Our room was spacious and while expensive included breakfast bottled water in the room and free wi fi. Bug spray is also provided in the room and I needed it. The bathroom is spacious with marble tiled floors and double sinks. I was a little surprised to see a white frilly shower curtain hanging on a bare metal rod across the walk in shower instead of a glass door or nothing at all. We visited both restaurants open for dinner and preferred Blue Water to Essence. The red snapper was fabulous. This is also the restaurant where breakfast is served each morning. The staff in the restaurants were very friendly. Nightlife is non existent. Couples and small groups of people gathered in the pool in the evenings but there was no music or bar other than in Essence. I do highly recommend Dufys Love Shack in Red Hook for an after dinner drink and dancing under the stars aka parking lot. It is a lot of funMy one complaint about the hotel other than the price of drinks was the length of time it took to check out. We left our room at 1030 am and when we arrived at the front desk really two small desks on either side of the lobby there only one person working and 3 couples ahead of us waiting to check out. With official check out time at 11 this seemed a bit odd to us especially for a Ritz hotel. We went to breakfast and when we returned we still waited about 15 minutes before we were able to check out. Again only one person was working and it turned out he was a trainee.", "offset": [1098, 1148], "date": "2015-09-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "9293b8b8-93b4-4d1f-96a7-6db76565f8a6", "sentence": "Beautiful Location Exceptional staff.

We had always heard how great Ritz Carlton was and were excited for our family vacation however our experience was NOT. Upon arrival to the resort we had to wait for 45 minutes before being taken to our room.

We brought this to the resort attention and the next day the smear was cleaned however the poop smear remained for THE ENTIRE WEEK we were there. Then we ate lunch at the beach restaurant which was overpriced with very poor service. When my husband had something in the bottom of his glass of water and simply asked for a new glass the waitress was very rude and acted like it was a huge inconvenience for her. We also ended up waiting for 45 minutes for our lunch a burger and salad. really. The next day we dropped our 2 boys ages 8 and 10 at the Ambassador Club while we had meetings. Not friendly there either. When we picked them up I was simply pointed in the direction to find them because the receptionist was on the phone. Then that night we had a hole in our sheet a quarter size in the middle of the bed. WOW. I do not even have holes in my bed at home. If housekeeping did not notice that how did turn down service not. I must say the last 2 days of our week stay was better but rumor was the owner was on the premises. So sad. a 5 star resort is only 5 stars when the boss is looking. After arriving home my husband was emailed by the manager asking what time he was available for a phone call to discuss our stay. He responded with any time after 9 EST and that was in July and still has not received a phone call.

We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas staying in an oceanfront queen bedroom. With Bon Voy Ambassador status and previous Ritz stays my expectations were high but tempered by recent reviews and understanding that they are still recuperating from the hurricanes. However we were extremely disappointed with the consistency of service offered. We take this special trip every other year and were extremely disappointed with our stay. From the beginning we were not able to reach anyone at the hotel via phone or email to answer questions related to the reservation. One time that I did talk to someone it took over an hour on the phone to attempt to change our room type. After leaving several messages and emails for a concierge no one ever responded. Eventually our Mariot Ambassador was able to confirm everything for us before we arrived. While the check in process was simple through the ap and the welcome lovely after several calls to the front desk we were told that we would need to pay an additional 350 night for access to the Club Lounge regardless of the lifetime status. We made several requests at the concierge desk the pool deck and over the phone to reserve a pool cabana and never received any response. Half of the time when we would call for reservations or room service no one would answer the phone at all. While lounging at the beach the service was spotty and inconsistent at best. There was an issue with the Sails kitchen which prompted a very limited menu for lunch and food being prepared next to the pool beach on grills under a tent. I was not expecting just one restaurant on property to be available for meals. Our room was on the 5th floor of building E and with only one elevator on the other side of the building I would not recommend this hotel for anyone with mobility issues. There are stairs everywhere throughout the main building to and from the pool and the beach etc. The construction of the family pool was very disruptive. It was visible from every room and the hotel attempted to disguise with music that started early each morning on the pool deck with the same playlist each day. The construction definitely cuts into the pool deck and you need to reserve your pool loungers early in the morning if you want a place to sit. At the beach you need to reserve a chair early in the morning if you want to sit in the front row. The attendants were friendly but not helpful even with tips. There just did not seem to be any focus on the customer experience at this resort.

Ritz Carlton I pay expect get better food service at your hotels resorts I have till this trip \u201c always \u201d gotten it you need to fix it. I am going back to the Virgin Isles next month yet not or ever staying at the ritz again. I talked to several people that were having the same experience.
