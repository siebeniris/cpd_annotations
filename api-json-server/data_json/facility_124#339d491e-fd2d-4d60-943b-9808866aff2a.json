We booked a weekend break at the Radison Blu Edwardian to get over the January blues and this hotel provided the tonic we required. We stayed for two nights and received an upgrade to business class. The rooms were stunning very modern with the usual facilities and a nespreso coffee machine. The bathroom had a wet room shower and a bath with a separate washroom. The hotel has a Spa facility with a gym a great pool area with a jacuzi and steam room and sauna. There is one lift which goes directly to the Spa so most guests use the robes provided and change in their rooms. There are two restaurants in the hotel which both seem to offer high quality food although we chose to eat out on this occasion. The breakfast was really good however there was a fair wait to get in. The hotel did apologise which was due to very high demand. The hotel is high quality modern but based around the facade of the free trade hall. it is location is very central for all Manchester has to offer.

As per title this is a fantastic and luxury hotel right in the heart of Manchester. The building is stunning and the location is perfect for the nightlife of Manchester. You can walk to the Arndale shopping centre and Picadily gardens within 10 minutes. I have stayed at the hotel many times last time being July 2015 and have always had a great experience. Upon checkin staff greeted me and made me feel special. All staff were very polite and accommodating. The checkin process was quick and easy. All the rooms have been spotlessly clean with great facilities. Minibar Tv and bed are all great and comfortable. The cleaning products in the bathroom are all of a good quality and could not ask for much more in a room. I managed to have some dinner in the hotel restaurant the food was fantastic. I have noticed on some nights there is some special deals on in the Steak and Lobster restaurant in the hotel. I believe the last time I visited the offer was on a Lobster and Steak meal. I believe you could get one of these meals for under \u00a3 20 which in my opinion excellent value. However these are only on certain nights so you may want to check first. The breakfast I had the next morning was also very good quality and the choice was excellent. Again the staff were excellent they offered me endless amounts of coffee and toast to accommodate my full English breakfast. The spa although a little pricey is also fantastic and would recomend it if you are there to relax. Would I stay at this hotel again.
