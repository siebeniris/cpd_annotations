Other hotels i ve stayed at did nt charge for that. Our room was on the 4th floor pool side view. Kinda older run down. Can i just say these are the loudest rooms ever. Got woke up several times during the night early morning from loud noises in the hall what sounded like workers with loud radios talking back forth while in the hall. If you order their delivery pizza just know it is pricey but taste amazing. Ate the garden cafe for breakfast not that good or terrible. We stayed here for 4nights.

Just returned home from a wonderful stay at Ramada Plaza Resort. I was a little nervous upon booking due to some of the negative reviews but I am not hard to please when it comes to a place to sleep as long as there is a clean bed and soft pillow I am fine. When we arrived at the hotel at first glance I could tell it was not one of the newer places so I went into it with an open mind and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in the beachfront tower in room 3031 want to know what it looks like. Check out the professional photos on this page because they were a perfect match which I was surprised about. The room itself was very clean but a little on the small size the bathroom however was very spacious. There were three people in our room including myself and we had to be very organized in order to have room to move around. The beds were big and very comfortable. Like I said this room features a very spacious bathroom spacious tub enough so that when I showered the shower curtain did not smother me. Water pressure is nice and the bathroom had a nice ventilation system because taking hot showers did not make the rest of the room hot at all. The only real complaint I would have about this resort is the lack of parking and the fact that you can not keep the balcony door open unles you turn off the a c and drag a chair in the doorway to keep it propped open. There is a notice on the balcony door that says something along the lines of not propping the door open when you have the a c running because the humidity will cause the fire alarm to sound. And like I said you can not prop the door open at all even with the a c off unles you drag something in the doorway to keep the door from closing. And with the balcony door being made the way it is that makes it impossible to walk in and out without climbing over whatever you have holding the door open. And then there is the parking. This is a large resort and the parking lot does not reflect that. If you leave and come back to the room late at night be prepared to park in the parking garage next door and walking a good way to the room. We stayed 4 nights and were only able to park close to our building once. Other than those two things this was a perfect stay. Will definitely be back. Oh one last thing that needs mentioned on our first day we scored an early check in and went directly to the beach. When we came back to the room we had a message on the phone checked and it was Camile. I think really bad with names and this was 6 days ago. She was just welcoming us to the resort and letting us know to call her for any assistance. We needed extra towels last minute and I called down to the front desk while secretly praying I would not have to walk across the resort to get them. Nope they said they would send them up and I had fresh towels in my hands within 3 minutes. Really appreciated the guest services at this resort. Anytime I had a question or asked for any suggestions they were very helpful and accommodating.", "offset": [2142, 2215], "date": "2015-10-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "71ad15ee-97f1-4831-9087-0a9490abcb0f", "sentence": "Always Amazing.

Beach access was great but the parking was horrendous. People parked anywhere and everywhere blocking loading and unloading zones making it difficult to check in and out. If you left the hotel good luck finding a spot later on. We had to use a nearby parking garage and hike it in. The street in front of the hotel was crazy.

There was no mention whatsoever that they were remodeling the hotel. Let alone the ENTIRE hotel. 1 week before our wedding we were informed that the Ballroom we paid for was under construction that the pool was n\u2019t functional the walk way was tore up and the whole front was being \u201c remodeled \u201d. 1 week prior to our wedding. There was nothing we could do they offered upgrades and then when the day of came we did n\u2019t receive any of them. Bar Tab Upgrade Valet Parking Red Carpet Hostesses the whole nine yards. We did n\u2019t receive one thing. Bar tab was shut down after what we paid was spent due to \u201c over intoxication of 1 guest \u201d Valet showed up an hour late and parked two cars and left. They forgot to turn the air on in the ballroom and ceremony rooms we ended up using so it was HOT during our ceremony. At first the hotel seemed great we loved everything about it. By the end of it I just wanted it to be over. It was the most miserable experience dealing with those people. When I contacted JimThe GM about everything he told me everything I said was invalid.
