I read the reviews on here and was a little worried about my one night stay for a business meeting. I usually stay at a different hotel nearby. So overall this is a decent hotel.

There was no line and I got up to my room fast. Lobby is odd more like a long hall with low ceilings. Not dramatic or impressive in any way. My room was pleasant. Very traditional furnishings that are showing signs of wear. Bathroom was big and had nice amenities. Bizarre thing was the room has no closet. Just a small square armoire that had the luggage rack iron and ironing board crammed into it. No iPhone radio just a clock radio that was broken wifi did not seem to work carpet looked dirty toilet ran until I jiggled the handle plug was broken on lamp. All minor but not on par with similar properties. Seems no one in maintenance or housekeeping is paying attention. Did not eat in the hotel. there is a Bruegers and a Starbucks a short walk away. Small gift shop in lobby has the usual assortment at crazy high prices. Called down in the morning to have my car brought up yes you can do that and it was waiting when I got done. i did leave the hotel earlier that day and went down and waited for my car which did seem like it took a long time and others around me were complaining about the wait.

There were working on the bar so draft beers were out of order which was a big bummer so I did not consume any alcohol.

I finally got ahold of someone the night before thank goodness but it was not until I figured out some way to get around their terrible phone system.

My friend arrived before me on Friday and went to the pool. Her sister and her shared a wrap by the pool and both had food poisoning the rest of the weekend from it. There was no A C on in the hallways or public bathrooms. One of the servers by the pool was incredibly rude not sure if she knows but we could all see her roll her eyes when she had walk away from a guest. The ice machine on our floor did not work the entire stay. It was impossible to reach the front desk from our phone in our room. Our door did not properly close in our room. The housekeepers did not replace toiletries that we had used when they cleaned. We were on the 7th floor and on the day we checked out a paper was slipped under our door telling us we could not use the elevator that day.

I am a Mariot Elite Member and have come to expect certain service quality of amenities at their hotels and this was a major disappointment.

The buffet was exceptional compared to the other Mariot properties. The parking is easy and they have more than enough valets. To top it off it is a stones throw to the John Wayne airport though we never heard the planes in our room. The pool area is very comfortable with lots of very comfortable lounges in and out of the sun with numerous refrigerators for the guest.

The bottom line is that this place is wonderful and highly recommended. AND finally for those customers upset about the parking charges here is a clue. All the Mariot properties we frequented have substantial parking fees for both self park and valet. A few dollars is the difference in each facility is not earth shattering.

So what I was on a vacation. There was a business center with crappy cell phone coverage and an uncomfortable work environment set up more like a lounge or a Christian Science reading room. Borderline grubby Carpet in the elevator was gross dirty and stained. Glad I wore shoes as not on my way to or from the pool.

More on Sundays I bought my wife a hot tea in the coffee shop resort restaurant bar on Saturday morning and it showed up on the bill at 39 including a 1 tip. I did same on Sunday same bar same seat same tip and it showed up on the bill at 69. Six bucks for a cup of hot water was a bit ridiculous even if it included some hip and trendy organic biodynamic natural tea in a recycled bag. When I asked about the difference at checkout it took about ten minutes for the nice lady to figure out there is a Barista on Saturday but on Sunday to go sales go through the bar and the price is different. BS. They gave me a 2 credit on the bill but too little too late. That Saturday Barista took fifteen minutes or so to come up with a cup of hot water. She was preoccupied with the point of sale system and trying to get a table order properly entered. Several servers bar tenders and bar backs walked by in the interim. All were very busy.
