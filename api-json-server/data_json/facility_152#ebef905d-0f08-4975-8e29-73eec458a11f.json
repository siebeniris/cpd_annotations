My 5 year old son and I stayed in this great place for one night and loved it. My room was incredibly clean and we faced the outdoor pool so had a beautiful balcony with patio furniture. It was just wonderful. The gym is GREAT. So many treadmills and cardio equipment. Full set of free weights and full set of machine weights. it is huge. And it overlooks the pool which is fantastic. The outdoor pool was so much fun and lit up at night it is very beautiful. If you are staying with kids and need groceries be sure to pick them up before you get here. There are not any stores nearby. Staff was fantastic. They let me do an early check in at 1AM and a check out by phone on the airplane because I had not been sure I could get on my flight.

I have been staying here fairly frequently for business for years. It kind of fits me like an old shoe at this point. This hotel does not have the lowest price in the area and the rooms are not the nicest in the area and the amenities are not all that but there is still something that I like about it over all the others in the immediate area. it is comfortable. The best thing about it is the fast easy access to LAX airport. The shuttle runs continuously and the service is free. In a pinch you can walk to and from the airport along sidewalks. it is not a really short walk with baggage but it is doable. Sometimes you will have to wait a long time between shuttles from the airport to the hotel. In the mornings the shuttles to the airport get really crowded so you may have to wait for the next one. But you will eventually get to where you are going. If the shuttle is packed from the Mariot to the airport you may get a direct ride to the terminals. Otherwise you will probably stop at one or two hotels along the way to pick up more airline passengers. The lobby is spacious with a variety of seating options large tables with chairs plush sofas individual upholstered chairs. it is a nice place to meet up or to sit around and people watch. it is done up in kind of an oceanside continental look with beige aqua blue and gold alongside dark wodthere is a Starbucks in the lobby too though as I recall it does not have all the features of a full fledged Starbucks. It may not take the Starbucks cards or award Starbucks rewards. I can not recall what the difference is but there has certainly been one on each of my visits. Latitude 33 is their more casual restaurant serving California style cuisine and some other standard dishes. I have eaten in the restaurant a handful of times and have always had a good experience but I generally order my food to go instead and eat it in my room. They never mess up my orders and the food is always good. Not spectacular really but good. Tasty. As described. Good. Sports bars are not my thing but I have eaten twice at Champions. it is fine. Burgers. Chicken Wings. Not healthy and boring imo. The workout room is fairly big for a hotel. There are free weights universal equipment and cardio stuff like treadmills and elipticals. The pool area is attractive and inviting but I have only used it for short periods of time when sitting out with a coffee or a book. I have never been swimming there. I get free wifi through my business contract but I believe that most guests still have to pay unles they are in the lobby where it is always free. Everybody should get free wifi imothere is not a lot to walk to from here. it is pretty much in an airport hotel industrial area. Even the restaurants in the surrounding blocks tend to be low key fast food sort of places. I did walk quite a ways once to try out an In and Out Burger. That was kind of fun. Airplanes flew immediately overhead as they landed on the north side of the airport. I am guessing that many of the other hotels in the area offer dining one could try but I have pretty much always stuck to Latitude 33 while I am overnighting here. A few other reviewers have commented on the price and expressed the opinion that their rooms were a disappointment for the cost. I do not feel that way and I wonder if those reviewers either reserved their rooms at an unavoidable high demand time for the area or reserved their rooms too late during a high occupancy period or just do not have an idea of the going price for a convenient room in Los Angeles. I think the pricing is generally fair and reasonable. I am happy with it. The rooms seem to vary from hall to hall and floor to floor in this somewhat sprawling hotel. I assume the variations have to do with whatever the ongoing renovation schedule happens to be. there is the taller tower building that you will see as you pull up to the hotel. it is one tall rectangular building that has maybe 14 floors can not remember. And then there is the other lower building with just 4 or 5 floors that forms three sides around the pool area like three sides of a rectangle. In general I have found that the higher floors in the taller building tend to have the less outdated rooms and they tend to be the quietest. But that is not always the case. it is kind of unpredictableI am a very light sleeper and always request a quiet location but I have not ever had a problem with noise or thin walls in any hall or floor of this hotelI have only reserved standard rooms here. None of the standard rooms bother me. they are all okay the beds are all comfortable they are all clean though not probably not pristine the air conditioners all work fairly quietly and efficiently unles you just happen to get a rare broken one they all contain an upholstered chair or sofa for reading their bathrooms are all pretty much the same. None of the rooms I have stayed in are anything to write home about but they are all more than adequate quiet and comfortable. Whenever anything at this hotel has bothered me not often my complaints have always been rewarded with a professional friendly accommodating response. Even though I am not boasting about this hotels amazing rooms amenities or features it is my impression that this hotel is superbly run. In my experience the management team is responsive knowledgable customer service oriented and professional. Here the customer always comes first.

I stayed on business in January of 2018I had not stayed at the LAX Airport Mariot in maybe 15 years or more so long in fact I could not recognize it as the same hotel once inside the lobby. They have updated and it is fantastic. They have a constant shuttle running to from the airport it was maybe a 5 minute wait and then another 5 minutes or so to the Hotel. Polite service and a clean shuttle. They have a large check in area which makes sense as this is a very large hotel. They also have dedicated check in for Mariot Elite Members which is nice. I reserved a standard king and was upgraded to a Concierge Level King due to my loyalty status. I do not know if all rooms have been updated but the Concierge level I was on had been. The room itself was spacious with that long entertainment center dresser desk format that Mariot likes lots of lighting and large windows with a view of the airport which was cool. Sound management was great I was worried about plane noise and it was not a problem at all. The bathroom had been upgraded thoughtfully but primarily with the solo traveler in mind. It would have been very tough to share had I not been alone. The shower was a walk in with a nice shower head with plenty of pressure and hot water not always guaranteed in a hotel this large. The vanity area was tight but well lit. The closet. well the closet was like this. Think of a nice closet now think of it smaller now think of it half that size and you have the idea. I could hang up a shirt sport coat and jeans and that was it. No way 2 people could share this closet for any length of time. However my expectation is that the majority of travelers here are solo business travelers on short stays in which case it is fine. The concierge lounge was without question the best hotel member lounge I have been in from an aesthetic perspective. it is HUGE I had guess well in excess of 350 square feet. Seating for probably 75 or more plus couch nooks. Views of the LAX Airport that were amazing. Full bar and refreshments and it is open 24 hours. Food spread in the morning was ok not on par with the rest of the lounge but completely adequate scrambled eggs sausage pastry fruit mostly melon and a little cantaloupe and yogurt options. The fitness center was solid. It had 4 6 treadmills or so 3 4 Elipticals I think it had a bike or two and several universal type weight machine options and a full selection of dumbbells exercise balls yoga mats etc. Cold water and towels were available and the machines were newer and well maintained. They have a JW Steakhouse that was packed. It does not have it is own bar which is too bad I would have sat at their bar if they had one and ordered off the steakhouse menu. The steakhouse setup was a little unique it was open to the lobby and felt like a re purposed breakfast restaurant. But it smelled great and was jammed full of what appeared to be happy customers. I sat at the lobby bar and ate there. They have a huge lobby bar with lots of large new TVs with tons of options for a solo traveler looking for a little distraction it was great. It was crowded in a good way and loud like can not talk on the phone loud but the energy was good. Fish Tacos and Caesar salad were quick and tasty and they have a nice selection of call brands with a deeper than average whiskey selection for those that are interested.
