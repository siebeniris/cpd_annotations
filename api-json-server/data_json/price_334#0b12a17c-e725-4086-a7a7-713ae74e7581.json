Stayed there the middle of last month they had recently reopened. apx 30 days prior due to flooding from Hurricane Harvey. First thing first. as soon as I checked in the lady asked me if I had two reservations I promptly told her no just one for myself and did nt think much more about it. Well apparently she was either dense or they purposefully and intentionally ripped me off. I was never given a receipt for my stay which is usually slipped under the door sometime during the night now I know why. even though I told her I DID NOT HAVE TWO RESERVATIONS they still charged me anyway. Heres the real kicker they put me in just a standard room and the extra charge was for a premium room. LOL Well its been a month and after two promises to refund its still not been put back into my account. So now I have to go thru all the nonsense of disputing the charges because of the unscrupulously deceptive fake charge they did and lies to fix it that the Omni Houston did to one of their Platinum Members.

I will start by saying nothing terrible happened during my stay for business at The Omni but I felt a variety of small things added up to a lackluster experience. Location Not great. Definitely not walkable. It sits far from the main road on a long driveway so not entirely convenient. Because of this I ate on site. Food. I expect high food prices at hotels but what I do not agree with is extreme price gouging. I got a small iced coffee nothing fancy no espresso no cold brews and a fruit cup that was 19 and change with tax. I got smart for dinner and ordered Uber Eats. The Omni Valet was completely rude to my Uber Eats driver and the 60 seconds he was on their driveway. They then got a bit rude with me for having a delivery. There were no other cars on the driveway and my dropof took all of 60 seconds. The dropof impacted no one negatively except for Omni missing out on another meal charge from me. Due to lack of options I did a grab n go breakfast from Birdies the morning I was leaving. CAUTION. the yogurts were expired by several days and I told the staff member. She got defensive and said Yes I know. Oh okay. The room decor very outdated the shower looked like it was from 1989 no hair dryer in the room and no lights over the shower weird bar soap that left a slime on my skin.

I have stated the Omni on and off for 20 Years and have always liked this particular location. I just returned after having not stayed there for 10 years and post flood and I have to say they have made it far better in the sense that the lobby is very inviting and beckons you to sit down and have a drink or a meeting. The rooms are just right and extremely good value. The beds are very comfortable and soft and the service is excellent. One differentiator of this hotel is that they offer you a complementary set of beverages in the morning and a bagel or English muffin as a nice wake up gesture. The bagels are not good quality and they do need to change find a new supplier but the fact they do this complementary is quite unique and very much appreciated. It is also smart because you become inclined to order some breakfast with it so I think it is also good for their bottom line revenue. The only negative on the hotel is the mediocre food in the all day dining Room. The Caesar salad have though taste. The Burger was served on a great brioche and was quite tasty but the attempt at the pho soup was not even close. The service despite my being the only person in the restaurant was spotty but Chatty and kind nonetheless. I offered some constructive critique at the Front desk and they cared enough to pass it on to the general manager which is very impressive in todays environment. The general manager wrote me a letter and took the macaroni and cheese off my bill which was not at all intended as I was happy to pay for it but she insisted. You just do not see this kind of management these days connected to all of the touch points in a hotel. The breakfast was great value but was lacking taste even other selection was perfect and I like the way they are trying to focus on just a few ingredients. The service in the bar was excellent I thought it was very smartly presented. I had recommend raising the price 20 and focusing on the quality of the ingredients. They have these fabulous biscuits and the only real sausage gravy in town all they need to do is add a little chicken stock and more pepper and they have a winner. The valet and bellmen are seamless which Is not always the case with concessions these days. In summary I thought the hotel was spectacular value and I credit the general manager with having put together a team that is genuinely motivated to make your stay more comfortable.
