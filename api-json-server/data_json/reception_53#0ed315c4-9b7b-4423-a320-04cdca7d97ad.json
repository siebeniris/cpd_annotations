Visit the spa while there. It was or anniversary and got the wife a massage and she absolutely loved it and there staff was top notch. Only complaint was that we had a tee time and when we showed up there was 75 guys from Sherwin Williams starting. The wait staff was covered up due to being under staffed and trying to accommodate everyone. Waited 30 minutes just to get a drink and was not gon na even think about getting food. My wife spoke to a woman at the pro shop to try and reschedule and was given attitude which I am not happy about. That was very poor planning on the golf staff to be very unprepared. Plus the big wig from Sherwin Williams paid for all the liquor at the bar because they do not serve out on the course. They must have had a good year to blow what would have to be well over 5 K just for the golf and drinks. Not to mention the stay plus spa treatments. We did play the next day and the course was nice. Only complaint is there were no hole layouts and barely yardage markers. Probably would not have had any problems if there would have been more than one course open. Three courses and only one open during the summer. Bad planning.

This was the first time staying at Chateau Elan for my birthday celebration. I was skeptical about staying at the resort due to reading to previous reviews.

As far as appearance of the resort the outside is beautiful but the inside does not compare. We were given a room that I immediately asked to be moved. The view was nothing to see as well the windows were filthy with spider webs and dirt. The second room had a better view. I wanted to put a small birthday cake in the fridge but I refused after I found hair in the refrigerator. Also I was pleased to find the chair had upholstery was ripped and torn.

I had spoken with the front desk on the day of arrival letting them know I would check out with another card. This is because the young lady at the desk failed to say your card with be put on a hard hold for x amount of dollars. The receptionist exact words is this card will be on file.

I \u2019ve purposely waited to share this review because I did n\u2019t want to relay any resentment or bitterness only the facts. So here it goes My husband and I booked the culinary experience as well as a spa day for our short weekend getaway. We booked over the phone as we \u2019d never been to Chateau Elan and wanted to speak with someone directly about the amenities etc. Upon our arrival we see that the Inn where our room was was under going a complete renovation. This was fine however it would have been nice to know considering the building smelled of fresh paint. So we check in and get settled into our room \u2014 400 night and we \u2019re next to the laundry room and also spotted three large bugs in our room and we begin to dress for our first dinner outing. Come to find out the resort \u2019s restaurants were either closed for renovations or weddings. It \u2019s important to note that this information is displayed on the website but was not relayed to us over the phone. Had we known we would not have booked the culinary experience. So we had no choice but to eat room service for most of our meals. Luckily there are a few restaurants off site that we were able to drive to. On day two we headed over to the spa for our very pricey couples massage. Low and behold the spa is also under renovation so where one would typically use the sauna steam room etc. it was closed. The men \u2019s locker room sauna and steam room were all closed. This was not disclosed to us either as we would n\u2019t have booked. Paying the hefty price for a spa service includes the amenities at the spa. So why did we pay for them if they \u2019re closed. Lastly I purchased an eye mask from the resort store the evening before we checked out. I placed it in the refrigerator in the room and subsequently forgot it was in there \u2014. so I left it. I realized this about 20 minutes after leaving the resort and called right away however the front desk was closed they were at the front desk to check us out. strange. Anyway I call first thing Monday morning and they file a report to have someone go to the room and retrieve it. It was about three days before I hear back and the gentleman I spoke said it was not in there and that no one had checked into our room since we \u2019d checked out. So there nothing he can do. So this only leaves one explanation. someone who had access to the room took it. I was told that the only thing I could do was come to the Braselton police department and file a police report. For a 20 eye mask. I also live about two hours away. What \u2019s most disappointing about this is that we spent nearly 200 for a two night stay at this resort and not one person was willing to work with us.

There was ample room and it was very comfortable. The overall service at the Winery hotel was outstanding. Everyone we encountered provided 5star service. Our only complaint was there was not a whole lot to do after the wine tasting tour and restaurant. I understand this is a Couples Get away and they mainly focus on couples spending time together but I think in order for the Chateau Elan complex to go to the next level they need more. Maybe partner with other companies to create a more robust experience. A live Jazz band or music. Maybe an art showing or even a poetry slam. I really do not think CE can survive and do really well unles they add another dimension to the experience.

Several times the doormen did not even say hello or acknowledge us. The front desk people also seemed very underwhelmed to be there. They were not rude but barely spoke. The host at Versailles was rude snipy which was a double insult as we had dinner reservations and yet were forced to wait and we just gave up and left after seeing other guests seated directly after entering since we had been waiting. While the place looks like a 4 star resort it did not feel like it due to the unwelcome feel. Honestly the customer service flaws here were enough to keep me from returning out of state.
