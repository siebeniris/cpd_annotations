Very nice hotel. Spacious rooms with spacious bath. Beautiful lobby and sitting area. However when you pay this much money for a hotel it should be assumed that breakfast is included. Come on all average hotels offer complimentary coffee. If you are the best should not you do the same. Location is the best feature for this hotel. It is so close to walk to the Aquarium Harbor etc. Parking is 30 per night. The best surprise of the hotel to us was the indoor swimming pool. With two kids who always get their best times in the hotel swimming pool we parents were surprised to find a lounge like area in the pool room. They had nice seating with magazines so that parents could relax while watching over kids if not swimming.

We came away with a great overall impression of the hotel. it is sufficiently well decorated spotlessly clean and staffed with friendly people. In short I had return here even though the changing rooms at the pool are coed. We had two rooms on the 12th floor which is the executive level. On weekdays this level affords you access to breakfast and snacks at the private lounge right on your floor. We were in Baltimore Fri. and Sat. so our perk was gratuitous bottled water en suite and breakfast buffet vouchers for the dining area on the 4th floor. We liked the made to order omelette station but the buffet had everything except waffles. You can sample fresh pineapple strawberries blueberries blackberries croissants muffins pancakes chicken sausage turkey bacon as well as porcine varieties of sausage and bacon. More about the rooms They did not knock off our socks with their stylish decor or swank bathrooms but they were not shabby. We booked each room at a special rate of 120 night and feel the price was worth it for the convenience of the location. One of our rooms had a super soft king sized bed but a smallish bathroom. It had a view of a few tall buildings and a parking garage. The best feature of the room was a meter long stone surface handy for pouring over a fold out map for those of us who still find them practical or setting out clothes. Our three kids 1 brawny teenager 1 waif of a twen and 1 athletic child holed up in this room. I was glad they chose it because a car alarm went off in the wee hours Sat. morning. Its sound was faint but roused me from sleep even though the children did not notice it light sleepers bewareThe room were we slept faced East and had a super soft queen sized bed. It overlooked a soulless courtyard but had such a spacious bathroom I was surprised that it did not have grab bars for handicap access. A wheelchair would easily fit into the space for that matter I had rate the hotel and immediate environs convenient for the handicap. Rooms facing the courtyard are best for light sleepers. My photo shows the sun lit pool area as seen from above. The pool is a nice size and depth for children 2 3 m 3 5 feet deep. It is not ideal for swimming laps. The changing room is perfectly clean but men and women share the same changing facilities. We found the co ed aspect convenient since we had the pool almost entirely to ourselves but even though I have lived in continental Europe over a dozen years I dislike shared facilities. Kids are unpredictable and 9 times out of 10 I get exposed.
