My wife and i stayed as this beautiful resort for two weeks in May The vast majority of rooms face the gorgeous stretch of sand and aqua blue seas. Our room on the third floor was contemporary and modern with a good balcony. The room cleaners are very efficient and polite. The breakfast each morning was delicious with a wide ranging choice. The evening menus were mainly themed. We tended to take a bus into nearby Holetown where there was a wide choice of restaurants. A very good managers dinner was held each week. It was annoying that the manager ignored us in favour of speaking to repeat guests. This happened each week of our stay. It took a complaint for management to recognise that new guests were as welcomed as repeat guests. A sincere apology was given by the manager Tim. The afternoon tea and cakes was a nice touch. The weekly tour of the beautiful grounds by the head gardener is highly recommended. Ryan was a gem teaching my wife to sail a small boat. Most of the staff were very helpful and polite.

I have stayed at all the main hotels on the West Coast and this is my absolute favourite. I have been twice before last time 4 years ago and had been told it was looking a bit tired. However I was very happy that this was no longer the case as they have recently updated a lot of areas with new furnishings and fabrics. The Hotel is spotless and elegant with beautifully manicured gardens and lots of calming water features. The rooms are well equipped and come with stunning Ocean Views as standard. The upstairs rooms have uninterrupted views of the beach and ocean the ground floor are larger suites with butler service and direct access to the beach. That beach WOW. it is the best in Barbados calm and clear turquoise water with reefs for snorkeling and resident turtles you can swim with every day. If you are lucky you may can the babies hatching. The water sports guys will take you out snorkeling to help you find them. Non motorised Water sports like Hobie cats kayaks and paddle boards are included and the boys will be happy to give you expert tuition. Motorised water sports such as water ski ing and Super Mable are available from other companies on the beach for a cost. The daily buffet breakfast was fabulous with so much choice I can not think of a single fruit that they did not have. You could fill up for the whole day. We only had lunch at Taboras by the pool on one occasion and it was a delicious salad and my other half had an amazing wodfired pizza. Very reasonable too compared to other hotels. Tuesday night is Managers Cocktail party followed by a buffet with live music at The Palms Terrace which is a beautiful restaurant and yet another amazing buffet with all sorts of fresh fish amazing quality hot meats a pasta station artisan breads I am really not a fan of buffets but this was the exception. The atmosphere was lively and social the soul singer was amazing and interactive we met so many other guests that we may not have otherwise spoken to. It was a brilliant night and everyone was talking about it the next day. The location is excellent being just a few minutes walk along the beach from Lone Star Restaurant and the cute little Ju Jus bar. Holetown is only 5 minutes by bus or taxi here you will find a fantastic shopping centre and plenty of bars and restaurants to suite all budgets. The hotel is elegant and luxurious but in no way uncomfortable pretentious or stuffy. There is a dress code but it is not to strict or heavily enforced just about being sensible and not turning up for dinner in your beachwear. We did not feel like we had to dress up to have dinner or to sit in the bar they just want you to enjoy your stay and feel comfortable. It was mostly adults when we were there but it is completely suitable for families and does have a lot of families in school holidays. All the rooms interconnect and there are organised activities and special offers to attract families in holidays. The biggest asset of this hotel though. what makes it so special is the staff. I work in the hotel industry and can be very critical but I can honestly say only at one other hotel in another island have I met so many wonderful warm and friendly people who just make it their everyday business to make you smile. Everyone without exception would go the extra mile without even being asked. On our last day my partner went to snorkel with turtles right down the beach near Lonestar The catamarans arrive with turtle food so he knew the turtles would be after that. He came back 2 hours later having spent at least an hour searching for his expensive dive camera which had fallen out of his pocket whilst feeding the turtles. It had all our holiday pictures on. I was telling the girls on reception how upset I was the chef Kirk was stood there too. I had not even asked for help when they sprung into action looking up the Catamaran companies that had been docked so they could call them to see if anyone had found it. Kirk joined in and called the water sports guys Romario to see if they could help find it. Romario ran down the beach to Lonestar where the catamarans anchor and in less than 10 minutes popped up holding the camera which he had found on the bottom of the sea bed 25 foot down. It was an absolute miracle what a star we just could not believe he not only found it but so quickly when we had to leave within couple of hours. Such an unbelievable thing to happen and everyone on the beach was cheering. This EXCEPTIONAL hotel is professional and doing what they should to be a luxury product but at the same time has such a FEEL GOOD vibe.

The rooms are spacious and well appointed with plenty of wardrobe and draw space never usually enough I find and air conditioning works perfectly very important comfy beds and great cushions. The pool is a little underwhelming being a simple rectangular design but it is adequate and plenty large enough the loungers are very comfortable with plenty of towels and the surrounding trees make it feel very tropical with even a wild monkey or two to be heard. The grounds are lovely and the beach area is fantastic with all rooms facing the sea as the hotel is right on the beach. The sea is just perfect clear and calm so wonderful to swim in. We did not eat at the hotel apart from breakfast which was good with plenty of choice and situated near the pool outside overlooking the sea as the restaurants in the area are amazing. Little birds come up and will happily share you breakfast with you if you let them. Not to be missed is the cliff book ahead. the cliff beach bar the tides and lone star to name but a few oh and fish pot. We also hired a catamaran to swim with the turtles which was amazing and a memory to be treasured.

You may expect top notch service all of the Team is great. There are though for me some cons The breakfast is medicore the best thing is the view. The service is good but the choice is limited it was my second time in caribean so maybe shal got used to. It is surely not worth 50usd head. The lunch dinner are just OK. I know I am not upper class customer but I have no problem with paying much for a meal provided I get something exceptional. The lunch or dinner menus are nothing special. The food presentation is ok the quality is perfect but there is nothing imaginative that shal explain the prices. Take 10usd per person for the lunch and 150usd for the dinner and expect nothing special.

Anyway we handled that and the prices was not the problem. I just wonder how bizarre some people must be to pay so much to eat something that is so overpriced and though nothing really special. OK it is Barbdos I think it is all about the sentiment of the British people. Just wondering if Sandy Lane would disapoint me more when it comes to the value for money.

We chose Barbados and the Fairmont for our first trip to the Caribean after a lot of research and we could not have chosen better. Both the island and the hotel exceeded our expectations and what was to have been a one off trip of a lifetime looks like becoming a regular destination. After unpacking we were stoling round the gardens and met Akil who then showed us the beach facilities and thereafter always made sure we were comfortable. At the end of our holiday receptionist Patricia readily agreed to extend our check out to coincide with our pick up time. The service was of the highest standard and always done with a smile. We had requested an upper floor room and were given such a room with a wonderful view over the beach and the Caribbean Sea. The room was spacious with more storage space than we could have wished for plus a balcony large enough for two sun beds chairs and a table. There was a minibar with space for our own drinks a coffee maker and kettle plus plenty of glasses and mugs. The bathroom was similarly well appointed and the only improvement we could have wished for was a quieter air conditioning unit. However the room insulation was as good as we have experienced so we never heard our neighbours even on the balcony. The hotel is right on the beach but also had a good sized pool in the beautiful gardens as a result there was never a problem in finding sunbeds at either. As with the rest of the hotel the service at the pool and beach was excellent. Breakfast was served in the open Taboras restaurant next to the beach and the buffet had a good range of fruit cereals etc plus an efficient egg station. You did have to be on your guard from the local birds but this was a small price to pay for such a lovely setting. We were on bed and breakfast but ate in Taboras a couple of times and enjoyed all the courses served especially as there was a light menu also available. We enjoyed the Tuesday buffet in the Palm Terrace with an excellent band but without them we found the atmosphere a bit flat. Another bonus at the Fairmont was the excellent concierge service who recommended tours appropriate for their guests we can recommend Glory Tours and Good Times Too catamaran both specializing in limited numbers on their tours. The nearest town to the Fairmont is Holetown which has a large supermarket a charming Chattel Village shopping area plus a new designer shopping centre as well as a good variety of restaurants. The town is about 20 minutes walk but the pavement is only intermittent so the excellent bus service is a better bet at US 1 regardless of distance. a return taxi for the five minute journey to Holetown was about US 35 return.

The shower surround was rusty in places with patched up grouting and sealing the balcony door was difficult to slide and had paint flaking off and the electrical and other fittings were dated.

The selection and quality of the food was excellent and the music was great. However we also ate a la carte on another occasion when we were not so impressed with the standard. In addition the mark up on very modest wines was staggering and much greater than at Tides or LAcajou at Sandy Lane where we had also dined. The price of a South African Cabernet Sauvignon which retails here in the UK for about \u00a3 13 was many times more than this. Taboras Restaurant.

We never saw our butler during the stay and equally never received any of the advertised butler offerings. Equally we did not receive the promised bespoke amenities including the beach bag etc 6. We had pre booked the hotel car to take us to the airport the morning of our departure and reconfirmed this the night before. However the car did not turn up for our transfer. When the front desk called to find out what had happened the taxi was at the airport waiting for us. The hotel had booked our transfer FROM the airport instead of TO the airport despite knowing we were in house guests. In the end they booked us a regular minibus which was far from the standard of the luxury car we had booked and was included in our rate. To date we have received no apologies from the hotel either for the involuntary downgrade to a room lack of early check in being set up lack of butler services nor the mishap over our transport to the airport. Additionally we have not received the promised refund for the price differential between suite and room. The hard product since the renovation is very nice but unfortunately let down by a lack of good customer service. Staff smiled and appeared outwardly friendly but that is where it ended and certainly there was not the proactive service you expect in a Fairmont or any other 4 or 5 star hotel charging greater than a 1000 per night. How do you maker sense of the disconnect between reviews of the hotel some give it huge praise and 5 stars. Others like myself encountered major customer service failings. Part of it may be cultural in the sense that the Caribbean way of life is laid back but that should not result in staff being less attentive or slap dash. I think if you luck out and everything goes clockwork with the stay you will really enjoy yourself. But if mistakes are made by the hotel do not expect them to admit to it or apologize and they do not seem to know the concept of service retrieval in the same way North American properties do. If you decide to stay here I suggest you double check everything before you arrive including room type services to be expected and ground transfers. However to be safe I would suggest you consider other options on the Island until the hotel management can get the customer service aspect of the the hotel up to 5 star standards.", "offset": [2961, 3170], "date": "2019-04-02 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "cd3b9c01-7e85-4ba4-b894-c7e2712d5c73", "sentence": "Quiet clean property helpful staff.
