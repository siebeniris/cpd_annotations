Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and have nothing really to complain about and much to praise the hotel for. The room was spacious the views towards the south quite breath taking and the balcony added a nice touch as we got lots of fresh air. Most hotels have not got the option of opening the windows or doors to the outside. Our room was serviced at a very convenient time when we were out and it was very clean. Reception staff was very polite and so was the concierge. We hired a car and had it valet parked. There was only a slight problem one day when the car was moved when it should not have been. However this was only very minor to us as we were not in a hurry. Just a little hint if you have your car valet parked ask for it giving yourself time and specify a time when you want it. They do get very busy at times. The restaurant Redsalt was a real blessing. We have good breakfasts there and we had a wonderful New Years Eve dinner there. A friend came to visit from Sydney and we were not sure where to have dinner with him on New Years Eve. We were so glad we picked Redsalt as it turned out to be our best restaurant in Adelaide both for the food and the service. This is saying a lot because we did try a number of places in the CBD North Adelaide as well as the Adelaide Hills and Barosa Valley.

It might be worth mentioning this to ACOR for anyone else choosing this travel option. We loved our breakfast in the morning too and there was certainly plenty to choose from in the buffet display. It was great to see chef making fresh omelettes and eggs and bacon etc however seeing the hollandaise sauce being squeezed from a bottle was not really necessary.
