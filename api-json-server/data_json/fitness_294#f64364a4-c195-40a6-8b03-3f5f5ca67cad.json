Furthemore Mr Jiles did not bother to speak to me when he saw the following day or bother to inquire whether or not the issue was resolved and if the room was satisfactory. Food preparation was terrible French toast soggy and delayed receipt of portion of breakfast order on several occasions at the Ocean 200 restaurant. Upon check out I requested for Katherine to have the Mr Kesler GM to call me. He never received the message. I was persistent and address this issue with him on 102715.

Beautiful setting and from the outside a great looking hotel. Wonderful spot on the beach nice pool and lovely outdoor seating and eating areas. Most staff members were warm and welcoming. The fitness center is crammed into a converted room on the 10th floor and looks like something out of the 1980s in a Motel 6. Of two treadmills one did not even work and the treadmill platform on the second was like walking in sand it was badly in need of repair or replacement. The other equipment was old and marginal. In addition when taken to our room we found it had not yet been cleaned though housekeeping reported it set to go. Although the front desk staff were apologetic we sat in the lobby for three hours getting continuing reports from the housekeeping staff that the room was almost ready. Finally one of the bellman told us the room still had not been cleaned after three hours. We were eventually given another less desirable room.

I went to the bar because my husband and I traveled the weekend of Hurricane Matthew and by the time we got there we were tired and just wanted 2 stiff drinks. Thank you all of you in the bar that night. The drinks were what we needed. Because we got there late I went to the front desk and ask if anything was open. She gave me 2 menus we ordered and they delivered or food in about 12 hour. We arrived there on a Saturday night because I knew brunch was the next day. I was so excited to see Desire at Sunday brunch. She was there with a warm smile and greeted us with the best customer service that you could ask for. I would like to say thank you to Toderick and Tareza in reservations. Year after year I do not know what I would do with out you. Toderick thank you for the guidance on the service at the spa. You might not believe this but your ability to help us out with an appointment for the spa you may have saved my husbands life. Thank you.

My family and I stayed for 4 nights in December. Every single day the beach andor pool ran out of towels. One day by noon beach umbrellas were also out of stock. The first day we figured it was a fluke but this has happened every single day. We brought this up to management on day 2 but on day 3 and 4 there was still a constant towel shortage. Housekeeping was terrible. They made the main beds left fresh towels and rinsed out tub and sink. but that \u2019s it. They did not mop sweep or vacuum floor or bathroom floor. They did not straighten the pull out couch or make the bed or even go into living room area at all. On day 2 we mentioned it to the front desk and they promised it would be addressed but it was actually worse. Sand and hair were all over our bathroom floor. The living area where my son slept was not refreshed at all. I spoke to the front desk and they promised they would have it addressed. Hours later the room still was n\u2019t touched. At that point we spoke to a manager and he assured us it would be handled and it was. Day 3 and 4 were back to the same poor cleaning. Living room was never touched and pull out bed was never made or refreshed. There is no door lock on bathroom barn door and it tended to slide open even when closed. The lounge chairs by the pool are in great need of replacement. The vast majority are worn and ripped. By the looks of them they should have been replaced ages ago. There was also lots of what appeared to be tiny dirty styrofoam balls floating in the side drain areas of the pool. We saw them the first day but they were still there for four days straight. It was was nice that the hotel had complementary after dinner hot chocolate and coffee in the lobby. However at 620pm the hot chocolate was already empty. My son saw it and wanted some so I asked at the front desk if it could be replenished and was told that \u201c if it \u2019s empty it \u2019s empty \u201d. My son was upset but the front desk guy just had an \u201c I \u2019m sorry \u201d shrug. Not so awesome to tell a little kid that he ca n\u2019t get the hot chocolate even though there \u2019s a big sign saying \u201c hot chocolate \u201d right in front of him. When the weather was cold and rainy I went to the front desk to ask what local indoor activities were available for families. Both front desk agents looked as if they have never been asked the question and had zero suggestions. One guy flipped through a bunch of coupons in a binder but ultimately had no recommendations. If the hotel is not large enough for a Concierge then the front desk staff should at least have knowledge on local options. Our new suite room 608 looked lovely at first glance but it seemed like it was done in a huge rush. Trim was sloppily painted front door knob is on crooked paint and spackle is uneven and sloppy painters tape still on the air vent in living room cold water did not not work in the bathroom both bathroom sinks are stuck in the \u201c closed \u201d drain position and fill up with water unles you physically pull out the center drain and rug pad in living room is too big for area rug and is showing. There was no \u201c do not disturb \u201d light or door hanger. TV in living room was fuzzy at best supposedly awaiting an upgrade to the same cable system the bedroom tv is on. The lights went on for no reason in the middle of the night waking us up. No insulation under front door and you can hear EVERYTHING from the hallway and frequent loud motorcycle noise from A1A Guest elevators are being used for the movement of construction materials and are constantly filthy. On top of that it \u2019s a very long wait for the elevators because they are being used for both guests and construction use. My husband explained to manager Kelvin some of the issues that arose over our nights here and he comped one night of our stay. That was a nice very gesture and certainly appreciated. We have stayed at the Pelican Grand in the past numerous times and never had a stay like this. We sent a note about our experience to the GM and Exec Committee a couple weeks ago and never received a reply.

We really enjoyed our stay at the Pelican Grand Beach resort. After doing a TON of research on hotels in the area I was not impressed with nor did I want to stay at the big hotel chains. Not only did reviews and pictures of those not look appealing but they are not even situated directly on the beach. Pelican Grand is situated RIGHT on the beach which was amazing. I did not mind that this hotel was a bit off the beaten path a bit from the hustle of Fort Lauderdale. I liked how it was in it is own area however extremely accessible to all the fun bars and restaurants. Taxis are very quick to get and you are about 12 minutes away from Las Olas. The hotel itself was very clean and the service was very nice. From Brian at the pool to the restaurant staff to the beach staff everybody was at your service checking in on you frequently. The rooms were crisp clean and modern. Beds were comfortable plenty of space. The food was great however a bit pricey which was not a surprise. The coffee and ice cream shop was my favorite and actually pretty reasonable we stopped there every day. We did not eat at Ocean 200 for dinner however for brunch one day and it was delicious. Lunch at the pool and bar were good too. The spa was great with beautiful views. Overall I would definitely recommend and would stay here again in a heartbeat.

We have been cruising out of the Fort Lauderdale Port everglades for 20 years now and have stayed in many Ocean side hotels from fort Lauderdale to Sunny Isle Fl. over the years. We discovered the Pelican Grand Hotel 4 years ago when looking for an ocean side beach hotel resort to stay at the day before our cruises that was a little away from the busy tourist scene. a little further down the fort lauderdale beach we found our new pre cruise home at the Pelican Grand. The historic look and bright colors of the exterior instantly grab you attention and almost transcends you back in time to when things were much slower and tranquil. We instantly fell in love with the charm and perfect location. As you arrive you are welcomed with a freindly greeting and great service to assist you with your luggage. Upon walking into the main entrance of the hotel you are visually met with bright yet warm colors that feels very comfortable and welcoming. We always stay in a ocean side king suite with beautiful views and fresh breeze of the Atlantic Ocean. directly out the back of the hotel is a well manicured freshly combed beach just footsteps away from the ranch style porch where you can sit and enjoy drinks meal from either restaurant on site and enjoy the warm ocean air and the sound of the gentle rolling waves as they roll onto and away from the sandy beach. The Staff has always been very friendly and welcoming. Added benefits of the pool and lazy river as well as the spa on the top floor of the hotel.

Great rom. But So Many Issues. This hotel sits right on the beach fabulous location great pool possibly one of the best rooms I and my wife have ever been in king ocean front suite my wife LOVED her spa treatment. but oh so many issues.

We were on Floor 10 and we never made it all the way up or down without stopping at multiple phantom floors that is no one there usually floors 3 6 7 and 9. All the guests were talking about this even the bellmen noted this as an ongoing issue. So the elevators were terribly slow because of it. The free wifi is terrible basically there is no wifi. I have never been in a hotel that did not have a book of hotel services and offerings you know like food options room service spa choices etc in the room. None here. I called the front desk they said they do not have such a thing. You can go to Hotel services on the TV but there is no information there. There were no robes in the room. I called the front desk they sent 2 up no charge but why were not they in the room. No free water bottles in the room. for 60 a night they should provide free water not the ones you have to pay for at either 3 or 6 each. We had the Sunny Side Up package which includes breakfast but not really. They give you coupons which give you a 20 breakfast credit. Our first morning the waiter gave us an 18 credit we had to correct him. And 20 does not go far. two eggs with bacon OJ and coffee and you are already over the 20.
