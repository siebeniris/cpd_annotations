Later that night the front desk called me to tell me she made a mistake and it should have been 400 a night but she spoke with the owner and they could do 300 instead.

I was VERY happy with my room. The one of 3 ocean view rooms 3rd floor the best if you like to get sun off your balcony. Being a quite single 60 year old male I was pleased there were no young and noisy neighbors. The maid service was superb. This place is as clean as you can get. The only thing wrong with my room was it was cold. There was no door sweep to keep the draft out. and unfortunately it was a cold week. I did throw a towel under the door which helped. There was an air conditioner but not a heater. So it was kind of uncomfortableIn the evening hours. I did not come prepared with cold weather night ware. At bedtime I used the other beds comforter. Which sufficed. I wish there was an extra blanket in the closet. But I know this was an unusually cold week and things like that are not necessary. Although this place is not the most beautiful motel on the island. I guarantee if your not a picky person who needs all the best things a hotel has to offer you will not regret your stay. The price is one of the lowest in the keys. That is what caught my eye. I worried a little about the reviews but gave it a chance. I am happy I did.
