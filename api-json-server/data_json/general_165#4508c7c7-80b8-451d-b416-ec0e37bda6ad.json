I have stayed at the Munich City Hotel since the early 80s because of its location. The hotel is located just off the central S Band Lines at Rosenheimer Plats. It is an ideal hotel to get to from the airport and is convenient to visit the Center form or as a base for work. The hotel needs a facelift. There is little else I can say almost everything is now looking tired. Even the staff are ready for the up grade which should happen next year. The problem is that the guests are paying the same price as the newer hotels are charging in the center without the quality of the accommodations. The Hilton has a nice restaurant but it is only used in the morning for breakfast. If you want to eat at the hotel then you suit in the hallway to the restaurant. It is rather unpleasant. There are a number of very good restaurants only a few stops away on the S Band in the center. The staff are simply outstanding at this hotel. The concierge who has been at the hotel for years is one of the best concierge at any hotel I have stayed at. The front desk is typical Bavarian cool but pleasant and the staff at breakfast are very good and efficient. The room I had again could use a new coat of paint and updated bathroom but it was spacious good interior lighting and the desk was well equipped for computers and other electronics. The room was very quiet and bed very comfortable. The only issue I had was the room was rather dark with out the lights turned on even during the middle of the day.

Stayed 2 nights in this newly renovated well located full service Hilton hotel. Overall it felt like a much lower 2 or 25 star hotel with many flaws. The management is very underwhelming and non responsive even after several pleasant conversations with subordinate staff members. I am typically Hilton Diamond or Gold over past several years and stay exclusively at Hilton hotels around the world when posible1. A C is not actually A C by any worldwide standard. Room is very stuffy with 2 persons high humidity in the room. my hair will not even dry out after shower. This is actually a water cooled heat exchange system NOT A C since the air temp is barely cooler than the room itself. Several conversations with staff not a single manager cared2. Executive lounge nowhere near international standards. I would not eat there again. poor service bad and tiny food selection certainly not the discerning among us. It seemed more like a free beer hall with people scrambling to avoid each other while in line for free booze very unbecoming of a Hilton3. Breakfast was abysmal by German standards. I even got yelled at by a staff member for asking why the bread was so hard I could not even cut it or break it. it seemed very stale. maybe 2 days. Overall the selections are not great. especially the eggs were quite poor. I asked to see a manager and was told no one is available. got to the front desk which I did and was told this is a good selection with good availability not even close to true. I even saw many people on both days complaining to each other about the breakfast. 4. Positive points for bar and service but music far too loud and inappropriate for this type of Hotel. Songs had swear words. even as children were sitting outside with parents. this would never happen at any other HIlton. I am not sure what this Hilton is aiming for.

Upon checkin a very friendly Jade warmly welcomed us and gave us some welcome chocolates. Our room was a decent size and had two comfortable single beds. This was little shocking for my 14 year old. Air conditioning worked well. The hotel had a recent remodel and everything was fresh and new. The one downside was the in the bathroom with the half glass shower door bathtub combo. I have never been a fan of these as water gets everywhere and this was no exception. Interestingly our room was connecting on both sides. I have never seen this before and tend to avoid connecting rooms. I did not hear any noise at all from either side. House keeping was probably the only lackluster component of this great stay. Inconsistent. Twice I had to call as face cloths were never restocked. The trash was not always emptied in the bathroom. Somedays it looked that only the barest minimum duties were performed. As Diamond you get two complimentary bottles of water in the room per stay and there are no individual water bottles in the Exec lounge. You can fill up your water bottles in the lounge if need be. The Exec lounge is beautiful with two balconies. There is a great breakfast with eggs sausage bacon cold cuts cheese rolls fruit yogurt and cereal. This was above average exec lounge breakfast fare. Kudos to Fatima. We asked for gluten free bread and she managed to track some down from the downstairs kitchen and every morning when we entered she remembered and would always ask if she should call the kitchen. A most appreciated touch. The evening presentation was very basic and somewhat of a letdown with hardly the variety of the breakfast service. Not really any hors doeuvres or cheese and crackers. Basically 2 mains which would run out as soon as they were served and it took some time to get replenished. There were also complimentary beer wine and cocktails. The amount of guests partaking in the evening presentation was much greater at one time than breakfast due to the 2 hour window. There would be entire families having dinner in the lounge. This led to overcrowding and a Las Vegas style buffet line with guests rushing to get food as soon as it was placed. Location is great. Plenty of restaurants and shops nearby.
