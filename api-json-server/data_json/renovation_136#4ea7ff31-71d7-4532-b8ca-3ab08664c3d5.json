This is a pretty darn good hotel for what it is. I do not mean that in a bad way but the hotel is in desperate need of renovation. My room has a very distinct 90s feel to it I do not know how often Hyat refreshes its decor but this one is past due. The location is within walking distance from a couple of shopping centers and approximately a mile away from I6. It was HOT mid 90s. during my stay and the AC for my room operated strangely and would stay on for 30 60 seconds just to keep the temperature as such I had a horrible first night of rest. It was only in the morning was I learned the workaround to keep the fan running constantly. On the plus side the fitness center has free weights and several treadmills and elliptical and the pool and hot tub were both operational which is more than I can say for some Hyats. As for the perks as a Hyat Platinum I did receive an upgrade to the Panoramic room with a 160 degree panoramic also received free breakfast for 2 and a free afternoon drink and snack at the NOVA bar. Both times I visited the front desk there was a queue but the staff was efficient overall.", "offset": [63, 144], "date": "2015-07-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "8c3c5762-5ae4-415d-8854-872175c015af", "sentence": "Nice facility and great service.

I stayed for two nights for a friends wedding. Her block of rooms were aprox. half off of the list price. I sure hope the list price was for the renovated rooms. Half off made this room very affordable even without considering it was 1 near DC and 2 the July 4th weekend. The hotel info says the renovation will be completed by fall 2016. The room I was in was a good size. It had a king bed a sitting area with a sofa mini fridge coffee machine and desk. The TV sat on a dresser that served as a half wall between the two spaces. There were huge windows in both the sitting and bed room areas. The bathroom was dark especially the shower. It was slippery the non slip texture stickers having worn off or been removed. The small underpowered light in the loo bath space is over the toilet and then an opaque shower curtain made the shower VERY dark. Dark slippery not a good combo. The sink is outside the dored space and offered a decent amount of counter but not a lot. There was a lighted magnifying mirror and iron in the room but I never found a hairdryer. which is odd. The bed was comfortable enough and I felt there was a sufficient variety of pillow styles. The AC was quiet but effective quiet is a great thing since many hotel AC units are just too loud. The sofa and other furniture pretty much needs the renovation it is all tired and worn out. I hope they are also replacing the wallpaper and the carpets. The location is great if you want to be in Fairfax lots of shopping and food nearby. Easy to get to from both Dulles and Reagan airports although traffic may make the journey long especially from Reagan depending on the time of day day of wekOveral for the price I paid I was happy enough.

Before I left the Hotel I was assured that my entire stay would be refunded but to my disappointment I was told by an Expedia rep that they only approved two days. I placed a formal complaint to customer service via email but have not heard from them yet going on 48 hours.
