Visited the JW for our anniversary a Tuesday through a Sunday and chose this hotel because of the pool and proximity to the quarter and business district. We had a corner room executive king room which faced towards the business district on the 23rd floor. PARKING. Parking was nightmare. We could n\u2019t even pull up to the hotel to drop off our bags as the loading zone was full of vans. We double parked so I could ask where to park since we tried calling and the line would not go through. The young valet attendant said to park elsewhere and was not at all helpful. POOL. The pool area is much smaller than pictures make if seem. It \u2019s a very hip area but was full and so where to sit and there are limited lounge chairs. We also were kicked out for trying to bring a couple of drinks out with us as they have a small portable bar that they want you to buy from. I did n\u2019t know there was this option as there is no information on the hotel website about it. We had hard cider as i am gluten intolerant and they did not serve hard cider so we had our drinks in the tiny lobby instead. It was n\u2019t at all what we were shooting ambience wise. The Roosevelt or the Hilton river front have a much better pool area and vibe. The pool was the main reason we booked at this hotel and we never got to use it. Huge disapointment. LOBBY AND CHECK IN. Lobby is so small and lacking a wow factor. There also were at least 6 10 employees gathered near the door. It \u2019s nice to see they have enough staff. Lobby had fruit flavored water most of the time. I recommend using the ap to check in ahead of time. Check in staff was very friendly and professional. ROOM. The room was clean and fresh but definitely reminded me of my grandma \u2019s house with the green carpet and beige on beige d\u00e9cor. The corner executive suite was no where near as nice as the Roosevelt or Hilton but was just \u201c nice \u201d. The bed was a bit too soft for my preference but my husband liked it. The bathrom vanity was in a galley style format LOCATION NOLA is not new to us but we still wanted to be near the quarter but spent a lot of time in the business district which offers the same feel as the quarter but cheaper and less crowded. This hotel is perfectly located for both and has two streetcar options right outside of the hotel which will take you to the garden district. Jackson square is about a 10 minute walk from the JW. STAFF. All of my encounters with staff were very professional and positive. Staff were all polite and treated us as though we were their 1 priority this was not the case at all at the Roosevelt. I appreciate the JW level of customer service. Management should know what a great job they are doing. Concierge also sent us complimentary champagne and strawberries for our anniversary. That was a very nice touch. OTHER They are doing maintenance on the elevators so there are only a couple in use so it took forever to get up and down. It seemed like most of the hotel guests were young hipsters or convention goers. I did n\u2019t see anyone that looked like they were there for a romantic holiday like we were hence we never felt like we wanted to stay at the hotel since the pool and lobby were duds. The Roosevelt is definitely the best option for romantic ambience. TIPS. CVS is right around the corner from the JW and has a great selection of drinks and snacks that can easily be brought back to the room. Daisy Dukes is open 24 hours and is across the street as well and has killer deals of really good po boys and breakfast 5 breakfast.", "offset": [2856, 2978], "date": "2015-10-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "7e1ed619-ded5-46b1-8500-002b81b06a4f", "sentence": "Very nice. My husband and I stayed at this hotel in July during Essence Festival. The hotel was very nice clean quiet and in a great location.

We booked this hotel for the week before the actual Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday. We stayed here for same period last year also. I think possibly the rooms are getting a little dated or just lack proper service. Our TV needed the technician to come to fix it as did our neighbors. Once I saw the reset button on the back needed to be reset I became my own technician. The A C did not work properly and could not cool the room. Technician came and fixed it right away as we were leaving to take a walking tour. We returned late in the evening and found the room had really cooled to be now actually cold so we moved the thermostatFrom 65 to 70 \u00b0 and went to bed. The next morning A C was still going and room just as cold. This time we shut it off and left for another walking tour. We returned later that day and found that you could not adjust the temps or shut the A C off. We passed this info on to the tech who came to fix the TV but we are leaving next day so I have no idea if it was ever repaired correctly. The service at the Mariot was superb as we have come to expect. The lounge is now on ground level instead of 28th floor. It was as expected well maintained with a very courteous staff. The hotel is obvious under renovation as signs are up regarding elevators being updated. This hotel is located where nearly all activities are walkable. We will return to this mystic city next year for Mardi Gras but not sure we will stay here.

There was no fan in the bathroom so everything was damp and the bathtub did not drain so I had to take a shower standing in 2 3 inches of water.

I did not think it was a big deal but they were notified and they said they would send someone to look into it. The following day the water was even warmer.
