I stayed at this property for a business meeting. it is a large hotel attached to a small shopping center. It was a bit complicated finding the hotel although that might have just been my GPS. The valet was efficient and convenient. Checkin was also very efficient. There was a mistake in my reservation arriving the next day but the clerk quickly remedied that and gave me a room. My room was on a high floor in the corner a nice upgrade. The room had all of the typical amenities. I preordered breakfast which arrived right on time. The wifi was fast although there was a charge. One complaint was that there were no few convenient electrical outlets. For example there was no outlet that would allow me to sit on the bed and work on my computer or have my cell phone charging on the night stand. This capability is table stakes these days.

The stay was OK but not great. I was on the Club floor and had to move rooms because a neighbour had flooded their room and it had ruined the carpet and walls in the corridor. This was obviously not the hotels fault. But the corridor was very noisy from the two big heaters being used to dry out the damage. The Club Room was a bedroom used for food and watching sports TV. The breakfast was awful. There were mistakes every day of my six days there. Butter with nothing to put it on. Croissants with nothing to put on them. When asked frozen butter arrived. They was just one juice and one main item. Coffee was from a thermos flask and we had paper cups only. They ran out of things frequently so there might be bacon but no eggs. It is rare in America to have a breakfast and be hungry afterwards. There was a line downstairs in the main restaurant so I never tried it. The corridor was also noisy from people entertaining theur children there and shoting from the Club room to their room asking if people wanted another bun etc. I had definitely suggest requesting floor 18 which is also a Club floor but without the noise of the Club room.
