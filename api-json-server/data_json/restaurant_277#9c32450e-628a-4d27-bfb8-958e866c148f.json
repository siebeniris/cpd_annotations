We have visited this property more than once. Good location for walking Nashville. on site bar restaurant. Great service clean and comfortable. They have valet parking which is key in downtown as there is no parking.", "offset": [121, 144], "date": "2018-05-03", "cpt": "3", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 34, "uid": "b0d879d1-f02c-4db6-8ef8-23b56999f6d7", "sentence": "This was my first time here and it was a very nice hotel.

Let me state that we stay at Hilton \u2019s 95 of the time and we travel constantly. First the good. the hotel is in a very good location for walking to wonderful restaurants museums Broadway Honkey Tonk \u2019s and other entertainment. It has a very inviting lobby with a great outdoor area a good fitness center good breakfast buffet although there were gnats flying around and on the pastries the room was clean and the bed comfy. We had no problem with the hotel itself but the service was a little off. I will say the hotel was full so maybe that was the reason but that \u2019s really no excuse. As we were checking in the front desk evening lady tried to argue that my husband was not a diamond loyalty member even though he had his number with him and he is just a few stays from being diamond for life that \u2019s a that of stays said because it did n\u2019t show in her screen that he could n\u2019t be diamond. I asked the time for the breakfast buffet and was told it goes until 1030 am I even asked if she was sure because that is an odd time but she said yes found out next morning as we were showing up at 10 that it ended at 10. There is some minor renovation work being done on the floor we were on 7. When this person left for the day there was debris left all over the carpeted floor that should have been vacuumed but was there everyday we were and each day there was more and more. Our room was never cleaned and when I called later in the afternoon I said that was ok but we needed fresh towels. I was told they would be sent right up but after coming back later in the evening there were no fresh towels so had to call again. The TV only worked part of the time. I understand all these things are minor and not the norm for Hilton properties and it would not affect my staying here again but I was just a little disappointed because the service is usually top notch at Hilton \u2019s. The concierge and the breakfast wait staff totally rocked though.", "offset": [1913, 1978], "date": "2019-04-17", "cpt": "3", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 37, "uid": "a59ca4e6-55c5-44d1-88e7-6cccfd8e3043", "sentence": "Very Nice.

Nothing. Mid afternoon I asked to speak to the manager. I outlined the problem. He said that is when we get our food delivery maybe you should talk to the restaurant manager. Then I said At the very least I want a different room on the other side of the building. Believe it or not this horrible manager said I do not see why I need to change your room. Does Hilton provide any training these days for managers. Just unbelievable. MOST cities in the US have noise restrictions for example Denver prohibits even leaf blowers until 7 am but apparently Hilton has no problem with many of its guests being disturbed and awakened by a food truck at 430 in the morning. I will not be staying at Hilton again.

After some back and forth they did honor the reservation and gave us two beds. That may be the reason for upcharging us.
