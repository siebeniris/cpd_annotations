First a bit of context. We normally do not travel to the more commercialized islands such as St Thomas and our real destination was Canel Bay in St John. However since we flew into St Thomas we figured we had spend a couple days and check out the island. Also although we love the high end American hotel experiences when traveling stateside we always try to find hotels that offer more authentic experiences when traveling abroad particularly when venturing down to the caribbean. So we were prepared for a comfortable relaxing experience with typical high end ritz service but I at least expected to be longing for the next leg of our journey. The bottom line was that I was pleased with both the island and the resort and could see myself returning given the ease of travel from the DC area. Now for the review. First up the island and hotel location. The Ritz is located near the smaller city of Red Hook. So we were able to easily visit this little town a few times for bar experiences and at least one very good restaurant Pecse. There are also a couple of minimarts for you to buy anything you want while on your stay. The town was fun but very small and not a lot to do other than what I mentioned. Getting to the main town Charlotte Amalie is a more challenging 20 to 30 minute cab ride away. However we found the town to be quite charming with several great looking restaurants unfortunately we only were able to venture into one Malfolie which was perched above the town and afforded us a great evening view of the town. We could have spent more time down town but limited time on the island and distance from the ritz prevented us from doing so. Check the cruise ship schedules if you want to avoid the crowds. On to the hotel. We found the hotel brands calling card luxury and service not lacking here. Others have stated that they felt the hotel was aging. That was nt our observation especially when considering the challenges of maintaining a property on the ocean. The room was very nice and well appointed as you would expect. And the bed was extemely comfortable. Also we booked the hotel through amex platinum so we got a nice upgrade to ocean view and a late check out. A minor annoyance was that the room was nt available upon check in. I know that we were there at 130 and check. in is nt until 3 or 4 but the hotel was only about 50 full so you would think they could be prepared for an earlier arrival. I had mixed feelings about the beach. I thought it was small and crowded with beach chairs albeit largely unoccupied. it just did nt invoke that caribbean feeling for me even though the view was quite nice. However if you venture over to the residents side which you are allowed to do. You will find a much larger beach that for us created a greater sense of serenity and relaxation. The water at either beach is calm and good for dipping or swimming. I aso saw a few people snorkeling but that is something we did nt try. One other thing about the residents beach the drinks are cheaper there 5 beer vs 7 on the hotel side but you can not charge to your room so bring cash. A few other miscellaneous observations1. the wifi was exceptional even on the beach2. free bottled water in the room as much as much as you can drink really appreciated this when we got to canel and they did nt offer you one bottle anywhere had to buy at 4 a pop3 only had one lunch there down at the hotel beach but breakfast every day. The food was very good but did nt see anything authentic on the lunch menu4. they have a very good gymSo in conclusion we enjoyed our stay a bit more than expected. If you relish the high end luxury experience and want a resort that is relatively easy to get to this is probably a good 5 star option for you. For us we will always seek out the more remote authentic experiences but we would have a problem returning to the ritz and st thomas.", "offset": [518, 681], "date": "2015-12-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "1c709819-ae8e-4ff1-8cea-ce5162d212cc", "sentence": "Amazing in every aspect.

For a property of this size and expectation that in itself was fascinating. The food was delicious at the Italian restaurant. Breakfast. banana fosters French toast was amazing. You do have to get up early to get a good pool side chair location but a simple tip on your first day goes a long way to getting a little bit extra service if that is possible. I was impressed to see some of the staff Charles actually engaging and playing soccer with some of the guests. Rashawn gave us some great tips about Red Hook. They really take their time to treat you right. The one suggestion I would make and yes I recognize this is an island is that recycling becomes more prevalent in the resort. Perhaps the resort recycles behind the scenes but it would be nice to throw the plastic cups and plastic water bottles that are provided throughout the day into a recycle bin and not a garbage can.

I am currently staying at the Ritz St Thomas with my husband and two children. This is our fifth visit to this Ritz Carlton and we are loyal to the brand. We have stayed in many other Ritz Carlton locations over the past 20 years. Our last visit to this location was several years ago with about 12 family members for our annual \u201c family trip \u201d which is why we chose the Club Floor then and chose it for this trip as well. Regarding the staff they are extremely accommodating and always willing to help. Everyone is very pleasant and will go out of their way to assist with any request. Miss Olivia in Guest Relations has been particularly helpful. She communicated with me before our arrival and has stayed in touch during our stay to make sure everything was to our liking. She went out of her way to make a very special Valentine \u2019s for our daughter and niece. She is terrific. My only disappointment with the hotel is the Club Level amenities. The club staff is terrific \u2026 very friendly and very hard working. Breakfast is very good. The staff tries to keep everything well stocked. Breakfast food choices in The Club are good not excellent just good. When we stayed here with a group of 12 several years ago the breakfast was very abundant \u2026. Large warmers of scrambled egg piles of crispy bacon assorted baked goods delicious fruit. Everything looked full and abundant. The display was beautiful. Now the breakfast is good \u2026 They have a chef making omelettes but because there is only one person at that job if you are here with a family you must wait quite a while for all of the omelettes to be made so it \u2019s pretty difficult to all eat at one time or close together. The selections in the 5 PM to 8 PM and 8 PM to 10 PM hours are very meager. I have been to many Ritz Carlton Clubs before and this is definitely nothing like what I \u2019ve seen at the other clubs. This is in no way reflective of the wonderful staff in the Club they are doing the best they can with what they \u2019ve got to work with. In other clubs the presentations are all full and appetizing \u2026 They never look picked over. In the other clubs the famous Ritz Carlton cookies are beautifully displayed and all the different varieties are always available \u2026 chocolate chip oatmeal peanut butter sugar. In this club sometimes they have one or two varieties of cookies available in a glass jar. They clearly put a lot of money into the renovation of this club but it looks like they \u2019re putting very little into the food presentations of the club once breakfast is done. The dessert selection is fair but nothing special. Again it \u2019s never abundant or very appetizing looking. On Valentine \u2019s Day there were heart shaped cookies and some brownies along with chocolate covered strawberries which were gone very early in the evening and never replaced. If I had never experienced another Ritz Carlton Club before I would probably think this was OK but not worth the money. But because I have experienced so many different clubs \u2026 Naples Beach Resort Naples Golf Resort South Beach Key Biscayne New York City etc. I can see the downgrade in the quality and quantity of food offerings. The Ritz Carlton Naples Beach resort has a spectacular Club. I \u2019m not sure why such a down grade has occurred \u2026 If it has anything to do with the Ritz Carlton being acquired by Mariot but I can definitely say the Club is just not worth it in its current state. It \u2019s turned me off somewhat to Ritz Carlton overall because in the past it seems like they were concerned about giving the guest an exceptional experience and now they are just skating by with the bare minimum. Again this is not reflective of the staff in anyway this just pertains to the food and beverage presentations in the Club.
