The bed was very comfortable and I like the fact that we had a Jacuzi tub in the bedroom as well. It was not crowded so we never had to wait long for the elevator. I also liked being on the 4th floor as opposed to the 1st floor. When we first entered the room there was a moldy smell. Our room did not have a fan in the bathroom to help with the ventilation. I thought the hotel could use some cosmetic updates ie chipping paint in the lobby dining area around the baseboards and cabinets caulking around the tub in the room was missing etc.", "offset": [378, 560], "date": "2017-07-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "aa43af31-9176-4853-a691-6258ce79ec85", "sentence": "Terrible customer service.

There was no mention that the property was under construction remodeling when booking at this facility.

I found out when i called the hotel to find out the hours that the pool was open for my teenage son. I was told it would be closed for several months for renovations. i asked if the hotel had made arrangements with another hotel in the area for guests to use their facilities until renovations were complete i had to explain what i meant 3 times before being told they they had never heard of such a thing being done. Okay i realize i am from another state HOWEVER this is not something new as a matter of fact my friends who were in SC at the same time for a college graduation in another part of the state had similar issue when they asked about gym the hotel had advised that they were upgrading equipment but that they had made arrangements with another hotel in the area to allow use of their facilities as well as offering a free shuttle to and from that hotel for guests to use those facilities. So my question was not unreasonable. i will NEVER book from this chain again without calling each hotel location i am interested in to confirm what facilities were be available for the dates of my trip.", "offset": [0, 139], "date": "2018-05-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "c23d0cc1-a938-4ddb-95e2-7eee2ecc83cb", "sentence": "OK at Best.

The bed was comfortable. The staff was very nice and was helpful. The food was pretty good. The location was amazing. No more than 15 minutes from everything we wanted to do. The room was clean. The construction is really inconvenient. You could n\u2019t access the back door sometimes so we would have to park at the very back of the hotel walk all the way to the front and then walk all the way to the back where our room was. Also there were a lot of bugs in the elevator. They were spray painting the pool railings and ended up getting paint on our car. We will be filing a claim to have it repaired but I feel they should have closed off that back parking lot if they were going to be spray painting. The \u2018 cooler \u2019. they explained that they do n\u2019t have refrigerators but only coolers was broken and screeched. I had to unplug it the first and second night. When I told them it was broken the first night they came and just plugged it back in instead of doing anything. The third day they actually switched it out. The hot water was hit and miss. The elevator had a very inappropriate anti Semitic carving in the elevator door and when I let them know they did n\u2019t seem to care.
