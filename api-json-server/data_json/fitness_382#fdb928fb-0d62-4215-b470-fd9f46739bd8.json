This was my stay this past 4th of July weekend which I stay each year for several days at he this Hilton. Arrived friday afternoon July 3 I already checked in online. At the front desk I aksed for the key to executive level to see the ladies that run the conceriege service as I have in the past stayed in rooms where you can go to this level and I am a silver honors card holder. I was told it is closed for the weekend. I have watched fire works from the lounge for the past 8 years. First disappointment. Second I was awake all night by loud laughing persons going up and down the aisle on my floor. Wedding people having thier fun. Not a good night where is Security. Have fun at your weddings but not at my expence. Saturday morning I enjoyed my hometown of Chatham festivities and came back to the hotel for a restful afternoon. NOT. The inside pool was mobbed with unruly children the sauna the same. Several families actually brought in lots of food began to set up two tables by the entrance to the pool. and set up a full buffet for themselves. Are you kidding me. Look at your security dvr for Saturday July 4 at around 2 pm you can not make this stuff up. Horrific outside almost the same. I told the Manager of the Spa. While she did come in once the problem still existed. Screaming jumping using water squirt toys which they seem to get me. Parents not even wathiching the children. Was told because of weather had to open it up. Really. When does the Hotel become responsible for entertainment of children when the weather is not nice. Is that not the parents responsibility. The children should not have been allowed in the indoor pool if so there should be someone monitoring the activities and lack of abiding the pool rules. Horrific so I went outside. Just as bad seems people must own thier own chairs because I could hardly find a place to sit. I could not wait to leave. My room was good I like the new Tvs. However this Hilton has lost it is refinement decorum and just class. I felt as though I was staying in a less than desirable named Hotel. I am to stay there in the next few weeks again but I really think I will not too much of a hassle for traverls like myself. I was an avid fan of this Hotel no longer will I advocate to my friends as a place to stay. The Efora manager did send me a little trinket I thought that was very nice. Good Customer Service. But the problemn needs to stop. I woke up early this morning to check out. could not wait to get out of there. The lady at the Desk Diana did not even ask me how my stay is. Okay after 400 later for a two day stay no thanks Short Hills Hilton you lost a good customer. If I had seen Anthony he would have taken care of everythingI did not ask for a Manger of the Hotel. I was too discusted at this point.", "offset": [864, 931], "date": "2015-07-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "a1ae31c8-fd47-45cd-be56-4cc12537791c", "sentence": "Work or Play the Hilton Short Hills is the place to Stay. The Hilton Short HilsThe Hilton Short Hills resort hotel is located 25 minutes from New York City in the fabled town of Short Hills New Jersey. The Hilton is perfectly located within walking distance of the Short Hills mall excellent upscale dining The Paper Mill Playhouse and some of the Tri States most beautiful homes and estates. We revisited the hotel at the invitation of the new General Manager Jan Larsen. Entering the hotel lobby we were once again impressed with the magnificent hand crafted crystal chandelier and the marble and dark wood panelled decor. We were pleased to see that our suite had a fabulous view of the the lush greenery around the hotel. Our bedroom was set off from the living room with attractive french doors with a comfortable king bed and a large flat screen tv chairs and a small desk. The Short Hills hilton is a perfect combination of resort and state of the art business center. It is also one of the Garden States most popular catering facilities with a large ballroom and several smaller rooms for business meetings bar and bat mitzvahs weddings and events. I had the pleasure of meeting with Michele Miterer Director of Event and Catering. We visited the Ballroom and the smaller event and business rooms. Michele and the rooms were impressive and certainly one of the main reasons the Hilton has maintained its pre eminent position as one of the best hotels for weddings and bar mitzvahs. Business Travellers and guests can enjoy indoor and outdoor. swimming pools outdoor tennis courts a state of the art gym indoor and outdoor swimming pools a gourmet dining room and the Retreat a club like bar and lounge with music and informal dining. The Hilton also features the renowned services of the Eforea Spa a luxe beauty spa for both men and women. After a brutal winter we were thrilled to once again find a serene oasis with luxe amenities great dining gorgeous swimming pools and a glamorous spa. We picked up our keys at the front desk quickly unpacked and went down to the dining room for light supper of salad burgers and pie. We then relaxed in the Retreat lounge and then went up to our suite for a much needed rest. The next morning we luxuriated in the sunlight coming into our room and enjoyed a luscious room service breakfast of hot and cold cereals bacon and eggs hot muffins with honey tea and coffee. Our server Miriam was delightful upbeat and meticulous. She started our day on a high note. We decided to try and work off our meals at the conveniently located gym. After 90 minutes of stationery bike and treadmill it was time to clean up and explore Short Hills. We took a quick car ride to the Short Hills Mall explored some of the fabulous shops and then returned to the hotel for some fun in the sun. We spent a couple of hours at the fabulous outdoor pool which was filled with guests and club members from the town. The pool has facilities for young and old as well as a small snack shack for exotic juice drinks snacks and sandwiches. Towels and food orders were handled by a young and enthusiastic crew of staff. Later in the afternoon we had scheduled a trip to the renowned Eforea Spa for customized cleansing facials. We were warmly welcomed by the Spa manager April Tidey who then introduced us to our aestheticians. Eforea Spa is all about a memorable spa experience for men and women. Eforea was created by Hilton to find the finest elements and practices from Europe Asia the Pacific middle east africa and the americas. Eforea offers a one of a kind spa experience for global and domestic travellers. eforea spa amenities include 13 private treatment rooms an indoor heated swimming pool luxurious changing lounges thermal elements and a state of the art fitness center with a movement studio. During the summer an outdoor pool is available. The management and aestheticians at the Spa were welcoming and made the Spa experience memorable. We then returned to our room to shower relax and get ready for a gourmet dining experience at the Dining rom The Dining Room is a stunningly designed restaurant with large elegant tables and chairs and magnificent lighting fixtures. We felt like we were at a beautiful mansion with a private butler and staff. We had the opportunity to speak to chef Richard Kennedy and learn more about the cuisine. At the Hilton dining is about eating healthy food farm to table from local meat fish and poultry purveyors. Our meal began with a series of special appetizers Asparagus Risotto made with basil pesto and toasted almondsChiled Shrimp and Avocado Cocktail with a chunky compoteLoved the Risotto. We then shared a a combination of Classic Ceasar Salad made with romaine parmesan vinaigrette and a newly designed Kale Salad made with quinoa apple citrus and candied hazelnut with a balsamic dressing. Both salads were excellent. For our main course we feasted on A Brick Dough Salmon with warm quinoa salad preserved lemon aioli The Salmon was baked in a see through envelope of brick dough and was absolutely delicious. A large certified Porterhouse Perfectly prepared and plated medium and mildly seasoned accompanied by a bearnaise sauce and shoestring onions. Both dishes were served with pan roasted vegetables foraged sauteed mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The steak was delectable and easy to slice and enjoy. Certified cattle are specially raised for their tenderness and quality. We left the dining room on a sweet note with a small slice of Chocolate cake and a lemon sorbet. We also sampled a flourles chocolate torte with freshly whipped cream and raspberry coulis. We went back to our suite totally satieated and satisfied with our gourmet feast. We awoke the following morning enjoyed another fabulous breakfast in the dining room We had a light breakfast of cereal toast fresh fruit and coffee and tea. Quick and enjoyable so that we were able to spend our last day by the visiting the business center to review emails and then to outdoor pool soaking in the fabulous sunny day. The outdoor pool was packed with guests of all ages attended to by courteous staff members who supplied drinks and snacks. After luxuriating by the pool for a couple of hours we went back to the indoor lounge for a mid afternoon snack of cheese burgers homemade potato chips and iced tea. It was then time to pack up our bags and leave for home. Thanks and Kudos to GM Jan Larsen and his exceptional staff for their gracious hospitalitiy and to Miriam Lieberman and April Tidey and the wonderful staff at Eforea.

My friend and I were very excited to be spending a weekend at the Short Hills Hilton. I brought her for her birthday making sure I booked a room on the executive level at an additional cost. We arrived early as I have stayed at this hotel many times throughout the past 20 years and this was never an issue. We figured if a room was not ready we would grab our bathing suits and sit by the pool until one was available. The front desk was polite however I was told there is now a 25 additional fee to check in early. I have NEVER had a hotel charge for an early check in but were glad we could at least use the pool. We arrived at the OUTDOOR pool around lunchtime and it was insanely crowded. We had to drag lounge chairs across the deck just so we could sit together. We strongly suspect the hotel sells passes to community residents given the large crowd. The INDOOR pool was once a place to relax after indulging in spa services. Not only is the spa now closed but the pool looked like a kids summer camp. The grill they use to have polside outdoors was closed as well. They did have cold sandwiches. While using the pool locker room I overheard 2 young ladies talking. They were upset because their room was not ready and they had to get ready in the locker room for an event they were attending onsite. By 4 PM we had had enough sun and pool and proceeded to check in. We were then told there were no clean double rooms only king. I had prepaid for a double. We were tired and sweaty and wanted a shower and nap. They could not give us an estimate of how long it would take to clean a double. They used the excuse that many of the guests from the prior night checked out late. how is that my problem. I was on the verge of a fit when the front desk said they found us a room. Then I was told the executive level lounge was not open. Why do they offer this perk online if it is not available. They did give us a voucher for a free appetizer at their onsite restaurant for that evening with no plan to eat in house as well as a voucher for breakfast the next morning however this was a disappointing substitute. The room itself was nice enough although I would not say it was a luxury hotel room the food was OK and the staff were nice. The Short Hills Hilton is nothing like it use to be. I use to feel like royalty when I spent a weekend here.", "offset": [874, 948], "date": "2019-06-06", "cpt": "2", "category": "fitness"}]}
