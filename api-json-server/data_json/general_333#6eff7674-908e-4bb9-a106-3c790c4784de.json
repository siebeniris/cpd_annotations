I was pleasantly surprised with my recent stay at the Renaissance Portsmouth Norfolk Waterfront Hotel. We arrived before noon and went to see if our room was available early. Although our room was not ready the front desk staff was very helpful in telling us where to park and a few local things to do while we waited for our room to be ready. We then parked in the garage 100 per night and decided to do the walking tour of Portsmouth. We really enjoyed seeing all of the historical sights and when we were done we walked to High Street where many of the restaurants are located. We ended up eating lunch at the Bier Garden a great choice. When we were done with lunch we walked back to the hotel to see if our room was ready. We were told it was and we were also told we were the Mariot mobile customer of the day we are Mariot rewards members and we checked in via the Mariot mobile ap. We were rewarded with the London Suite and free parking. What a pleasant surprise for us. The front desk was very helpful and polite at check in. The hotel lobby was beautiful and very spacious and clean. Our room was on the 5th floor and the elevators were very quick there were four of them so we never had to wait. The London Suite was very spacious and appeared clean but it did have a stale odor. not sure what it was. The view was beautiful and we were very happy to be in such a large room. We checked out in the morning around 100 via our Mariot mobile ap. I did stop at the front desk prior to leaving to drop of the room keys and ask how the parking comp worked. The one thing that I was bothered by was that I never got was an email receipt I was told I would get one of our nights stay. Other than that we really enjoyed our stay and we will make the Renaissance Portsmouth Norfolk Waterfront Hotel our go to place when we are in the area again.", "offset": [1416, 1482], "date": "2015-06-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3eb6eaab-7aac-4712-9c05-11e09b44576b", "sentence": "Great place for vacation and wedding celebration.

I recently stayed here for a conference and spent 4 nights at the Renaissance. Unfortunately this property just does not live up to the Renaissance name. There were some great things about the hotel that need to be shared but some downsides that can not be overlooked as well. For starters and this has no effect on my overall scoring but should be mentioned. when you pull in there is no clear indication of where you should park. Like most hotels I pulled right up front to check in real quick before parking my car. I was greeted by valet who said I would have to park my car and then check in. This was somewhat inconvenient as I was already parked and out of the car and now I was in the way of others as I was trying to maneuver around to get back to the parking garage. Again this had no effect on my overall score but I do feel it is important for future guests to know. The check in process was fairly smooth. The girl at the desk was very polite. She acknowledged by Mariot Rewards status referred to my name several times and offered additional assistance. I was happy with the check in process overall. Unfortunately 3 days later I realized that she or someone else during my stay reauthorized my card several times. Luckily for me this was not an issue because I had enough padding on my credit limit but for a total bill of 500 being authorized nearly 150 could cause issues for some. My room was on the 9th floor and was in the corner. It had a great view of the harbor and was welcoming to walk in to. The room was clean enough. Carpet looks old and worn. Case goods are showing their age. And maintenance is definitely a huge downside to this hotel. There is evidence of many shoddy quick fixes. Sloppy paint jobs where the running paint was allowed to dry. Brush strokes inconsistent with the rest of the wall or door drawing attention to the fix. Moldy grout in the shower. Caulking that probably needs to be re done. Now I understand the average guest would not notice this stuff but when you stay at a brand like the Renaissance these are the things you expect to be right every time. Other small things that were bothersome from such a high end hotel were the fact that I had no trash cans in my room and the alarm clock was not set to the correct time. I know for a fact that if a Mariot inspector saw either of those items they would be dinged. I know it sounds like I am complaining over small things but again you expect more from a Renaissance. All of that being said the rest of the room which is the majority of what you experience was great. The bed was very comfortable. The pillows were nice and full and fluffy. Sleep quality was definitely not an issue for me. Again I really enjoyed the view from the room. The room was spacious and I did not really have any real issues with it. Spent the majority of my time attending meetings on site. For the most part the banquet staff was very helpful and attentive. We had some minor issues one morning where we did not see a single staff member and were unable to get some help with some small requests doors unlocked water etc but it was not a huge deal. The manager was around and was doing his best to help in a department that clearly was not his and that was not his faultPart of our meetings included food. For me this is another area where the hotel fell short. In talking to my co workers many responded with What do you expect when a kitchen is mass producing food for over 500 people all at once. While I completely understand this I have been in the industry long enough to know there are things they could have done to improve. Our breakfast one morning consisted of cold meats bacon and sausage not traditionally served cold and runny scrambled eggs usually not over medium. That being said it is important to note that the banquet staff was busting their butts the entire week and deserve the highest praises. Next is the gym and pool. The Gym is just ok. 3 treadmills 2 elipticals and a bike. There are also 2 leg machines and a total gym type machine used for upper body. Finally 2 benches with dumb bells. For a free gym it works. Most hotels do not have any weight machines so I was happy to see the total gym type machine for my upper body workouts. I also really liked the pool. I usually went around 10p and there was no one there I could swim laps. it is not the biggest pool but big enough that I could swim back and forth for a while. Finally the physical appearance of the overall hotel. I do not think a single E was working in the Hotel of the 3 building signs that say Renaissance Hotel. Seems like something you would want to get fixed right away. The outside of the building just looks dirty as well. Overall the service is pretty good and almost on par with what you would expect for a Renaissance but the quality of the product is not there. I think I would have less heartburn about it if this was just a Full Service Mariot instead. If you are going to Portsmouth this is definitely the hotel to stay at as there is not much else around it but just know this is not going to be your typical Renaissance.", "offset": [4747, 4889], "date": "2016-04-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "45009e7d-45bf-4e91-8603-322e7795b7f4", "sentence": "Pleasant Stay.

I called to request an early check in for the two rooms that we booked months in advance and was assured that that would not be an issue. Upon showing up our rooms were not available as requested and we ended up waiting about 30 minutes for one room and close to an hour for the 2nd room while we had a hungry newborn that needed to be fed. Subsequently we called the front desk to request a couple of complementary bottles of water which I thought was a standard request for a gold elite member. The front desk receptionist proceeded to tell me that that was not possible and that I would have to pay for a bottle of water. It was not until I asked to speak to the manager that I was able to get the requested water. If that was not enough of a headache we attended a rehearsal dinner hosted at the hotel and catered by the hotel and the chef was given specific instructions on how to cook my dinner because of nursing a baby with allergy restrictions. Specific instructions were given to not cook my food in anything but sugar and salt and rice was to only be boiled in water. Upon receiving my dinner and after a couple of bites I noticed that the rice seemed too rich so I double checked with the chef to make sure the rice was only cooked in water unfortunately the chef took it upon himself to cook it in a dairy substitute which was detrimental and caused a thankfully mild allergic reaction from my newborn since I did not ingest a lot of the food. Lastly after we left the hotel I reviewed our folio and realized that the charges were potentially incorrect and confusing. I was put on hold for over 30 minutes when I called the front desk and finally had to hang up and call again. I was once again put on hold for an extended period of time. I finally asked to talk to the general manager Toni Pento who was pleasant enough at first and assured me that he would look into the charges and call me back. I did not get a call back from anyone until the next day and it was not Mr Pento but the front desk manager. She proceeded to explain the charges to me and I immediately told her that I only wanted to discuss matters with Mr Pento as I \u2019d already been very clear about my grievances and desire to only communicate with him. I asked her to relay the message to Mr Pento to give me a call. However I never received a call back from Mr Pento even after leaving numerous voice messages and calling a substantial amount of times. After a couple of days I decided to call again and spoke to the marketing manager who referred me to the accounting department \u2013. both were very prompt in assisting me. I \u2019d like to make it very clear that my issue is not with the bill or the charges to my account it is the subpar level of service that my family and I received during our stay and afterwards \u2013 especially from Mr Toni Pento who as a general manager should represent his hotel with courtesy and service and lead by example. That was something clearly missing from my interactions with Mr Pento. At best he was rude and impatient. Needless to say I do n\u2019t ever plan on staying at this particular hotel again and would like to emphasize my disappointment as a Mariot rewards member.", "offset": [1641, 1764], "date": "2017-10-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "7976b6a6-6aae-49de-bac5-a3cbdeb0ca36", "sentence": "I was there for a work conference. it is a beautiful hotel. it is right on the water not a great view but not terrible.

The thing that jumps out for me with this hotel is the great customer service from the front desk. I made a mistake on some reservations and they helped me out and helped me avoid a cancellation fee.

Nice clean lobby area with free newspapers desktop computers with printers and even apples at the front desk. Scenic views from the rooms of the river and ships. I would guess this is the best place to stay in Portsmouth. Internet wifi is free. Gym is adequate. Indoor pool is the typical undersized tub. I got a discounted rate of 94 night for my room because I was there for a scheduled event otherwise the rate would have been about 115. A downer is that most of the rooms I have stayed here four times seem to have interior connecting doors between the rooms which increases the noise from neighboring rooms. Avoid the bar. The service is terrible they often run out of items drink prices are high and bartenders seem unable to prepare proper high end cocktails such as martinis. There are better watering holes with 3 miles and the downtown location and neighborhood is safe. I have a separate rating for the on site restaurant. The highlight of the restaurant is the breakfast buffet. It is good but overpriced at about 140. Also you used to be able to include the buffet in your room cost at a discontinued price but this package seems to no longer be available. Another source of irritation is the forced valet parking for hotel guests.
