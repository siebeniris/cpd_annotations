This is one of the 2 hotels in Bangkok that I will come back to. I chose it for its location and the convenience of having a huge shopping mall just downstairs. there is even a Skywalk that links the mall to the BTS thus umbrellas are not needed rain or shine. Check in process is rather smooth and rooms are allocated rather quickly. Receptionists are always friendly though a few of them do not really know how to converse fluently in English but still they are willing to help. Rooms are nicely furnished and kept clean. The housekeeping comes pretty early in morning and ensures water supply is replenished and room made up. Breakfast spread is good and the food is yummy. A good choices of food available local breakfast or even for the health conscious. Lots of vegetables available. The mall is huge thus one is not short of finding food to eat. In fact you will be spoilt for choice. I have tried the hotels restaurant and the local fare it serves are up to par. Good for room service or those supper nights. Do give the spa a try. I will be spotted there for every visit. it is a haven though prices wise maynot look as competitive as those spas outside but this one is worth every penny. Try to book in advance via the hotels website so that you can get some discounts on the treatments. I will definitely go back again if I am back in Bangkok. Keep up the good work.", "offset": [276, 375], "date": "2015-01-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "4a16bc71-f815-41a3-8b36-e0aa717b733c", "sentence": "Great rooms and hotel location. We managed to get a really good deal on this hotel as it would usually be out of our price range. The room was fantastic check in was quite slow but they did end up upgrading our room as they did not have joining rooms that we had requested. We had also asked for a twin and first they said they did not have one but then they agreed to upgrade. I would have expected them to upgrade you to an available twin as it is obviously not ideal to share a bed with someone you do not want toThe location is great around a 8 min walk to Siam 15 mins to MBK. The hotel itself is located in Central world mall which has tonnes of shops and restaurants and a cinema no food court thoughThe room we stayed in had a twin bed desk sofa ensuite with shower and separate bath. And for some reason a see through window to the room from the bathroom who would want this staying in a twin. Thankfully you could pull a curtain across. The welcome drink was a nice touch but unlike most hotels I have stayed in they only offered soft drinks which is a shame. I am sure people paying full price would have liked the option of a cocktail. The pool temperature was lovely not too cold and there was always numerous sun loungers around the pool. I do not know why they make you sign for a pool towel as you just leave these behind at the end of the day on your lounger and I do not know anyone who would want to steal a gigantic red towel. Who knows though. I did not use the gym but it looked nice with good views from the treadmills. Another small issue was the nearest ladies toilet to the pool takes you past the gym fitness room and reception for the spa. I felt quite self conscious in my bikini so bring a sarong. Overall this hotel was a touch of luxury and I would recommend it.", "offset": [582, 792], "date": "2015-03-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "23755582-b03b-410d-afb2-94e64495c791", "sentence": "Too big and impersonal.

To gain access to this hotel from BTS Chitlom is a long walk and only suited to marathon walkers certainly not user friendly for older folk with luggage. Even once inside Central World not enough signage for the hotel and the circuitous route around the shopping mall is horrendous.

From check in to check out staying at the Centara Grand Central World was an absolute pleasure. Greeted by the friendly and seamless through the check in processes we were in our room with in minutes. The room was quite spacious and well appointed. Large sized flat screen tv which had all the channels you needed including the popular sports channels. As is twas our wedding we were also greeted with chocolates and champagne. An extremely nice touch. The hotel has a lovely outdoor swimming pool with bar and the gym area is quite big. Also in the mens and womens change rooms where large steam rooms all complimentary to use. Room service was also great. The food was definitely up to restaurant quality and some of the best food we ate in Bangkok. The hotel is located above probably the best shopping mall in Thailand and it is filled with many restaurants too and is only a 10 minute walk to Pratimun Shopping Mall. You will get all of your shopping done close by.

Booked this hotel after staying in the grand centre point ratchmadari just across the road on the way back from phuket last year. Thought would get the convenience of being on top of the mall and views all around.

I liked the acesz through the convention centre to the supermarket at CentralWorld altho this closes from 10 pm to 10 am. The Red Sky is an excellent location right at the rooftop from where you can take in the breath taking sights of the city at night. It can be quite magical as if you are enclosed in a glass cage of sortsthe room itself is nothing to really shout about. Pretty much the same with the usuzl amenities. In this respect I would have chosen a hotel nearer the Siam or Chit Lom BTS stations. I have stayed at hotels sited near both and honestly they were cheaper and none the worse with breakfast. The lobby is on the 23rd floor and the welcome drink was a nice touch as we sat at the lobby bar for coffee and cookies. But the lifts going up to the room are amazingly awful in the peak periods. We waited at least 5 min and for 3 lifts to clear. If they have a full house do expect delays. Location wise it depends what you are there for. If you are there for business it is probably great. Whilst CentralWorld mall had plenty of shopoing and eateries I found the walking to either station rather tiresome becos I would be doing that up to 3x a day. It gets tiring when you have been out walking the whole day. Even for someone like me who can walk for hours. But if you wanted to go shopping at Platinum or Pratunam then this hotel is quite ideal less than 10 min walk away.", "offset": [8, 102], "date": "2015-07-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "50bc092d-a7d2-48ed-ac2a-fbf9b77dbca9", "sentence": "Modern large and practical room. I stayed at the hotel for 1 night in July 2015. We decided to stay at this hotel to get a hotel that was located in the Siam area in Bangkok and we wanted direct access to a mall. The lobby area is on the 23rd floor if I \u2019m not mistaken and check in was fast. We got a room on the 25th floor but note that the hotel has about 55 floors. The disadvantage of having a hotel with a lobby like this was that we always had to take a lift to the lobby level and then switch to another lift to get to the room level. Not very convenient when you want to get to your room fast. The room we got was 2512 and the room was larger than expected. The room was modern and tastefully furnished with purple carpet on the floor dark purple walls and also areas with light wood. As you can see on the photos the bed was placed against a wall where there was a window towards the wardrobe area. In front of the bed there was a desk and chair there was a small fridge the flat screen TV was folded into the wall and could be brought out if you wanted to watch it in bed \u2013 pretty good setup in my opinion. There was also room for a lounge area with two small sofas and a table and the view from the window was not bad at all as it gave a view to some of Bangkok \u2019s skyline. The wardrobe area had lots of room a desk to put stuff room for the suitecase a wardrobe with hangers and a safe and also a kettle for boiling water. The entrance to the bathroom was through two doors with frosted glass and the first thing you see upon entering is the bathtub. Behind the bathtub there was a separate room for the toilet to the left and a separate shower to the right. There was also two sinks in the bathroom \u2013 excellent and functional setup. The only problem that we had was that water leaked out of the shower and ran towards the toilet \u2013 not a big problem but it is annoying to step into a puddle of water. There were amenities that were good \u2013 shower gel shampoo etc but also tooth brush vanity kit sewing kit etc. We did not have breakfast included in the room rate this time \u2013 you can buy breakfast at a caf\u00e9 at the ground level or you can just walk into CentralWorld shopping mall and buy food there. Just note that the shopping mall opens at 10 am. At the top of the hotel you will find Red Sky bar with a great view \u2013 the prices are of course high as you are paying not for just the drink but the view. There is a spa pool tennis courts and gym on the 26th floor. As there is some construction going on at the moment we got a 40 discount on massage and we enjoyed that. The location of the hotel is good \u2013 you get more or less direct access to the CentralWorld shopping mall and you can walk to Siam skytrain station. Note that the traffic can be pretty bad in this area so when leaving for the airport it took us like 1 hour just to get to the highway. So it might be an idea to take the skytrain airport express link instead of a taxi. All in all this is a very nice hotel indeed. We got a modern large and practical room and we enjoyed the location and the facilities. I would not mind staying there again and I would not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends.", "offset": [2212, 2260], "date": "2015-07-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "c679ea98-662a-47b2-9c12-4959556bda1e", "sentence": "Exceptional.

We stayed 5 nights and really enjoyed ourselves for our first visit to Bangkok. The breakfasts had a good variety and the staff were really helpful organising gluten free bread one day and remembering this for the rest of our stay bringing it out without asking each day after that. We did not eat there for lunch or dinner dinner was priced quite expensively and the adjoining Central World mall had lots of variety of restaurants to choose from. We avoided the Japanese ones as they seemed really high priced but the Thai ones were not. Check out the Sweet makers on the 7th floor they were amazing to watch crafting a butterfly shape into a hardened sweet. We enjoyed time at the pool both in the morning as our kids are early risers and the shops do not open until 10 AM and in the afternoon to cool off. The rooms were on the small side but this was not a problem as it was really just a base to sleep and we spent most of our time out and about. Our room was on the 40th floor and had a great view but you could also go up to the Red Sky restaurant for happy hour and catch either a sunset or electrical storm. The staff were friendly and helpful and organised a late checkout for us as we did not fly until late. We found a great wholesale mall by accident which was priced really well just over the bridge called Platinum Mall you have to wander through quite a few shops selling rubbishy stuff but we found some awesome kids T shirts of good quality that we have not seen anywhere else. You could ask for discounts for multiple items but it was not really battering like the markets. The Siam Paragon mall is also really close a couple of minutes walk away we went to the SeaWorld which is worth a visit also if your kids are between 5 10 there is a place called KidZania where the kids can go mad earning money in jobs experiencing what it is like to be a Vet Pilot Fireman etc. then spend it on things like making Cocacola or climbing the outside of a building. do not worry there is a parents room for a reprise and bit of sanity for adults.", "offset": [331, 495], "date": "2015-10-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "d5e2e2c7-e497-40bc-81b0-3e84cdf1dfe3", "sentence": "Convenient and catering to most needs.

Very friendly staff and helpful. Concierge made restaurant bookings for us too. Big spacious room. Big bathroom. Great city views. Only complaint with the room was the bed. Have to say the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in. So incredibly hard. Was like there was no mattress at all. Location is excellent. The Sky Train is close by and the Sky Walks too. Definitely want to walk along the Sky Walks rather than the footpath when you can. Covered and away from traffic fumes. You can walk directly into the Central World Mall from the hotel. The mall is ginormous. It is Two floors of just restaurants so great when it is really hot out or raining. It is so big that even staying here for 6 days we still walked past new stores every day. Easy walk from the hotel to the other major malls too. Pool I chose this hotel for three reasons. it is location and star rating but more importantly it is pool. We wanted to be able to lie in the sun by a pool. There are many beautiful looking pools when you look at Bangkok hotels online. But when you look at the tourist taken photos you will note that most of their shots are in shade. that is because many hotels have other tall buildings all around them. Not so for the Centara Grand at Central World. There are NO tall buildings directly beside the hotel. Nothing to create shade on the pool area. There are umbrellas and trees polside if you want shade but plenty in the sun if you want it. Pool temperature is cool though. Definitely refreshing but a little too cool if you wanted to hang out in it. Hotel breakfast pretty good. Yummy pastries etc. Omelette station made to order. Coffee would have to be the best non espresso Coffee we have ever had in a hotel from anywhere we have been in the world. We were very surprised as we usually immediately order machine espresso type coffees because the brewed Coffee is so bad. Not here. They serve it in two portion sized Coffee pots. The gym is well equipped. We used it every day before breakfast. Had to work off the cocktails and food from the night before. Spa we had massages which were very good. Quite a large variety of massage types to choose from. Would definitely stay here again but I will be asking whether they have rooms with softer beds first.
