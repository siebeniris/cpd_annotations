Shops Restaurants Waterpark Aquarium and restaurants bars galore. We stayed only for one night passing through Dubai to Cape Town. Not the most straightforward to get to taking public transport from the Airport. Metro to the Tram followed by a walk through a multistory car park. to the monorail over to the Palm. The journaey from end to end probably takes around 90mins. The area around the hotel seems to be very busy as tourists visit the the island to get a look at the hotel Once you have worked your way through the hoardes of tourists and into the hotel itself you reach the grand reception area. Because of its size and number of rooms there was a 15 20 min wait to get checked in. Had an amazingly large room stunning views over the private beaches and pools and out over the palm to the Jumeriah Beach area. Fresh fruit on offer in the rooms and a huge comfortable bed along with a small seating area. Lack of free wi fi was slightly disappointing particularly at the cost of a room. D\u00e9cor is very luxurious and the private pool and beach areas are very well set out. When you are there the bars and restaurants are very expensive compared with some of the places in downtown Dubai but I suppose that is the nature of staying in a 5 star hotel. Definitely worth experiencing the luxuries of the Atlantis at least for a night. Just watch as well with the monorail. the last train over to the Island is at 945pm after that its taxi only.", "offset": [1181, 1357], "date": "2015-04-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e7f85f02-6f12-4c7a-a463-b29e8f84d747", "sentence": "5 Star.

Check in staff are miserable. Rooms are spacious. Cleaned every day and plenty of water provided unlimited toiletries. You get free unlimited entry into Aqua Centre and the water park. that is all you get free here and expect to pay more than triple what you had pay in the uk for almost everything. Ice cream aprox \u00a3 5 for a magnum or corneto. \u00a3 4 for a packet of crisps. \u00a3 8 to rent a locker in the water park whether you are a guest at hotel or not. Builds up if you are visiting the water park daily. Breakfast kaleidoscope restaurant or saffron costs 155 aed. Which is aprox. \u00a3 33 per person and it is buffet style so lots of choice but it is like a cattle market very much like a Butlins or Pontins experience. Brits everywhere filling their plates to get their money worth for an expensive breakfast that is neither fresh nor particularly tasty. The noise is unbearable and there is no such thing as a relaxing breakfast in this hotel. Dinner is the same in both restaurants although cost 250 aed per person \u00a3 52. and that is without drinks. the cheapest bottle of wine was Jacobs creek \u00a3 4 in my local corner shop 280 aed at the restaurant that is a shocking \u00a3 58. Again so noisy and no chance of a romantic evening at all. There are more restaurants and a few smaller fast food places. We ate at the burger place \u00a3 45 for a burger meal. The Asian restaurant op the burger place was a bit more reasonable but still expensive. My partner and I decided to eat out after one evening experience at the hotel. We went to the nearest mall by shuttle bus outside the hotel we ate 2 courses with drinks bought a few things and had a taxi back and still paid less than we had the night we stayed in the hotel. it is Ramadan at the moment this did not really affect our stay as we felt we needed to respect the staff and locals so we covered shoulders and knees etc as requested by the hotel however lots of Brits walk around half dressed and this did not seem an issue. All in all this is nowhere near a 5 star hotel. It looks grand in the public areas and it is clean but it is a noisy full hotel that is well over priced. Not for couples ok for families with the waterpark and ok if you are happy to eat in overpriced crowded noisy restaurants. \u00dcber is a great way to get around and cheaper than most taxis.

I just spent 7 days in the Atlantis hotel The Palm. On arrival we were checked in and were given our room key. That evening we went for our meal after which we had a walk round the hotel. Then we decided to have a drink in one of the bars in the hotel. On a previous stay at the Atlantis we always changed the bill to the room but this time they told as that we had no credit. We could n\u2019t understand this because it was only the first night there. So the following morning we went to the reception desk and asked why we could n\u2019t charge the drinks to the room. They told us that our credit card was not swiped at check in. This is a fundamental error which caused us a problem at the start of our holiday. This took a day and half after complaining twice to the desk. We have always checked our bill each evening on the tv services this was never a problem during our last stay here. We went into the tv service to check our bill after billing drinks to the room but there was no entry on the tv so we went to the reception and told them that the tv billing was not working. Ok they said they would sort it out. Next evening same again booked all drinks to the room but nothing on the tv billing so we went to the deck and asked to see a manager she told us that they would sort it out. This took 3 attempts to try and sort this problem out which was quite a simple problem that IT could have sorted. Finally my wife got on the phone and spoke to reception again they then sent someone to the room and sorted the problem out. Unfortunately the manager that we spoke to did nothing to solve the problem nor did the person we spoke to on the second occasion. This has not been a pleasant stay for us at the Atlantis and I feel that standards are slipping.

The hotel complex definitely has the Wow factor. The floors walls ceiling admirable. Pretty flowers everywhere. People guarding cleaning helpful and respectful.

Three of us loved the aqua park and had a lot of fun there. Unfortunately I could not say the same nice words about the restaurants and especially the staff working in some of them. At first glance looks like you have a big choice of places to eat drink and just be merry but actually it \u2019s not like that.

It turned out that the difference in what you receive it \u2019s not much. Because we were two one two of us upgraded one not so I had opportunity to compare. Both rooms were nice with upgrade on higher floor and with more expensive finish. The upgrade are giving you option to visit two more cafes restaurant and private beach which was n\u2019t so private and exclusive. But like I said the worst part was the some members of the staff in \u201c kaleidoscope \u201d and \u201c nasimi beach \u201d rude incompetent bad trained. They were struggling with the fact that our company are in two different rooms and we had some preferences where we had to sit.

Just returned from an 8 night trip to Dubai. We stayed at the Atlantis for 4 nights and this time we booked the Imperial Club Lounge. I always write an honest detailed review from wherever we have stayed as I want it to help others decide as I would want to know the good bad the ugly here goesThe Good on arrival at the airport we picked up a complimentary lift to the hotel which was in a lovely car. We arrived at the hotel it always looks stunning grand beautiful. The staff are all very friendly whether it be cleaners managers or even gardeners everyone works very hard to try and look after everyone staying at the hotel. Everywhere is immaculate. There are cleaners everywhere so no excuse for anything to be dirty. Even the gardens are immaculate. Our room was a refurbished room was very nice again very clean. Bit disappointed we were overlooking the front of the hotel again but we only get ready sleep in there so did n\u2019t want to ask to be moved. The Aquarium is stunning this was a real highlight seeing the wonderful fish every morning at breakfast as we always had a certain table overlooking the aquarium. Food in Kaleidoscope by the aquarium for breakfast was good there was every kind of breakfast going nothing every ran out although it really niggled me that every time we ordered a coffee they turned up with it we always had to ask for a spoon. Surely it \u2019s common practise to send a spoon. When we came here 2 years ago it was the same then I know it \u2019s picky but it \u2019s anoyingThe Bad Sunbeds around the Royal pool are crammed in like sardines I know it \u2019s a large hotel has to cater for the amount staying but it \u2019s very cramped we ended up sitting round the Zero Entry pool where there is space it \u2019s also a better pool you get the sun all day. Although ca n\u2019t be helped we had a room facing the sea we had diggers going 247 as they are putting in massive boulders. although it \u2019s not the hotels fault I feel they should have let us know on arrival. We did n\u2019t sleep very well as the noise was extremely loud at night. Dress code seems to have majorly gone down hill since we last went this is included in the Imperial Club Lounge. There were people going in the lounge at night after being in the pool in swimwear for happy hour still dressed in swimwear staff turn a blind eye to this which when we said to them about it they do n\u2019t semTo understand EnglishEating in the evening we ate in the buffet on the first night which was nice and lots of choice. Two nights we ate in Bread Street kitchen 1 night at Seafire steak house. We are disappointed that there is hardly any restaurants where you do n\u2019t have to pay a surcharge to eat in. We had a drink each night with a meal ended up with a \u00a3 70 bill to me I think this is disgusting especially after paying for half board. The Ugly The Imperial Club lounge is a complete joke by joke I mean it \u2019s like Benidorm. I was embarrassed to be English the reason we come to Dubai is to escape the English but they have found Dubai. Food time was like they have never eaten we went in for a cold drink at 220pm one afternoon to escape the heat for 10 minutes we went to the Lounge in the west tower went in and it was rammed with English 228pm the food started to come out and it was like watching people at a wedding trying to get all the food people were piling their plates full of sandwiches some families had what looked like banquets on the tables there was so much food they should have been ashamed of themselves. Even the bowl of clotted cream had gone within 5 minutes. The kitchen staff could n\u2019t bring the food out quick enough. We ended up walking out as we could n\u2019t bare watching the animals in the zoPo in the pool. This is a regular daily occurrence in the Royal pool I find this absolutely disgusting. Everyday everyone got evacuated from the pool as someone had a po it basically is people that do n\u2019t think it \u2019s right for babies to wear swim nappies. The lifeguards have lots and give out for free when talking to a lifeguard they said they ca n\u2019t force them to put them on their children. In my opinion if they do n\u2019t put them on then they should n\u2019t be allowed in the pool simple. We watched in horror as they cleaned the po out and walked it past where we were seated with it all dripping from the net all over the floor I \u2019m amazed they did n\u2019t put it in a bucket or somethingWil we return. I somewhat doubt it our second part of our stay was at the Mina a\u2019Salam all I can say is wow completely different had a different type of clientele more what I want from a stay in Dubai.", "offset": [1148, 1392], "date": "2018-09-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "d827371f-4e1c-44d2-8be7-57f43f96d3a6", "sentence": "It \u2019s good but does n\u2019t live up to the hype. Decided to treat ourselves to a Terrace Club Room thinking there would be plenty of perks to go with it. I would love to give this hotel very good but given the price we paid what we received was average. Check in at the Royal Majilis we had to wait about 5 minutes but at least we could comfortably sit and wait with a glass of juice. The main check in area seems chaotic around check in time and queues are long. Our room was n\u2019t ready so we grabbed a water park wrist band to go check that out. You would think due to the amount we paid for the room they could give lockers for free but we had to pay 50 dirham for a small locker. Water park is hard to navigate with little signage and to be honest Yas Waterworld in Abu Dhabi is much better and was less busy. We are snobby when it comes to water parks as we get spoilt when we are in Australia. Not that this is the staff \u2019s fault but found other guests quite rude and often would push in which really was n\u2019t monitored made the experience less enjoyable. We headed back to the room around 4 pm it was very extravagant and large. Thoroughly enjoyed the lovely jet bath. The balcony had a great view over Dubai and Atlantis. The room is a great size but in hindsight a bit too big for one night for a couple. If you were a family or staying longer it would be amazing. We had to ask twice to get our luggage sent up to the room. The bathroom amenities were fantastic. The Imperial Lounge evening drinks was average drinks range was great but not the best canap\u00e9s as compared to what you get in other hotel chain lounges. We expected more I think given how renown this hotel is. There is quite a few restaurant choices obviously with the prices you would expect. We opted for Bread Street Kitchen and it was reasonable. Breakfast in the Imperial Club buffet was small for the crowd they cater to. Very busy even at 1030am. Staff were busy and service was average. Pool areas are clean and we were able to get sun beds easily. The beach area for the private beach let us down as we had to hunt down the service staff to get a drink. No one around to help with towels not so private as everyone seem to come and swim in that section anyway. The aquarium The Lost Chambers is great and highly recommend walking through it.

We are a family of 3. me my wife and our 8 years old daughter. We chose Atlantis because of her as she loves pools and water parks. We stayed on the 11th floor east tower. We had fantastic panoramic view of the ocean from the room. We booked the club room so breakfast 24 hour snacks drinks water park were complimentary. We spent most of the daytime in the water park with our daughter as there were so many rides. There were some family rides also and because it was a peak season with soothing weather in Dubai we had to queue for the rides. There were two towers Neptune probably and Poseidon the first tower had individual rides and the second tower had group rides. Also there were lazy river rapids and any other attractions in the water park. In addition they have aquarium kids club several pools dolphin bay you have to pay separately and they do n\u2019t allow children alone so you have to also buy expensive ticket for you whether you want it or not. You can easily spent 34 days in this resort and do n\u2019t bother what \u2019s going on outside they will keep you captivated. The breakfast spread is huge they serve breakfasts in multiple restaurants but the one in the west tower probably have the largest spread and largest queue. They provide complimentary pick and drop from airport for the club room guests which is a big plus. The staffs are courteous in general but probably pay more attention to the light coloured guests than the brown coloured one but that \u2019s a general observation about Dubai not only for Atlantis.

What a brilliant place this is with so much to do. The water park is fantastic and there are so many rides with ones you want to go on multiple times. Guests get a good advantage so definitely book a room here if you plan to go. I was a bit skeptical that this was a family hotel but it is just as good for couples. The waterpark is lots of fun even if you do n\u2019t have kids and the buffet breakfast is glorious. I would recommend the club lounge if the price is reasonable it really makes the stay so much better with amazing room views access to drinks and canapes. It is true lu something special and the aquarium is so peaceful and I could spend all day at the place. The staff are Ok but not as helpful or friendly as other Palm hotels I have stayed at but this does n\u2019t affect the overall experience.", "offset": [337, 432], "date": "2020-04-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}]}
