The second day I had another waiter that asked if I had a coupon for the breakfast. My husband said we did and all of the sudden the waiter played the disappearing act. We did not get our coffee for a long time and I had to ask another server for it and cream. He was not even around for a refill. I suppose that he thought he would not get a tip because we did not pay for the breakfast. When he gave us the receipt and indicated to put our room number down he was very clear on where we would put how much we wanted to tip him. For a waiter that did not help at all he was undeserving of a tip however my husband did insist on leaving him a couple of bucks.
