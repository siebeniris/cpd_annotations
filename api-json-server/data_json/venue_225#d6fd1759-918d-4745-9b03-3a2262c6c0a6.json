We attended our event which ended early and arrived back at 10 pm to relax and have a drink at the bar oh no bar closed restaurant closed room service advertised as 24hr except for now we were told the second shift of chef starts at 11 pm so no room service.

That makes everything better though I must say that the cookie I was given at the DoubleTree Toronto was better. Maybe I was hungrier. The room was booked for me so I do not know what we paid. I hope it was not much. While the room was clean it was small and pretty basic. Half the window was blocked off as it was facing another building and the half there was still in situ overlooked that building. The bathroom was also pretty basic.
