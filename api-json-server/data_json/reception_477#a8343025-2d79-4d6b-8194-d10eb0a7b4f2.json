The Bad things Our room did not have Wi Fi we had to go to the lobby to check our emails and get on line. We got charged twice for drinks at the lounge after my boyfriend paid for the drinks with credit card they also asked for our room number we did not think anything of it because we paid with the card but when check out time came we noticed they also charged the drinks to the room. They charged us for long distance calls when we made local calls they told us because we dialed the country code area code that it registered it as a long distance call. The first night we ate at one of the restaurants in the hotel and aside from being very expensive we noticed that they automatically charge to the account a service charge aka gratuity charge of 15 to the bill but in addition they also added a line with the word tip. so they got double the tip for a not so great service. We read in a pamphlet the next day that service charge is another word for gratuity so after that we stopped tipping as everyone automatically gets a 15 tip. Front desk staff not friendly or very helpful. The Good Things Beautiful beach and crystal clean water very clean and well kept. Fun complimentary free activities like paddle boarding kayaking and snorkeling. Great pools and hot tub. House keeping and beach staff very nice helpful and friendly. Location is great walking distance to a lot of restaurants we did not do the all inclusive so we wondered out took the bus and rented a scooter to explored the island. Very safe area.

Went for a long weekend and chose the Melia for its all inclusive option. Although the hotel is clearly in the process of being updated we were not disappointed. Upon arriving we chose to upgrade to the LEVEL and it was well worth it. The people working there were willing to help you whenever it was needed and were incredibly friendly. The service from those who worked at level was much better then that of others around the resort. Ashjuan was GREAT. He made sure that we had everything we needed and was always in a good mood. Hotels could use more employees like him. The all inclusive was worth the money too. If you plan on eating at the hotel without it you will be spending a lot of money on food alone not to mention drinks. Despite some minor improvements that need to be made I think that once the construction is done the hotel will be even better then it is.

I will start with the positives. The hotel lobby was beautiful the hotel staff was friendly and the level staff also did a great job at making you feel welcome and relaxed. The beach and pool are were great though the waiter service was lacking. they definitely need more staff to effectively cover the guests. The food was great and much better than I expectedNow what was disappointing was our room. The door key reader was broken and every day the keys would stop working for no reason. Now that might not seem like a big deal but when you have an ocean view room you walk as far away as possible from the elevator and to get to your room and realize your key does not work every day sometimes 3 4 times a day gets very frustrating. We of course complained to the staff and at first they tried to blame us saying we were demagnetizing the cards but even they experienced it when we forced them to walk with us and have them see that the keys were not demagnetizing but the door was defective. In addition to that the slider door leaked after a rain storm and our rug was soaked and everything that was on the floor was also soaked like my 350 leather purse and winter coat. The room then smelled very moldy for the remainder of the trip. Lastly after the rain storm our ceiling leaked and dripped for a few hours and was left with plaster hanging down. We also had small ants around the slider which is pretty gross since we were on the 8th floor. You have a lot of other choices when selecting hotels for Bahamas. We wanted to avoid droves of kids so we opted to not go with any of the Atlantis properties however we did speak with a number of tourists who stayed there and said they did not encounter to many kids so next time that is where we are going to stay. The biggest disappointment was that when I voiced my complaints to the staff both in person and via email no one felt compelled to even apologize. I spoke to and emailed the director of guest relations and he just did not respond. I did hear they are investing money in the property so who knows maybe it will get better down the road but until then I would say do nt take the chance and stay here.", "offset": [268, 332], "date": "2015-04-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "e9153a3e-fadc-42ea-b26d-3342418673ab", "sentence": "First time visitors loved it. My fianc\u00e9 and I stayed at The Melia in April for a short trip babymon and to check it out as we are getting married here in November. We chose the All Inclusive plan. We had an ocean view room which was so pretty. We were a little skeptical with the reviews but quickly found out that they are not all true. I truly feel that you get back what you give out and after staying here I m quite surprised at some of the bad reviews this hotel received. Although the hotel is slightly dated small things like concrete on pool areas and ground outside are chipped they are clearly working on improvements and with how nice the decor is inside and gorgeous beach it was the least of our worries. That being said from our first interaction with the check in desk we started on a good note. The women who helped us forget her name was very pleasant and since my 6 month baby bump was showing she even took the tim to talk to us about her 4 children and joked with us a bit. She was informative and gave us info on the restaurant locations inside hotel etc. We did not have to wait in line however the line an hour later was a little long but with everyone showing up at once I would expect a back up so that to me is reasonable. Our room was also ready early we checked in at about 1 pm check in normally at 3 pm thanks to our wedding planner. Upon arriving to our room our keys did not work. It was frustrating since it was hot and I am pregnant and room was far walk from elevator BUT much to our surprise a housekeeper heard us mumbling from room next door came over and quickly helped us into our room saving us the trip back downstairs. Point being everyone we came into contact with at hotel was very pleasant. Please and thank you goes a long way I think some pl forget that sometimes. The beach was gorgeous. Water was almost seaweed less and sand was very soft. Small beach but surprisingly never packed even when hotel was almost at full capacity. We had a beach waitress named Carolyn she was awesome. Although tipping is not required we did pack 1s and left them when we needed at bar rests etc which i felt they appreciated. We ate at Nikei first night and wow what an experience. I ve been to my fair share of Hibachi but Giovani Jaye and Roland certainly made the whole experience amazing they are a true gift to your hotel and should be recognized for that. Aqua was the next night the tall maitre d was super nice and funny forget his name sorry and although our waiter was a little grumpy the food was outstanding this is where we are having our welcome dinner when we get married here so we were excited that the food was so good plus the decor and atmosphere was candle lit romantic and upscale. Our one and ONLY disappointment with the food was Cilantro it was mediocre at best quite honestly. Breakfast buffet at Marketplace was awesome we went early everyday by early i mean we were there by 9 930 the latest and we never had to wait more than a minute to be sat. The later you go the longer then line. Sidenote. I also had a grilled chicken sandwich at the outside pool area while sitting on the beach not sure if it was because i was so hungry but it was one of the best chicken sandwiches ever. I inhaled it. If you are hungry on the beach get it. Our wedding planner Liset G met us during our stay and she is wonderful so sweet and so accommodating. She showed us around the hotel premises and we got to view where we will have our ceremony and reception etc. We are very happy we chose this place and her and Ashley E have been outstanding with all the planning details. If you plan on having a destination wedding consider Melia. We are happy we stayed here and looking forward to coming back in Nov with what will be our 3 month old baby family and friends to get married here.

I will try to be as to the point as possible. We just returned from the Melia Nassau Beach family vacation. We had booked our vacation through Expedia and paid to stay at the new and amazingly rated BAHA MAR. A week before our scheduled departure I went onto reviews to look into activities we may want to do while in Nassau only to find that my brand new 5 star hotel was now showing a two star rating. Expedia and other travel companies are booking this hotel despite the fact that it is not nearly complete and ready for occupancy latest estimate. December or January. Seems Expedia was not letting people know until the last minute and changing their accommodations to the beautiful Melia and throwing in the all inclusive to sweeten the deal. Okay so we took it. At least we were fortunate enough to have found this out one week before we left many others found out a day or two prior. With that short notice we did not feel we had any alternative. I had seen the Melias website and it sells itself rather well. so when we were offered a premium oceanview room with all inclusive we figured why not seems like a nice enough place. Melia is in need of some serious renovation. Most of the concrete structures columns pool areas patio areas are in bad shape sharp piece of concrete stuck in my foot attempting to go out onto patio off our room to read. The carpeting leaves much to be desired. The beds are very hard on the back but may be fine for someone who prefers a mattress on a wooden platform scenario. Housekeeping never showed up on any day prior to 3 pm with the exception of the day we were checking out. After a day at the pool beach or activities we would get back to our room only to find that they were in the midst of cleaning it and we had to make ourselves scarce in order to allow them to finish before we could get in and shower change for dinner. Next the food. it is a good thing we did not actually PAY for the all inclusive because we would have been livid. We ate breakfast at the Marketplace buffet. every day it was probably the best meal of the day omelette station fruit oatmeal meats cheeses juices etc. That being said it was terrible to have to endure the flies swarming your plates every time you sat down to eat. The problem was alleviated slightly by requesting inside tables but the flies were still a problem. Several times we were seated inside next to the partition to the outside tables and we had to either brush dead flies off the sill next to us or just ignore them. Disgusting. Generally though the best food and selection was found at the Marketplace. We made our required reservations at their Nikei Japanese Cilantro Mexican and Aqua Italian on the first day for dinners during the week. Aqua was just okay but the best of the three. Nikei was just okay as well very limited menus. We actually walked out within minutes of receiving our dishes at Cilantro my husbands fish was actually spoiled bad and he had to spit it out in a napkin. When the manager saw us get up to leave he stopped my husband who promptly informed him of the issue and the response was I apologize I will make a note of it. We went to their tapas drinks bar to just get a light something and the sliders were good but imagine how you had feel if you received an order of chicken wings and one of them was obviously bitten into. Ugh. The Campus Cafe a stand set up by the pool makes decent burgers hot dogs and good grilled chicken sandwiches but in general we were so disappointed we went outside the resort and paid to eat at Compass Point resort as well as at the Atlantis restaurants. Only problem is that we had to PAY for that food and we had to pay an additional 25 to 40 EACH WAY for a taxi to the other resorts. We paid 40 to an unscrupulous private taxi guy who was hailed by a Melia doorman only to pay 25 on the way back to Melia in a new clean taxi van with air conditioning. Watch who you use even if the hotel staff motions you to them in front. We learned the hard way. It appears that the common areas that are mostly used check in area large bar and lounge area HAVE been renovated already. They are rather nice and always clean. The Starbucks on site is a plus. Many times due to the issues with the food we found ourselves laying out money for Starbucks coffees drinks and snacks. They were very good and the baristas are super nice quick and accommodating. Just note Their food snack offerings are not the same as Starbucks in the states lamb burgers guava pastries etc here but they are around the same cost as you had expect to pay here in the States. In general a pretty bad food experience though especially after feeling that the all inclusive would partially make up for the lesser resort accommodations in comparison to the sparkly new highly touted Baha Mar The beach is absolutely beautiful. The only thing we disliked were the vendors walking in front of you every day who were allowed to set up tents on the beach among you. Not a day went by in which we were not hawked to buy beach wraps jewelry and cigars even after saying no each and every day prior. That was a bit annoying but basically tolerable if you gave a firm NO a couple of times or made like you were sleeping. We also had the usual guys asking you to go parasailing fishing ride jet skis etc on top of the others. That was also in addition to a local guy trying to sell homemade bahama mamas and drinks in coconut shells guaranteed better than the beach bar. My daughter and I were a little shocked to see that there were native guys on the beach who were offering rub downs with lotion to women for money and yes there WERE some takers. Maybe our personal feelings but quite odd to see. Lastly the personnel. This is a tough one because roughly 50 of the employees were awesome. Super friendly polite accommodating. 25 seemed just there to do their job. The final 25 seemed resentful to have to answer questions or to help you. you had be hard pressed to find ANYONE who was readily able to get a drink at the swim up bar. it is positioned as the back of the bar and nobody behind the bar really pays attention to that area. One must be loud and insistent on ordering a drink from the swim up bar. If you are not you do not get any attention until you or someone else IS loud and insistent. A side comment about the bar. we are not big drinkers so it did not really matter too much to us but the drinks of course have only the slightest hint of alcohol unles you insist that they make it harder or a double which we heard several people do. On any given day the tap is not functioning at the 4th floor bar or the pool bar could not make frozen drinks because they temporarily had no electricity. A bit annoying as it seemed it was one thing after the next. The last night we were there my daughter did not feel well and we reluctantly tried simple fare from room service not included you have to pay for it. We were pleasantly surprised as the food was far better than anything we encountered in the all inclusive plan. Overall the only thing we absolutely loved about this resort was their beautiful stretch of white sand turquoise water beach Starbucks and basically half of the staff we encountered. All else.

Basically the hotel attendant said the package booked by Expedia was not all inclusive. The attendant and I spent over 3 hours on the phone with Expedias customer service in which Expedia confirmed it was all inclusive but the attendant insisted she needed a fax or email from them saying they would cover the cost. We ended up paying 819 extra. The attendant at the hotel was nice BUT she did not seem to want to help every time she spoke to a new customer service rep she would start by saying i spoke to someone and confirmed the package is NOT all inclusive. I had a printout that said it was all inclusive. I just felt like she was not trying to help us out the manager came by and did not seem interested in helping us much either. They did lower the fee but I still had to pay 819 more. so be careful with this type of things. I was able to get a refund from EXPEDIA after a good 7 hours trying to get this resolved. They blame the hotel go figure. Unnecessary stress. Back to the hotel it is pretty awesome and the staff is very polite helpful and friendly. I would go back.

Slept in until 930 am went to the mini fridge because they are supposed to be stocked to find a half eaten slice of cake a bag of chips and a granola bar. Kinda peeved but hey people forget right. Went to take a shower to find there were no washcloths in the bathroom. Called down and this time it was only an hour wait. no sarcasm I was really afraid it would have been longer. Stayed in the room until noon went to the outside restaurant beautiful view. Stood at the entrance because the sign instructed that I waited to be seated. There were about four women working and they simply enjoyed their conversation as if we did not exist. About three maybe four minutes later one of the ladies looked at me with a confused look. I asked if we should sit and she with a sort of duh stupid look on her face shook her head for yes. Went to the seat to find mold on one of pillows so I moved it over. I ordered the pizza and my fiance got the chicken wrap. His review Not the best but if you are hungry enough you can force it down. My review. No. No. No. The parts of the bottom that were not burnt were simply missing it was supposed to be margherita pizza and they diced the tomatoes after the pizza was I am convinced microwaved and threw them on top. Also the lemonade was literally the most disgusting thing. Even my fiance could not handle it and he will eat drink just about anything. We opted out of the all inclusive option so our bill was 35 there were two bites missing from the pizza one mine and one my fiances and the lemonade barely moved. Day 3. did not spend any time at the hotel so it was a great day filled with delicious food. When I got back to the room the mini fridge was still dirty so I chased the lady down and told her. she came apologized and removed the cake. Better than nothing but still no snack you know. Day 4 it is Christmas day. After opening gifts in the room we decided to give The Market Place buffet. a shot 56 tip because the waitress was kind. I tried to go in with no expectations because I generally hate buffets but I had some glimmer of hope because I literally yes quite literally almost started crying when I tried the pancakes which you will never convince me is not plastic. The bacon was okay. but after two plates of it I could not. The cranberry juice was the highlight of the show. Yes sure they probably only poured it into a container but whomever did that thank you.

We stayed at Melia Nassau for 7 Nights on April 23rd. We traveled in a group of 10. Ages ranged from a 2 year old to mid 20 \u2019s to early 30 \u2019s to mid 50 \u2019s mid 60 \u2019s. So we had a good age group to experience the facilities and services offered by Melia. This was my wife and I 2nd full stay in Nassau but our 4th visit in total as we have travelled with cruise ships to Nassau before. My wife and I travelled with our 2 year old and we booked the Level upgrade. We had to ask where the private check in was first though as no one came up to us and greeted you like they normally do at any other resort. They had a Level concierge walk us up to the Level Lounge where we sat and they checked us in. The concierge was Jonathan who helped us there. The check in process was pretty smooth. However we were NOT offered any fresh towels for freshening up or even cocktail drinks during our check in process in the level lounge we seen others receiving this service the next day when we came back to the level lounge to talk about dinner reservations. We were in Room 756 which had an amazing view of the property and the ocean. The rooms do need updating as I \u2019m sure everyone has stated. The mattress was not bad as I previously read people had back pain from their experience during our stay definitely not a pillow top but it was ok for the stay. You can tell the room \u2019s need work though as the roof had damage to it and the washroom needed tile work. We did have very cold A C and hot water which I know others complained about. Now regarding the Level upgrade would I recommend it NO. We travel a few times a year to different places land and sea. We usually upgrade our room categories and service butler or concierge any chance we have. The level service upgrade at Melia was pathetic. They give you a different bracelet color gold to wear during your stay. There are 3 a la carte restaurants which you need to make reservations for you have to get up early go down in the lobby stand in line and pray you get a reservation. With Level you are supposed to get the reservations made for you before the regular guests. You would think having a 2 year old they would take this into consideration and give you reasonable times for dinner instead of 9PM which is usually the time kids are in bed well no they do n\u2019t take that into consideration here at Melia a family resort. There is a premium restaurant Black Angus which is NOT included in your stay even with the Level upgrade. We definitely tried to talk to the level concierge Jonathan regarding the timing issue for our dinner reservations he always said he would take care of it but never got back to us. We both felt he is there just to smile to you and let you hear what you want but the message goes in one hear and goes out even quicker the other. He seems to care about your concerns but good luck you wo n\u2019t get any help from him. We spoke to other level concierges who actually helped for other minor things during our stay and they even whatsap us confirming the things requested has been fulfilled. Jonathan would never get back to you not ever. They give you an information paper with a bunch of \u201c advantages \u201d of being a level guest but they are basic things like a business centre complimentary Hors D\u2019oeuvres inside the lounge which is always the same small sandwiches and Danish and meeting area who uses this when you \u2019re on vacation. So really what benefits are these compared to booking a standard package when you can save hundreds even thousands of dollars depending on how many people you are upgrading for. Yes you do get beach concierge service which is always good on those hot days when you want the drinks coming to you. However with only 2 servers on the beach be prepared to wait 25 \u2013 45 minutes on those drinks. There was one perk which was n\u2019t listed on their level upgrade package information sheet room service was FREE. Usually with all the all inclusive resorts we have been to room service is always free. However only with Level service do you get room service for free. If do not have level service you would have to pay 10 USD EACH time you place an order. That means if you wanted room service every day after you came up from the beach or pool for 7 days you would be paying 70 USD plus any tip. There room service menu was definitely on the premium side which was great. The room service foods always came piping hot and fresh never had any problems with this part. For those of you with young children the \u201c Kids. Co \u201d club is only offered from ages 5 \u2013 12. So our 2 year old did not have any activities games or shows offered. Being a family resort you \u2019d think they would have some sort of kid \u2019s entertainment for all ages. We managed to try all the restaurants except for Black Angus. The Italian restaurant Aqua was good and we had an excellent server. Portions were good and if you wanted to customize a dish it was open. Market place buffet was nothing to rave about. They had very basic items which did not change much from lunch and dinner. There was not much of a variety though. There were a few good items but nothing which kept us coming back unles we really had to. Cilantro Mexican was the best out of all the restaurants we tried on the property. Our server was excellent and went beyond to make our meal enjoyable and relaxing. The Tapas restaurant Estavida was not true tapas sorry to disappoint those who have been to true tapas lounges and restaurants. They served potato wedges nachos hummus dip which they never had every night during our 7 night stay wings and burgers. This is definitely not tapas food it is pub food. However we always and I mean always had excellent servers every night we went to Estavida. Also they had exclusive drinks which you can only find when they are open in the evenings. They had a burger and hot dog hut opened for a few hours polside which was a nice to grab and go. The lady serving was nice and always worked hard even with the temperature weather. O\u2019grile was open during the day for lunch and for dinner reservations. The lunch menu is decent with steak and cheese pizza and so on. The dinner menu was average. I ordered the chimichuri steak. medium is how I like my steaks. When the server placed my meal down I asked him are you sure this is my steak. Are you sure this is medium. He said he guaranteed it. When I cut into the steak it was filled with blood. It was RARE. The plate was filled with blood. This server was a joke. It took him 20 minutes to come back and check on us to see if we were happen with the meal. Nothing was done regarding this we got up and walked out. Nikei Asian was a letdown. First they did n\u2019t seat us until 45 minutes after our reservation time. We have done hibachi and tepanyaki many times in the past. The chef was nice. However his food was very bland. Rice was under cooked as it was grainy. But beyond the food here was the most insulting thing they can do to their guests 12 people around the chef table. Everyone ordered dessert the only thing on the menu was vanilla ice cream so no other choices. We were waiting for about 20 minutes now for dessert. Then all of a sudden about 14 servers walked out from the back into our room through another room and began to pretty much have a party in the room next to us singing happy birthday and toasting to one of their co workers. They left all 12 of us we never did get our dessert and they chose to host a party in the next room. There was no one to talk to regarding this because they were all partying. Customer service needs to be heavily revised improved and the workers inside Nikei should be looking for another job with that attitude. We met one of the workers on our floor Dominic who is usually in charge of the sheets and so on during the day but a server at the restaurants during the evening. He is so helpful willing to go out of his way to get you anything you need and point you in the right direction. He definitely deserves recognition. Our vacations are not complete without us having fresh coconuts. Dominic made that happen for us and I can stress enough his excellent customer service. Baha mar actually owns the Melia resort. Baha Mar is the new multibilion dollar resort next door to melia not all inclusive and is outstanding in architecture d\u00e9cor service and more. They have a shuttle that picks you up for free and takes you over to their casino restaurants and more. We went for lunch one day to \u201c Stix \u201d which is Asian Chinese food. It was excellent. Items were very tasty. The property inside reminded me very much of the Venetian in Las Vegas. You could tour the resort but needed permission from the front desk in Baha Mar We did parasailing through the local vendor on the beach. They were great and took their time with us and made sure we were happy. Some others in our group did the jet skiing as well with the local vendor and had a blast too. We did a local tour not through the hotel as their prices were sky high to the fish fry and some scenic cultural buildings some of the people in our group have never been to the Bahamas. Fish fry is always good just make sure to get your free Bahama mama \u2019s when you dine in. Also if you do like to try the local alcoholic drinks definitely try the sky juice. We have had it before and it is always a hit. We did Atlantis as well which was great. We have done it before so we knew what we wanted to see again. There were some in our group who never been. The water park is excellent especially their rapid river with the tubes and water slides too. The aquarium is great too. We did NOT go through the hotel for this too. They wanted too much for this tour and we decided to use a local taxi and get a good deal through him for the Atlantis Water Park slides beach and aquarium access. There are 2 family pools and 1 adult only pool. They did not have much music during the day which was in my opinion bad. Usually staff would like to get their guests engaged in games and make the pool atmosphere lively. I did talk to one of the staff from entertainment she said they were n\u2019t allowed to play music. The management told them no music. Why. I do n\u2019t know. She had to wait for the management to go into meetings before she can play music for the guests. The guests LOVED the music. They always wanted more. I mean it \u2019s a vacation yes. some want to relax but for the most part people want to have a few drinks have some music and enjoy the pool. There is always the beach to relax without music from the entertainment staff. They had two elevators on our wing but only 1 worked fully during our stay. The other intermittently popped on but then would shut off again. I did take the stairs a few times but at times had to wait due to our stroller. One point I would like to make for management you are in the Bahamas where is the Bahamian culture. There should be Bahamian culture flared into all aspects of the resort from food to entertainment. It \u2019s a shame that the staff can not truly express their culture to the guests because management shuts them down. I talked to many staff servers and bar tenders they all said they wish there could be more Bahamian culture infused into the resort. I believe that is true. If I wanted an American resort I would go to Vegas or Florida or New York. But being in the islands there definitely should be the culture of the locals from food to entertainment wrapped all together and showcase it. There entertainment in the night consisted of Broadway show beach boy \u2019s video concert magic show ritmo Latino show salsa party and karaoke. Do n\u2019t see any Bahamian culture in those nightly affairs. That \u2019s just my opinion though. All resorts will have flaws but its how they overcome them with staff attending to guests and making sure they are taken care of is what sets the bar high and brings customers back. We did complain to some managers about the service we received especially at the Nikei restaurant which was completely unacceptable and they said they will bring it up with Pablo the general manger of the property. We are on vacation and we will not let obstacles stop us from enjoying our quality time together. Everyone works hard and deserves time to relax unwind and create moments with their family as we have done and will continue to do on our future vacations. Overall would I recommend Melissa Nassau. At this point no. I have heard and read that they are improving this resort from the roof at the moment to mattress later this year and then maybe room improvements. But who knows when this will be completed. Their Level service needs a complete overhaul though especially with the amenities and services offered for such an upgrade. Staff was a hit or miss on occasions but we definitely got some great ones during our stay. Cleaning service lady was amazing as well I forgot her name but had a good in depth conversation with her a few times and she is so hard working. I do n\u2019t mind giving it a shot maybe after a lot of improvements have been made but that is a long way from complete.", "offset": [11131, 11263], "date": "2018-05-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "04313822-27c4-4289-b121-cfab30854e88", "sentence": "never been to an all inclusive like this one.

I wish someone would have informed me before booking the trip. When we arrived our trip was fully paid for. In order to get the yellow wrist band we would have had to pay an additional 630. It was not worth it because at the end of the day some of the staff gave my husband his johnny black. The food was just regular nothing to write home about. The beach is beautiful and well kept. The pool area was nice also. The best thing about the resort is the helpful staff. I never had a problem with anyone. Everyone went above and beyond and for that it made us forget about the yellow wrist band level nonsense. I especially wanted to acknowledge a few staff members.

We traveled to Melia with my family of 10We booked the level lounge ocean view room for our 25th wedding anniversary through American Airlines vacation packages. We did n\u2019t book the transportation so we took a cab to the resort which was about 10 minutes from the airport. The cab says that is is 210 but it actually cost us 300 each way. They charge an additional fee per bag so if you can get transportation in your package you will make out cheaper. The hotel has transportation which is a Mercedes truck to take you back and forth to the Bahamar hotel for free but not to the airport. Level Lounge upgrade When we arrived at the resort we were taken to floor 4 to the Level Lounge. With the lounge you get private check in and out. You will get an orange wrist band which identifies you. The lounge has tv \u2019s computers games snacks coffee and cocktails for you to enjoy throughout the day. You get access to the private beach area with food and beverage service on the beach a private restaurant to eat breakfast a discount to eat at the steak restaurant and 24 hr room service. You make your reservations for the restaurant in the level lounge which really does n\u2019t make sense since hey are not guaranteed. Restaurants. The restaurants are hard to get reservations even if you are in the upgraded level category. You have to fill out a form and put the time you want and then they will tell you at a later time if you have reservations or not. I was not happy the day of my anniversary. I put in to have a special dinner and they did not honor my request. Not only did they not acknowledge that we were spending our 25th anniversary at their resort but they did n\u2019t even give us the courtesy of letting us have reservations at the restaurant of our choice even though we filled out the forms 2 days in advance. My husband and I mentioned to everyone at the lounge and even a few managers that it was our anniversary. We even put it on the reservations and they did not even send anything to our room or acknowledge it al all. We spend our anniversary in the Caribbean EVERY year and every hotel or resort we \u2019ve stayed at did something special for our anniversary either send a note a card a plate a towel animal in our room or a desert or something but they did NOTHING. My family was so surprised because they \u2019ve seen our other photos from previous hotels that acknowledged our special occasion each year. I feel for that reason I will not recommend anyone to spend a birthday or special occasion at this resort. Dining. The buffet was actually nasty during lunch and dinner. In fact I could n\u2019t find anything that I liked in the buffet and I am a foodie and eat everything. The buffet for breakfast was good and had everything for breakfast from made to order omelets mimosas and other items. Specialty restaurantsI enjoyed the food especially the staff at the Mexico restaurant called Cilantro. We had the best meal served family style. The entire staff in the restaurant was so friendly to my family. I do recommend getting reservations to Ciantro. The restaurant on the beach served hot wings salads burgers and was pretty decent. You have to put clothes on even though it \u2019s on the beach you ca n\u2019t go in there with just your bathing suit on. They did have a food stand that served hot dogs and burgers that you could get to eat on the beach. If you were on the level side you could order food from the waiter. Room service is included with the level lounge. There is a fee for room service for anyone else. I ordered room service one morning and it came hot and delicious. My room was a basic room with a king bed and a nice view of the ocean and pools. The hotel was nothing fancy and the room was not modern. I thought since it was the Melia name that we were getting a luxury room but it was not. This was our first time staying at a Melia chain. I was n\u2019t impressed but it was n\u2019t bad either. I feel it as just okay. Staff at the resort is very friendly. Each night they had entertainment and then a DJ in the lobby every night. I think that is a great touch since most resort shut down after 11 pm. It gave the people who did\u2019t want to go to bed An opportunity to listen to good music and dance. The Beach is very nice and clean. The ocean was calm and beautiful. If you want a good spot on the beach you have to get up at 5 am to get a chair with an umbrella. I put my stuff out on the chair and someone tried to move it while I was in the ocean so you have to watch your stuff. Overall I had a nice time but I would n\u2019t return I would try another resort.", "offset": [3498, 3545], "date": "2018-09-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "a75e3e30-e606-4152-a69b-1d821c1a840c", "sentence": "Disappointing Experience. Our overall holiday experience at Melia was OK to begin with. We are pretty easygoing travel internationally often and fun loving but had to write a review following our experience. The reception staff really do n\u2019t care once you have that all inclusive wristband on and they have your money just no interest or concern. quite surprising for an international resort and not a great representation of the fabulous people of the Bahamas. Oh and if you lose the wristband it \u2019s 20USD to replace. Some staff are amazing the entire resort should be as friendly and welcoming as the housekeeping team and drink servers around the pool whoever is managing them is doing a great job and should manage the entire resort staff wise. Some bar staff in the lobby are just rude and do n\u2019t want to be there at all but other shifts are so much fun and joking around it \u2019s the luck of the draw but ruins the whole vibe at the main bar when bad. The Grille beach restaurant by the pools day only excellent and friendly staff everyday. all restaurants in the resort should learn from them. The basic food is also 100 better than the mass style produced food served in the onsite evening restaurants. We just wished they were open in the evenings. We had dinner at the Asian fusion restaurant Nikei one night and despite making a reservation at 80am as required we were waiting 45 minutes for our table in the evening with rude attitude from front of house. Once seated it took quite a while for drinks to arrive and then the food. oh dear the food really just a comedy of errors. It was terrible and tasteless. tempura vegetables was our first dish to arrive and we had to send it back as it was stone cold. From there we had dishes that just did n\u2019t arrive and meals cuts of meat that were not as per the menu a server that did n\u2019t make eye contact and was more worried about what was happening at the entrance. The seafood rice main was inedible we left 3 of them uneaten. The table next to us family of 4 received their deserts and were so shocked at what they received they were looking at us in disbelief and we all started laughing at the bizarre situation and left with full plates of food on the table. I had to politely say something to reception and they said they \u2019l have the Food and Beverage Manager contact us but that never happened no surprise. The onsite Starbucks has disgusting service. Staff are sitting out the back in a small office on the phone and when you have to ask over the counter for assistance after patiently waiting they are rude no greeting no enthusiasm no eye contact no name taken and just generally like we have completely ruined their day and their social media time by buying a coffee. starbucks we highly recommend you have a secret shopper undercover staff experience this site it \u2019s site number 76 so shocked we looked it up at different times of the day and report back as it \u2019s certainly not representative of what we have experienced with your brand. oh and the \u2018 display \u2019 food looks like it has been there for years. Now not that this will be everyone \u2019s experience and I do n\u2019t wish it upon you on the last 2 days stay an extremely large and overbearing conference came in a took over the resort public areas and food stations ranting and cheering and sucked all the Wifi. They had set up corporate stations and events all around the resort with flags and T shirts and suddenly our relaxed environment becomes a conference of loud happy hand clappers. All the holiday guests we \u2019re in the middle of it with no escape and the resort has turned its focus onto the conference that have different colour wristbands. We immediately made plans for dinner at the casino next door to escape it all even though we were all inclusive. By the way the Casino has great bars and restaurants. if you want a quality meal head over there but it is a little expensive as you would expect. We caught the shuttle that states in the info pack its not included in the all inclusive package but we got it for free without a problem runs every 15 minutes. We eventually checked out and all we got was a short \u201c ok you do n\u2019t owe anything your free to go \u201d. no thank you we hope you enjoyed your stay come again or how was everything.

Upon arrival at the hotel having precheck previously completed I had to wait for my room for 3 hours with 6 yr old and 1 yr old. There was no communication in reference to how long it would take to get the room. All I would get is come back in 30 min. If I knew that it would take that long then I would change and hang out by the pool. The manager on staff did not help at all. At least someone should have mentioned the restaurant reservations. Additionally I have put in my order notes precheck notes and inquired in person requesting a crib for the baby and I am still waiting for it. The staff at the front desk misinformed me every single time. The restaurant reservations it is almost impossible to get early reservation 6 7 pm as at 802 am everything is booked. While reservations are taken between 8 am and 4 pm they are completely gone by 802. And I am presented with an impossible option of 9 pm or after. My kids are asleep at that time which leaves me to buffet. The food at the buffet seems to be leftovers from the previous days. The only good thing about the buffet is the breakfast which can be cooked in front of you. Even my 6yr old asked me daddy what is this am I eating. first night dining at the buffet. Thankfully after only 20 minutes of arguing the manager was able to accommodate us with reservations for the next day. The resort is doing improvements throughout. My kids nor I did not appreciate the smell of paint and view of construction. Lastly I will only briefly mention roach at the restaurant which crawled in the middle of the dinner. The pool at first looked great then I have noticed that the family pool west has broken filter system and cleaned by vacuum and staff. By the last day filter system broke down completely in all the pools and there was no hot water at the hotel. Calling the front desk or concierge was pointless as no one ever picked up that line. The only two things that worked really great The beach WiFiThe resort is corrupt unmanaged and lacks communication. If you have any issues then it is what it is.

This is the first review I have ever written but I thought it is important to do so as there are some great things about Melia that I want to call out but there are also several areas that certainly need improvement. We paid the extra to do the upgrade to The Level. I would recommend this upgrade as it allows you access to a private area of the beach where chairs and cabanas are always available and the rooms have a great view. Also room service is included with The Level and we found that to be the best food in the resort. In addition check in out is a breeze and the people who work in The Level are very friendly and helpful. In regards to the resort I \u2019l start with the pros The beach could not be any more beautiful. They keep the beach very clean and the water is gorgeous. Location is great right on Cable Beach with a view of Paradise Island and only a few minutes drive to downtown. The food with the except of the Asian restaurant was above average for an all inclusive resort including five star all inclusives that I have stayed at. Also the service in the restaurants except for the buffet at breakfast was great. Another great thing about this resort is they offer a free shuttle to take you to Baha Mar which is a fun a gorgeous hotel to visit. Cons We spent five days on the beach in The Level section and we never had a server come around to ask if we wanted anything. In fact one time we flagged the server of that area down and asked if we could order a drink from him and he seemed put out and very annoyed. Our mini bar was not restocked the entire time we were there. One day we called and asked for water and coke to be sent up. After two hours it had not come so we called back. Another six hours passed until we called again and a manager finally delivered them within five minutes. While the rooms were clean and the downstairs area is very nice the resort in general is in need of some upkeep. The paint carpet lack of ac and overall appeal in the hallways makes it appear to be a two star resort at best. The biggest con for us was the friendliness and service of the staff specifically at the bars. It really put a damper on our trip as encountering courteous and friendly staff should be expected at any resort. Many people have left reviews about the amazing staff so perhaps we were just there during a week where their b staff was working. With the exception of one or two bartenders the pool bar in particular had the most unfriendly staff I have ever encountered. None of them would ever be employed in any customer service related field in America. Special call out to a bartender named Delano for being exceptionally rude the entire week. Not only to us but everyone including children who asked him for a drink aka to do his job. He would fair much better in a job where he did n\u2019t have to interact with people. The lobby bar had a couple of really great and friendly bartenders. The others would only be somewhat nice when you had cash in your hand and they knew they were getting a tip. Overall we liked the resort and had a great trip and loved the Bahamas.

This is going to be long. on arrival we found our way up to the Level check in. Our room was not ready but we were directed to go for lunch. Our bags had been left near the entrance and whilst Level had asked us for tags we had not been given any so checked on baggage to see it was mixed with others and no order. Lunch outside only option in travel clothes so a little warm but after that our rooms were ready. Despite booking 9 months in advance and asking for connecting rooms this did not happen which baffles me as surely despite full occupancy with that notice you simply designate those rooms in advance. Rooms were overlooking pools and ocean and a beautiful view. The rooms had everything you needed and whilst our aircon worked beautifully not so much in our childrens room next door. As level guests you get a small fridge with a variety of drinks inside. Despite the fact we only drank one type of drink from the fridge you had think that s what they would re stock it with but NO. so thankfully as Level guests we could grab some from the fridge in that lounge each day as we walked by. Rooms are well maintained and ready each day as we came back in. Restaurants thank goodness for being a Level guest as they booked our dinner times for us other guests have to be queuing before 8 am each day to book for that night whereas Level guests can book 3 days in advance. Good choice of restaurants but the Angus Steak house is so expensive. Such a shame to make it like this which prevents many guests from going there as its such a beautiful restaurant great staff and food. Japanese again is excellent staff are brilliant and food is delicious. Cilantro both times we went in had to wait 30mins for table booking and then several dishes not available each time. Service varied in here. Aqua Italian again had to wait a considerable amount of time to get table and be served. Almost 45 mins on our second visit. Again items missing off the menu. Can understand once but on both visits. Service was poor in this restaurant. Market only visited twice for breakfast and again long queues. If staff got on and cleared tables quicker the queues would be less. Definite attitude of some staff in this restaurant and really unhelpful. Such a shame as great food and could be easily rectified which better management. Outside BQ lady WOW. works her socks off and food is excellent. Bars by far our favourite and big shout out to the Dicenzo on the bar outside the restaurants as they were the best. Level Beach a special area designated just for Level guests and has comfy sunbeds own towel hut and drinks service. Beds are great and good location for all. Loved it down here everyday but two problems that again could be easily solved to make this space perfect. we have been to lots of all inclusive that nail this. Each day the beds were dirty you had to waste one towel cleaning them down of debris sand etc before you could lie your towels down. Staff are outside working just add this into the tasks. Towels ran out frequently. its a Caribbean island you have rainstorms every day. the towels get soaked you should have enough towels or a laundry that can deal with this. Go to the Atlantis it has towels for hotel guests water park guests cruise ship guests. AND IT does not RUN OUT. Buy more if necessary. we went one day asking at all towel huts and even at 5 pm could not get one so had to pad back through hotel to rooms. wet. Level drinks service. you either had two of them working the beach at the same time for about 30 mins or nothing for 2 hours and you ended up walking and getting your own drinks due to dehydration I am not joking. most of the time they are sitting in their hut on their phones FACTSuch a shame as this hotel has the actual potential to be amazing but it falls short on so many sides. Its a 3 star and no more. I could write so much more but its depressing to be so negative. LEVEL STAFF are brilliant and help you with everything so big shout out to them.", "offset": [1473, 1607], "date": "2019-07-22", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "9520a414-a5d0-4b83-9605-f5079313d13d", "sentence": "Second vacation at Melia. and we brought the family. Second time here. I write this review on our third day here. After our first visit back in 2016 we were so happy with this place that we talked our family into coming with us. Big mistake. we are disappointed and ashamed everything we share with them is opposed by the facts we walked in this time. Low quality service cheap quality but not cheap priced. The beach degraded became quite steep and instead of trying to level it they come with a cheap fix building wooden stairs. During the day you get annoyed by the construction noise nearby or by all the vendors that camp right on front beach trying to sell Bahama Mama in coconuts cigars with a doubtful Cuban origin bracelets and fans and conch shells that are used as shelphones with the most annoying sound when you try to rest after a year of hard work but with a signal code well known between the vendors and other operatives with different businesses on the beach. There is no sight of security or police in the area anymore. The services within the hotel could use some improvement. some of the housekeepers the young ones should be more attentive to the customers needs. Picking only the garbage tiding the bed and being arrogant does not do it for an all inclusive hotel I expect soap shampoo and towels on daily basis especially if I follow your guidelines into how to proper dispose the used towels and I make the mistake to tip you for your hard workThe food services could use a larger variety a better menu and a better presentation especially at The Market Place and the OGrile. You clearly can see the difference in work flow and customer approach between the old team members and the new ones hard working people like Eleanor and Shena make a diferenceThe same I could say about the restaurants within the hotel. Very hard to obtain a reservation only 24 hours in advance with long lines not fun when you are in vacation and low quality service see my review for Nikei. The bars also could use a larger selection of drinks and better bartenders by the way Gary remains the best bartender that Melia has the fact that drinking bottled water is limited to whatever two bottles of half litter each the housekeeper drops in your fridge makes this place look so cheap. There is drinking filtered water available thru the resort at the bars and restaurants by the cup plastic cups with the same impact on the environment as the plastic bottles but if you want to have a bottle with you on the beach or overnight then you have to reuse the one that you emptied. That is so cheap looking MeliaBefore you were able to see the general manager on the floors during the day and the service managers present most of the time. I guess that was before. In conclusion Melia in Nassau looks a little tired with more room for improvement than before with a drop in its standards probably getting ready to surrender to the aggressive expanding Baha Mar and to become a memory on pictures and on TripAdvisor and for me with a regret that I could have used my money somewhere else for something better this summer.", "offset": [2579, 2736], "date": "2019-07-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "cea07641-0182-479e-a279-88d657149da5", "sentence": "The LEVEL is worth the extra. Unfortunately I am back to work and writing this from my desk and not enjoying the awesome view on Cable Beach from the Melia. The trip was great and everything was seamless. The LEVEL experience was worth the extra coin. Before arriving I emailed the resort to confirm my reservation and received a timely response. I was able to communicate with the staff affiliated with The LEVEL. I made dinner reservations before we arrived for each night. Thank You Danisha Aderley for all your help in answering my questions by email and insuring the dinner reservations were made. Upon arrival we were greeted with Bahama Mamas and guided to The LEVEL Lounge to check in. This was great you go into the lounge they have snacks and top shelf alcohol for you while you wait. Then you sit down with a member of The LEVEL staff and go through your check in process. Was perfectWe were provided with our room keys and off to our Junior Ocean View Suite we went. The room was great clean and stocked with a mini bar and keurig. ROBES who does not love ROBES. Big thank you to Vanisha for taking care of our room. She was awesomeThe LEVEL beach area was great. Rhinon Jordan and Randi always on hand for drinks and a lunch menu. We were spoiled. We were up early and secured our beach spot then the good times rolled. Never without a drink or food. Speaking of Food. OGril was great for breakfast and lunch. We ate at Nikei hibachi Cilantro with our new friends from Nashville Alex Meredith and Aqua. Needless to say a cocktail with Dicienzo before dinner after dinner and anytime he was working required being prepared for laughter. Our last day we spent a few hours in the ocean where our friend the sea turtle said goodbye. We were able to get a late check out and lounge around the hotel until 230 pm. Overall we had a great experience and will always to The LEVEL experience. CONS. The negative Nancys that come to the resort whine and complain about everything and try and scam The LEVEL experience. People hear you use your inside voice. Customer Service is not an easy industry and we found the staff at Melia to be on top of the game. Its vacation people sit back relax and go with the flow.

I visited Melia in July with three girlfriends all of us middle aged. We chose this resort for its location on Cable Beach and because it was the most affordable all inclusive option. After booking we began to see all of the negative reviews and some positive so we went forward with lowered expectations. Melia met those expectations and in some cases exceeded them. Our rooms on the 7th floor we did not upgrade to the Level had excellent ocean views and overlooked the Westwind condos on the West side of the resort. The rooms themselves were okay. Not the cleanest but not the dirtiest I \u2019ve ever had. We left a note the first day with a small tip and asked for more waters which we received that day and every day after that with no tip needed. We never ran out of towels but sometimes certain dirty towels were removed and not replaced or replaced with different sizes. Whatever we managed. About the mini fridge ours had a soda a beer a granola bar and a bag of chips for the first 3 days of our visit. We did n\u2019t eat drink those or ask for anything but on the 4th day suddenly our fridge had two more beers and two more granola bars. In celebration I drank one of the beers. Yes there is construction on the East side of the resort since we did n\u2019t stay on that side I ca n\u2019t speak to that. They are also renovating the exterior and are now working on some of the West side upper floor rooms. Yes the hallways are frequently hot musty smell funny and contain beer bottles trash. Not the best impression but since we were just walking thru not a huge problem just not attractive. We used a tip on the FaceBok page to make dinner reservations in advance of our stay by email which worked for the first two nights of our stay. Once we checked in we saw the concierge in the lobby to book the next two dinners. The restaurants exceeded my expectations in both service and food quality. On the night we dined at Cilantro they were out of several appetizers but both the hostess and our waiter let us know so it was not a surprise. The food was great. On the last night we dined at the tapas restaurant in the lobby area and they treated us to complimentary champagne with blueberries in the glass we were all celebrating milestone birthdays. No complaints about those restaurants. The buffet was hit or miss. sometimes they had things sometimes they did n\u2019t. Also service at the buffet was spotty. sometimes you had a hostess to seat you sometimes you had to wait a while. Sometimes someone would bring you drinks or missing silverware sometimes it seemed like no one \u201c owned \u201d the table and you had to flag someone down. O\u2019Gril was my least favorite of all of the restaurants. It was dirtyflies and trash everywhere tables not bussed cleaned had very poor service and the food was not good over cooked both timesThe beach was great although crowded. We always managed to find a couple of chairs together to put our things on although usually not in the shade you must need to get up very early to claim those spots in the umbrella areas. maybe some people just left their stuff there all night. Since we were in the water most of the time this did n\u2019t bother us. We were disappointed to learn that some of the water equipment the resort \u2018s web page mentions are not there or are an extra cost. We brought our own snorkel equipment but there was n\u2019t too much to see a few colorful fish around the rocks. My friend was able to get a paddle board to use with a few minutes \u2019 wait. The beach bar \u2019s service seemed fine most days maybe a few times we had more than a few minutes wait or had a cranky bartender but if I had to work all day in that heat I \u2019d be cranky too. We did n\u2019t spend much time at the pools but did observe that the main pool adult pool had a much younger crowd and feel to it. And that leads me to my only real negative review. I never really felt 100 comfortable with the \u201c vibe \u201d of the place. It had dance music going all of the time instead of Caribbean music so most of the time I felt like I was in a disco or club especially at night. My friends and I tried to find a quiet place to relax and chat while having a drink after dinner and there was none to be found. The lobby is the main focal point of the resort and is an open bar restaurant entertainment area on most nights and jammed with people. The resort could use some quieter seating areas off the main lobby.", "offset": [1841, 1915], "date": "2019-08-12", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 30, "uid": "35ef08f4-4ef3-41ff-b317-bed77add5628", "sentence": "The beach is beautiful the Resort is alright. Just returned from 6 days and 5 nights at Melia Nassau Beach. The good bad and ugly To be fair there really was not anything ugly about this resort and nothing particularly bad either. There were certain people who made a very average resort good and they deserve credit here. When we arrived the first thing we discovered was that the adult pool was closed and empty. I am not sure if this was do to Hurricane Dorian having recently passed through or if it was routine maintenance. The other pools are perhaps the best aspect of the resort as a whole other than the beach of course. so we looked the other way at this. The next thing we discovered was that the O Grille restaurant by the pool was closed. Then we discovered that the jets in the hot tub did not work. Then we found out the jets in the other hot tub did not work either. Starting to see a pattern. First impressions are lasting impressions and our first impression quickly led us to think we were at a fairly ghetto all inclusive. The bar by the beach is manned by several bartenders with varying definitions of customer service. My wife mentioned waiting for several minutes while two bartenders finished their conversation before helping her. Maybe this is what they call island time or maybe it is poor customer service. Either way it was not what we expected. Also unlike every other all inclusive we have ever been to gratuities are not included so there are tip jars in several places around the resort including the bar. Given the caliber of service I just mentioned this seemed off putting. The exception to this was a bartender named Patrick who was phenomenal. He leaped to your assistance when you came to the bar and was constantly asking people are you good. Can I get you anything. I got to where I kept cash in my swim trunks in case he was working because anyone who worked that hard deserved it. The restaurants have something of a revolving schedule. The Marketplace what they call the buffet had an excellent breakfast and lunch put out but several nights during out stay it was closed for dinner. Cilantro the name of the Mexican restaurant had a very minimal and unimpressive menu so we nearly left but the waitress made some great recommendations try the snapper and it turned out alright. Aqua the Italian restaurant had little to write home about but the prosciutto pizza was exceptional. By far our favorite restaurant for dinner was the tapas restaurant just off the lobby. Our first night there we had a great waitress named Sacha. The food and Sachas commitment to service were so good that the following night we went back and asked to be seated in her section. It turned out she was off so we were seated in Karens section. In minutes Karen felt like family. I am not sure I have ever had a more wonderful and engaging waitress anywhere and we gave her a 25 tip. Given those two nights we came back again and had a waiter named Ricardo. He was a 180 from what we were used to. His service was so slow that a gentleman at the table next to us went up to the bar for another round of drinks because he got tired of waiting for Ricardo to come back. He was a ghost. And when he was there we got monosyllabic grunts instead of any semblance of friendly service. The beach is beautiful and clean but by the end of the day there is often quite a bit of littler that people leave. How anyone can litter in paradise is beyond me but my little boy often got some exercise after dinner by walking the beach and picking up plastic cups and trash before the tide reached it. This is not the fault of the resort by any means but it should not be us picking up trash. There really should be people assigned to doing this. Since the tide comes fairly high up the beach in the evening it is not something that can be put off until morning. So overall I give the place a C. It was one of the cheaper all inclusives I found on CheapCaribeancom and we got what we paid for.

Unfortunately what I thought I would be a holiday to remember is just that but for the wrong reasons. Upon arrival it looked great. The welcome was ok not much advice or explanations given apart from if you lose your wrist band then it \u2019s a cost of 200. Room was large and clean except for the used bottles of cups on our balcony ok you can forgive as it happens but whilst on the subject of rooms ours was n\u2019t cleaned for 2 days despite leaving the request on the door handle daily so we had to request for water to replaced from the reception and toilet roll clean towels from any of the carts we passed. I then overheard the cleaners discussing at 425 that any rooms not done would n\u2019t be as they finish at 430 sharp baring in mind they do n\u2019t start until at least 12ish. After each shower it would take at least an hour for the water to drain away always resulting in the tub having dirty mucky water. You would also see the same trays rubbish sat outside of romsFor hours at a time some actually went into a 2nd day so was n\u2019t surprised to see flies getting excited. Food whatever either ate was very good I must admit however you are advised to download the ap as there are a number of restaurants which need to be preboked which we requested via the ap but unfortunately it was n\u2019t the most responsive leaving us twice missing out. So rather then eating at the same buffet 3 times each day we look over at the room service available 24 hours a day. but if your not on the elevated option which we was n\u2019t aware of there is a charge of 10 EACH TIME. Again the quality of the food ca n\u2019t be questioned or the service. Entertainment is never gon na be a west end show but it was more enjoyable to sit and watch the barmen Patrick and Frederick who the youngsters could learn a lot from and maybe think twice before hiding out the back to maybe get high. There is a lot of building work going on and out of 7 days we had something every day replacement of carpets 6 pm. cleaning of carpets 7 pm building work next to Meli\u00e1 continuously some kind of work near the gym and some kind of building works between the family pool adult pool which was absolutely filthy FYI so think twiceThen to top off a splendid stay we speak with reception to ask if we were able to extend our room as not being collected until 7 pm. Now I \u2019m quite well travelled and expected a fee but \u20ac 26 PER HOUR totally to over \u20ac 150 so we could freshen up before a delayed flight which they were aware of and then at least a 10 hour journey after take off is totally unacceptable if you ask me even better that when speaking with another guest they tell you they were given their room free of charge for the same extra time. Unfortunately we felt we had no choice to pay as there are no facilities for you to use to freshen up etc after checking out at 12 pm. I will be looking for a further explanation as to why this is and justification for decision to the next. There is a little shop on site but be aware they charge you \u20ac 2 for the cans of coke they serve you from the bar and \u20ac 295 for bottled water you should have in your room daily.

In short do not stay at this resort. The overall quality of the resort staff and especially food is shockingly poor. First this was not a cheap resort. I am paying many hundreds of dollars a night closer to one thousand a nightSecond the food is in a word terrible. When they say there are \u201c 7 restaurants \u201d what that means is the same low quality food is re plated in 7 different locations of the hotel. I have never been to prison but I assume the food served here is quite similar to what is served in most state lock ups. As one example the same cold cut \u201c meat \u201d not sure what it is is served for breakfast lunch and dinner and on more than one occasion I saw insects on it. Dinner the first night consisted mainly of trays of macaroni and cheese macaroni salad and some type fried fish. Moreover it is extremely difficult to get a table or even get served. Even though this is \u201c all inclusive \u201d we left the hotel to pay for meals elsewhere. Third the staff is uninterested in helping with any issues. For example when we checked in the mini bar did n\u2019t work and there was no safe in the room. Ok minor inconveniences. But 6 calls and visits to the front desk and concierge later over 2 days we still could n\u2019t get an in room safe. Finally after demanding to speak to a manager we were referred to someone in housekeeping. We then finally got a safe but of course it did n\u2019t work. We had to call again and have 2 different workers come to fix the safe. I could go on and on about how we asked to speak to supervisors and mangers time and time again.
