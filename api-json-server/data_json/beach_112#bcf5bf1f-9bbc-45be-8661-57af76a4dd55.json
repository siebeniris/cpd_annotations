The room was very clean and comfortable with a fridge desk comfy chair which i placed in front of the window to view downtown and nice bed. There were no water bottles so buy some and put in the fridge. There are lots of variety stores close by. The hotel is close to shopping and great restaurants and you can walk everywhere. There are however lots of homeless people on Market Street. We had no problems at all just the smell of weed at 8 am all day wherever you walk.

There is a small kiosk that sells homemade ice cream wish i could remember the name but twice i enjoyed Guines and Gingerbread ice cream which was divine.

Check in was a breeze. My first impression. what a wonderfully friendly smile Mr John has. We had arrived early so our room was not ready but we were given another room that was ready right away. We had a room on the 32nd floor with a magnificent view of the bay and the golden gate bridge. All lit up at night it was spectacular. Rooms were very clean beds comfy and the coffee was excellent. If we ran out of anything we used the in room tablet to order it and not only was it delivered quickly but there was a follow up call to make sure it was actually delivered. There are tons of places to eat within short walking distance. There are hotel representatives everywhere ready to answer any question. There is no pool but there is a fitness room.

I have stayed at this hotel many times in the past during the Oracle Open World conference. I have always loved it. I have written past reviews on it extolling its virtues. But this time no. And I am pissed at them and an extremely unhappy customer. And they really do not seem to care. They have made the strike going on between them and their workers their customers problem instead of just theirs and are still charging 500 per night for the privilege of staying there in what I think are unacceptable conditionslet us start with the NOISE. We got a very subtle email with a warning that there would be more noise during our stay and they apologized in advance. But they made it sound like it was due to construction. It was not. I could hear no construction noise. but what I could hear from 8 am until 10 pm were all the strikers downstairs yelling on bullhorns beeping whistles drumming on drums and screaming. All Day All Night at the top of their lungs. It is incessant and it never stops except at the 10 pm deadline thank God. They put me in a room on the 27th floor and I was still unable to ever take a nap during the day even with earplugs put in. Then there are the amenities. They are undergoing construction AND the strike at the same time right now. So there is a very limited choice of restaurants and bars and they are poorly staffed. Their normal bar downstairs is closed. There is a small pantry market where you can purchase coffee sandwiches etc. And then there is the extremely expensive View bar on the 39th floor which is beautiful but also operating in a limited capacity. They close at 11 pm so after the Oracle concert we had to go somewhere else to even have a cocktail. There was no food service while we were there and the staff was obviously a pick up staff that made every drink differently every time. And I am sorry when I pay 15 for an Old Fashioned I want a good one. But every one was different depending on who I ordered it from. Then the housekeeping service is also down to a skeleton staff. They obviously do not know what they are doing quite yet although they are trying their hardest. The blame is not on them. But they did weird things like they took my pillow that I brought from home because I have a bad neck. Housekeeping gave me money to replace it but still. Having to go to Target and buy one was not on my to do list. One day we asked for extra cream which they gave us but then the next day they removed all the extra cream we did not use. I also walked out in the hall and asked for extra coffee for my husband and the nice guy gave it to me but then was immediately reprimanded in front of me by his supervisor for doing so. And we also saw a poor woman frantically cleaning a room with her two kids in tow. They obviously are having a difficult time finding workers to cross the picket line. I understand they are having problems. I understand the workers are trying their hardest. I feel bad for all those involved. But Mariot should be offering a discount to their clients during this time this place is not any better than a Comfort Inn I stayed at out in Half Moon Bay right now. And what did we get for our trouble for putting up with this. All they offered us was a measly 50 miles on the Mariot Rewards program. 50 miles gets me absolutely nothing. A basic hotel room is 250 miles for one night at most of the places I looked at. And so Mariot you have lost my loyalty and you have lost a customer. I have always booked Open World early so I could make sure I get a room at this hotel. but no more. Next time I will stay ANYWHERE else that happens to be available. it is great that you treated me well when things were going well for you and it was worth the price to have that treatment. But to make me pay full price for a half staffed hotel with people screaming their pain outside all day long was completely unacceptable. And even though I talked to the manager on staff to let you know I was not happy with my experience your measly 50 you gave me to make up for it was pretty much a worthless offering on your part.

The view from our room was not the best but that was okay as we were going out for the night anyways if you want a view make sure you ask for one when booking or at check in. They have usb ports on the base of the lamps on each night stand so that was a huge plus to charge any of your devises. Our bathroom was large just loved it plenty of counter space lots of towels and they provided little soaps shampoos etc. but I always bring my own from home. There is also a hair dryer in the room. The View Bar on the 38th Floor is amazing. My favorite place by far at this hotel. The views are amazing it does get crowded up their quickly so go up there when they open if you can to get a seat by the window if that is what you would like. I had a Blackberry Bay drink that was so good and it came with an orchid in it drinks are bit expensive but it was my birthday so we planned for paying higher pricing. My only complaint was the valet parking arriving at the hotel took some time long line of cars pulling into the valet garage and its also 80 to park the car for the night. We called just before leaving the hotel the next morning to have them get our car so we were not waiting forever for them to get it. So by the time we got down to valet the car was there ready for us we also carried our own bags as we only stayed over night so we did not have much to carry and it is faster than having hotel staff carry for you.
