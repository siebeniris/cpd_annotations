As a business traveler who exclusively stays at Hilton properties I can say without a doubt that this was the worst yet.

Although the website said that the hotel was under renovation of their guest rooms I thought it was fine to stay but I was so wrong. When we checked in I noticed the complimentary coffee tea service to the side of the front desk which I thought was nice but soon I quickly discovered that it was not just meant for guests. There were often various hotel employees that would utilize the coffee or tea for themselves. I thought this was for the GUESTS. As we make our way to the elevator my family and I were constantly sneezing from the dust that the construction people made as they haul materials and cement into the elevator that took us up to the floor. Inside the rooms were musty and smells of moisture. The size of the room was small and tight but the bathroom was spacious. The best part of the stay was the shower water pressure. Unfortunately the hotel did not provide enough towel service for a family of four. I then picked up the telephone to request for more towels and I discovered that the in room telephone was not working. So I made my way downstairs to request for more towels from the front desk which we never received from the staff. We waited the next morning to get more towels from the housekeeping staff in the hallway. At our complimentary breakfast the hotel only provide one waffle maker which is slow and always had a line of people waiting to use it. By the time breakfast was ending there were guests that were still waiting to use it. The staff quickly came out to clean up everything and took food away. It is absolutely awful to stay in a hotel that does not make guests feel the comfort of home. The front desk staffs are also unfriendly no hellos or welcome when guests enters the hotel. The entire staff and management should be renovated and retrain for hotel and hospitality service. If you plan to stay in this property I recommend that you stay away and go for other chain of hotels than to waste your time and money in this location.", "offset": [11, 143], "date": "2016-10-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "eb727491-7948-484e-874e-c0365607a45a", "sentence": "Worst HIlton Property.
