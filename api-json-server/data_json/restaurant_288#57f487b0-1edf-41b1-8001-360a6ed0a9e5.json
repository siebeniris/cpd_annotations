After spending hours discovering the city mostly touristy haunts in the day the very comfortable and clean room was fantastic.

There are several high end restaurants also in the area but we stuck to local eateries that were a few minutes walk from the front entrance of the hotel. The evening front desk staff were friendly and helpful in recommending a few night clubs DC House Hip Hop close by as most bars close early and shops typically shut their doors at 8 pm.

Arrived at this hotel for the last leg of my 3 week holiday around the USA with my friend. We had booked a twin share room through a third party provider 9 MONTHS in advance. As I get nervous about 3rd parties so I made sure to email the hotel directly to confirm they had received by reservation and received confirmation that my booking was fine. Check in was fine well except for the 10 per night hold that they put on your credit card for us that was 400. We went up to our room and where presented with one King Bed. Not what we booked. Went downstairs. We were polite thinking it was just an error. Pulled up my email confirmation and confirmed we had definitely booked a twin bed room. The receptionist went to get her manager. That women whose name I wish I could recall was AWFUL. They had over booked and bumped us to a King room. Their excuse was that there was flooding issues in one of the rooms. If that is the case. EMAIL or CONTACT your guests. Come on. you have all my contact details there not difficult. Your team is simply lazy. We where offered a trundle bed. we are two grown women. We requested two beds. They were unable to supply. Even though they had rooms available that evening instead of giving us a second room they offered us a room at 50 off the rate for the night which was MORE than we had paid for our original nights. So for the first night I had to sleep on a lumpy trundle bed that was DUMPED in our room and we had to make up ourselves. No pillows where brought with it. We had to place it right in front of the Air conditioner which was SO loud and kept cutting in and out all night. It was horrible. They where thankfully able to move us to a a proper room for the remainder of our stay. But I was not happy about the situation at all given we had booked so far in advance. They kindly offered us complimentary breakfast would not recommend if you have to pay for it. However I still got charged for 1 lot of breakfast on my credit card. Upon checking out I asked if there where any charges that where going to be applied to my card. I was told yes the breakfast. I corrected them and advised them it was complimentary. She said it would be removed. it was not. I have not received any invoice to advise of the charge it was simply takenI emailed them as soon as I saw the charge on my card that was nearly 3 weeks ago and I have not received a response. This hotel is horrible. I would NEVER recommend them to anyone. Not just because of the issues that happened to me but also for the folowing1. Air conditioners are very loud and noisy2.
