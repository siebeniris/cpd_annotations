Great location in downtown Cincinnati near most attractions. Elegant common areas and grand marble staircase that I loved walking. Yes the charm is indeed that the marble is slightly worn. Attentive staff clean and nice amenities like plush towels and high end soaps. Valet and doormen who get the car door for you seem to always be there. Wonderful and 5star. Unfortunately the spacious clean room was old. Like 1970s old. And worn. Hvac worked sluggishly decor was stained and torn and the bathroom was one of the worst I have seen at this price point. The stained slippery oversized tub with no safety grips is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Faucets do not work well sinks are stained chipped cracked and the toilet barely manages its job if you can crouch so low to the ground to get to it. Strong water pressure in the shower does not make up for the torn curtains and lack of temperature control. Upon arrival I requested a renovated room. This would have helped. Although the hotel was no where near capacity the request was denied unles I wished to pay 150 per night. I paid 125 and took a daily risk in that bathroom. For even less per night other downtown properties including the newly built ones next door are likely safer. I wanted to love the Cincinatian and were I in a renovated room I likely would have.

Our backs hurt so bad we could hardly stand up in the morning. The bathroom however was very nice. Very worn and needed updating but it was nice to have a large bathroom with two sinks. There was no make up mirror which made it almost impossible to get ready in the morning. Every other hotel we have stayed at in the last year has some kind of a magnifying mirror in the bathroom.

This should be a good 4star boutique hotel. Instead you have a bland hotel with below standard food and beverage options and a complete lack of attention to the details. The hotel was so bland. If you did not know better you could have been in a forgettable airport hotel. There was not even background music in the lobby elevator or public spaces. At check in I was not addressed by name nor was I thanked for staying. All of the staff were polite. They were not intentionally bad. it is just that they were not well trained in the sort of service one expects at 4star hotel. Very rough around the edges. Nothing refined. No bellman to assist with luggage although the valet parking attendant did at least help me with getting my bag out of the trunk. I also never saw a manager. No complimentary newspapers. No umbrellas. My room had a bathrobe but no slippers. Speaking of room the TV was great as was the wireless internet. But the floor is wood or fake wood which makes a lot of noise especially with luggage on wheels. The bathroom is awkward as there is one sink in the room with the toilet and another bigger sink in the main room of the bathroom. Weird. Instead of a modern luxury shower the hotel has old Jacuzi tubs which I found difficult to get out of when I was wet. I was really afraid of falling. Also the bathroom showed a considerable amount of wear and tear despite this being a recently renovated property see picture. My bed was comfortable but the pillows were horrible. The pillows were four twin sized pillows for a king sized bed. They were either polyester fill or lumpy polyester foam. Horrible especially since Hilton normally has luxury feather king sized pillows. There were two major design flaws in the room First the door does not close all the way. As a result it lets in a lot of light. Look at the pictures. One picture shows the gap between the door and the door frame when the door is closed. The other picture shows how the door gap is eliminated when you push the door closed and hold it in position. The second design flaw is in the bathroom. The towel racks sits right under the dirt old heating and air conditioning vent which means dust and other things are likely falling down on the towels. Not exactly what you want. The breakfast restaurant is horrible. When I was there they were out of pretty much everything except bacon eggs and muffins. there is no on site lunch option nor is there a restaurant unles you consider the bar pub only opens after 4 pm a restaurant. The owners missed a huge chance for a marquee restaurant. All things considered I would not stay here again.
