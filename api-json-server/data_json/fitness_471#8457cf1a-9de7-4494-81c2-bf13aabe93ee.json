The Valley wing is the most exclusive wing and if you like luxury and attention to detail then it will certainly not disappoint. There is an exclusive lounge area available to Valley wing guests only which features fantastic art works and caters all day for various snacks and canapes high teas and all beverages including champagne. The only complaint I had was that it was so air conditioned that I near froze nearly every time I entered after coming back from polside a very very minor complaint. There was also an amazing harpist playing in the evenings which we really enjoyed. The room was lovely though we did have a flood as a drain was blocked and maintenance had to be called which held us up a bit for our dinner reservation but all in all was fixed quickly and only a minor inconvenience. All snacks and drinks non alcoholic from the minbar were complimentary which was a nice touch. Pool area was great no complaints. Food service was a little slow and did not seem to be many servers around but again a very minor thing. Food was fantastic. There is an exclusive a la carte breakfast available in a special room off the Valley wing lounge and it was absolutely amazing. Service and food simply first class. We had one dinner in the hotel buffet restaurant and that was also very nice with good selections especially good for children. We had one spa treatment each as this was included in our reservation package and was very nice with pleasant and professional staff. They use Kerstin Florian products which are just lovely. We always stay in the Shangri La Rasa Sentosa which we love so just tried this one for a change and it did not disappoint. If we had been childless this would definitely have been my pick especially the Valley wing however with a child children I think Sentosa would have to be my pick as they just cater more to kids ie kids club etc kids pools etc. The garden wing looked slightly more resort style and laid back so maybe a better option for those with children if you choose this hotel. All in all a fantastic hotel which we would recommend.", "offset": [1435, 1568], "date": "2015-01-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "055f58be-af53-4c45-bd45-8b7fd30513e9", "sentence": "Running a work conference and all was well. I was part of a team running a conference for senior executives at the hotel and therefore experienced both the guest side of the hotel and interfaced with the conference organisation team. On the guest side I stayed in the Tower Wing and the rooms were of a good size and were well equipped. The bed was comfortable and the linens were in good conditionthe gym is fabulous and the pool is also lovely and of a reasonable size. Breakfast was fantastic definitely something to ensure is part of your room rate. It would be easy to have enough breakfast to tide you over until dinner time and there is a massive choice. On the business side we used the conference team who were reasonable though not stellar. Access to rooming information was frustratingly difficult and tardy and our key contact would not say that they could not do something they would just leave it undone. This got us into difficult situations a couple of times until we realised this was the modus operandi. We also had issues a couple of times with noise where works around the hotel are not coordinated with the conference schedules and we ended up chasing around the hotel trying to stop sources of hammering and other noise that was disturbing a very high level conference. It was not even the hotel staff who found the source of the noise in the end. That lack of coordination should be rectified. This and some other small issues in terms of event organisation mean that I would only rate this hotel as average for hosting events at best. Nonetheless the guest experience is great the breakfast a raging highlight and the gym and pool are v good.

We were really impressed by this luxury hotel with friendly staff excellent rooms we were in the garden wing overlooking the pool fantastic gym and lovely pool. The rooms were well appointed with comfortable beds and we had a great nights sleep. It is within walking distance of Orchard road and the MRT station where you can purchase a 1 3 day Singapore tourist card for unlimited travel on buses and the MRT underground. Our only disappointment was the 70s retro dining area called The Line. We arrived on a Saturday evening and had to join the scrum to get our food. The quality of the food was excellent but the fact that all the tables are like a motorway service cafe surrounded by cooking areas and people queuing meant that conversation was impossible. There are other options to dine in an evening which are quieter but with no advertised menu or tariff outside we did not venture in and at SIN 20 for two in the Line we did not feel we got value for money. There are plenty of other places to eat towards Orchard road and I am sure that they would not be full of screaming kids and you could relax during your meal. Breakfast was an equally rugby like scrum on the Sunday even leaving it as late as we could to venture down. It may be that this is just a weekend effect as Tuesdays breakfast was calmer but the bright orange decor staff fed up of weaving their way around guests and the general lack of personal space was not in keeping with the rest of the hotel which oozes sophistication.", "offset": [44, 204], "date": "2016-03-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "e0664411-9d5a-4db2-8166-5144b0a7cdb9", "sentence": "Delivered on expectstions.

The lockers could use a refurbishment but still fully equipped with sauna Jacuzi steam room etc. Only negative experience was at The Line the all day dining restaurant. On both days for breakfast the restaurant seemed more like an over crowded factory than a place to eat. Having a line up of tables in front of the restaurant near the lift landing actually blocking the passage is always a bad sign. Although food quality was good and variety excellent it is a very stressful way of starting the day. I do not think the hotel will change this any time soon given that it must be a gold mine.

Shangri La had never failed me in all the countries that I had stayed with them but this was totally disappointing. I was celebrating my wedding anniversary and my wife birthday yesterday at Chi Spa. We had a 15 hour massage which I partially paid via my Golden Circle points. After paying the final bill at Chi I requested for a complimentary car park coupon which I was given one by the Spa counter. Then when we were exiting the car park the complimentary ticket machine read my coupon as expired. I took a closer look and it was indeed expired 2 days ago. Hence i parked my car and headed to the concierge at the lobby instead of going all the way down to the Chi Spa which was 2 floors downHowever I was totally shocked by Mr Rajagopal Rajkumar Chef Concierge who refused to exchange my complimentary car park coupon. He stated that the Shang and Chi Spa were different. I was surprised and had no choice to head down to the Spa. The Spa counter lady was so sorry about giving me the expired coupon but was surprised that the concierge refused to exchange as Chi Spa belongs to the Shangri La After taking my coupon from the Spa I went back up to ask Mr Rajagopal Rajkumar why did he refuse to exchange. He was not apologetic and stated that the Spa coupon was for 3 hours of complementary car park but the Concierge was for full day. Hence he could not exchange. I mentioned that I did not even spent 3 hours in the Hotel what is the difference between the complementary coupon issued by the Spa or the Concierge. And he did not even ask if I was in Hotel for more than 3 hours. I was so angry that I asked for his name and he gave me his card. Again not a single Sorry was mentioned. If I was not in a rush for my lunch appointment I would had called for the GM or Front Desk Manager to sort this out.

I went each day and there was no music on and the running machines TVs on some machines did not work. There was no atomosphere. Most hotel gyms have music TVs etc. The machines were also pretty outdated. The gym was hot and the floor mats you have are DISGUSTING and look many many years old. Surely you can afford to update them. There are too many machines and not enough floor space. To try and get on the floor and do was sit ups between the other guests and machinery was impossible. Our air conditioner in our King room also did not work very well. There was a leak into our bathroom from the ceiling above during our stay which was fixed when we rang about it. The hotel seemed VERY crowded. I found out from a friend that was staying at the Apartments next door that they can use the amenities pool gym etc which may be causing the overcrowding problem. Could consider a separate pool for Valley Wing guests. Could also consider putting families separate from other adult guests in the Valley Wing club lounge champagne bar. I did not receive an orchid on arrival which you normally receive but received other benefits on arrival so not a real issue. Beds are very hard and required pillow toppers. We got overcharged with some room service delivered to the Valley Wing patio area. This was a complete disaster and took over an hour and a quarter to arrive and we then got charged for the wrong dishes which was only picked up on check out. Took a long time to sort it out on check out. I did not enjoy the breakfast experiences due to crowds. I did not like the Summit Room venue for breakfast as it was not heavily attended and the food looked stale and not fresh. The food at the The Line for breakfast was frequently empty and the chefs were not on top of the crowds and food demands. The new kids area and pirate ship is great but no one knows about it.

I could manage to take a day off on a weekday so I chose Chi Spa considering good massage and facility for hoping relaxing time. I made a booking 2 days in advance and told the staff that I would like to use the facilities such as jacuzi and sauna before the treatment. I went to the Spa one hour before my appointment time on the day. I told the staff who attended me to check in that I came early to use the facility. She explained to me the facility is at the gym which I am familiar with. So I changed and went to the gym to use the facility. That was the time I found out the facility was closed for maintenance.

It was totally ruined my excitement and feeling of relaxing and good day at Spa. I really did not understand why no one at Chi Spa knew about the maintenance work at the gym. I asked Spa manager for some explanations. She kindly offered the alternative to use the Swimming pool and outside jacuzi but I felt so disappointed so I declined the offer and ask to have spa treatment as soon as possible. I was offered a complementary collagen mask during the deep tissue body massage. The massage was excellent. The masseuse Stephanie was excellent. She taught me how to massage my body to release the tensions. I learned many things about my body from her. She was very caring and has profound knowledge on what she is doing. But again upon payment it was a different staff attended me. She was soft and a nice person. However she told me a Collagen mask was for \u201c Service Recovery. \u201dThe term \u201c Service Recovery \u201d should have been kept at Spa side.
