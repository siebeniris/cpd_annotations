The front desk staff was extremely unfriendly and unUpon check. in I was barely greeted with any words. I was given the keys to my 2 reserved rooms with no explanation about any breakfast Diamond perks or anything else eg water or rooms on the Hilton Honors floor. When I inquired I was told there would be breakfast vouchers left under our doors during the night. We proceeded to our rooms weaving through throngs of youth lounging around on the floor in all the common spaces on the 3rd floor. Exhausted I tried to fall asleep around 130pm to the sounds of kids running up and down the hall yelling and slamming doors. yes we called the front desk to ask for assistance in rectifying this. After eventually falling asleep I was awakened by a fire alarm. We all know the importance of respecting safety and evacuating quickly. Imagine my dismay at hearing other customers say they \u2019ve experienced the same false alarms on previous stays at your property. After the interrupted sleep we were not necessarily pleased to hear voices singing in the lobby before 830am on Saturday morning. Lovely voices perhaps and yet not appreciated after a poor night of trying to sleep. I was disappointed again when I discovered that I had not been given the promised breakfast vouchers. And again surprised when the shower was lukewarm the maid service did not refill the bathroom amenities and there was no water in the exercise facility. When I phoned you to discuss this directly nobody answered the main hotel phone number for over a minute and a half. I thought I had the wrong number. Surely a full service Hilton has someone on staff to answer the telephone. Through my eyes and those of my husband and friend \u2013 this is a snippet of the customer experience.

I read the tripadvisor reviews and could not decide if I wanted to request a room overlooking the lobby pool a room with a balcony on the other side or a quieter room. After an 8 hour drive to the hotel I no longer cared about the location of our room. All I wanted to do was have a shower and go to sleep. The very professional front desk attendant Suley was fast and efficient checking us in giving the wifi instructions and updating us on the dining options. Most importantly he did not make me feel like a second class citizen for having booked through hotwire. He even asked if we wanted a high floor or a low floor. My family member chose the high floor option it will be fun. Make sure you take one of the two elevators with the glass window for your first trip up to grasp the beauty of the building on your arrival. I loved the room. The beds were super comfy the linens were so crisp and ultra clean white. 2 weeks ago I emailed the hotel dsbosbwhiltoncom to ask about the cost for a fridge and microwave offered on request but never received a reply. Imagine my delight when I discovered the room had a mini fridge. Then I found one robe to wear in the closet and 2 bottles of water for us. Thinking it might be like a Sheraton here have some2botles of water offer I called the front desk to ask if there was a charge for the water. No charge btw. Our room had a balcony overlooking the non pool side so we felt we had the best of both worlds. We locked the door and slept soundly. The balcony sliding door has a lock as well as a safety bar. The bathroom was large clean and had Peter Thomas Roth toiletries. The coffee maker can make 2 cups of coffee or tea it is very good coffee. The lighting was excellent in the room to read and the TV was perfect when we watched the hockey game. The in room dining menu had some reasonable priced options 12 for a 12 inch chese pizza all day kids menu for 8 burger fries and a drink In room breakfast dining was more expensive. There was a cooked breakfast option for 1750 and a continental breakfast option for 15. There was a desk and an office chair on wheels as well as an upholstered chair. There was no seating on our balcony but I noticed other patrons were moving the room chairs onto their balconies. Local calls were 1. There was a safe in the closet. The pool was large and there are loungers and chairs overlooking the pool. The bar beside the pool also serves food. There is lots of parking close to the hotel and I noticed there was some parking under the hotel to the left as we drove in the hotel entrance. The pool is open until 10 pm so late night noise was never an issue. The fitness area is open 24 hours for the crazy folk. The wifi was flawless. On the second night I went to bed early in the evening. I awoke to the ringing of a bell which was. yup you got it. the fire alarm. I had previously read all about their seemingly frequent fire alarms but I never really thought it would happen to me. In the end there was no fire but the messaging was persistent in indicating we must leave the room. Now I know why there is a robe in the closet. However I insisted on dressing properly before I met the Woburn fire department. Oh yes in a fire evacuation you are not supposed to use the elevators as per the evacuation protocol posted on the wall. Heres where you will wish you asked for a low floor.

Once in the lobby proceed straight out the revolving door to the parking area where you can snap some selfies in front of the Woburn fire truck.
