In fact I was trying to chose between 2 different spa vacation sites and the receptionist was so personable and helpful that she was the tipping point. From our ride from the airport to our last meal in the dining room our stay was perfect. The program advisor helped us decide which classes to take and told us about all of services that were offered. We loved every class we took every meal we ate and every lecture we attended. The only complaint I had was the food was too delicious and I ate too much. The integrated approach of treating body mind and spirit was truly effective. The positive energy and healing spirit that I felt everywhere in Canyon Ranch was truly a blessing. I can not wait to come back.

This was my third visit to Canyon Ranch in Tucson and I brought my 19 year old daughter for her first visit. Every time. I leave I think that visit can not be topped but once again they did surpass themselves. New since last summer is the new sanctuary with the glassed in room for meditation and the gorgeous adjacent meditation garden with numerous fountains and beautiful flowers. Every employee we met was so friendly and welcoming. They went out of their way to do anything to make our visit a great one. We both did a ritual treatment I did the anti aging my daughter did the Euphoria and they were fabulous. The spa complex is so beautiful with everything you could need provided for you. We also had wonderful reflexology massages facials and I had a great pedicure with CJ who was so knowledgable and gave me many tips on nail care that I can do at home. One of the best things at the Ranch are their lectures I attended many and learned so much. From The Science of Weight Loss to Ask A Psychic there is something to interest everyone. My friends that I was traveling with did some art classes that I want to try next time they made beautiful jewelry and scarves. A highlight was a personal session with Lorey in the exercise physiology department. She was outstanding and gave me a workout routine I can do at home as well as some information on an injury that sent me to her in the first place. I recommend everyone take advantage of the free consultation with the nurses when you get there. They are great especially Sarah and can point you in the right direction if you have any physical or emotional health concerns. Canyon Ranch has the best food ever so good and good for you. The food is always one if the best parts of the trip and at lunch if you go to the Lunch and Learn in the Demo kitchen you get a cooking lesson and lots of recipes. Also I recommend at least one hike. The surrounding area is gorgeous and for level 1 and 2 hikes you do not need hiking boots athletic shoes are fine. We hiked through Saguaro Park and the cactus and desert plants were gorgeouscanot wait til my next visit and my daughter loved it so much she is spreading the word to her friends it is a great place for multiple ages there were grandmothers mothers daughters and husbands and wives there during our stay.

The main clubhouse is really nice but again the staff sat around talking really loud. I felt like I was interrupting if I asked a question like where is the restroom. It was aggravating because I wanted to sit by the fire and read my book but the staff was just too loud. There is a large desk when you walk through the front door it looks like a nice place to ask a question such as where is the spa but no. The lady made it clear that this was not the place to ask any questions she was busy. Um ok sorry to disturb.
