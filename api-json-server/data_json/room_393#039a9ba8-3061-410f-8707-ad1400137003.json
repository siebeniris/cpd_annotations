Hotel Needs Updating. The hotel has a great location on one of the main streets on the River. There were a couple of tour groups staying there during our visitThe carpets in the hotel are old stained and worn but clean throughout the halls and in the rooms. My room was larger than normal Eastern European hotels. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Towels are sufficient but a little thin. There were 3 or 4 holes in my curtains. There was a little mold in one spot of the bathromReceptionists were friendly and speak multiple languages fluently. I arrived to the hotel in the last evening and chose to eat there. I ate at Le Square and had soup club sandwich and fries. The people next to me were having fish and pork. My meal was excellent. The people next to me said theirs was also very good. It looked and smelled delicious. The staff in the restaurant was professional attentive and very friendly. I would eat there again. My breakfast was included. It was a breakfast buffet with an assortment of hot food eggs potatoes several meats etc cereals salads cold meats cheeses breads vegetables coffee teas juices etc. While the choices seemed a little limited I thought the food was tastyThe Main Stret River side of the hotel is a bit noisy. I recommend a room on the opposite side for a quieter room. I had a great price on this hotel.

The air conditioning did not workNo WIFI in bedroom. Or even the capacity to pay for wifi. There is absolutely no way this hotel would pass for anything more than 2 in the UK. The rooms are below the standard found in budget hotels eg. Premier Inn or Travelodge but the same price per night.

The hotel has a great locatioin. Nestled between the happening downtown and the Danube. The breakfast was wholesome and good. The best part was the price point at which the rooms were on offer. Some of the negative points are that the carpets were threadbare stained and neither the wifi nor the room safe worked. This was true for nearly all six rooms which we occupied.

We stayed for only 1 night. First of all when we arrived in the hotel we stored my friends medicine in the refrigerator. Then we left and spent the whole day out and came back in the hotel late at night. We checked the refrigerator and it was warm inside and the medicine which is very expensive and vital for my friends health was damaged. So disappointing. When we said it to the reception they told us they are sorry and that they will fix the problem for the next costumers but its does nt really matter to us. Apart from this the room was clean but very small and generally the whole decor of the hotel is kind of melancholic for me. Maybe is the colors black white and Grey that make it look like this. But the place where breakfast was served was really beautiful with great atmosphere and the waiter the big guy was very kind and helpful. However the quality of the breakfast its self was not that good and everything was exposed without a cover to protect them. There are clear caps for protection that should be use. Also I prefer the products to be packaged so I know the brand name of it the energy etc and the expiration date not for example just yogurt in a boul. How can I know the quality of the yogurt if I do nt know where you got it from. It happens with every single product in the breakfast and I did nt like it at all. Finally the Orange Juice was not like Orange Juice but it tasted more like Water with Orange Juice. Anyway it was just a bad experience from all aspects. The worst is that our medicine was damaged.
