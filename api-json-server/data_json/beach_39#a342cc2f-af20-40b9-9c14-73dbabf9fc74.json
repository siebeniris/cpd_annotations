We both very much enjoyed our stay at this Hotel particularly the swimming pool and indoor spa. The rooms are very large and spacious kept very clean by the cleaning staff.

We have just returned from a week at le Meridien I can not praise this hotel enough. We arrived at 5 am after a night flight and we had not booked to stay until the next day but the lovely night receptionist Silvia was so helpful she gave us a temporary room to get some sleep until our room was ready. We are gold Spg members so we enjoyed the club lounge daily and thus include breakfast daily in the lounge of in the main restaurant. Breakfast is amazing with fresh cooking station and such a great selection of fruit pastry cold meats usual cooked breakfasts pancakes etc etc and the chef is often walking around chatting to guests. All staff are so friendly and helpful. The club lounge also serves alcohol from 4 to 7 pm daily and a range of snacks which we often enjoyed and through the day you can get cold drinks or coffees plus relax to work etc. We stayed in room 127 a sea view exec room it was lovely with a great view of the church and bay. The roof top pool is on the smaller side would be my only slight negative but still plenty of room to sunbathe and swim. not sure how this would be in July or August though. The indoor pool and spa is heavenly and we swam there most evenings. We felt totally relaxed after a week here and I would highly recommend this hotel to all. We will visit again for sure.

Prior to our trip to Malta my husband and I spent weeks on Trip Advisor etc trying to make a decision on where to stay in or near Valletta. Although we have traveled extensively Malta was new to us. We are an active love to travel couple in our mid30s and wanted a room with a view accessibility to restaurants central location and nice amenities. After looking at places in the party areas of St Julians Pacevile more NE and also places closer to Valletta we settled for something in the middle Le Meridien at Baluta Bay. It was the PERFECT place for us to stay and we were so happy with our decision. A wonderful clean fully equipped hotel with wonderful customer service. We were fortunate to have Starwod Gold status so we could access the Executive Lounge which was a nice perk. it is in a great central location and we really enjoyed our experience at Le Meridien. the water view from our balcony room 939 was awesome.

The cleaning service was not that good. We found hair belonging to other guests and some dust on the floor. We have very high standards though. My main problem is with the internet policy.

We stayed at Le Meridian in August 2015 for five nights. Upon check in we were upgraded to a sea view room on the 8th floor. The room was large bathroom spacious separate bath and shower and had an iron rare for European hotels I find. The bed was comfortable and there was a balcony with a small sitting area. Rooms were cleaned promptly and there was a turn down service each evening as well as housekeeping who would check if we needed anything. The hotel whilst busy was large enough to still be quiet. In terms of location I think the hotel is spot on. Initially I was concerned because the walk to Sliema was further than initially thought but the hotel is pretty much in between Sliema and St Julians. To me this was convenient. There are lots of restaurants around the restaurant below the hotel I think it was called U Bistrot is fantastic and I highly recommend it a supermarket is a short walk as well as a self service laundromat. The bus to St Julians is below the hotel and to Sliema across the street and a short walk. All easy enough. Free and secure car parking is also provided. We did not visit any restaurants in the hotel but we did use the pools which were small but sufficient. You are on an island so go out and enjoy the beachesThe hotel staff were generally good. Some were a little slow but they got there eventually. However I would not recommend the travel agency on the ground level to book tours.

There was a spacious rooftop pool area with a wonderful view of Baluta Bay and a variety of quite terraced areas which we did not get to use as it was a bit chilly but no doubt lovely in the warmer weather to sit and chill. We did not get to use the Spa which looked just as inviting as the rest of the areas so can not comment on this. Our room was on a high floor r825 which had a spacious balcony and a good view of the bay which might not have been the case much lower down although can not be sure. Probably the only downside for us was that there did not seem to be any other English TV channels other than the news channel so the free wifi was good as we made use of our iPads instead but would have been nice to have had a choice of a English TV channels.

Our room was pleasant enough in design and layout but had no decorative wow factor unles you count the sea view which was stunning. The bathroom was well designed and included a corner bath. When we complained about a sewagey smell in our room we were moved immediately to another bedroom. The indoor swimming pool complex is beautiful it was a little cool to swim in the rooftop pool but that looked very attractive and the extensive gym was staffed very professionally. The only real complaint I have was regarding breakfast which in itself was a wonderful buffet affair. We usually had to wait a very very long time for coffee and really flag someone down for refills. This was more apparent if we were seated on the right hand side of the restaurant. Staff mostly ignored us from their station and tried not to catch our eyes it seems they resented having to refill their coffee pots from the far side of the restaurant.

Staff location and spa are the strengths of this hotel. The staff are all first rate from receptionists to cleaners. The location is really good overlooking Baluta Bay and with excellent transportation links right outside the door where you can catch local buses that will take you to the rest of the island at very reasonable prices and with breath taking efficiency and regularity so do not be tempted by any of the fancy tours on offer till you see for yourself. And I would not bother renting a car either as you had spend half your time trying to find somewhere to park it. The room I had overlooking the bay was well appointed and well cared for by daily housekeeping so top marks there. The Taro restaurant is good and I thought reasonably priced but with a limited menu so if you are staying for any length of time you might soon run out of options. The breakfast served in a different space Sciroco restaurant is a typical hotel breakfast with something to suit most cultures. Nothing to get excited about but nothing wrong with it either and some really good staff. Surprisingly this restaurant seems not to be used at other times which perhaps reflects the fact that there are loads of eating places all around. The spa offers well priced massages and other treatments that I would rate among the best I have had anywhere and the pool and associated facilities were surprisingly uncrowded during my stay. There is another rooftop pool which I did not sample as the water was too cold at the time and I suspect it never gets very warm even in mid summer. So what is not to like. Nothing about the hotel itself and I would go back but I would avoid a date when executives from the Starwod hotel chain might be visiting. This was the one downside of my stay at dinner in the Taro restaurant on April 12th 2018 a group of them had rather too much to say for themselves in a public space. The restaurant is neatly divided by curtains to create differently sized bays which means that tables on each side of the curtain can be quite close to each other. The aforementioned executives were just on the other side from me maybe a couple of metres away at most. And their noisy conversation told me all the reasons why I should actually be saying this is a bad hotel. does not make enough money. does not know whether it is a business hotel or a holidaymakers hotel. Needs to be rebranded because it does not attract the right sort of client me. And a whole lot of obviously confidential information naming names and hotels and cash flow and employees around the world. Unbelievably unprofessional behavior. and of course because they were a higher level of executive the restaurant staff sympathised with my concerns but obviously were not going to challenge them nor did I expect them to. If they worked for me I would fire the lot of them though they will know who they were and should be ashamed of themselves and the image they projected of their organization.", "offset": [1919, 2082], "date": "2018-04-20", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "2ecf3ba1-fe18-4fe6-ac33-7fbee8582591", "sentence": "Fantastic Hotel In a fantastic location.
