I have stayed at the Waterfront Hotel four times occupying rooms in three tier levels. city view balcony with harbor view and deluxe suite. The hotel is located in Jack London Square and a 5 minute walk from the Oakland Amtrak station. Restaurants abound nearby. it is a nautical themed hotel throughout and right on the harbor. The San Francisco ferry is on or nearly on the property. Valet parking is available. I strongly advise paying a little more to obtain a harbor view room with balcony. My room was spacious with every expected amenity plus two sinks and a wet bar. The view across the harbor to San Francisco is wonderful especially at sunset. The suites are worth every dollar and highly recommended. The only downside is that nearby train traffic can be disturbing to those occupying city view rooms. This is much less of an issue with those in the west facing rooms. Bus stops are across the street from the hotel free shuttle service on weekdays up and down Broadway and BART stations are within reasonable walking distance. Service is superb. I called the front desk to ask about a transportation issue I was asked where I wanted to go and within 5 minutes a gentleman appeared at my door with a map and BART schedule.

My husband and I wanted a central location for our midway point of our western vacation. We flew to Denver from Ohio rented a car and enjoyed a three day drive through the mountains and desert to Oakland to see his daughter. We wanted a beautiful comfortable centrally located hotel that was close to fine restaurants quick connections to wine country and of course to San Francisco. We were very pleased to know we were within a very short pleasant walk to the water shuttle to Pier 39 and Fishermans Warf. The location could not have been better. We even enjoyed looking at the shipping cranes that inspired George Lucas for the Star Wars movie 6The accommodations were very nice the bed was comfortable with nice smooth sheets and very clean duvet. There was an iron board hairdryer any forgotten soaps and lotions and generous towels. The pool was small but quiet with soothing saltwater. The lobby area provided refreshing lemonade water and newspapers. We arrived on a Sunday and we are greeted by friendly professional doorman who helped with our luggage and car. The counter staff also helped resolve a wifi issue that only affected my phone. We also enjoyed the shuttle service which allowed us to try a recommendation for breakfast that was about 4 miles from the hotel their complimentary limit. The room was always cleaned by 3 pm and was fresh and inviting. The decor had a modern nautical theme which was a delightful change from some of the more drab neutral colors used in other hotels. The only negative was our last 24 hours when the elevator stopped working. However there are only a few floors of stairs and we were not inconvenienced by this. It would have been problematic to someone with handicap issues. It started on Tuesday afternoon and had not been resolved by Wednesday am Also the breakfast location was slow unprofessional and not very helpful. The breakfast food was not good.

I booked a room through hotelscom and was really happy with the room. There are 2 buildings and we were in the building next to the one with the hotel lobby. The room was generous in size with 2 queen beds and a little balcony looking out onto the street. The room was very quiet. It was nicely appointed with a large desk dresser unit. Plus it had a round table with 2 comfortable chairs as well as an easy chair next to the balcony. It was really comfortable for us to read in and use our devices. The wifi was terrific. I wish all accommodations had wifi that was this good. There is a Keurig cofemaker in the room which I find to be so civilized. There were only 2 coffee pods for the morning so I requested more at the front desk. They were very accommodating and Housekeeping dropped off additional ones. One drawback is that parking is valet parking and costs 30 per day. A second drawback is that there is no breakfast included in the rate. There is a small cafe by the hotel restaurant that offers coffee and some breakfast fare which we did not try. Everything worked well for our stay here and we would definitely stay here again.

This hotel has a great location and a so so restaurant. But they totally lack integrity. I reserved a junior suite the ADA one through their website as I needed two rooms I was traveling with my 88 year old mother who has issues sleeping and the walk in shower was a bonus. The website listed a pull out couch in the sitting room. Perfect I thought. When we got there the room had no pull out couch and the \u201c sleek modern \u201d furniture they advertised was a nasty worn and stained orange burlapesque couch. I contacted the office and was told that the room was as advertised and they had no others. I requested a roll away bed a piece of sagging junk that certainly fit in with the nasty old furniture and took up most of the room. The following morning I check their website for the promised roll away couch. There it was right on the screen. So I called down again and said I had proof of the promise which I then went to show the desk. I was told \u201c I have to ask the manager \u201d. Three hours later after no word I went back down to the desk. Amazing the manager was passing so we grabbed him this is n\u2019t a big hotel she never looked for him. The manager was rude and of little help and I had to show the evidence to him. unbelievable. He even suggested that if I found a new hotel they would n\u2019t charge me for the rest of the stay. Right with an 88 year old woman when really his response should have been trusting my claims get to know what your website promises. followed by the first night free and a better room. I had to push for the room next door. Not a two room suite but with pull out bed. oh and updated furniture. So the real story about the Waterfront.

Location is great. It \u2019s in a very cute spot. Room was big and comfy. Front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful.

We asked the woman at the front desk to let us in the bathroom since we had just checked out and did n\u2019t have a key. She told us she could n\u2019t help us and we should go find a public restroom. I \u2019ve never had this experience before. We spent almost 400 to staff at this hotel for like 12 hours and the second we check out we \u2019re treated like a nuisance. Her attitude was so off putting and unbelievably rude.

When I walked into the restaurant which was virtually empty at about 530she looked at me with a harsh tone and said Can I help you. instead of something like One for dinner. or Can I seat you for dinner. It was very odd. I understand that working in this industry can be challenging as the public can be rather rude. However I am a friendly person. I smile when I enter into these spaces.

There was another awesome lady at the front desk with Alex that was just as funny and sweet but I forgot to get her name. CiCi at the bar was another wonderful employee.
