This was greatly appreciated as it made our stay much more comfortable. The desk staff door men housekeepers and other hotel staff were all very helpful during our stay.

It was also nice to have a television in the bedroom and living room. We enjoyed the rooftop as a nice place to sit and read during decent weather and enjoy a drink at night while we enjoyed the view of the Empire State Building Chrysler Building One World Trade Center and the East River. There are several great dining options all within a very short walk and several subway stations also very near to the hotel Grand Central Terminal is about 3 blocks away.

Nestled on Lexington Avenue between 37th 38th Street lies the Shelburne NYC a simple awning subtly identifies the hotel entrance where the doormen greet you with large smile and a hearty welcome. The modern yet warm lobby was staffed by several representatives of the Shelburne all of whom were only too happy to help with any query or request. The 25 day resort fee is a slight kick in the teeth. For this sum you are entitled to goods to the value of 10 each day from the Cupboard a small area next to reception where candy chips crisps water beer juice milk and Coke were available. This would have been useful had the stock been maintained most days the shelves were virtually empty apart from a few bottles of Samuel Adams and Brooklyn Beer at 6 a bottle and some MMs. If people are forced to pay a 25 daily charge then the Cupboard should be fully stocked at all times. Also included in this fee was a daily Wine hour where residents could meet in the Lobby for a few free glasses of wine. Local phone calls and in room wifi were also included. It is worth checking your bill on checking out as I had been charged for the few calls I had made from our room. Three elevators service the 16 floors of the Shelburne NYC and whilst the morning rush hour makes waiting for a ride slightly irksome most of the time the elevator arrives within seconds of summoning.

The roof bar is a great space however it is not a full bar. I asked for three different standard and one shot to discover that the bar did not stock those drinks. They serve no food or snacks other than popcorn which they were out of at 4 pm. and chips with guacamole. The staff elsewhere on property looked professional but the roof is another world. The male staff appeared to have no uniform at all while the female staff uniform was a blue tube dress two sizes too small.

I sent a photo of this to the hotel when I returned home as I discovered this the night before we left and reception was so busy the next morning that I did n\u2019t get a chance to ask for the Manager and complain about this incident. The response I received from the hotel to my email was that sometimes people use the toilet facilities to change before they return home. I am sorry but this was a black thong lying on the cubicle floor and unles it belonged to a blind person there is no way that any female would have missed picking this up. The toilets can be accessed by anyone from outside the hotel as you can come out of the public bar to use these facilities so as the heading to my review asks is this a hotel or a brothel.
