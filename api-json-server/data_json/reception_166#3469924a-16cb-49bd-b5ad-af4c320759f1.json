Our little family came for a weekend getaway to eat shop and see The Lion King. I can not say enough about how beautiful the property is and how helpful sincere and friendly the staff is. Arrival was easy. If you do not want valet parking there is a self park lot around the corner which is a little cheaper. The lobby was bustling with people coming and going and enjoying cocktails. It is bright and beautiful. Check in was a breeze. Our room was on the 9th floor and it was amazing. It was so spacious and well appointed. Marble everywhere crown moldings and incredibly high ceilings. But the bathroom. Double vanities glass enclosed shower separate water closet and the deepest soaking tub I have ever seen. Note for families double beds not queen sized. While the beds and linens were luxurious and comfortable they were small. The pool and gym are in the basement. You have to walk through the gym to get to the pool. There is a lot of quality equipment and nice touches like water cool towels and fresh fruit in the gym. The pool is on the smallish side but crystal clear and very nice. Hot tub was large and clean too. The man testing the water the morning we were there was very friendly and seemed genuinely pleased that we were enjoying ourselves. You could tell he took pride in his work. We used the concierge service to help us find the right spot for dinner and again for breakfast. His recommendations were good ones. I did not look too hard but did not see coffee in the lobby. Starbucks on every corner and one cup brewer in the room met that need. Location was good for theater State Street shopping Milineum Park and Willis Tower. Plenty of places to eat within walking distance. Decided to leave a day early due to frigid temperatures coming in. Front desk staff was helpful. There was some initial confusion about our early departure but the front desk manager followed up with me personally and promptly to straighten things out. Every staff member we encountered went out of their way to be friendly and helpful.

The JW is located in the loop area of downtown Chicago only about a block or 2 from Willis Tower. We arrived on a Friday afternoon to check in and this was the only glitch of the whole stay. I had reserved a room for 4 people 2 adults 2 children but they had us booked into a king room with no sofa bed. We were told there were rooms with 2 beds available but one would have to be made up and would take 30 45 minutes. We decided to wait in the beautiful lobby rather than store bags and it was a smart move we had barely sat down before cell phone rang to let us know room was ready maybe 5 minutes at most. So worked out well. The hotel is an old bank building and the character of the building has been well retained in the lobby. It is really quite impressive. Every staff member we dealt with was pleasant and polite. We were given a double room on the 4th floor overlooking the front of the hotel. The room was large with two beds work desk and chair easy chair safe large closet and a very big bathroom with a large glass enclosed shower. There was nothing about the room that could be faulted. The JW has an indoor pool which we did not use but it looked quite nice and is adjacent to the massive gym the largest I have seen in a hotel. The spa is also located in this area. We did not partake in any of the hotel dining options so can not comment on them. The location is very good with easy access to public transport and withing walking distance of south Michigan Avenue. It is a pretty good walk to the main part of Michigan Avenue but Uber is cheap. We arrived by Amtrak to Union Station which is about 3 blocks from the hotel easy walk and departed by plane from OHare and the CTA Blue Line station with direct service to the airport is 2 blocks from the hotel. Very convenient. There were plenty of eating spots near the hotel and several good fast food vendors for breakfast including a Starbucks right across the street. Overall an excellent hotel but can be expensive for food and drink. We had an excellent rate for the room so felt it was very good value.", "offset": [803, 860], "date": "2016-11-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "e59223c1-9fd5-4047-b6b8-89c39fa0b6cb", "sentence": "I love this hotel.

Very friendly staff great location We\u2019d been wanting to stay here for years we were so excited. We\u2019d chosen the JW specifically because it was a beautiful hotel and we \u2019d heard it was a great family hotel with an indoor pool. We booked 2 days to get out of the house swim relax as a family kids 7 4 who love swimingThe pool was in terrible condition. Walking into the room we were overcome with chlorine fumes. There were 4 other families in the pool and all their kids were coughing after going underwater. The pool deck was filthy with black mold in the grout and small puddles of black water sitting on the tile. I do n\u2019t know why we even tried going in it was poor judgement as parents. My eyes burned from the chlorine and our kids along with the other families in the pool were all coughing uncontrollably every time after submerging. The chemical levels must have been way off. We pulled the kids out after 5 minutes and gave them long showers to remove the chemicals. Incredibly disappointing for such an upscale hotel brand and otherwise beautiful facility. We told the front desk and they provided a small discount on our room. but we wouldn\u2019ve chosen another hotel had we know the pool was unusable as that was the entire point of our trip.", "offset": [1092, 1162], "date": "2019-02-21", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "0f5270d3-caba-47e3-a5d4-280bbf3b9aca", "sentence": "Not impressed.

I \u2019m a loyal Mariot and previously Starwod SPG member and try to stay in brand when possible. When my significant other and I had a single night trip to Chicago planned we decided to go a bit all out and stay in the JW downtown because hey why not right. It had great reviews and seemed like a fantastic luxury experience. We were completely let down. At check in we arrived a little early and after admitting we knew we would n\u2019t likely be able to check in early my oversight we simply asked if there was an estimated time frame of a potential room availability that way we could plan some sort of activity or lunch to kill some time. The rep at the front desk was condescending and frankly a little rude at that question and chided us for arriving before 4 and said they would notify us when a room was available no estimate given. We ventured off and a half hour later got a text message letting us know our room was available. Got back to the hotel and to say we were let down was an understatement. The room was fairly tiny which was fine expected for a city center hotel but it looked like it had n\u2019t had any work done to it in the last ten years. The alarm clock was covered in a thick layer of dust the desk looked like it had been through a war and the windows were completely frosted over. Don\u2019t get me wrong if it was facing an alley or something I would n\u2019t even mind that view but I felt like I was inside a fish tank or somebody \u2019s middle school science project. My girlfriend and I spent most of the afternoon jokingly trying to figure out if the light was fake and we were in a lab somewhere. Finally the nickel and diming for food \u2014 24 for breakfast. 5 for a pastry downstairs. Come on the rate for the night we stayed was 500. How about throwing us a bagel or something. Maybe even a coffee that does n\u2019t come from an inrom coffee maker that \u2019s probably never been cleanedThe two redeeming qualities the bed was comfy and the tub was really nice. But all in all I \u2019ve had comfy beds and nice tubs at 2 and 3 star Mariots that charge a third of the price in similar city locations so I \u2019m frustrated that a room that would cost so much would be so underwhelming. And at least those 2 and 3 star hotels had some semblance of complimentary breakfast. But I digress. I am a loyal Mariot member but this whole thing was just underwhelming from start to finish. Any other day it \u2019d be a 3 or 4 star review but given the price and prestige and guest services experience I ca n\u2019t give this stay more than 2 stars.", "offset": [675, 872], "date": "2019-05-20", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "8c111477-0b4b-4321-ba7a-c795847382b5", "sentence": "Chicago weekend.

The Gentleman who was working on Saturday at the Concierge was excellent. He was kind and so willing to help. It is more catered to the Convention type crowd as you can sense with the lack of personal attention in items that need attention. However for the room rates around 230 rate I feel it is a very fair deal. As stated online and NO fault of the staff the food from Breakfast to lunch should be skipped. We ordered the breakfast the quality of the gronola and pancakes was terrible not the cooks but the base quality of the food they order is not good so skip their food and go outside as others stated. I would grant it the level of Holiday Inn level but the staff was very kind. This probably has to do with the Prime Investors Group whom puts pressure on Mariot Mgmt to keep costs down. It is important to note they DO not vacumn the rooms nor replenish soaps etc if you stay more than two days. Our room was never vacumned nor soap replenished. Again I am sure Upper Mgmt has pressure to keep costs down. I would Never pay over 275 for this hotel but not the fault of the staff. I sense also the Upper Mgmt could be strong on their Staff from how I see them afraid to adjust to some policy hardness. I will say again it is a Convention type hotel so do not expect follow up on issues. Maybe loosening up on some Policies might help create a more pleasant environment. Having lived in a Hotel Residence I could easily put together a list of items to correct to make it more pleasant. The cost to do this renovation was nearly 400 million so much pressure on the Investors and Mgmt Company being Mariot. Overall beautiful place for the above price range but skip the food.
