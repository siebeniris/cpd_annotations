I had never been to Asheville and heard it was a great place so I decided to take a mini vacation solo. I chose the Aloft hotel because of it is prime location to great food and craft beer breweries. The hotel was great and full of energy. The staff was very friendly open spaces were inviting and relaxing and all that entered seemed to have fun. Not wild party fun. Adult relaxing I love life fun. The hotel works with a dog rescue outfit so there is always a pet in the lobby for you to play with or walk. They tell me 33 dogs have been adopted since it began last month. Most by hotel guests. Clean friendly prime location with a relaxing vibe.", "offset": [615, 666], "date": "2015-06-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a388c4ed-28cc-4687-975a-a9ffa679aa2c", "sentence": "it is the best salsa event every 2 sat ashvile has friendly atmosphere on the balcony and the lobby overlooking Biltmore Avenue.", "offset": [0, 128], "date": "2015-06-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "fb26d4e9-f17e-4c00-abda-b2be63347313", "sentence": "Fantastic Funky Excellent Customer Service Canines Welcomed. I travelled to Asheville for a weekend away and some fresh mountain air together with my very large dog and stayed at Aloft for 2 nights. It was our initial visit and everything from beginning to end was absolutely perfect. The greeting by the hotel staff was super friendly and helpful there were some very nice touches in our room. Bliss products for me and a godie bag for Kodi my Akita a dog bed more like a pillow for him but still and a food water dish. We were thoughtfully situated on the same floor as the hotel doggy walk convenient though we typically went for walks in and around the hotel. While the doggy run is nearby the pool it is quite separate and does not present any esthetic odour issues artificial turf and a hose with spray to clean up. The rooms are not large but are efficient and comfortable think European style. Contemporary very streamlined. The hotel is right downtown and there are many many things to see and do in the direct vicinity so it is extremely convenient. There is secure covered parking for a reasonable 7 day right under the hotel. The pool area is terrific private cabanas rooms along the perimeter and a good amount of seating. Asheville is a very dog friendly place and there were lots of venues to choose from where Kodi and I were welcomed to sit and have a drink or a bite to eat. As we were both enjoying Aloft so much we would go out for an early morning walk in the surrounding neighbourhoods do not forget to stoop and scoop people and then return for a coffee at. Alofts ReFuel coffee bar with a fresh pastry. Sitting in the reception area with the doors wide open onto the terrace offering a refreshing breeze was extremely inviting in the mornings. in the evenings we opted to sit out on the terrace at the WXYZ bar restaurant and watch the sights and sounds lower down at street level. The bar area is quite lively in the evenings without being too loud and not at all rowdy. There was a band on Saturday evening which really added to the atmosphere and enjoyment index. The food was quite good and nicely presented and prices were very reasonable. The first night I had the steak and frites alas they were out of the shrimp that is typically served together so just provided me with additional steak and the second night I had a salad and some wings should have had one or the other as the portions were generous. The staff at Aloft are simply fantastic kudos to Emily Thomas Simona Caitlyn Tomy Kodi loved the treats you gave him and Ericka to name a few. There were some guests with dogs in tow like me during my stay and my experience was pleasurable in that all canines were very well behaved and accustomed to traveling. Net net no issues with the mix of dogs and people. It really was a fabulous weekend and we will definitely be back.

No matter how many times we stay at Aloft in downtown I always get excited because of the atmosphere in this part of town. it is blocks away from the Orange Peel and within easy walking distance of the US Cellular Arena as well as myriad restaurants breweries and bars. it is easily the best located of the downtown boutique hotels and less expensive than some of the others. The XYZ Bar area is chic and inviting and the enclosed parking garage is a plus. Rooms are typical boutique style slightly on the small side even for boutique but ample for a night or two. There was a discernable difference in the amount of late night noise we heard here compared to Indigo and elsewhere. however that is more due to the neighborhood where everyone is up late and enjoying la dolce vita. Definitely a younger and more lively crowd than you might see at the Windsor or Grand Bohemian. The only thing Aloft lacks is the lack of a generous breakfast like Indigo but the convenience of location is a better asset when it comes to Asheville where you can walk 5 mile in any direction and land in a delightful eatery.
