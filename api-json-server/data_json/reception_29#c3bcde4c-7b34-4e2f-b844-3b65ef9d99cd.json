Hotel was old. Rooms were small and very hot. No air conditioning. The only way to regulate the temperature at all was to open a window some. The temperature outside was in the 40s F yet even sleeping or trying to sleep on top of the cover was difficult at best. I was totally exhausted the entire stay due to lack of sleep. The room was clean except the carpet was stained. The staff was nice and the breakfast buffet served to our Trafalgar tour was good. There was free wifi but it was pretty much useless. It was enough to sync my Fitbit but I could get or send e mail or get on the Internet.

Stayed for 3 night as part of a Trafalgar tour. Arrived before 10 am and got a room right away. Nice surprise. The reception staff was very helpful but they were almost always busy. Room was nice and clean. Bath towels were crisp. Bathtub was deep. There was a full size mirror. Hotel is on a canal in a nice quite neighborhood. Walk to museum quarter took 20 minutes. Soap and shampoo made in Germany was nice. Appreciated the complementary bottled water made in Italy. Wifi in room was weak. Breakfast was plentiful. Enjoyed the little pancakes sausages bacon fruits passion fruits water melon juice yogurt. Hotel got a nice restaurant on the canal. There are quite a few restaurants and a Albert Heijn supermarket in the De Pijp area which is 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel also offers airport shuttle service.

The hotel lobby was very beautiful as was the lobby bar and restaurant. When you got to the rooms they were a bit tired and dated. We were with a tour group and would have been nice to let the hotel showcase the city and offer canal view rooms to us instead of all the flight crews staying at the hotel. Instead we all were offered views of the main driveway. Beds were very comfortable but air conditioning was on the light side considering it was warm when you were looking to cool off.
