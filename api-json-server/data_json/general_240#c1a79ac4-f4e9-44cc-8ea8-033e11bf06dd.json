We arrived at the Caribe Hilton on a Saturday and it was the busiest day of our stay. The pool pool bar and beach were very crowded and loud. I can understand the noise of people having a good time but the music was blaring over the sound of the people. It was so loud that we could not carry on a conversation and had to leave to find a quieter place on the other side of the Hilton. The pool bar area quieted down during the next few days and we did get to enjoy it. The pools beach and hammock palm tree grove are all beautiful. Drinks seemed to be expensive. We found the beach staff to be very helpful. Our room was in the tower and we were thrilled when we saw the view from our 8th floor room ocean waves beach palm trees winding paths etc. We heard a roaring noise when we opened the sliding glass door and thought AH. How nice we could fall asleep to the sound of the waves. Then we noticed that the sound was constant not at all like the sound of the ocean. It turned out that the sound was from the generators down below. We had to keep our sliding door closed to block out the sound. So disappointing. The room was nice the shower was excellent and the housekeeping did a great job. The hotel was very accommodating about storing our baggage until it was time to leave for our flight. They also have a computer stand in the lobby where you can look up and print your boarding passes. We went to several of the restaurants on site and they were a disappointment. Generally the restaurant prices were high and we did not feel the quality was worth the price. On our first morning there we had breakfast at the Palmeras and our food was cold did not go back there again. We did enjoy the Pina Colada Club prices were good food simple tasty and if you needed quiet you could sit outside or in their back room. The staff was friendly and did everything they could to please. Only drawback was sitting outside when the generator fired up and the air was filled with black oily smelling clouds. We traveled into Old San Juan by taxi and enjoyed the fort the shopping and delicious food. Try El Convento for it is old world atmosphere and good food. The shopkeepers were very helpful when we asked for recommendations for places to eat. Taxis to Old San Juan were reasonable and are right there at the hotel or at a taxi stand in the city.

My wife and I spent a week at the Caribe last week. We were there on vacation with another couple. We found the location outstanding. Easy access to Old San Juan and The Condado. The beach and pool area was fantastic. The pool was multilayered with a great swim up bar. The beach was a quiet lagoon easy to swim in. There were many great areas to sit and sun including a hammock grove. For the most part we only ate breakfast at the hotel which was very good at all locations including Starbucks as we had Hilton honors breakfast vouchers. One day had a nice lunch at the Pina Colada club. Now to why this hotel does not get five stars. 1. Aging roms our room which had a great view was worn and clearly could use a face lift. Also we had a problem with a leak in the sink that took multiple calls to get fixed. Which brings me to the second problem. 2. Inconsistent service service from the staff ranged from mediocre to outstanding. We had many instances of this variability. But let me mention those who stood out. Gabriel the night check in manager helped get us our room with a view after the check in person was useless. Eliot at the concierge desk came through time and time again including great seats to a baseball game. Juan who makes the omelets at breakfast was always kind friendly and efficient and went out of his way to give my wife a birthday surprise. Roberto the bar tender at the swim up bar besides making great drinks he went into to hotel to get us tourist information he thought could help us All the car valets were fast friendly and helpful Finally the pool area manager walked me over to the best working hot tub when I needed a good hot soak and then made sure I had fresh towels. Despite the problems based on location and the beach and pool area I would stay at the Caribe Hilton again.

We just spent 5 nights in virtual bliss at the Caribe Hilton. This was in large part due to the wonderful Jorge and Glenda in reservations for finding the perfect room for our needs. This was the second year in a row we have been to this hotel and while I tend to try new things instead of returning places my son and I have decided that as long as we can have that room we will be back every year. I would like to thank our lovely and elegant housekeeper Dolores for keeping our room spotless and always being there to help us when we needed it. She has a kindness intelligence and refinement that made us always feel well taken care of. When my son locked us out of part of our suite Dolores helped us. When I got a severe sun burn Dolores found medication for me which she insisted on giving me. I would walk down the hall and catch sight of her changing someones sheets in such a loving way. You could tell that no matter what she is doing she does it with love and with her best. As I got to know her I felt like she was being underutilized. she is intelligent and astute and I think that the clientele at this hotel would appreciate those qualities and find them helpful in a more upper level capacity. One of my favorite things about this hotel is the guests. Both times that we have been there were wonderful children for my son to play with and equally wonderful parents for me to chat with. The hotel seems to attract a certain clientele who make the whole experience more fun and comfortable. What also helps with that feeling is the security that is selected. They are all intelligent bilingual and very personable. Xaviar in particular was very helpful and gracious when we got locked out. One gets the sense that they are familiar with the guests and are keeping the property secure. If I were to offer one suggestion it would be to hire staff who are friendlier and warmer. The front desk staff tends to be pretty stiff and professional. One of several experiences When I first got my burn I went to the desk and asked one of the supervisors for ibuprofen. Her response was to go to the hotel store and purchase it rather than perhaps a more compassionate and personal response that I received from the warm and friendly Hasada sp at the towel stand. Many of the waiters at breakfast at Palmeras seem stressed and unhappy except for Victor who always has a warm and relaxed smile and beunas dias to give the guests. I was so sad that Roberto in Palmeros was on vacation while we were there. We were so looking forward to seeing him. But we were blessed with the charismatic and conscientious Luis who obviously cares deeply about the quality of his work and keeping the guests happy not a trait I see very often. Finally I so appreciated when I called downstairs to Martin on our last day. I had already been informed that there would be no late checkouts. However a half hour before we were supposed to leave the medicine on my burned back still had not dried. Panicked I called down and asked Martin if we could please have a half hour more to help it dry. He said Please take an hour and if there is anything else we can do to help you please let us know. That meant so much to me.

While official Caribe Hilton promotional material will be quick to point out that it is the birth place of the Pi\u00f1a Colada and the celebrities they have hosted mostly in the 60s and 70s it is clear that this property is past it is heyday and is trying to hold on to the past. The lobby is gorgeous and uniquely designed having an open air design straight into the parking area and a bar. However this proved troublesome for our check in as there was loud live music being played next to the lobby which led to both myself and the check in attendant having to yell at each other. There are only 2 elevators in the main building which leads to very long waits for the elevator during peak times. We actually had to wait for 4 elevators passing through our floor before there was enough room for us to get in in the mornings. The bedroom was alright. You can tell reservations probably took place within the last couple of decades but it was still sub par for a 4 star property. Its age still comes through. We also experienced a hot water shortage as it was warm at best. The pools are nice and there is a nice bar by the pool with a swim up area. The beach was a bit lackluster with not a lot of sand area and it got very crowded throughout our stay. we are not sure if the hotel was full or if simply locals came to take advantage of the amenities as pretty much anyone can come through the property without being checked. With exorbitant resort and parking fees around 40 and 20 respectively daily and local taxes you are looking at a much higher daily rate than posted so beware of that. At the current daily rates and the state of the property I do feel that it is a bit overpriced. The hotel is close to the airport which is pretty convenient and does offer a beach front area which are pluses to be sure however the area around the hotel leaves much to be desired. The adjacent hotel building looks to have been abandoned for several years and is an eye sore as it can be seen while at the pools and beach area. I also had an issue with my room key not working on my last day due to combining reservations. I was told at check in that it would not be a problem but apparently it was and unfortunately it happened right when the lobby was at a very hectic time of day there were several conventions going on. and it took me a good 20 30 minutes to get a replacement key card. All in all I was disappointed in my stay. Service was mediocre and the property needs a little more TLC especially the rooms. Diamond members get a very basic free continental breakfast and a discount for full breakfast. This was very disappointing as most other locations offer full free breakfast for my loyalty.

Family friendly. Hi my wife and I chose to stay at the Caribe after learning of the protests at the El San Juan Resort. This was a great choice on our end and we were not disappointed. We received a free upgrade to the hilton honors tower that included an ocean view. We also were able to check in a few hours early which is always. The facility is quite large with several restaurants onsite. We knew ahead of hand to try and eat outside of the resort as the prices are very high within the Caribe. On our last night we did eat at the Brazilian Steakhouse on the other side of the Caribe and this was A for only 499 per person. The pool is quite large and the swim up bar is absolutely amazing. It does get busy with only three people working during peak hours 130pm50pm. but they do an amazing job and are working as fast as they can. Do be patient with them. They are also friendly. I recommend getting the shaker if you are ordering more than one drink at a time. 250 of the first one 3 4 drinks in a shaker. whereas two drinks would cost 230. The refill on a shaker is 170. The caribar onsite is an establishment to watch the game and hang out at night. Again it costs more because it is at the resort but that should be expected. For transportation Uber was our best friend. We literally saved over 100 using this instead of the taxi feature. The only way to get out of the airport is with taxi 24 to caribe from airport and that same ride back to the airport was 80 with Uber. We also made friends with an Uber driver and he took us to the rain forest one morning. There is no cell service so taxi and uber are normally out of the question. Just line it up ahead of time and agree on a price and for what time you want the uber to come back and you will not be disappointed. We did not bring our children but this place was definitely family friendly. Saw tons of kids enjoying the pool and other amenities and it never turned into a party so it was enjoyable for the adults and kids. The housekeeping was great. We would leave mid morning and come back usually by 30pm and room was always cleaned and looked nice. I really do not have anything bad to say about this place. Our anniversary was perfect.

We ate most of our meals there as the Hilton \u2019s options looked sorely lacking. Uber can drop you off at the front door but they can only pick you up on the edge of the property which to be fair is only a 3minute covered walk from the front door. But the Uber drivers claim the Caribe is the only hotel with this restriction. The pool area is reasonably attractive it is on the ocean but could use a significant remodel as the tile is worn out and dirty looking although it probably is n\u2019t dirty per se. The 2 hot tubs are very small maybe 5 \u2019 x 8 \u2019 and did n\u2019t get very warm. As a Hilton Honors diamond member I \u2019m used to an included breakfast and simple courtesies.

She said a few people had called about that but it was not the responsibility of the hotel to call my bank. I was staring at both charges on my screen as I spoke to her. If it is happen to several customers do not you think it might be the problem of the hotel. I did follow up with my credit card this morning and they confirmed that I was indeed billed twice. They opened the dispute to fix the problem a problem that the Hilton created but did not try to fix. My intent of the call was not complain but rather to work out my bill. I just wanted to be done with the entire stay at that horrible hotel. Instead of apologizing for all of the myriad mistakes she just kept telling me she would not help me and to call my bank.", "offset": [173, 315], "date": "2020-03-15", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
