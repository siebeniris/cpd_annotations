I was on the 9th floor and the suite I was in was LOVELY. When booking you might want to call instead of booking on line. The rate for the suite was listed on line and still is at 45810 a night but I actually ended paying quite a bit more per night. I enjoyed it anyway and will be coming back. Friendly staff nice restaurants in the hotel and nearby. Housekeeping was very thorough but forgot to restock the fridge a couple of times for the money I ended up paying I would have liked to see housekeeping clean room earlier and restock the beverage fridge daily.

The hotel is in a good location. The Metro is a short walk from the hotel. The staff was exceptionally nice. The downside for me was the room. My wife and I were unable to get a room with a king sized bed. The room had 2 double beds which were not overly comfortable. I do not know if a king size bed would have been better. Also the bathroom is a bit odd. The sink area is not closed off from the rest of the room which can be annoying if one is sleeping in the bed adjacent to this area.

We got stuck for two extra days waiting for the airport to open. This hotel said that the guests who were stuck had priority on the rooms and the room price did not go up. They had an opportunity to stick it to the guests and they graciously did not. As far as I am concerned they have a customer for life when i come to the DC area.

The room itself was fantastic and I could tell the attention given to the small details. My room had a beautiful view overlooking Dupont Circle. I was on the top floor in a one bedroom suite. There was a wall of windows with high ceilings and large sliding doors in both the main room and the bedroom. The weather was great for Jan 60 degrees. so I was able to enjoy the large and spacious patio. I made great use of the overhead heater provided on the patio a very unexpected and well appreciated amenity. The bathroom was amazing. heated floors. heated towel rack. large shower area with multiple shower heads. The bathroom is stocked with an array of toiletries and supplies not found in many hotels and they are good size too. If you forgot anything it will be there for you. The bedroom and bedding were soft and comfortable. and the room was quiet. You would never know you are right above the busiest circle in DC. The room went from bright and open to various shades of dark and subtle. The lighting options are numerous and the curtains allow for complete blackout while you sleep. The electronics allowed me to play music with ease. I would have been satisfied with all of the above but The Dupont went above and beyond with its attention to little details. The mini bar was well stocked AND unlike similar hotels all non alcoholic drinks were included in cost of room. There was an espresso machine and a wide array of waters juices and sodas. The staff replenished the fridge often. The turndown service was on point. slippers robes chocolate all presented in excellence. On New Years Eve our room was given a nice bottle of champagne to celebrate on the balcony. The staff was ready and willing to answer any questions. They directed me to great spots around the Dupont Circle area. The Do Not Disturb button by the bed allowed me to dictate when the room was cleaned. The housekeeping staff does an amazing job. I do n\u2019t know how they do it all because they are quiet and efficient. The hotel lobby was open and inviting. It provided a great spot to read paper have a coffee and people watch. The workout facility had everything I needed right there to achieve a great workout so if you travel light. no worries the gym has it all.
