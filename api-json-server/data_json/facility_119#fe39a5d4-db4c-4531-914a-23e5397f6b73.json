Wow I must say had I reviewed the negative reviews I would not have booked this hotel. Okay I get it. it needs an update. they are going to get that update as there were signs displayed that there is going to be a very big update in the near future. There is plenty of free parking. So some areas are a bit run down but our executive room was not bad at all. The bathroom was clean and the water pressure was excellent. I had no plumbing problems during my Monday Friday stay. The bed was very comfortable with very squishy pillows. I did not see one bug while staying in this hotel and trust me I looked. I looked around the toilet and shower drain no bugs and I even stripped the bed linens and lifted the mattress to look at the box spring. ALL CLEAN. NO BUGS. I actually do this in every hotel I stay in do not think this NYC girl did it because she was in the South. All hotels have a risk of roaches and bed bugs and thankfully I experienced neither here. I adjusted the room temperature as I saw fit. This hotel is in East Memphis so you really need to rent a car while you are here. There is a very convenient strip mall a 5 minute drive away a plus since you can not really purchase toiletries OTC pharmaceuticals etc. there is a Capital Grille located next to the mall salty food but good. Anyway we happily drove to all major sites The Civil Rights Museum Graceland Riverboat Cruise Beale Street the Stax Museum of Soul Sun Studios etc. We arrived at all locations within 15 25 minutes. Guess what. There was NO TRAFFIC. We breezed right along and had a blast admiring the scenery. The highway roads are a brown color not like the tarry black I am used to. I love my NYC but the traffic can be a nightmare. I did not experience that in Memphis. So back to the hotel. Is it in the heart of Downtown Memphis. No. But it was clean and quiet some reviewers talked about street noise please. those sounded like crickets compared to the noise in NYC. The elevators were a tad slow but they were fine. Our best review is saved for the hotel staff. What charming kind wonderful people. Everyone greeted us warmly with a smile. They answered any questions we had and gave us good suggestions of places to go. Everyone who manned the front desk was courteous polite and very professional. We had breakfast vouchers the food is decent with nice options which we used almost daily we slept in one morning. Every morning we were greeted by the lovely Pat. She was attentive and very accommodating always ensuring her visiting NYers always got a delicious pot of hot coffee first thing. When we told her we were leaving the next day she came over to us and embraced us telling us that one day she had like to see New York City.
