First let me say that the island of Curacao is ugly by my standards and getting around is somewhat difficult since they do not have many road signs map systems highway names etc. However if we had not stayed at the Renaissance I would have been angry about this trip. The Renaissance team saved the day. People are so nice helpful accommodating and easy it was a bonus. If you are not the adventuresome and determined to explore the island you will be in heaven. Food is great go to Exquisite. On vacation my habit is to not go to the same place twice. But this restaurant was so great I ate there three nights in a row. Yep it was that great. In my 64 years it was the best steak I had ever eaten. Starbucks right on site and included in the inclusive price. The little infinity beach was nice but not big. The restaurant helps you to go where you want to go. do not bother going to the Curacao Liquor Factory. Prices are better elsewhere and it took us 3 hours to find it in the city. Another thing the people do not seem to know where things are. You could ask people within ten feet of each other directions and what they gave you would be different. Shopping is nice as well. But again the island is just not pretty. If you are thinking tropical beauty NO. Nothing but scrub trees and bushes. My only complaint with the Renaissance is that I upgraded and paid for a room with an ocean view and all we could see was one of the true trees on the grounds. That was not worth the 200 extra. Ask to see the view before you upgrade. Rooms and furnishings are nice. Try to get on the 2nd floor as that is where everything is happening but away from the smoke filled casino. I agree with one contributor in that the hot water needs to looked at to make the stars go up on the property. Morning showers before 100 or after 100 PM is a no go. The garage access for cars is a bit of a challenge because it is across the street and first come first served. The hotel shares this space and it can fill up at peak times. Used the dive shop at Casa Abao and found that Raul was wonderful patient and very knowledgeable. And it was free went to Porto Mari and was not happy because they nickel and dime you to death.

Coming to Starbucks and the beach bar were also great opportunities to visit the hotel facilities which were fantastic ways to promote the place among locals who usually recommend to friends and family. I recommended this hotel to many of my friends and family who have visited Curacao but I now feel that policies like this are a deterrent to their prestige and the chains reputation around the world. To people who visit the island I tell you that there are more hotels to choose from and these do not have discriminatory policies that should be a shame for a touristic island such as Curacao.

This is a hard review to write. I am a loyal Mariot family customer. I have Platinum elite status a few stays away from Lifetime Platinum which means I have nearly 750 cumulative nights. I feel obligated to share my good and bad experiences. The good. Friendly helpful and competent front desk and doormen. The concierge aka navigator was exceptional. I had a minor medical issue that needed attention she walked me to the doctor \u2019s office and then to the pharmacy to pick up meds all the while she shared her love for Curacao and its culture. This was totally unexpected and greatly appreciated. Travelling alone I felt well looked after and cared for by the entire staff. I was upgraded to a huge suite the bathroom alone was larger than some hotel rooms and also provided a continental breakfast comp for Platinum members. The restaurant buffet dinners were better than much of the local dining and although expensive about US 40 a good value there were usually a few amazing dishes goat stew oxtail soup and some misses and this is about what I paid for several evening meals out anyway. Important for me the opportunity to get a large salad and a balanced meal which was something generally not available elsewhere. The coffee was well above average for Renaissance Mariot recently the coffee at some other locations has been undrinkable. The location is ideal. It is out of the hustle and bustle of the city center but a short walk away. It is also much closer to the center than some of the other outlying hotels and resorts. The \u201c marginal\u201dThe dining room staff was sometimes cavalier about providing proper service. While many of the servers knew me by name at the end of my week \u2019s stay others pretty much ignored me and just chatted among themselves. One morning when there were more servers than customers my request for a second cup of coffee went unheeded for over 10 minutes and I just left because of a time constraint. The Wi Fi was great when it worked. It was sometimes problematic to connect with and was not functional for several hours on a couple of days. I used my own service provider instead but it was an additional cost that seemed unnecessary. The travel desk while very helpful and generous with time and advice had a limited number of tours available. For what I wanted to do they suggested I rent a car. I ended up booking a tour on my own check out my other TripAdvisor reviews for suggestions. The shower while luxurious with multiple showerheads was challenging to adjust to a comfortable water temperature see other comment about shower below. I \u2019m not sure what the problem was perhaps a defective valve. The bad Several items were non functional though I did n\u2019t plan on using them anyway in my room. The safe did n\u2019t work the Jacuzi in an otherwise lovely tub was n\u2019t functional and one of two televisions was n\u2019t fully functional. There was black mold in the shower though otherwise the room was very clean. The business center charged for computer access except for printing boarding passes. I \u2019ve never run into anything like this. The elevators were problematic as the other reviews here attest. While I understand that it is challenging to get parts to a semi remote island like Curacao. the length of time this has been appearing in comments suggests there is a problem more than just a mechanical one. This was n\u2019t a major issue as the hotel only has four floors and I did benefit from the exercise climbing the stairs. There was no emergency plan on my room door or any indication of emergency exits. Granted there were signs indicating a direction for an exit or for stairs this is not really an international safety standard or something appropriate for a Mariot chain hotel. One of the servers who only provided a couple of glasses of water at a buffet meal solicited a Trip Advisor review by providing a card with her name on it. I thought this was very tacky. Hence my very thorough review. The toilets continued to run after the maids cleaned the room on several occasions it took a simple jiggle on the older style toilets to remedy the situationI did not contact management about any of these issues during my stay but I am confident that if I did they would have been addressed. However these and other similar problems suggest a systemic problem at some level of management. Overall I did enjoy my stay in spite of some shortcomings. I \u2019m not sure of the source of the issues as I \u2019ve stayed on smaller and more remote islands and locations without these issues. My comments are provided to adjust expectations of potential guests who might have pre conceived ideas about what a Renaissance Resort might be or rely on what to me seems like some overly generous reviews without reading details. Had this been a Holiday Inn or some other mid range chain I would have felt my expectations were fully met.
