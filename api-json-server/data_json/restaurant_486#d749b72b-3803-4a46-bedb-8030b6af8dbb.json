We secured rooms here for my daughters wedding. One of the rooms was used for the bridal party and bride to have hair and make up done get dressed and prepare to go to the church five miles away. The rooms were spacious and easily accommodated the extreme hub of activity. There is a separate living room space that had two good size couches an extra side chair desk and cafe table island with additional seating in addition to the small kitchen area. The bedrooms also had a vanity table with a huge mirror that was perfect for hair and makeup and also were spacious enough to accommodate lots of people walking in and out. The hotel also has a very nice atrium which we used for some pre ceremony photographs for the bridesmaids and bride. The photographer had a lot of shots to chose from there is a nice wrought iron 2story gazebo like structure gaslamps among foliage and two ponds surrounded by nice greenery and stone walls. There is a nice breakfast buffet that offers a full meal and made to order eggs and french toast that really makes this hotel a fabulous value especially as compared to other hotels in the area. A few of the other reviews talk about the staff and I agree completely. While this hotel has amenities and space that is not offered by other hotels the staff always makes or breaks the experience. The staff here is excellent. Lastly if you have a wedding in the area and are looking for a hotel for your out of town guests I would highly recommend looking into this facility. The rate was very reasonable and our guests were impressed and happy with our selection. The front desk also is happy to accommodate welcome bags if you chose to provide those to your guests. The only small disadvantage is the person handling the room block contracts check carefully for errors but it is a small issue compared to the final result.

It was dangerous and we nearly injured ourselves. The next day they provided a shower mat which did help a little but it should have been in the room all along. The paint plaster above the tub was peeling and some of it came down on my wife while she was taking a bath. So much for re modelling. The room they gave us was a family room. It had one king bed one queen bed and one queen pullout couch. Normally a hotel would have had a dresser with a half dozen drawers. This room which we were told was typical had only ONE DRAWER in the entire suite. The bed was far too soft for our tastes.

First off this hotel is quite a long way from Chicago city but it does have an excellent rail service cheap too. Second point this hotel is catering for both business and leisure travelers although I would personally question why you would holiday here as there is nothing in the immediate area that would occupy you for more than 30 minutes. On the plus side the hotel is quiet unles you are in the rooms immediately above the reception area where there is a bar and pool table often used to late in the evening. I will say that check in was efficient and the delightful African American front of house receptionist was awesome. I think her name is Katrina I may be wrong. but she was middle aged like me and a true delight to interact with. Engaging personable and nothing was too much trouble if only all front of house staff could be like this. Rooms are practical and comfortable but were a little on the dark side for my personal liking poor lighting over anything else. They are basic and you need to be prepared for this. If you are inclined to take a wine or two in your room you will need to go find a glass. It is a small point but an irritating one.

There was a microwave oven in the room and fridge but no crockery or cutlery I had to ask the cafe staff to borrow some cutleryLok this place is basic no frills but the people working there are trying hard to make it pleasant.
