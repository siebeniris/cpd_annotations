This property was once the diamond of Miami but that is sadly not the truth anymore. The staff is overall friendly but if the management of the property allow the hotel itself to be rundown then what can even the best of staff do. The hotel is worn plain and simple. The rooms have a dingy smell the floors are not polished the towels are bare thread that is if you can even get towels. Have stayed many times in the past but this was just the worst of it. The Easter Passover break brings with it throngs of people but a premier hotel should be prepared. To be told that I have to be at the pool by 730 am to get the two chairs I am allotted even though the room is slotted for 4 people and that if I get up for more than an hour or so because maybe I want to grab lunch. I should not be surprised to return to find my chairs cleared with other people sitting in them. The towels they put out on the chairs are worn so thin not to mention many of them are stained. The bar in the main lobby stays open till all hours but the only cute coffee ice cream bar dessert place closes early leaving guests no place to be unles your want to buy very expensive drinks. The four elevators are always packed and with the two services elevators out with no apparent plan to fix them and nothing being done to help the guests out who had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator it was a mess. The property is well located and if the ownership would put something back in to fix the place up I am sure it could rise to its former glory. Very disappointed at having paid so much for so little. I would also like to ask why do the ladies who work at the pool have to be in bathing suites all day in the hot blustery sun while the men are in comfortable sun protective collared ts and shorts.

This is my 6th year celebrating my July 10 Birthday at Fontainebleau. each year the experience gets better and better and the resort feels more and more like home. You might get tired of me gushing about how much I love Fontainebleau but you have a very happy guest for life. If there were a rating above 5 I would certainly give it. exceptional beyond words. We arrived on a very early flight from Hartford CT and go to the hotel before 10am to our delight our suite was ready and we were able to check in and get settled in our room and still get to the pool and La Cote for lunch. The Tresor one bedroom suite is a vacationers paradise. comfort great amenities washer dryer 2 bathrooms kitchen and a breathtaking view from every window and balcony. If there was one thing I could say that might need attention is the internet speed in our room \u2026 it was very slow on both the in room MAC and on our mobile devices which was slightly frustrating as I did have to do a minimal amount of work and I even got booted off Safari on the MAC several times. Other than that slight inconvenience the suite could not have been more wonderfulWe had lunch at Vida twice during our stay when we wanted a short break from the sun. Our food was great and the service even better. On one visit we had asked for grilled corn on our 3 Chicken Cob salads. our waiter came by a while later and apologized for the delay in our order. they had no grilled corn available and WERE GRILLING SOME especially for us. Where else would you get service like that. Only at FontainebleauWe have ALWAYS loved dining at La Cote for lunch although in past years I was disappointed by the slow service and having to wait quite awhile to even be acknowledged and I stated as much in my in my review. well someone listened. The experience this year at La Cote was like a 360 degree turnaround. The staff was beyond attentive so courteous and really worked together as a strong team. At our first lunch on our day of arrival Alex was our server and he was just incredible. He was attentive but not hovering accommodating as could be and we loved his easy demeanor and friendly smile. On our subsequent visits and there were several. although Alex was not our server he always came by our table to greet us and offer his help with anything we needed even though he was not serving our table. He is a prime example of exemplary service and team spirit. I also want to mention Laz another exceptional server friendly efficient accommodating beyond words and also greeted us and offered assistance even when he was not our server. On our last day we had a female server and I regrettably do not remember her name and because we relocated to a table under the shelter of the bar because of a sudden and torrential rain storm I did not even remember to get my receipt at the end of the meal. However like the other servers we experienced this year she was excellent. so accommodating to our switching tables and a real trooper taking great care of us during the downpour. All in all I was so thrilled to see such a major improvement in the efficiency and attentiveness of the entire team at La Cote. it made a great dining experience so much more enjoyableWe were anxious to try Pizza and Burger which opened since our last visit in August 2016. We went for lunch and loved everything about it. We always enjoyed Michael Mina 74 but Pizza and Burger was even better. Two of used enjoyed the build your own salad option and the third had an awesome burger. Our server was great as was the support staff. we will definitely go backWe love stopping at Chez Bon Bon for fresh squeezed orange juice and yogurt parfaits for breakfast and little treats and of course gelato during our stayWe ordered lunch polside one day and it was great. I noticed that the speed at which the food was delivered was MUCH IMPROVED from years past. If there were 2 things I could change FRESH would open earlier in the morning and they would serve the EXACT SAME fresh squeezed orange juice as Chez Bon Bon. it is definitely different not fresh and pulpy but watery and always served with ice almost like it is made from concentrate and not freshly squeezed. Otherwise it is a great little spot. My FAVORITE of all Fontainebleau restaurants is Scarpeta. I used to have my birthday dinner there now for the last couple of years we decided to have the last dinner of our vacation there instead. it is relaxing not to have to leave the resort and we a guaranteed an exceptional meal every time. The polenta appetizer and the signature spaghetti did not disappoint it NEVER. does. the one disappointment this year was the removal of the zepoles from the dessert menu. In fact for dessert lovers that we are we actually skipped dessert this year there was nothing appealing to us on the menu. When we mentioned this to our server she informed us that there is a new pastry chef and she decided to get rid of the zepoles. Change is good I Agree but when taking away a standard and favorite dessert while it might not be a Scarpeta Signature it should be replaced with something equally as decadent for me no chocolate no dessert and there was no chocolate to be had on the dessert menu that was not mixed or embellished with fancy fruit purees etc. I am a chocolate dessert purist BRING BACK OUR BELOVED ZEPOLES. Other than that out meal was outstanding. as usualWe visit Bleau Bar every night for a cocktail before dinner. it is a great place to people watch and relax with a glass of champagne. it is so nice to return to a place and have the staff recognize you from previous visits. Not only did Bianca and Melissa and several of the other servers recognize us but they remember that we come down to celebrate my birthday. With the thousands of guests that pass through the doors of Fontainebleau it \u2019s a very special feeling when you are recognized and remember by the folks who work at the resort. As I said earlier it is like coming home. Fresh yet familiarWe get lots of pool time in during our stay and we LOVE Glow BarAs I mentioned all our days are spent at the pool. it is my ultimate relaxation. The servers are great. shout out to Jackie who took such great care of us during her shifts. I rent a pool float daily the folks at the cabana rental are great but my favorite is Stefany. she remembers me and my birthday. every year I am always greeted with a huge smile and a hug and I am so warmly treated that I look forward to seeing her each year. As for the lounge chairs we get to the pool bright and early so as not to miss a minute of the day and we love the chairs right at polside. I realize these chairs are in high demand and have long known about the 45 minute rule leave your chairs unoccupied for 45 minutes and they are given up to other guests. While I understand the need for this rule in fairness to all guests this year a TIME STAMP was introduced to the mix. If a pool attendant sees you leave your chair he puts a ticket with the time on your chair not back in 45 minutes. You lose your chair. OK I get it. EXCEPT when we leave our chairs to go to lunch ON THE PROPERTY we are not in control of how long it takes in each restaurant to get served etc. So heres the tricky part. we are coming back after lunch ON PROPERTY spending not a small sum on lunch in a FONTAINEBLEAU restaurant not to mention at Glow Bar all day long. the service is at a relaxed pace so we either A choke down our lunch within the 45 minute time window or B lose the spot that we secured since 730 am. Not good. Again I recognize the need for this rule as we have witnessed people leaving for the day to go to the beach shopping lunch on Ocean Drive and come back expecting their chairs to be waiting for them. THAT is unfair. But if you inform your server attendant that you are going to lunch ON PROPERTY and fully intend on coming back for the rest of the day should not there be a grace period that allows time for a leisurely lunch. Perhaps some fine tuning of this rule is in orderWe always take advantage of Miami Spa Month in July and schedule massages during our stay. We love Lapis spaI am so happy that in the past two years the staff at Ida and Harry has become much more welcoming and friendly than was the case a few years back. Every year I receive multiple Fontainebleau gift cards for my birthday and love to purchase a little treat of a piece of jewelry in Ida and Harry. Three years ago I indicated in my survey that the staff was unfriendly and not at all accommodating. I was actually contacted by the retail manager at the time and we spoke further about my experience. I am happy to report that since then the staff has been great. those that remember us say so and those that do not are much friendlier and more helpful. It makes such a difference in the entire shopping experience. I had the pleasure of working with Stefan this year and while the ring I had asked to put on hold somehow made it back into the case it was nonetheless a pleasant encounter. When I came back to purchase the ring the young lady recognized us from many years of shopping at Aquamarine. she had just transferred to Ida and Harry. she was lovely. And while it is somewhat challenging to make a purchase with gift cards paper certificates e gift cards they do it happily now as opposed to years ago when it was made to feel like a major inconvenience. keep up the great work and good spirits at Ida and HaryA couple of side notes My friend inadvertently left a brand new pair of running sneakers under her lounge chair at the pool. She had pushed them well underneath the chair so they would not get wet from splashing from the pool and when we left in a bit of a hurry due to some unexpected rain she forgot to grab them. The next day of course they were no longer there. She went to the attendant who sent her to Cabana rental which then sent her to the Concierge who contacted lost and found. Unfortunately they had never been turned in. She checked several more times even as we were about to leave for home and regrettably the sneakers never turned up. Also an ongoing issue year after year is ball playing in the main pool. While I am certainly not opposed to families having fun sometimes the balls they choose to use are hard rubber balls tennis balls and leather footballs. I have come dangerously close to being hit multiple times with these balls. While the big FONTAINEBLEAU beach balls are fun and even soft nerf type balls these harder balls are much more dangerous especially on the weekends when the pool is very crowded. Perhaps there should be some posted rules about ball playing in the main pool. The ADULT pool is quite small and I enjoy being at the main pool. maybe the ball playing with these harder balls should be restricted to the FAMILY pool. I see where someone could easily get hurt if one of these balls goes astray.

I wish I had done a bit more research before booking here. I live in Las Vegas so I do not enjoy staying at mega resorts since I am always surrounded by them. Fontainebleau is massive. I was assigned a room in one of the farthest towers so every time I left my room to go eat use the spa or catch an uber it was at least a 10 minute ordeal. I would have much rather stayed at a more intimate hotel especially for the price we paid. The beach area adjacent to the hotel is beautiful but as soon as we got settled into our beach chairs which are complimentary if you are staying at the hotel the staff came and put up one of those day beds right in front of us that blocked our view of the water. Keep this in mind when going to the beach. If it is a nice day and you do not pay for a day bed you probably will not get a good view of the ocean. The girl at the little hotel hut tried to sell us a day bed for 60. I told her ABSOLUTELY not. Then she said okay best I can do is 425 and I said no thanks again. Then she said okay 300. I found this unprofessional. Luckily we had a really awesome server on the beach named Bryan who kept the drinks coming. We ate at Scarpeta the Sushi restaurant and the pool cafe during our stay all of which were great. One more thing. Make sure you physically check out of the hotel. We received a 500 late check out fee because we just dropped our keys and left.

There were long lines everywhere and you had to keep asking for help all these came with 20 service charge from all the restaurants. Pools are nice however finding a seat near the pool was very hard unles you got up early. Finding people to help you with clean towels or order drinks required multiple efforts. Even if you wanted to go to cafe yourself to save the efforts you will have to deal with a long wait too. We ended up standing next to the pool with our belongs ourselves so that we can keep an eye on our kids. There was a policy to reassign seats which was not occupied for over 45 minutes but the policy was never reinforced. We pointed out the breaches multiple times with the staff but they just did not honor the policy and did not want to ruffle the feathers.

Security told me that there is always trouble Sunday Night due to Rap Night on the main florSOUND GOOD SO FAR. We were then woken up by a couple screaming on the other adjacent room balcony at 7 AMWe had several hotel billing errors which took a great deal of time to sort out. The fifty dollar first day drink credit was never enacted. A fridge that they agreed to bill for 75 for the week was charged daily. This took many visits to the front desk to rectify. We told the front desk that we were going to check out after two nights due to the bad experience and they communicated that there were would be no penalty. When we checked out they charged a 100 early departure fee. We again had to visit the front desk to argue that commitment as well. Valet parking has an arrivals and a departures area. The departures area has many employees but severely slow service.

This is a long review so let me just start with the gist Fontainebleau did Everything possible to ruin our weekend. I urge you to stay at Loews or the ritz where you will be treated with the care and attention you deserveI have never experienced such a discrepancy between price and quality of service. From the resort fee to the mandatory Valet parking fee 50 night to the EV charging fee 25 to the umbrella fee 25 day to the service charge added to every bill plus 18 Gratuity I expect and deserve excellence. Unfortunately all we got was our patience tested at every turn. Staff is unfriendly uninspired uncaring and worst of all unapologetic. Room was very average no different from a Mariot or Hilton but with some glaring differences the room is trapped by money grabbing schemes. Their Policy about the in room fridge was laughable. If you use the fridge there was a charge. Having no coffee machine is an obvious tactic to spend money at their cafe which in itself is not terrible but the 30 minute lineup and atrocious service at the caf\u00e9 makes it unbearable not to mention. We called for wine glasses and a bottle opener to enjoy a bottle of wine on valentines and only received an opener after 90 minutes with no glasses. I \u2019m assuming they were less then motivated to have us open our own bottle. As for the 75 night 25 extra to charge our Tesla we shelled out for Valet well that was even more unbearable. On both of the times we left the resort. We used Automated service for Valet from the room was used about 20mins prior to arriving at the pickup area we were told we had to wait in line anyways another 20 mins. was then told that \u201c the order never came in \u201d and we waited an additional 20. At 50 a night the wait was 1 hour for such a simple task. If the hotel is this incompetent then let us park the car and retrieve it ourselves. As far as service from their Concierge desk we Asked for a recommendation to watch the NBA All Star events and he of course recommended a restaurant on property. So not wanting to deal with the Valet again we went for it. guess what. unfortunately they \u201c were n\u2019t taking any walk ins reservations only \u201d. Frustrated we went back to the concierge who only then decided to make the reservation. Absolutely no initiative or foresight and to top it off the restaurant had over a dozen empty tables available for the entire 2 hrs we were there. So this was either poor restaurant management to turn us away a policy to try to get us to eat elsewhere or just downright incompetence. The 11 pools is a front over half are small hot tube size swim areas. Did I mention the views you get to enjoy the day five rows deep looking at the back of a plastic lounge chair. If you want services you have to track down a server who will then come back to take your order 45mins later. tack on another 45mins to 1 hour to get your food. When we mentioned the wait times to our waitress her response was it usually takes up to 2 hours to get food. How silly of us to order food when we were hungry. Things are even worse at the beach. Not only does food take forever if you could even find a server unles you pay 250 to be in the first row cabanas your chairs are parked directly behind them with your view 100 obstructed. By the afternoon chairs are crammed so tightly in my son barely had room to build a Sandcastle. How was check out. First they never asked me how my stay was which was disappointing because I was going to be truthful and tell them everything I am writing here. I requested a key to the refresh lounge which was a nice facility only to have the incompetent checkout clerk give me one for the women \u2019s that was unable to be used for the men \u2019s. So my husband had to come back in wet beach clothes stand in line for 35 minutes to speak with the front desk clerk to get another card. It was clear when we were checking out that we were three people staying both male and female so for her not to offer cards for both genders does n\u2019t make sense. In summary do n\u2019t be fooled by the reputation. This hotel is beautiful scam and I highly recommend staying at the ritz or Loews.
