What we experienced was a warm welcoming staff who were super helpful in a lovely holiday home for us. This is clearly a carefully staffed and well managed property that values its guests not just customers. Breakfasts were extensive and excellent the amenities such as pool sauna steam room and gym were pleasant and spotless. We found the staff so welcoming and helpful. The best of the best was Mario the Concierge who helped us greatly with tickets arrangements and an answer to any question. The views of bay were great and we found that we could walk out one door and always find taxis waiting or exit the other door to the street nearer the bay and board a bus for 150 Euros for an all day ticket. The hotel is a 20 or 30 minute car or bus ride to Valetta but all around it are bayside restaurants shops and real Malta. We had a great time at this hotel and will certainly stay there again if our travels take us to beautiful Malta. PS We even found that the hotel has an art gallery no charge adjunct to the lobby where we saw the work of an excellent Maltese artist on display.", "offset": [164, 268], "date": "2015-01-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "70ef62d5-7dde-4522-b3dd-791815cbe898", "sentence": "Most disappointed overall. We went to Malta last summer and stayed at the Corinthia Marina in St Georges Bay which we thought was very good. Bob is to have a hip replacement soon so we wanted somewhere with more accessibility and less hills so chose Le Meridien in the heart of Baluta Bay. It has plenty of restaurants close by and a public bus stop outside. Maltas public buses are generally very good except on Sundays when they are so crowded. You check in on the third floor but except for checking out you do not use this floor again unles you want to use the bar. so you do not get the cheery good morning that you get from most hotel receptions. Our room was a deluxe sea view on floor 7. Le Meridien does not have the greatest sea view but this was probably about as good as it gets. The room was large with a good size balcony and good bathroom facilities including robe and slippers. Unfortunately on returning to our room on day 2 the patio doors rattled it was windy and the maintenance man could not fix it. We were moved very promptly next door and although the room was very similar the balcony was about half the size and the sea view that much less due to buildings being in the way. Housekeeping was inconsistent. Some mornings we received a bottle of water some we did not. Coffee was always replenished but the tea selection which was extensive hardly ever got replenished. More often than not only one flannel was left. There is no fridge which in the height of the summer would be a big downside. There is a notice effectively telling you not to even touch the minibar as you would be charged for any items that were disturbed. Wifi generally was ok in the room but we think it is a cheek that unles you have a deluxe room or are a regular Starwod guest wifi is not free. Even when it is it is the basic package and you have to pay extra for faster. Compare this with small restaurants and bars nearby which all offer free wifi. We had a poor experience late one evening. It was nearly 11 and we were reading in bed when there was a knock at the door and almost immediately the door was being opened. Fortunately we had the bolt on. It appeared that there was an internet problem in the next room and they seemed to be checking if ours was ok. We complained about the intrusion. The duty manager Bernard was very apologetic and a couple of days later a bottle of wine and some chocolates appeared with a note. that was a nice response but should not have been necessary. We note one or two reviewers stated excellent breakfast. In our opinion they must be very easily satisfied. When we stay at hotels our preferred breakfast is porridge followed by poached eggs and grilled bacon. At the egg station there was one gentleman who had no problem poaching eggs for us but on 3 occasions out of 12 we were told no poached eggs. Also some mornings there were no omelettes. We do not know from where they source their bacon but only if you like bacon with 90 fat would you have eaten it. Porridge was also inconsistent. some mornings perfect some mornings so lumpy and others so thin you wondered if any oats has been included. The best thing about breakfast was the Ftira bread which made excellent toast. In fact one morning when there were no eggs and the porridge in our opinion inedible our breakfast consisted of ftira bread toast and jam. Finally although it states it on the web site the outdoor pool is only open from June to September and the indoor pool is inadequate for swimming. We did find the concierge very helpful are not they just about everywhereWil look to stay elsewhere if we return to Malta.", "offset": [3509, 3631], "date": "2015-04-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "cba878e2-8931-458f-9779-72ea1b6c1e76", "sentence": "First Impressions very disappointing but improved through the stay. This was our 3rd year visiting Malta and on reading reviews for the Le Meridien hotel thought it sounded a great place to stay. We arrived at 130 am and there was already a queue for check in when we finally got to speak to the reception they said we would have to wait a few hours. We went and had lunch in the hotel and then went back to reception at 20pm to be told our room was still not ready and to come back at 30pm. At 30pm there was now a queue and finally got the key to our room which was a Deluxe Seaview on the 5th floor 524 the view from the balcony was a Seaview but to the right was a construction site overlooking our balcony. After a verbal confrontation with the general manager we got moved to a better location and was also sent a bottle of wine and flowers as an apology. I understand that the hotel was fully booked and were training new staff but I would not have booked at this hotel if I knew we were going to be next to a construction site.

We booked a weeks holiday at this hotel at the beginning of November. Despite an enjoyable stay during which the staff were most helpful the 5 star rating for the hotel is perhaps stretching matters. We paid extra for a de lux room with sea view. We were given a room on the 5th floor which morning revealed to be overlooking the bay but was partly obscured by a large yellow wall. Top floor rooms would have a better view. The room was large and generally equipped to a 5 star standard however the d\u00e9cor was uninspiring. Loose sanitary fittings and marks to the paintwork suggested failings in the level of inspection and routine maintenance as was also apparent from considerable trolley damage to plasterwork and skirting in the corridors. The toilet was poorly ventilated with obvious consequences. Maid service and cleaning were excellent except for one day when the hotel needed reminding that the room had not been serviced. My main criticism here is that guests in a 5 star hotel should be able to expect de lux facilities in every room and perhaps just expect to pay extra for a sea view. First impressions of the dining room were excellent with a diverse buffet very well presented for our first evening meal followed by an excellent breakfast buffet. From that point matters went somewhat downhill. Probably due to the end of the half term holidays the number of half board guests dropped sharply and the evening meal for 4 of the next 6 nights took place in a smaller restaurant. The first meal was slightly chaotic. It started 15 mins late with guests virtually ignored during that time. The choice of food was very much restricted with just 4 main courses available. Organisation gradually improved over the week with the occasional attendance of a restaurant manager. The last evening meal had an Asian theme. Problem was that not everyone likes spicy food and there were not too many alternatives. Things missing The rooftop snack bar did not open and the advertised beach shuttle bus did not materialise. Some good points The indoor pool sauna and gym were well run and very well equipped. The quality and presentation of the food was generally very good. The concierge provided very good local advice.", "offset": [134, 263], "date": "2015-11-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "d149fa55-eda1-45cb-8137-115498ca8d91", "sentence": "Good hotel in a great location.

A couple of small service issues but nothing major. The head housekeeper walked in unannounced without knocking about an hour after we checked in and her attitude was what are you doing in my room which funnily enough was the exact same thought we were having. Turns out the front desk had allocated us the room before housekeeping had signed it off. this also meant it took 3 calls to get the minibar unlocked. And do not get me started on the Myoka spa I have reviewed this separately and as its a concession within the hotel I will not penalise Le Meridien for our troubles there.

My wife and I booked a package deal and when we saw the hotel we would be staying at we were thrilled. A 5 star nice view spa facilities bar great loaction etc. When we arrived we were even more thrilled. Our room was ready at 11 am when check in is at 2 pm. so we were off to a good start. The room was spacious and inviting with a large bathroom and separate toilet and a comfy bed. We did not have a sea view but made nothing of it as the room was great for us. The door lock on the balcony was broken and a curtain came down from the rail so we called down to the front desk and they sent Martin the maintenance man to fix it. We left him there and when we got back all had been fixed. First day we went to the pool in the spa. On the way down we met a waitress from the breakfast restaurant so we asked what time breakfast would be the next day. She also recommended the bar lounge for dinner which would offer us a complimentary meal on Monday and Wednesday should we desire. We asked again complimentary. she said yes. We had had no intention of eating in the hotel because it is expensive and we thought it was strange that we were being offered a free meal with our package. So the next day we went down to breakfast which was fine but nothing to rave about and on the way out we asked the hostess at the entrance to the restaurant about the dinner. She said yes yes it is on Monday and Wednesday and it is complimentary. She checked our room number on her list and confirmed it. We then asked where we could find a pharmacy as both of us were ill with colds. She said there is one across the road and there is also one in the hotel itself. We are baffled as to why she would tell us this as there clearly is not one in the hotel. That evening Monday we went down to the bar lounge for dinner. We asked the waitress if the meal was complimentary she said yes. We had a mix up almost immediately with the food as we had told the wait staff we are vegetarian and would not be going for any rabbit or beef. They misunderstood and thought it was only my wife who was veggie so they brought me a platter of meats and fish while they brought her a pasta. I had just ordered salmon which was not on the menu but they assured me they could make for me with no bother. The salmon was dry and the attitude was even drier. We eventually asked if we needed to provide our room number and she said yes I will bring the bill. So we sat there as she placed a 64 Euro bill in front of us. My wife went to get the Duty Manager to sort it all out because no one seemed to understand us. My wife is half American and speaks excellent English and I am fully British. Our English is not difficult to understand yet we could not make ourselves understood. The duty manager came to our table and stood while we sat and chatted to us in front of the other guests in the lounge instead of taking us aside. There were not many people there but it was uncomfortable all the same. She said that this has never happened before and we explained that in this case it certainly had happened and we tried to describe the person who had told us. She then left to make a phone call came back and said that the employee in question has denied telling us it was a free dinner included in the package and that she would not have had any way to check even if it was. How are we supposed to know this. Still we should have smelled a rat when the in hotel pharmacy never materialized. She even said the words. I am not saying you are lying. We were incredulous. You do not say that to a customer. That infers that that did indeed cross your mind. The duty manager offered us 50 off. We took it but left with a sour taste in our mouths that could have also been the food. Two nights later we had salmon in Frescos. Now that is how it is done. So the staff had trouble understanding us save for the gentleman who checked us in who had a South African accent. On our last day we asked the front desk where we could leave our luggage for the afternoon after checking out and she said with the concierge. We thought she was talking about the lady downstairs who sits in a room booking tours for guests. Is that not a concierge. Apparently not. That is a shop. However instead of simply saying no sir that is a shop. You can leave your bags over here to the right with the concierge here. Instead she said I do not know what you are talking about sorry and then giggled with her colleague. I tell these stories disappointedly because we had such a good start and we were on our belated honeymoon and celebrating my wifes birthday and I feel that if we had not tried to go to dinner in the hotel we would have had a lovely stay but it was soured by the staff. I had say if you do not have any reason to see that staff you enter on floor 0 jump into the lift and go straight to your room. so you do not even have to walk by the reception desk which is on 3 for some reason. you will have a great stay. And if your television does not send you messages accusing you of going over your rooms credit limit. there is a way to relate to people and Le Meridien could bear to learn some new methods to truly earn their 5 star status in the eyes of this guest. Everything else was great but a good experience in a less stocked hotel with friendly staff can make for a better holiday than a fancy 5 star hotel with sub par service. We were not livid just disappointed. And one thing I would advise to all the staff working there if you do not know do not make something up. Say you do not know. Honorable mentions Shaun in the hotel lounge is a good waiter. I have seen another review in which he is been name dropped so I feel he deserves a mention. He was the only on that night who dealt with us in the proper way. Also Martin the maintenance man. Would I recommend the hotel. Almost. I recognize that a personal experience does not mean everyone will have the same experience and it is a nice hotel.

Did a day trip to Valletta on the bus 150 euros each. Buses get crowded and traffic is a bit mad everyones in a hurry we saw some really bad drivingWe went to the War museum and Grandmasters Palace and Armoury museum which was very interesting. We did a day trip to Gozo which i would recommend lovely Island plenty to see. We did the Highlights of Malta which again was a very enjoyable day out.

We booked an executive room for access to the lounge the breakfast was mediocre at best I would recommend asking for fresh fried eggs as the lounge buffet is pretty congealed and unappetising.

Some of the staff were lovely but some were quite abrupt you would barely finish eating before they take your plate but they never kept things like the coffee machine stocked or the plates and cups stocked. A strange set up and again certainly not 5 star. The pool area was nice and there an adults only area for sun bathing which is great if you have no children yourself.

If you need to have breakfast early be mindful that a queue forms waiting for the breakfast to start and due to the process of checking each person against their room number it can actually take a while to get seated. The club lounge is small but decent with a good selection of food including breakfast items such as smoked salmon that you do n\u2019t get in the main restaurant and an outdoor seating area. My biggest disappointment with the hotel was the rooftop pool area. Granted there are limitations with the size of the pool but the area around it was small and overcrowded. A separate area beyond the pool where loungers are laid out feels like an abandoned veranda. The loungers are also very uncomfortable. I would suggest making better use of the entire rooftop area and providing a fuller service. A good overall experience.

The hotel is in a great location across the road from the beachfront within walking distance of many restaurants bars cafes and sights. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel enabling use of the very good network that covers the island. Given the fact that it is currently undergoing renovation the common areas felt quite modern and the rooms did not feel particularly dated. They were spacious and comfortable.

Check my Instagram to see what I mean giusepecanavo. All the guests have free parking which means no more hassle to find it outside trough the extreme traffic of Malta. Breakfast was well made staff was super nice and the Spa much appreciated. Jamie and Chiara welcomed us during the check in and made us feel like home since the first step. We had the chance to try out also the Atrio restaurant at the 3rd floor where we had a wonderful dinner and an exclusive service from the waiter Manuel. Giusepe of the bar was amazing as well. With the well equipped 247 gym I was able to maintain my workout routine even during my holiday so that was a big plus. Our room was very clean very silent and with the perfect temperature inside which made our sleep perfect. Wifi connection was on point as well.
