We turned off the our air conditioning to reduce the noise however the upstairs rooms outdoor component was outside our bathroom as well and they had their unit on all day night. For someone who prefer silence this was extremely irritating. Staff Your front desk staff were amazing. Paige made us feel welcome and was happy to talk to us. There was another girl my partner interacted with as our bedroom TV was not working. She was responsive by informing the maintenance team and was also empathetic when the TV could not be fixed by apologising to my partner later on. WIFI. So slow or high usage made it un usable but it is ok. we are not here to be on our phones all day. Parking Needs to be more organised. Spent some time searching for a parking spot and ended up parking at different parking areas in multiple occasions. Why only a 6. even with those experience I would still give a hotel or resort about a 7 or 8 as I understand the louvre doors and to keep the beach style and not everyone is as fussy about noise as I am. Whilst parking issue must be due to high occupation as it is the school holiday. However I gave you a 6 maybe it should be a 5 because the experience with the maintenance guy lets call him MG for short left an extremely bad taste. Going back to when I was recalling about the TV not working inside the bedroom. Before the MG came to inspect the TV we tried the turn off wait 10 sec turn on and the turn off unplug all cables wait 10 sec turn on method along with the girl before it was decided the MG will come and check the problem out. Thumbs up on the waiting time for him was not long. Once my partner open the door there was MG who wanted to confirmed if we were having problem with the TV to which my partner answered yes. As they made their way to the bedroom my partner then asked how his day been to be responded Been busy all day. Which is probably true from how fast he was walking and the moody to monotone short answers we got. He then proceed to the TV doing the method we did previously as we told him we had tried that already. He then said That normally fixes it. After trying it a few more time he concluded with well. there is nothing I can do about it. Will have to get the technician to come in the morning. We then told him how we are checking out in the morning to him to shrug make his way out of the room and say Well I can not do anything now. Leaving both my partner and me looking at each other wondering if that really happened. The reason why this experience really disappointed me was not because the TV did not got fixed before we checkout or that nothing was done as compensation but the attitude and poor service quality we experienced with the MG. He did not greet us when he arrived or left. He did not seem to try and made the atmosphere feel comfortable. He did not apologise that the situation can not be fixed in time. And he definitely not afraid to put his I do not CARE. attitude on display. Having this experience at the end of the amazing day we had definitely left a wedge on the whole experience.", "offset": [1338, 1487], "date": "2016-07-04 02:53:36", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "e404dfa9-72ee-49ec-92f7-960f92354b0f", "sentence": "Nice but most activities for kids not operating.

Room 353 was very shabby not very clean.

Received overcooked watery brown rice ie. not pilaf a few chopped carrots potatoes etc in a watery tomato sauce all poorly presented on the plate. Told waitress it was not as described on menu she returned it to the kitchen both the chef mgr agreed it was very unsatisfactory. Mgr offered to deduct price from bill which I accepted. My room 353 was next to a wall mounted electrical cabinet at about 10 pm it started to emit a very loud buzzing noise. I contacted reception was told maintenance would be there immediately to investigate. By 11 pm still no one had been to check on the noise so I contacted reception again and asked to change rooms as it was impossible to sleep. Eventually moved to Room 365 half an hour later. Room 365 had no bedside lamp lamp on desk did not work and again room cleanliness was well below standard. By then I was too tired after an early flight from Melb. to bother with these issues went to sleep. Had breakfast in restaurant in morning and cooked food was lukewarm at best.

The facilities were nice and I understand you are undergoing a refurb which is great. It may have been a busy time of day year month but check in took a VERY long time. We stood in the queue for over 40 minutes. It also was not communicated to us to wear the yellow wristbands all of the time we were told just to use the kayaks etc. For someone who had never been there before we were kind of chucked in the deep end. There was an issue with the add on buffet breakfast that I had purchased with our booking as it did not turn up in the restaurant. It was rectified once I showed my email after it did not show up in your system but it was just an inconvenience. It was also strange that we were there for a wedding and had previously emailed several times to tell you that we were there for a wedding but all of our rooms were very far away from each other. Although the food at Sola was good it was overpriced and the service was appalling. For lunch one day we waited over 40 minutes for a kids burger and of the 5 people I spoke with only one of them apologised about a missing ticket. Maybe understaffed. Maybe lining up to order food and also lining up for drinks is not the best idea. We had a 20 person dinner on our last night and the lines at the bar were so long that none of us could have been bothered to get a drink. If there was table service we would have ordered bottles of wine and you would have made much more money. The kids loved the kids cove programme and the babysitting service was great. When you redo the rooms you should put in a coktop so families can cook pasta etc for the kids when they do not want to eat out every night. Also when exactly was the P bar and fish and chips eatery ever open. We had drinks by the P when we arrived on Friday afternoon but it seemed to be only open sporadically. We went down to get fish and chips for the kids dinner one night and it was not open. There was also no signage of opening hours so we did not know when to come back. Once again money you are missing out on. Also Activity Bay should open earlier. When the kids are up at 7 am it is a long wait to get kayaks. Once again there were no signs with opening hours so we did not know what was going on. A shade sail over a portion of the P would be nice too.

The cafe does not open till 7 am so early risers wait for your coffee fix until then the restaurant Sala what an over priced joke of a place we asked for wedges said they only do large cuts of potatoe chips could not understand the menu and ordered a vegetarian pizza when we received our food almost 60 for these dishes. we got french fries and a medium sized pizza. So we never ate there again. Now the outdoor activities the pool looks big in the pics but it is so small for such a big hotel. It was always full looked green sometimes so they definitely need another pool. We hired bikes which needed to be repaired or replaced seat was constantly moving and handles during our bike ride.

The Buffet restaurant was the let down mostly everything we put the the tables that we ate from got stuck as the vanish was peeling off on all the tables even my phone got stuck then you go to use my napkin and the napkin is stuck to the table and all I can see on our tables everyone elses is napkin marks of paper stuck to the gables it was like the tables have not been cleaned properly. The food at the buffet restaurant was very very average to say the least I felt a lot of it was not fresh at all. There was not a whole lot of vegetarian or vegan options and I feel vegetarian options were really recycled and not fresh. The seafood buffet was not much of a seafood buffet I was really hanging out for some healthy choices but there was not unfortunately. The breakfast buffet was very average as well the fresh fruit was not fresh it was old and we found flies in it again not a whole lot of vegetarian options not even mushrooms but you had three types of eggs. I felt a lot of the food was Superdry like he had been out for a couple of days before hand on the buffet it did not feel like it was fresh at all. I felt like there was a lot of processed foods to make it easier for the kitchen. I want to say a big thank you to the kids club as they were amazing what a fantastic lady Helen was with my children and what a wonderful facility you have their. Everything else was amazing it was a great stay for our wedding anniversary of 12 years it would have been nice to stay longer then one night. but hopefully next time we can stay longer.
