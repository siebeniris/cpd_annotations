I have to say the hotel has gone completely downhill. It so overcrowded that people were trying to kick us off our chairs at the pool. We stayed in the Tower and these rooms look like they have never been cleaned. The room I was in smelled so bad of mold and just a horrible musty odor that my family decided to leave a day early. Not sure what is going on at the hotel but they really need to overhaul the rooms and also the family hang out room attached to Serendipity.

Where to begin. The first morning we were rudely awakened by the sound of jack hammers ripping up a side walk just outside our window at 730am. Not welcomed when you have checked in late and gotten to sleep after 1 am. The front desk assured us that was unusual and would never happen again. Except it happened the next morning. So they moved us into the Tower our original jack hammer room had been in the cloisters and was a small but beautiful renovated room. Our new Tower room was quiet but had not been touched with paint or ANYTHING since it seemed the 1980s. Paying over 400 per night for a room with stained carpet stained walls and yellowed phones with cords attached to the wall was just unacceptable. When you pay 5 star prices you expect a room that is at least in great shape. This room was sad and neglected and depressing. The rest of the hotel was disappointing as well and clearly the place had gone down hill since our last visit. they had recently decided there would be no table service with menus for breakfast. So if you were too tired to stand in the buffet line and get your own food too bad. Some people like buffets but most who pay these prices expect SERVICE. It is luxurious to order from a waiter and to be served. That is not possible here anymore. A big mistake on the part of management. Have fun waiting for your omelet while you try to run over to the toaster and time your toast so it is hot when your omelet is ready. The pool no chairs. Long wait to find a space to sit. On top of that you must PAY to use the pool. Your room does not come with access to the resort you must pay an additional resort fee. Now I ask you who books a room at a hotel and expects that the price you pay gets you ONLY that room. Well no one. This resort fee is simply a way to increase revenues. Put the charge into the room price. Otherwise your guest feels nickel and dimed the whole time they are visiting. Another example of this is the spa. Book a massage for 150 and you get your bill and see a service charge of 20. That would be OK except they then tell you. this is not a tip. Some of this charge goes to pay the salary of your massage therapist. So you are left feeling. wow the massage therapist is not making much money I better tip ON TOP of that already high 180. So you add another 30 tip and you leave the spa knowing you paid 210 for a one hour massage which is ridiculous. You are fuming and any benefit you received from that massage disappears immediately. Last but not least when you want to go to the front desk to ask about anything forget about it. There is always a long line of people waiting to check in or check out. I believe that this was because they had huge groups of conventioners staying at the hotel and those large groups of people were likely the reason that service was so bad and the pool was so crowded. Guests like us who have chosen this hotel because it is an American Express preferred property get the short end of the stick. NO question those convention attendees were likely paying 12 the price we were paying for our room. I am sure it was a fine place for a business event. I do not recommend it as a vacation hotel. This is the worst review I have ever given and I feel badly about it. The hotel employees were well meaning. There are just too few of them and they were not well trained.

I have not stayed in this hotel since 201 when I found it missing a lot of the customer service given by The Breakers and other hotels. Also back then I found the resort in need of an update and dirty. I was pleasantly surprised with this trip in terms of the cleanliness of the pools and hallways compared to last time. We stayed in the Tower because double beds are too small the rooms are spacious which is great when you have kids. I think the air conditioning systems need an overhaul as it was hard to cool the room down past 70 and the vents were very dirty. Had there been ceiling fans that would have helped to circulate the air. The beaches and pools are great the chairs around the middle pool are worn and falling apart and could definitely be replaced and I did not like that on the Saturday the closed it at 4 pm for an event for a conference but it was not a big deal. The food is very expensive and there are not many healthy options in terms of gluten free. The food outside at both the Tower Pool and the beach club was good though albeit pricey I want to give a shout out to Steven at the Tower Pool he was an excellent server and knowledgeable which at 501 the night before our server missed the mark. I am fine with a resort fee. but like many others I say tie it into the cost of room and include parking or allow self parking 35 a day for valet which is your only option is extremely expensive when you are already paying top dollar for rooms a resort fee food etc. I must give an excellent shout out to the Loss Prevention Staff in particular Eric Goldworm he and his colleagues went above and beyond the call of duty to try and find my sons bear which we left there a resort of 1000 rooms and linens I thought this time he was gone for good. But I received a call that he was found 24 hours later and they would overnight fed ex to us at no charge not only that but he took the time to write my son an endearing email and send a few pics of his bear around the resort that to us went and above the call of duty and my son loved it. So I hope he is commended for his outstanding attention to customer service. I do not remember the gentlemans name I called and spoke to at 130 pm at night when I realized he was left behind but he too was helpful as was Kara. So thanks you and kudos for that.

The good the not so good and the great. My wife and two teenage kids checked into the hotel over Christmas week. When we made this reservation back in June we were advised that the newly renovated Cloister wing was beautiful and more than spacious for our family of four with two queen size beds. When we arrived at the room it was in fact renovated and ideal for a family of four midgets. My wife was not a happy camper and my teenage kids wanted to sleep on the beach. As an aside unles you are travelling with infant children do not book the cloisters as the rooms are tiny at best. We contacted the front desk but were met with robotic responses that the hotel was full and that nothing could be done at least for the first few nights. I then remembered a very professional young man that I had dealt with on prior visits to this wonderful hotel Bradley Shapiro. I was told that he was no longer at the hotel but in fact the front office manager at the Boca Beach Club. I frantically called over to the Beach Club and was lucky enough to get Brad on the phone. Even though this was not his problem he did everything in his power to talk me down from the roof and told me to give him 20 minutes to see what he could do. Almost 20 minutes later I spoke with Brad and he advised that he found a second room on the same floor that would accommodate my wife and I leaving my teenagers in the first room. While there was an extra charge he was fair professional and empathetic to our situation. Having run my own business for the past thirty years I consider myself a good judge of character and Brad is right up there with the best. In fact I watched him deal with patience with customer after customer most of which were extremely demanding in a condescending and entitled way.

I took a recommendation from a close friend to stay at this hotel. After 48 hours I checked on trip advisor to see what people were saying and I was relieved to see that it was not just me having a shocking time. The attitude of the staff at this hotel is utterly appalling. It all started with the valet who told me not to park my hire car next to the expensive cars. Then the receptionist who did not have the right room available for us who then peppered me with alternatives across what is a huge resort. my apologies for not visiting before but after a 4 hour drive I need a bit of time to take things inWe tried to spend money in the shops but assistants told us that we would have to come back tomorrow to check for our shoe size. When we went for a drink we had to wait an age for the server who then like many of her colleagues helped herself to the 20 auto gratuity for a party of 6 2 of whom were 16 18 years below the legal drinking ageAnother reviewer put it really nicely that they felt they were being nickled and dimed for everything. I agree with this. For example after paying 1000 for 3 people to play golf I asked for a bottle of water to be put in my golf cart. I was told to go to the snack window and part with 8 for one. It is things like this that made our stay unpleasant and uncomfortable. The final straw came on the final day with rude reception staff who were aggressive to an elderly female member of our party in response to a simple question about check out times. This was unacceptable and has no place for people when they are on vacation. The hotel itself is beautiful and the accessibility to the beach club was good via the water taxi or shuttle bus. The beach is great and the pool area great fun. The kids club is below par but can keep the kids entertained for an hour out of the sunshine. The tennis club was good and the kids had really good lessons with Todd and Cody. The aforementioned golf course was in appalling condition the greens and tees were poor and did not reflect the 30 cost per player. The kids menu was light on healthy food and when pasta with tomato sauce was requested this was WAY too much of a problem for the chef and was declined with the offer of plain pasta. This hotel it is staff but overall its management need to really learn that the 1 may keep them rich in the short term but this is not a viable way to build the Waldorf brand or a property of this size. As long as the staff are hunting out tips from wealthy customers they are ignoring the other people who have also paid good money to be there. We will see this place on an episode of Undercover Boss one day and I am convinced it would uncover some shocking behaviour.

I attended a work related conference here and decided to bring the family along for a mini vacation. And wow did we pick a great place to stay. The Boca Resort was amazing. A quick word of warning though the company owns two properties very close to each other. The Boca Resort which is located on an inland lake and the Boca Beach Club which is located along the ocean. Luckily we picked the Boca Resort because that is where our conference was. But there are shuttles running constantly back and forth between the two locations. Business side first nice locations but LOTS of different rooms and very easy to get lost and confused. Also while right next to the Resort you have to walk albeit briefly outside of the Resort to get to the meeting center. It would not have been a big issue if it had nt been 95 degrees out with about 99 humidity. Family vacation side awesome. There is a breakfast restaurant and a dinner restaurant that allowed kids 12 and under to eat free. This was a HUGE savings as food was super pricey. 35 for an adult breakfast buffet. Kids enjoyed the pool amd taking the shuttle over to the beach. They enjoyed seeing lizards and the resort staff is absolutely incredible. Dare I say the BEST I have encountered in a long time. Downsides were the difficulty our kids had completing the Mizner Quest almost impossible to find all of the spots and poor directions the heat and humidity lots of places where you have to walk outside to get through the Resort and the Flow Rider was never available when we could get to it.

As a Diamond level Hilton member I have stayed at Hilton properties all over the world including other Waldorf Astorias. While this is a physically beautiful facility in a nice location near the ocean I feel that this is a weaker hotel. Yes our group of five had an enjoyable time during our week and a half stay but it was pretty much without too much help from the staff. I do n\u2019t really like to make that type of statement as some of the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home. For example Edie one of the parking valets was very helpful friendly and accommodating. Rebecca who assists the front desk with booking and billing issues was extremely enthusiastic and competent. However there were several snafus and mishaps throughout our 10 days so many that one really could n\u2019t ignore these unwanted distractions. I will give two examples. The first example involves an issue with check in to the resort. We had reserved 3 separate rooms. I was traveling with my mother who is elderly in a wheelchair and accompanied by a personal attendant. As my mother had a separate room the lady at reception asked to see my mother \u2019s ID. As my mother did not have her ID available the reception refused to check her in. Then the lady said something to the effect \u201c there is a second person staying in the room with your mother Mrs Aide she pronounced it Ah ee dah \u201d and \u201c if Mrs Ah ee dah had her ID then my mother could check in \u201d. Neither my mother nor I had ever heard of Ah ee dah. I asked to see the reservation on the computer monitor. I saw that the room was booked for my mother and her \u201c aide \u201d. I almost laughed out loud but then asked my mother \u2019s aide to show her driver \u2019s license and we finally went to our hotel rooms. The second example involves parking. I know to do my homework before traveling ie check reviews on social media and emailed a Yelp user who had stayed at the resort in March 2017 asking for advice about any potential concerns. He had encountered parking issues which were so persistent that they had disrupted his stay. He recommended that I be especially careful in explaining to the parking staff upon arrival that I am a hotel guest and not a visitor to the hotel. This he assured me would save me considerable anxiety. So when I checked in I diligently explained to the valet that we were staying for 10 days and that we were not visitors. The man nodded in agreement did some paperwork and gave me a valet parking receipt for my car. Nevertheless the next day when I went to get my car another parking staff member Edie noticed that I had the wrong type of parking ticket. I was startled even knowing in advance that there is a potential issue can not protect you at a Waldorf Astoria. Edie ended up re doing our parking ticket and everything went smoothly with parking for the remaining 8 days of our trip. I note that they charge 41 per day for valet parking and there is no alternative available such as self parkingWhile neither of the above examples by themselves was very serious they were troubling for two particular reasons. First of all you do not expect this level of customer service at a 5star hotel and especially not at a Waldorf Astoria. Secondly virtually all of the staff with whom there were issues appeared to be meticulously attired women in blazers with high heels men in dress shirts andor sports coats \u2026. Perhaps it is just me but it is odd to deal with people dressed to look formal and professional who do not perhaps appear to be overly concerned about their own performance. These service issues cropped up throughout our stay. They included maintenance issues no heat in one room in the Yacht Club for 4 days plus there were ants in my Yacht Club room billing issues including overcharging and in another instance it took three different staff members a week to fix a single billing error restaurant service issues getting a cup of coffee from unatentive wait staff during breakfast could be challenging and navigation issues a few staff did not know where buildings were located. We did manage overall to enjoy ourselves as this resort has many excellent qualities. The hotel is nicely laid out and the physical attributes give a feeling of being in an exclusive corner of the world. There are guests from all over the world so people watching is fascinating. The Yacht Club has lovely views overlooking the bay. When one wakes up in the morning one can see the sunrise.
