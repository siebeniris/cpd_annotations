I am in Atlanta occasionally on business travel and have stayed at this Crowne Plaza on several occasions. I just returned from a quick to Atlanta and had my most underwhelming stay yet at this hotel. I will break down my experience for you. Location If you are in Dunwody on business this is great for you. it is right next to some monstrous office parks and is directly off 285 and located down the road from MARTA if you want to escape the suburbs and head to Midtown Buckhead or Downtown. Front Desk The front desk staff has always been great. They consistently exceed my expectations and always thank me for being an IHG Rewards member and for staying at the hotel. Public Spaces I appreciate the whole atrium feel of the lobby bar and restaurant area since it fits with the wooded atmosphere outside the hotel but it is a little dated and needs a facelift. Rooms. For a hotel that is located right next door literally STEPS away from IHG Headquarters you would think they would step their game up. These rooms are dated the water is either cold or skin melting hot and the tub is just something you would expect out of 198 not 2015. I did however have a nice view as nice as a view gets in Dunwody. and I could see the Atlanta skyline in the distance. The beds were typical hotel beds not too hard and not too soft. The decor was not Motel Six but it was not up to what you would expect from a Crowne Plaza next to IHG HQFod and Beverage This is where the hotel absolutely drops the ball in a most unacceptable way. The bar is FAR too small for a hotel that specializes in business and convention travel it is not news to anyone that people on business and convention travel like to DRINK. The night I had dinner in the bar my sandwich took FOREVER to come and the steak was tough and overcooked the staff was completely overwhelmed and they verbalized it. Hugo did his best to run the bar well like he does but a female who had on a Supervisor nametag was cursing and I witnessed her pick up the phone apparently call the kitchen and proceed to yell and swear at the person on the other end over how long it was taking someone to get a medium rare steak salad. I know she was probably frustrated with the kitchen however this is absolutely unacpetable especially when someone is at supervisor level. The bar also apparently was running out of beer and had no pineapple juice on the evening I was there. Long story short the bar is in need of a makeover both in size and decor and in staffing. I also had breakfast in the hotel yesterday and had to flag down a supervisor to place an order from the menu. I know most people get the breakfast buffet also subpar but I wanted to order from the menu. One would assume the hotel makes more money from menu orders but maybe not. The waitress I did eventually get recovered well however a bad taste was left in my mouth from the experience. Overall This hotel has massive potential. A great location across from Perimeter Mall in a town filled with great restaurants and sprawling office parks would make this an ideal location for anyone traveling to the area with its close proximity to interstates and MARTA. Sadly the dated decor and some massive service fails makes this hotel far less attractive than other IHG hotels in the area including the Staybridge Suites down the road. One would expect big things from the hotel next door to IHG. I did not have a choice about staying at CP this time however whenever I have a choice in the future it will sadly not be this hotel. I do not recommend it to anyone.", "offset": [2732, 2807], "date": "2015-02-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "9f5b487f-389f-4f89-a15e-bd9153182c9a", "sentence": "OK just now happened. My son got sick and woke up vomiting. I cleaned most of it out of the carpet but it was still in desperate need of some cleaning attention. After 5 minutes of continuous calling to front desk I almost gave up I FINALLY got ahold of someone. I told the gentleman the situation and explained to him that housekeeping was needed for the smell. Almost 10 minutes later housekeeping showed up with a VACUUM CLEANER. I explained to her she needed to CLEAN the carpet with a cleaner for the smell. She nodded and came in my room. She switched on the light ran the vacuum with NO REGARDS for my sleeping 8 month old and left. No attempt to clean the spot with any chemicals. The smell is so rancid and the spot is still damp with vomit. I just laid towels over it. I have been staying here for 2 nights and up until now have had a pleasant experience but with day shift. This is my first instance of dealing with the night staff on call and I have to say I am extremely disappointed.

Oh where do I begin. Let me preface this review by stating I try and stay loyal to the SPG Brand as I travel around 30 weeks out of the year and like to have my points at one place. But from time to time I choose different brands because they are closer to my client and sometimes find it interesting to see what it is like on the other side. Let me also state I am still currently staying at this hotel but after what occurred this morning as I woke up I must write about it. It is conveniently located to my client and my stay will be about two weeks. I decided on this hotel because the Le Meridien was booked. I made my reservation about two weeks prior to arrival. Upon arrival on Monday I was promptly checked in and enjoyed the friendliness of the front desk staff. She told me she had the room I reserved a King corner room and to proceed to the 9th floor and off I went. Upon entering the room it was neither a King bed or a corner room. I grabbed my bags and went right back downstairs. I approached a different front desk associate and explained what had occurred he looked through the computer and told me there are no more King rooms available. From the start I was immediately disappointed and questioned why they even take reservations if they do not uphold them. His colleague Felecia approached us while we were conversing and requested that I come with her to her computer. She continued to tell me that the hotel was booked but she quickly worked on the computer and made some calls to housekeeping and told me she was going to do her best to get me a room that fit my reservation made two weeks ago. I was late for a client dinner so I requested they hold my bags and that I would come back in a few hours. I came back at around 10 pm and they told me they were able to figure out a solution great. I proceeded to the room and immediately jumped into bed. Quickly noticing the pillows were feather based I am allergic but I was too tired to call up and wait for housekeeping after a long day of travelling. In the morning I went to the front desk to kindly request that housekeeping swap out the feather based pillows for the duration of my stay. After returning from work that evening I came to find two feather based pillows and one down pillow. I called up housekeeping and in about 25 minutes they swapped them out finally. The next day the same thing more feather pillows. In addition there was a wet pillow case sitting on top of the dresser interesting a gift perhaps. Yet another indication of a lackluster housekeeping staff. But here comes the best part I woke up this morning and proceeded to go wash up in the bathroom. As I patted down my face I saw in the mirror a small black brown speck on the wall. I turned around and there it was a cockroach picture included. Definately not what I want to see at 630 in the morning or ever actually. To summarize this hotel is outdated roach infested and they can not even manage to hold a reservation. The Club Lounge is tiny and plagued with depressing spread for breakfast. This was IHGs opportunity to wow me I will only leave with goosebumps.

I was glad since I am a IHG member. I checked in late. I was informed the Club Lounge would be open 24 hrs and also breakfast starts at 630AM. However the Club Lounge was very disappointing. It was dark residual few peanuts in a dish and the fridge was not well stocked with few bottles of water. My room was large clean with good lighting. I was impressed. The bathroom sink lighting and countertop were renovated. However the bathtub was clean but dated. The faucet handle however was loose and as a result I was unable to adjust the temperature of the shower well. I then went to the Club Lounge at 640AM for breakfast which was to start at 630AM. but there was no fresh coffee or food to be found. I called the front desk and the operator it took several minutes for someone to pick up. The front desk staff ended up making my room service complimentary. However room service was very good. The server was attentive. The omelet and potatoes were perfectly done. I would say it was the best part of my stay. My impression of this Crowne Plaza is that there is potential but someone in management needs to pay atn. to detail to make the a clients stay better and more favorable.", "offset": [1201, 1264], "date": "2015-10-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "a2f941a8-be51-4d47-b02d-c61dfe168f75", "sentence": "Perfect For Leisure Business. Recently stayed at this property for 5 days for business and decided to bring the family. This hotel is ideal for both personal and professional travel. I have stayed here in the past primarily for large conferences. This property has amenities to meet needs for all. Free self parking but valet was affordable. Free WiFi worked well. My family really enjoyed the 24 hour pool and beautiful walking trail behind the property. The hotel lobby was modern waterfall beautiful and restaurant and private seating with a television was a nice feature. Hotel staff was very friendly. We were on the 14th floor and room was clean with standard features and a refrigerator. Bed was comfortable and overall room was clean. I would stay at this property again. I would highly suggest the property do something about the parking garage. It was too open and anyone could enter. A simple security gate would have made me feel more comfortable. Although I was with family sometimes I would leave the property and walking down in a secluded garage that is not maintained and secured was a little scary.

We stayed here two nights for a conference last weekend. From our arrival the hotel was unimpressive and average at best. There was a line across the entire lobby for check in four representatives three at times and a throng of people. When we finally made it to the desk after waiting 58 minutes there was no apology or special treatment just a disinterested front desk attendant. I inquired about the wait and was told that this was an unusual situation. they have never hosted a conference before. We spent the time allocated for dinner waiting in line so we ate at the Bistro 55 bar. Dinner consisted of a cob salad and grilled cheese sandwich for 30. The salad was 14 cold corn and the chef attempted to hide the overripe avocado in very few greens. My wife liked the grilled cheese and fries 14Our room was a small king room very clean but still musty smelling and dated. Hopefully it was one of the old rooms as there are renovation in progress signs in the hallways. The old wall HVAC unit blew air right onto the bed which we were able to adjust a little by moving the vents. While we were there we complained twice about a broken toilet. The hotel operator line continually rang without an answer and we had to call multiple times to finally get through. After the 2nd report someone cleaned up the water but did not fix the problem. The conference facilities were nice which is where we spent most of our time during the day. I remember staying here when I first moved to Atlanta 20 years ago. I thought it would have changed more and offered better service especially since it sits in the same complex as the IHG Americas headquarters.", "offset": [1149, 1211], "date": "2018-04-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "0a595a69-6da4-4c0b-814f-386b3e1eb893", "sentence": "You will not be disappointed.

It appears as thought this property has been updated recently and the ambience is lovely both in the lobby and in the room I stayed in. However some details are lacking. Most notably the Wi Fi speed. For a business traveler it was painful to try and conduct video conference calls for personal use FaceTime kept cutting out when trying to talk with my wife and streaming video kept buffering. You can pay for x2 speed but 1 1495 is criminal and 2. in this day and age you expect enough speed from basic connectivity to say godnight to your loved ones. It almost feels like the hotel is purposefully throttling the speed to try and extort an extra 15 from you. I ended up using my MiFI adapter out of frustration. The second detail was the bathroom. I am glad to see hotels leaving bathtubs behind in favor of walk in showers however they skimped on the bathroom size so if I walked directly out of the shower I would have stepped into the toilet. I should not have to do triple Lundy to maneuver in the bathroom. On the plus side the bed was comfortable and there were outlets with USB ports built in although not USB C which is what many new phones and laptops are switching to on both sides of the bed and at the desk. The staff are cheerful and helpful as well. In short if you are a Luddite and do not need connectivity and are flexible enough to snake your way in and out of the shower I recommend this property.
