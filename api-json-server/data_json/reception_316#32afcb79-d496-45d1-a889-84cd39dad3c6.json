Out of our the 4 hotels we were staying in during our vacation to San Fran Vegas and LA this hotel was the one that I was looking forward to staying in the most. Unfortunately it was the one hotel that let the whole side down. Whilst perfectly located excellently decorated with perfect rooms suites and amenities with balconies. it is just the little bad things that still stick in my mind. The one bed terrace room has a kitchen area with a microwave refrigerator come mini bar and dishwasher. However it does not come with anything to put in the dishwasher and anything you would like to put in the microwave had better not be chilled as you wo nt be able to store it because you actually get charged 25 for making use of the fridgeThere is a sign on the door that says you will get charged for anything that gets removed from the mini bar which is understandable although the lady on reception was convinced it actually says something different. but it is not until check out that you also get told you get charged for putting stuff in we bought milk from CVS for our cup of tea in the morningThe Air Con just would not get to the temperature I wanted it to get to and in this day and age being charged 20 per day for a very poor WIFI service was not what I was expecting from one of the dearest hotels in Vegas especially as most of the cheaper hotels offered it free to people not even staying in them. The pool areas were spot on the staff friendly but the one person that stood out for me was Janice from the Bamboo pool. Friendly helpful and nothing was too much trouble for her.

I have stayed at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas numerous times and I have to say that the quality in service has definitely gone down. Upon check in our room was not yet ready which was fine. The front desk agent gave us our room keys and that we would receive a text message when the room was ready. When we went to our assigned room the key would not work. We had all our baggage and things with us and had to walk all the way back to the front desk where we had to stand in line all over again. It was such an inconvenience. No apologies whatsoever from the front desk agent just saying it has been happening a lot. Ok thanks buddy sarcastic tone. Another issue we had is that the shower handle came off and hit my leg. You would think that they would properly check all the amenities in the room before letting a guest check in to it. Luckily it did not fall on my feet or I would have broken a toe. I called guest services to inform them of the situation and they said that maintenance would be coming up to fix it. Again no apologies or concern for my well being. It was cold water running so I could not take a shower. I called again because we needed to leave and I wanted to take a decent warm shower. The person who answered the phone was so rude and said that they already know and the maintenance guy was coming. I think her name was Anna. She was acting like they are doing us a favor by fixing the faucet handle and should just keep waiting. The whole situation was an inconvenience to us. The least she could do was be nice about it. And lastly at check out the front desk agent was not courteous at all and quite dismissive when we had questions about our charges. Also she did not ask us if we enjoyed our stay. If she did the answer would have been no we did not. Do n\u2019t get me wrong there are good points about staying in this hotel the room was spacious and clean and the balcony view had an awesome view of the strip.

Where to begin. We went to Cosmo when it first opened beautiful casino rooms to die for and excellent service. We were once loyal to only the V P and now the Cosmopolitan has stolen our heartsThinking of our most recent stay we traveled with a large group everyone staying at different properties. Of course I was at Cosmo where I receive top notch service and the best comps from the most amazing host I could ever ask for. It does not matter if I win or lose the experience of being at the Cosmopolitan is enough to satisfy us beyond our wildest dreams. We booked a 1 bedroom suite in February beautiful and clean as always. We had a fantastic view of the Belagio fountains it does not get better than that. About midway into our trip I get a call from a friend who travelled with us telling me the room they were in at a different property was so poorly maintained and they were really bummed and disappointed. Being their first time in Vegas I was not about to have this. I called the host department asked if we could move to a 2 bedroom so my friends could join us. About 10 minutes after my call we had a bellman at our door ready to move us this was nearly at midnight into another 2 bedroom suite with an even better view of the fountains. When I called to inquire I never once asked for this move to be complimentary and even expected to pay upon checkout for this last minute request. True to each of my experiences in the past when I went to check out again Cosmopolitan went above and beyond to accommodate my requests and handed me a bill with not a penny due. No matter how bad things can ever get and we have never had a bad experience here we will always be loyal to the Cosmopolitan not just for the comps but the entire experience from hand crafter cocktails fantastic gaming floor the best high limit room in Las Vegas. AND the only buffet I have ever eaten at Wicked Spoon and continue to eat at each trip. If you are looking for a unique Vegas experience Cosmo is the place for you. The only property on the Las Vegas strip with such a fantastic view from your own private terrace. The players club check in staff cleaning staff host staff bell staff etc. All of these wonderful people make for a unique experience and truly offer the BEST of Las VegasI should also add. Circa May 2014 I made a huge mistake when booking my room. We mistakenly reserved our dates in June when we were actually arriving in May When we arrived to check in in May our reservation could not be retrieved due to our oversight because we provided the wrong dates when we originally booked. Again in less than 10 minutes our CO STAR was able to put us in an even better room than we expected and never once made us feel some type of way for a huge mistake on OUR part.", "offset": [2154, 2227], "date": "2016-07-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "f544ddd2-3f62-4f0a-a269-af5bd4de19d7", "sentence": "Rooms not available when checking in said I would get a text when available usually not a problem.

I called down and requested to moved to another room which took a lot of time and effort. Meanwhile I went to see the concierge about notary service which we had called about in advance. We were coldly greeted by someone named Tayfun who informed us that the notaries were all gone for the day and that we should try Belagio or Aria their competition. When we told him that we had spoken to someone not even an hour prior who said they could help us with notary service he shrugged his shoulders and laughed. When I asked why he was telling us to go to the competition to handle services the Cosmo offers again he shrugged. We gave up on this sad excuse for a concierge and headed to Aria where we were warmly greeted and immediately helped. This hotel is an absolute joke and management should be ashamed.

Whether it is Nick Tim or Winsey checking me in I am always accommodated to the best of their ability. I have never walked out of the Autograph Lounge feeling like the staff did not put forth 100 to make sure I had a great customer service experience. Their infectious smiles and their can do attitude makes the check in process something I actually look forward to. My family loves the multitude of food options. The Henry Wicked Spoon Egslut and Momofoku are all delicious. My daughter has a wheat allergy. Rhori Kow the former executive chef at Wicked Spoon before he left to Triple George Grill would specially make dishes to accommodate her. She did not have to feel like she was missing out on the Wicked Mac Cheese because Rhori would make it gluten free just for her. that is the level of service no matter where you go in this resort. On one trip I reached over the buffet sneeze guard to tip the carver. Unfortunately I did not realize I rested my forearm on a warming lamp. I burned myself. For me it was not a big deal. I could have walked away with an ice pack but the staff Hector and Emilio at Wicked Spoon jumped into action. They quickly dispatched security to bring a first aid kit. They brought ointment and wrapped the burn. It was a little overkill for my taste but guest safety seems to be paramount. By the time I returned to my room Chance Storm from guest services left me a voicemail to check in on me and ask if there was anything he could do to help. This was followed by a call the next day from Jesica in guest services. She was genuinely concerned for my well being not for litigation since I already admitted it was entirely my faultWhen we did not think ahead to book time on the tennis courts the staff let us use an open court that the original reservation was late for. The party eventually showed up but we got a good 40 minutes in. The gym staff could have held the court but was happy to fit us in.
