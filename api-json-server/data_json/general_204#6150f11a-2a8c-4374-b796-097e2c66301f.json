I \u2019ve written before about Beijing Kempinski Lufthansa and generally have been happy enough to make it my entry and exit hotel in China. But things have changed considerably over the past year or so. Right now I am kicking myself for being fooled again. Bait and Switch 1 13 January of 2017 Kempinski delivered me to Beijing Capital Airport as they have maybe three or four times a year for many years. I do n\u2019t mind paying the 1000 RMB cost for this service as it provides guidance right up to the checkin counter and then to immigration. But this time I was dumped on the curb at an unfamiliar terminal and left to fend for myself causing me to almost miss my flight and over 50 in phone calls for assistance. I challenged the 1000 RMB service after an insulting offer from Mr Sylvain Vodermaier that a \u201c future \u201d transportation charge with Kempinski would be discounted. That is laughable Kempinski had already demonstrated that their transportation service was not up to par. so why should anyone consider that kind of offer a reasonable attempt to make things right. I am perfectly capable of doing \u2014 as I have many times over past 10 years \u2014 taken a taxi at any time to drop me off at Beijing Capital for much less cost and stress because I understand and prepare myself in advance. The ride to airport provided by Kempinksi was not only worthless it was an extremely negative experience that almost caused me to miss my flight. If I \u2019d been granted common courtesy of knowing that the usual service was not available I \u2019d have allowed time and prepared for finding my way alone. After a few months Kempinski reversed the charge on my AMEX. This should have been a no brainer. A loyal guest who has stayed on the Executive Floor for almost 10 years is blindsided by a drastic change in type of service and the manager argues the point. Mr Vodermaier should be congratulated for being so attuned to guest needs that he drives the most loyal guests to other hotels. Now I know and will not use Kempinski transportation again. Bait and Switch 2 23 26 June 2017. Another stay at the Kempinski Executive Floor. This time the Bait and Switch involves the lack of Executive Floor Lounge services. Guests PAY FOR a decent breakfast and happy hour snacks at the lounge. But there IS NO FUNCTIONAL EXECUTIVE FLOOR LOUNGE now. The original lounge has been downsized to about 14 of size and breakfast consists of some bread butter and a little fruit. Same is true of the \u201c Happy Hour \u201d that is not even close to normal service. Kempinski tells guests that they are undergoing remodeling but Executive Floor guests should not only be told that the Lounge is not functional but room rates should be reduced to reflect that. Neither of these occur. Fortunately during my last morning my manager friend Tony Liu volunteered to get breakfast for me. I went to the breakfast place about 500 meters from the dysfunctional \u201c Lounge \u201d and took pics of what I wanted. He then walked there and prepared a tray of my selections. It worked very well delivering the quality of breakfast for which Executive Floor guests pay but is not available now without this kind of special assistance. All Exec Floor guests should be told not to expect usual service in advance of registry. Yesterday I visited two 5Star hotels within walking distance Westin Chaoyang and Four Seasons to examine both their Executive level rooms and their respective Executive Club areas. What a contrast. I plan to stay in one of those during the remaining Beijing stays this summer.", "offset": [2113, 2159], "date": "2017-06-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "6a25b2b6-4444-44b0-99ed-1fd2f9671f17", "sentence": "One night stay was very comfortable.
