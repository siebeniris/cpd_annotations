I used to recommend this hotel and stay here frequently when it was the Pan Pacific. However with the new management from the Akyra service has dropped.

In the midday during checking I asked if I could have an extra bed in my room for a guest I was told I was allowed to at a cost of the extra bed and could come back later to get in set in my room. When I returned later on to confirm the extra bed I was told that I was not allowed too and only could do so if I upgraded my room. I enquired why this was the reason as I was told something completely different in the morning. The lady Ms Be at the front desk did not give a valid reason why I could not and told me I had to pay and upgrade my room to have an extra bed. NOT that I wanted to make a fuss but it is a bit odd that I got two different propositions from the same front desk hotel what kind of standard is that. I asked to speak to the manager and she said that she was the manager of the hotel and I had to talk to her. Later I found out the Manager is Christian Zunk. And to add my guest had canceled their own accommodation plans to stay the night on the extra bed however with all the malarky of paying for upgrading a room. They went to rebok and find new accommodation. This experience was a shame really.

When travelling to Bangkok I like to try different neighbourhoods and chose this time Thonglor. Also I prefer newly opened hotels. Akyra is fast taxi ride away from the Shuvarnabhumi Airport as one seldom get stuck in a traffic jam in this area but it is also a little bit off from the Skytrain. Akyra is a fine newly refurbished property but can not match the places constantly hovering amongst the top hotels in this city where new hotels still spring up like mushrooms. LOCATIONMy 3 5 for the location because it \u2019s bit far from the BTS. Thonglor would however be an area to look for an apartment if one was to move to Bangkok and if you need to be in this area Akyra is a fine choice. Hyped as a hip area Thonglor is upscale residential area. In residential market it could indeed be called hip as there are many upscale serviced apartments and that \u2019s what Akyra Thoglor also essentially is. If one was to travel to Bangkok for the first time or even having been to the city several times I would n\u2019t really recommend Thonglor as the area to stay in for a short time. It would be perfect area to live in for a longer but for a person only visiting BK it might be bit off the beaten track. As a bonus being largely residential area there are very good supermarkets a stone throw from Akyra. And many excellent restaurants. Akyra is around 1 km or 15 minutes by walking from the Thonglor BTS Station. This area is also known as the Japanese exclave hence there are several upscale Japanese restaurants in the vicinity. Sukhumvit Soi 55 is quite heavily trafficked so the noise from street may echo to the rooms. ARIVAL3 5 arrival Akyra is bit hidden and it as not obvious where the check in was. Took a taxi from the Shuvarnabhumi airport early in the morning. The driver did not know the location of the place had to give him Google Maps to navigate to the hotel. Akyra is located in Eight Thonglor building where there is El Gaucho Argentinian statehouse in the corner. Google Maps gives is location bit wrongly the entrance is from the south east side of the building even thought there \u2019s also entrance thought the small shopping centre that faces Soi 55. There are residences in the same building. The reception is on the 10 floor of the building. The lobby is a bid hidden when exiting the lifts. On your left there \u2019s the glass walled gym and next to it there \u2019s a a doorway that leads to the lobby. Once in the check in desk is a tucked behind you in the left hand side corner. I was so early in the hotel that I changed in the gym locker room and headed out. When back after 12non the room was ready. The decor is upscale contemporary. It \u2019s not wow interior but elegant and \u2018 timeles\u2019. ROM35 5 because of the noise from the street affects maybe only rooms facing Soi 5As newly refurbished and name change from Pan Pacific Services Suites to Akyra all is updated or mended. I booked a one bedroom suite. The room was long and narrow with the windows only in the bedroom facing the street Soi 55. Bathroom was with tub only no walk in shower. White marble bathroom was elegant. Large TV in the living room and bedroom. King size bed was comfortable. The only issue with the room was the noise from the street. Ambulance or police going by and the noise was very loud. There was also a kitchenette which seemed unused. The bonus in Akyra are larger suites even up to three bedrooms which are affordable for larger groups. POL45 5 for the pool area. maybe not enough of pool chairs if it were busy but otherwise really good. The pool deck is on 11 floor where there is also the restaurant and outdoor bar. The pool deck is really very nice and the pool is bigger than what pictures tell. I \u2019d guess it \u2019s close to 25 metres long. There are mature Frangipani threes is the pool area and also a whirlpool. There are just a handful of deck chairs but at least when I was there the pool area was only used by a few people Compared to some very large hotels eg Millennium Hilton where I stayed last time. the pool area is nicer and even bigger. RESTAURANT38 5 Breakfast is served in the 11th floor restaurant. Good but also because of the size of the place not as versatile as in larger hotels. The restaurant was empty in the evenings. SERVICE4 5 Super friendly and helpful and at times hit and miss. Nothing wrong but they get sometimes confused. Could be partly because of the language barrier. SUMARYIf I could I would give Akyra 37 5 to round it up it is 4. The traffic noise was loud that I was considering 3. Akyra is good but not very good or excellent. If you need to be in this area Akyra is a good choice. However there are plenty of AirBNB places in this neighbourhood. Currently on place 81 in TA I think this is correct ranking to Akyra Thonglor. Rooms are nice but the location could be a factor that prevents this place hitting the top 50.", "offset": [3557, 3637], "date": "2018-04-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "f9d6162e-b658-464e-979b-b9ef9710ef07", "sentence": "Nice hotel.
