The driving was fine although there are very few information signs in Muscat to point you to the tourist attractions.

Without going into details almost everything about Al Bustan was perfect the overall cleanliness the equipment of the room the well kept garden beach area the gym the choices at breakfast. One thing I want to specifically mention As we arrived late we only ordered something for in room dining. I was delighted to see besides the international standard cuisine also some Omani dishes on the menu. The lamb dish I got was very tasty and also came in an extraordinarily large portion and at a surprisingly cheap price. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Al Bustan and will most likely return. As the overall experience was great it almost seems impolite to criticize anything.

We booked 2 nights in a lagoon room. Arrived 3 pm and were told the room would not be ready until 5 pm due to a problem. We were offered a twin we booked a king which we refused.

Plenty of free bottled water and the usual nespreso and tea making paraphernalia. Staff were delightful. So helpful. The breakfast choice is incredible and keeps you going all day. Beach beautiful. Water sports team very helpful and cheerful. Downsides. Attention to detail in some areas is lacking and at this price it \u2019s inexcusable. Untidy areas near the stairs and the stairs themselves are really scruffy. Admittedly most people staying here use lifts but some do n\u2019t and it does n\u2019t give a good impression. They gave us a late check out but omitted to update their system so we could n\u2019t get back in the room. Slight lack of attention to detail but minor point. Overall a very nice stay and thank you to all the staff who were all incredibly helpful and happy in their jobs.

After 2 hours they moved me to a suite with both pool and sea view which was exhilarating. The suite was nice and big but again the signs of aging is unmistakable. But if you want peace and quiet and some needed relaxation time away from downtown Muscat this is the place for you. The property and the pools are beautiful and the walk at the beach was just what I needed. Breakfast spread was exceptional too.

My only complaint was that the kids club was not adequately staffed so someone from gym was watching often and did not follow schedule of activities.

This hotel made a great impression from the start. I received an email a few days before arrival informing me that I had been upgraded by one category due to Mariot status. Upon check in were offered coffee dates plus cookies and even a toy for my toddler. Waiting for us in the room was a whole array of sweet treats including nicely packaged boxes of dates and chocolatesHOTEL the hotel is an old building. A lot of the common areas corridors etc looked quite dated and the hotel exterior looked like it was a few decades old. That said the stuff that mattered lobby rooms pool area restaurants. had all been redone to a very high standard so the age of the overall building was n\u2019t really an issue for us. EXEC SUITE SEA VIEW. this was a nicely appointed suite all rooms have been refurbed in recent years. While advertised as 80 square metres it did n\u2019t feel overly spacious due to being designed as several distinct sections such as a 2 part bathroom and 2 separate walk in closets. I would have rather had an extra 05 bathroom than a second walk in closet. We also had a large balcony that offered great ocean views from our 7th floor location. BEACH. access to the beach was roped off in the area directly in front of the hotel due to being too rocky apparently but the beach to the left of the hotel was accessible. While we did enjoy the ocean views from pool area and other vantage points across the resort from close up the beach did n\u2019t look as appealing. Most guests hung about in the pool area including ourselves while not many seemed to be on the beach. I know there was a bad storm a couple of weeks before our stay. not sure if this played a partPOL AREA to me this was the highlight of the hotel. The design of the whole area was incredible. Perfectly manicured lawns with symmetrical lines of palm trees all centred around the main infinity pool. There were lots of sun loungers around but they were well spaced out and there were always plenty of free loungers to choose from. There were also some roped off cabanas reserved for guests staying in higher level suites. We lucked out one day and were given a cabana for no apparent reason but no such luck ensued on subsequent days. The main pool was slightly heated. There were an additional two large pools connected to each side of the hotel respectively with some rooms having direct pool access but I did n\u2019t see anyone using either of these pools. Rounding it all off was very good polside service. I \u2019ve stayed in many resorts that seem to overlook this aspect but here there were enough people around to take drinks orders etc. SPA. the Six Senses spa is independently operated and is a 10 min walk from the hotel through the pool area. My wife had a facial and I had a massage. Both treatments were decent although we \u2019ve had better. There are also a steam sauna facilities but we did n\u2019t have time to check these out. KIDS there was a completely separated area to the far left of the property with a splash pad large kids pool including a pirate ship with 3 water slides a tiny non water baby playground with some mini slides another playground for older kids and a zip line. The kids club was also located in this area. It was an impressive collection of stuff but even though we were travelling with a toddler we did n\u2019t spend too much time here as it felt a bit too segregated from the rest of the facilities. We ended up using the main pool a lot more there were never more than a handful of people in thereMEALS breakfast was entirely in buffet format served at Al Khiran. It scored highly in both quantity on offer and quality of the food. We also enjoyed sitting outside and enjoying views of the main pool with the ocean behind it. We had lunches polside and most items were very good king prawns especially although the panini was disappointing. Also disappointing was the dinner buffet at Al Khiran. We visited on a seafood themed night but most of the food was pretty average apart from desserts and drinks service was also too slow. In contrast we had an excellent meal at China Mood with highly attentive service. This was probably one of the best meals of our trip. SERVICE this was another highlight. Most staff we encountered were exceptionally friendly many going out of their way to make conversation and check that we were well taken care of. They seemed to really take pride in their work and this was a pleasure to observe.
