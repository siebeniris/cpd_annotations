When I asked if I could be upgraded to the next available room they said it would cost 90 for the upgrade. No thanks. The room I was given an interior room with no view was quite large at approximately 500 square feet. It was well appointed but in need of refreshing as the bedskirt and wall fabric had some stains. The hotels location is great. We were so close to Central Park the Time Warner Building and Times Square. I will say that I was disappointed by the hotels service. Last month we traveled to the Ritz Carlton Naples for nine days and perhaps we were spoiled by Naples superior service. In comparison the Ritz Carlton New York was lacking. However my daughter loved feeding the horses outside and was gifted a Matilda soundtrack which we listened to on our drive home.

When we arrived to our room they had left us a bottle of champagne and framed pictures of the two of us from over the years. Everywhere we went in the hotel we were acknowledged by name and wished a Happy Anniversary. Even at our Afternoon Tea they brought us macaroons with Happy Anniversary written on the plate. One staffer asked if we needed help getting tickets to a show. I mentioned we had tickets to The Band \u2019s Visit on Broadway. When we returned from the show to retrieve our luggage before heading to the airport they gave us a small gift bag with a note and copy of the Musical \u2019s soundtrack. This hotel has small touches down to a science. This is in addition to the beautifully renovated rooms that have to be some of the most spacious in NYC.
