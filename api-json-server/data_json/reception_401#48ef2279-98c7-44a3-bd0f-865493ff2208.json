Overall Islamorada is a beautiful place. We arrived at the hotel around 130 and thought maybe we could check in a little early to change clothes and get out in the sun.

Hm welcome to the hotel. This hotel is just about what we expected after reading other reviews. It is your typical old Florida hotel. Nothing fancy not entirely clean but relatively comfortable. The bathroom needed some serious attention. We knew we were not going to be spending much time in a hotel room so we were not concerned about staying in a top notch facility. The pool is convenient and has a nice view.

The rooms are all newly refurbished with a contemporary breezy marine theme and colors. The girl who worked the front desk while we were there Emily had a great attitude and demeanor. The mattresses were comfy but the double beds were a bit small for two people. The whole facility felt clean and well maintained. The continental breakfast was basic but a nice option. The recreational equipment was new and free to use. Cons. The kitchenette has no equipment other than a K cup brewer and a microwave no plates mugs glasses or flatware. The balconies tend to trap the road noise acousticaly and amplify it. You must keep the AC unit on high to drown out the street noise and it takes a bit of fooling around with the AC remote to figure out how to turn off the very bright. lighted temperature numbers on the front of the unit. The pool is small and basically adequate but once the kids arrive it gets a bit cramped feeling. Double beds smaller than a queen but clean and comfortable. No elevator.
