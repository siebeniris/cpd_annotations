The restaurants have lost their appeal for me and I found them very average this time but again can not fault the staff in most of them. The Captains table still delivers decent food consistently but sometimes the staff become a bit flustered especially when it gets a tad busy. I feel the resort is changing especially as the White Orchid is not part of the AI for Jebel Ali clients yet Palm tree clients spend most of their time in the Jebel Ali part of the resortthe beach is still clean and well maintained even though my he view is not very pleasant.

We were returning visitors to this once impressive hotel. Impressive because the staff were smiley the management visible and friendly and the service was good. This time although a lovely 7night holiday we had a different experience. Offered an upgrade to a sea view room as our booking was for garden view which was an appreciated gesture. Rooms are clean furnished well with plenty of power sockets and Elemis toiletries. Tea and coffee facilities are available \u2013 we clearly liked our tea coffee but repeatedly had to request additional supplies to be delivered. Rooms also have an electronic safe robes beach sliders sandals plenty of hanging space and multi language channel tv. The shower over bath is rather outdated as most newer or 5 Dubai hotels opt for walk in rainfall showers. I think rooms are small and more akin to 4Fod in the main buffet restaurant Ibn Majed is ok but the selection can be somewhat random and I \u2019m not sure in what culture Greek rice chicken tika masala and tempura battered uncooked fish go together. Lunch in the Captain \u2019s restaurant on the beach was lovely because the selection was good with lighter options if you preferred and it was well cooked and tasty. I have a pomegranate allergy and as one of the items on the menu contained these seeds the chef kindly made sure none were in contact with my food. This was our first return visit to JA Beach Hotel in 4 years having tried other Dubai hotels in the interval. We were delighted with the \u2018 new \u2019 infinity pool. Cooled to 28 degrees it offered respite to the hot sun which averaged at 39 degrees throughout our stay. It is a lovely place to chill with one of the pool bars at one end. The pool bars are available throughout the day and only twice during our entire stay and we were on the beach 10 6 every day. did a waiter come around the beach to take drink orders. So we went to the pool bars where the service is dreadful sometimes waiting 10 mins to be served. Nearly always if there were a mixture we noted that the women are ignored in favour of serving men first and it seemed at times that whoever shouted loudest was served next. It is a painfully slow and arduous process which also includes asking for your room number and printing a receipt which needs to be signed each time. Is this for stock purposes. Surely there is a faster way or a way to make serving guests a better experience for them. I \u2019m not in the hospitality industry and I can think of someEmpty dirty plastic cups straws and glasses litter the pool and beach areas daily. Beach loungers are study plastic but the cushions are stained worn thin and uncomfortable \u2013 we were told they were updated when the infinity pool was built but they \u2019ve clearly had their day. We started doubling the cushions on the sun loungers for comfort and were asked not so politely not to do this on Fridays as that \u2019s the day that the \u2018 club \u2019 members visit and there would n\u2019t be enough to go round. Fair enough but we should n\u2019t have to do this in the first place. Since our last visit a fence has gone up on the beach separating the beach areas of the JA Beach Hotel and Palm Tree Court. Pool areas are designated depending upon which hotel class of room you are staying in and swing gates are now in place offering entry exit to certain areas of the hotel again depending upon where what class your room is booked. Unfortunately there was a tragedy on the beach whilst we were staying and from what we observed the life guards and attending staff were quick to react and could not have done more. I know a little nit picking in places but perhaps the management should discreetly observe or experience this hotel from a guest \u2019s perspective. It is a lovely \u2018 resort \u2019 \u2013. but it is n\u2019t 5. In comparison to other 5 hotels in Dubai \u2013 Atlantis Zabel Saray Ritz Carlton and most others on The Palm. They especially do n\u2019t give 7 service as the guy who checked us in proudly quoted far from it in our experience but as I said to a lovely Scottish lady whilst we patiently waited to order drinks at one of the pool bars in true British style we \u2019l complain and have a moan but if the price is right we will be back.", "offset": [2560, 2751], "date": "2016-09-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "8b121bc7-711d-44ed-aaac-a6659b65edb2", "sentence": "Lovely beach and gardens.

Jebel Ali Beach Resort ReviewIf you are looking for a winter sun beach holiday then there is not much to fault the Jebel Ali resort. The sand is soft and golden and it gently slopes into a tranquil blue bay. There is a very large section of the bay cordoned off for swimming which is perfect for everyone from tiny tots to keen swimmers alike. We stayed in the Jebel Ali Beach resort which is one of a small collection of hotels on the site. The other hotels offer larger rooms with large balconies and a wider range of pools to choose from. We were offered the chance to upgrade but did not see a huge benefit. There is an abundance of loungers on the beach and the attendants will come and happily place a parasol wherever you need it. If you do not like getting sand between your toes then there are also loungers around the gardens under palm trees for shade or in open space for sun worshippers. If neither of those appeal there are loungers around the pools so there is definitely something for everyone. If you are after a tranquil spot by the ocean though you will not find tranquility here. The resort is close to the city of Dubai in quite an urban area and is really very busy. Planes cross overhead on there way into Dubai airport the sea plane makes regular take offs and landings from the bay as it ferries people on sightseeing trips over the city. The ocean is busy with freighters coming and going from the nearby docks huge opulent leisure craft are always to ing and fro ing from the adjacent marina together with buzy jet skies and speed boats. The maintenance staff and gardeners love to use manly petrol driven equipment to get their jobs done quickly so chainsaws leaf blowers pressure washers etc buzz intermittently through the day. We found this buzz of background activity added interest to our time on the beach to us it was nice to always have something interesting going on but as I said earlier if you like your beach life quiet then look elsewhere. One morning though the maintenance staff did decide to pressure wash a huge piece of beach equipment right in the middle of the beach using a petrol pressure washer. I thought that was excessive and had a word with them. To their credit they understood my objection and immediately packed up and good heartedly left us in relative peace. Scenery 410As I mentioned earlier this resort is close to the city of Dubai and the stretch of coastline is very industrial. The resort itself is tucked in the lee of a second palm archipelago which was started in 202 and abandoned like so many other projects in Dubai when the finicaly crisis struck. The result is that the view from the beach consists mainly of a large number of pile supports that were planted to support a proposed raised motorway that still lacks its road. These piles give way to a more traditional harbour wall in the northeast and then away in the east is a the many cranes of a huge dock facility. The outlooks are not terribly unsightly noisy or smokey and do nothing to distract from life on the beach but again do not expect views across the ocean to the horizon you can not see it. Food 1010There is absolutely no compromise here on the food. Every single meal we had in every restaurant at the resort was superb. The main buffet restaurant serves an excellent varied breakfast with all the usual breads fruits yogurts meats cheeses and of course a massive range of cooked breakfasts for all tastes. Dinner too in this restaurant is superb with a different theme each night and every dish expertly prepared and always a wide choice. We particularly enjoyed the uk themed night. The beachfront pool side restaurant is a delight and surprise. The range on the menu is excellent. The salads particularly are exquisite light and fresh and expertly prepared with the finest ingredients. This is the kind of place where you wish you had a bigger stomach to cram in more of the food delightsWater sports 710The resort offers a small range of watersport activities for those wanting to add a bit of interest to their holiday. There are sailing boats kayaks and paddle boards to rent. You can also water ski and get towed on a chair behind a speedboat if that is your thing. There is also a Wibit Water Park moored 50 meters or so offshore. This provides excellent fun for the older kids and the fitter adults. We gave it a try and it is a huge laugh although very challenging. Beware though the barnacles and salt deposits from dried sea water can be sharp and my wife ended up with scratches that drew blood. I would recommend long trunks and slevesStaf 9510On the whole the staff were all excellent. They are obviously well looked after and happy in their jobs and this comes through in the happy way they interact with all the guests. All the staff at the water sports were superbly friendly knowledgeable and genuinely keen to help. I took an hours sailing lesson with Ben and he was outstanding. He very clearly explained the complex science of sailing and was always encouraging enthusiastic of my efforts and a superb instructor. The lifeguard spotted my wifes cuts after our session on the Wibit and without even being asked he took her aside and applied antiseptic and soothing cream. In the main restaurant we asked for a table by the window but at that time there was none free so we were sat elsewhere. However a few minutes later one came free and again without being asked the waitress quickly moved us to our chosen location. it is little tiny attentions to detail that really make the difference and make you feel welcome. There were a couple of staff among the dozens we met who were bored and disinterested and just doing their job which was a shame and hence the 95. All inclusive 810We took the all inclusive package which to me is essential as the food and drink is extremely expensive when bought as you go. Our only complaint was that the inclusive package had more rules than a game of chess and was quite limited as to water sports. You can use the kayaks but not the paddle boards if you use the kayaks it is only for 30 minutes a day and then only during certain periods in the day. Very confusing and frustrating. On the food side it is easier with most restaurants covered and the menus clearly indicate what is included. Most drinks are covered including water beers wines cocktails and mocktails. it is only if you want specific brands or more exotic cocktails you had need to pay extra. One frustration is that you have to sign for the full amount of the bill so it is not obvious it is all in. we have stayed in other all inclusive resorts where the bill shows zero for included items and only shows a charge where you stray outside the range. This means there is no confusion and means you get the pleasure of signing a big fat zero bill after most visits to the restaurant or bar. Rooms 810We found the room to be adequate for our needs a reasonable size and a decent bathroom with a good effective shower. We paid extra for a sea view but the balcony was only big enough to stand in and had a solid wall so the view was not visible from the bed and so of limited benefit. I would not bother next time. Wifi. 710The wifi was great in the hotel itself the bandwidth was enough for us to watch the odd movie without buffering. However on the beach it was very weak and more or less unusable. Transport 610There is a free shuttle bus into Dubai city in comfortable mini busses or coaches. The schedule though is quite limited and half of the services go via the Atlantis hotel on the Palm. This adds at least 30 minutes to the journey and for us it was much more as the queue to get off the palm was huge and slow. There is a metro station a short 15 minute drive from the hotel. To me it would make more sense for the hotel to run a frequent shuttle service to the metro station which serves all the malls and the airport. All in all a superb winter break I would highly recommend.", "offset": [2027, 2192], "date": "2016-11-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "64c205a7-4678-41d2-91e6-c9f22bdfb07c", "sentence": "Outstanding Service Great Experience Superb Value.

The trip was arranged for xmas. We have been here 5 times before so to go this time and have the experiences we had was very disappointing. We arrived in the Wednesday 20th December ready for xmas. We have stayed in palm tree court but prefer the fifth floor in the hotel. On arrival we asked for to upgrade to a suite which they said they did n\u2019t have so that was fine. We had the package which included breakfast beverages throughout the day in the lounge and also evening drinks from 6 pm till 7We asked for a price to upgrade which was 20 British pounds for myself and husband. We did upgrade but thought it was very very costly for 9 nights on top of what we had paid. We also asked if we could pay the amount what it would cost to use the jasmine pool no this was not an option. The pools we could use the sun beds are very sheltered very very low to the floor and the pools are far too small for the capacity of the hotel. We ended up on the grassed area no one helped with sun beds or towels. The pools were over run with kids and people there was no where to chill at all. They would bring the kids club to the grassed area daily which they had a massive area for kids so why bring them to where people were trying to be quiet was ridicoulous. The food is very good the white orchid and the manager are really outstanding in fact if it was not for him we would have left Minh sooner than we did. We went to shooters had a table booked for 9 pm went at 8 15 to have drinks first 9 came they apparently did not have a table for 3 as our daughter joined us for the xmas period from the 23rd. Eventually we got a table the meal was great. We asked to book a taxi back to the hotel they said the bus will be here in 25 mins we said no we will pay for a taxi can you ring. 20 mins later no taxi they said but the bus comes soon. We made it perfectly clear we did not want the bus and to order the taxi. Eventually the taxi came when he came he told us it had only just been rang. The xmas eve gala was booked and all set up because of unforeseen weather conditions fog. they had to cancel and have in the restaurants. The question were massive took 45 mins to an hour to get seated drinks were a real struggle too they were not catering for the amount of people they had. The hotel is really tired it all needs revamping the service from some is really poor. The pools are not easily accessible slopes all over also full of children sheltered areas which we do n\u2019t like. The jasmine pool is great for us as it is easy to access and sun beds are comfier or were. The worst part is we are refused but yet there were guests from our floor using that area daily. We finally checked out 2 days earlier as by this time it had gone past putting it right. We are taking this up with our travel company and are expecting a full explanation as this hotel is far from cheap and is not a 5 star hotel by any means.

After some discussion we were given a great room on the fourth floor and I was pleased to see the concrete balcony had been removed and replaced with glass great touch. The cocktail bar on 7th floor previously the only indoor area for smokers had been replaced with a non smoking Sete Italian restaurant and now all smokers have to sit outside which in December can be a little chilly. Our first evening we eat at the Ibn Majed buffet restaurant again previously one of our favourites. one of the reason for choosing JA Beach for a third time was the touch of class the restaurants and lounge areas had sadly this has gone and we saw many men wearing shorts and t shirts previously not allowed and according to the rules the hotel issue still not allowed yet this is not enforced. Breakfast is also a let down and has now become a self service canteen style we had to help ourselves to tea and coffee carry hot pots through the mine field of frankly naughty children allowed to run riot by lazy parents. On our first morning I sat on our balcony and watched the pool attendant at around 630am place towels on the loungers no guests were around so I assumed this was part of the new changes a lounge with a towel on it as I continued to watch it became clear that he was being paid by guests to save the loungers and by 715 there we no lounger left this happened every morning of our trip and in 9 days we never once got a chance to sit around the pool. We booked our Favourite restaurant Shooters and I am delighted to say it was as excellent as ever and Jude and his team should be commended for their hard work and service skills do not change this I begWe had booked Divas and the New Italian however we were told Divas is now a set menu and we cancelled our booking. when we visited the Italian to my horror We were told that having spent over \u00a3 80 and gone ultra all inclusive we still had to pay 50 to eat there out of principal we left. I really do n\u2019t understand the changes the hotel have made the hotel as gone from a classy resort were you have to dress appropriately to an UEA version of Benidorm with no dress standards and very unruly guest with naughty children.
