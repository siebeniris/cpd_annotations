It removes you from the hustle and bustle of the big name hotels in the area. It is literally 60 paces from the Sofitel and a few more steps to designer shopping restaurants etc. To me It is the best location you could have in Chicago. You are a a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue and great shopping to east. To the north you are a couple of blocks from Lou Malnatis Pizza the best deep dish in Chicago or Gibsons Steak House to name a few. The shopping in the area is boutique based with Department stores thrown in the mix down the Miracle Mile. If you are or have a doll collector in the family American Girl is just a few steps away. Whether you are here in the summer of winter it is a great place. Peaceful quiet and relaxing. When you walk into the hotel it is an instant calm unlike the hustle and bustle of the loud convention style hotels. The staff is extremely personable. The doormen are polite courteous and respectful and just plain friendly. The atmosphere is a throw back to the elegance offered in premium hotels in past decades. Two Fireplaces flank the entrance and are as inviting as their sitting area is warm. Quality furniture and detail in each and every room. 42 televisions and in the Suites you have access to a Mac Mini which runs TV and Internet. Regular rooms are well appointed. King Suites include a beautiful Bedroom Separate TV Lounge Meeting room with Desk and pull out couch. Bathroom has both a tub and separate shower with his and hers makeup shaving sink or vanity areas. A feature i really enjoy is the separate heating unit that can be turned on in the very large bathroom to make it more comfortable when getting out of the shower. All totaled I am guessing you have about 80 square feet including the main foyer entrance area. Very comfortable. It has been recently upgraded. I prefer the old decor but honestly this new decor is equally as nice. The in suite decor is far from dull with room accents and appointments in every room adding the decorators touch and feel to each room. The Beds and pillows are not worn. They are plush comfortable clean and always refreshed. Bottom Line Great Hotel Great Value Great Location and Great people. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Talbot.", "offset": [2173, 2227], "date": "2015-01-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "1c1d2e87-4c14-405d-91e4-c9e60c3b9758", "sentence": "Cozy Vibe.

Our one bedroom suite had plenty of storage a large bath and spacious living area that included a sleeper sofa a couple of chairs for seating and a desk. The bed and pillows were comfy and warm and I can assume the sleeper sofa was too since our adult son slept on it all four nights without complaint. I am extremely picky about cleanliness and our room was spotless all four days. My only complaint would be that the turn down service could also include emptying the waste cans and checking the bar sink for used glasses then refreshing them. The location is fabulous and we easily walked everywhere we went in the surrounding neighborhoods as well as Michigan Avenue. Included free Wifi and breakfast for two.

Thank goodness for Trip Advisor because that is how I found this hotel. I booked it for four nights based on the hundreds of excellent reviews and its convenient location. This is an old hotel recently beautifully renovated and decorated in the heart of Chicago an easy walk for nearly everything. The rooms are quite large with warm welcoming traditional decor. There was not anything that was missing in the spacious room. Plenty of lighting an extra large room safe where you can easily fit a laptop or iPad plentiful bathroom toiletries tons of drawer space and a huge wall mounted TV. Keurig coffee maker. Iron. Refrigerator. We had a small issue with the TV reception and an engineer was immediately dispatched. Problem solved. The hallways are short not the long forever hallways in some hotels. It is very quiet in the guest rooms. Our room faced another buildings brick wall which seemed to be only a few feet away so there was literally no view. We were in room 709. It was hard to even determine what the weather looked like from our window. I am sure that there are more expensive rooms with street views but frankly the only time we were in our room was at night. The only possible room omission a power cord on the desk that could hold multiple devices. Our friends stayed at the more expensive nearby Park Hyat and we were often at their hotel. Personally I would choose the Talbot every time over the Hyat. More intimate less austere and contemporary.

The restaurant bar is very nice and the food very good though we only ate breakfast there the fluffiest and tallest PANCAKES ever. The location can not be beat and the STAFF is bright cheerful and engaged. You almost get the FEEL of the RITZ without breaking the bank. we have stayed here before and will surely be back again. it is like getting to visit with old friends again. There is no Keurig or other coffee pot in the room but we travel with a hot pot so that is a little odd. They offer a complimentary fridge so that is nice. it is a GREAT VALUE and we HIGHLY RECOMMEND. we will be back friends.
