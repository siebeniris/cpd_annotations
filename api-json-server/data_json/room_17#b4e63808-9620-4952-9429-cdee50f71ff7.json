Needed a North Atlanta hotel with good access to Interstates 75 85 285. Found this hotel easily. Location is ideal tucked nicely just off I285 at Ashford Dunwody Rd exit near Perimeter Mall. Lots of food shopping etc nearby. I visited two consecutive weekends in April 2016. Hotel is very nice. One downside is the parking lot you will walk a long block downhill to get to hotel unles you valet. Good food at breakfast. They do some cook to order and there is a bar for other offerings. You can add breakfast vouchers to your room rate. Very nice bar as well. Good strong WI Fi in the rooms and lobby. Rooms are very clean had a problem with shower failing my second visit.

The lobby has nice fresh water right when you come in valet parking if you so desire. We ate in which is something we do not often do but we enjoyed the terrace area so much and the weather was great. The menu offers a good variety and being vegetarian we did not have to change anything or make any substitutions. I had the fresh veg plate and it was delicious.

STAY AWAY. Aside from Robert who was great there is no one at this hotel who can provide service or accountability. I did not know it was possible to drop as many balls as this property does. Unbelievable. I spent three days at this hotel AND hosted an event here and not one person made an effort to say hello or ask me about my stay. Alarms constantly going off in the business center echoing into the lobby and the conversations amongst the staff showed that they could not care less. Ice machine was not working entryway light in my room was burned out and and sink drain in my room was not working. When I asked to have these fixed for a second time. I was told by engineering that they never got the report. When someone did show up they argued that the light could not be fixed. 20 mins later a lightbulb magically appeared and the repair could in fact be done. Overhearing the comments made during the repair of the drain kept me away from even looking at what they were doing. There was no water provided in my event space. Buffet items were not labeled identified. Condiments were not provided dirty plates were left sitting and not bussed. Shuttle bus service is a joke. No one knows where the drivers are at any given time. Drivers do not show up for work. When questioned who else could proved my ride was told there was no one else on property. Not two seconds later two individuals walked out of the back office catching front desk person in a lie. Workout equipment is old rusty noisy deteriorated and missing parts. it is been over 2 weeks since I stayed here and the problems with my stay continue to haunt me. Room was to be billed to master account. However they charged my personal card for my room. Was never provided a folio only found out when reconciling my credit card statement this morning. I rarely take the time to bash a property but they did everything possible to deserve this one. I am a business traveler who logs around 90 100 hotel nights per year. You guys have a LONG way to go to even be remotely competitive.
