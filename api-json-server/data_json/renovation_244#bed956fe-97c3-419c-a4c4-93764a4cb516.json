However the hotel is old and the last renovation must have been some time ago. The front staff is a little overly snooty especially Cesar. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 4 pm and was not ready until after 5 pm. They gave us a 25 credit for our wait but gave us no way to use it. When we tried to receive the credit at the restaurant they did not know anything about it. Shortly after we arrived they came for turn down service. I had not been in the room for more than 30 minutes. The cleaning staff is also way understaffed or really slow. They came to our room at nearly 5 pm the next day to make the beds. We had been gone all day and were just showering preparing to go out.

I have to say I was a little disappointed in all the TA reviews here as I booked this hotel solely on those reviews. Honestly this is a very tired hotel with small rooms that smell like your grandmother died in them tiny bathrooms and a small screen TV that can not be swung out at a proper angle to watch TV in bed. There are very few outlets for a modern business traveler to plus all his electronics into. They do not have coffee available for free downstairs and getting your car takes 15 minutes even when you call. The elevator looks like it was last renovated in the 1930s. Sure the lobby looks nice but do not be fooled.

The CotageBoboiOperacafeBrick BelTaco StandWe stayed at Grande Colonial for 4 nights. It was an excellent choice for our San Diego location. LOCATION the location is simply perfect. It has great ocean views and is one block away from the beach and ocean. The area just has a nice feel to it with wide streets and just the right amount of people does n\u2019t feel crowded. The great thing is that are a ton of well regarded restaurants in the direct area. You have everything from breakfast to Thai to pizza. There is also a lot of shopping within walking distance. So if you want to you can just walk to everything and not have to worry about driving or Uber. We also considered staying in Gaslamp Quarter but are so happy we decided on La Jola instead. Gaslamp is nice but just feels like any major city \u2019s downtown. La Jola has the laid back safe and beautiful feel to it. Also the attractions like the Zoo and Balboa Park are less than 25 min away. ROM we upgraded to a junior suite with full ocean view. The windows were huge and gave us a direct view of the water which is always a nice bonus. As for the actual room itself we were n\u2019t very impressed. Keep in mind this is a hotel built in 1913 so even with renovations it wo n\u2019t feel modern. The bathrooms were a big disappointment with small round toilets and low showerheads. Also our room had no door separating the toilet and the vanity area and there was no mirror outside of the bathroom. The air conditioning was also weak. We kept it at 65 degrees every night but it felt more like 73 or 74On the bright side the beds were super comfortable and they had good quality Gilchrist Soames toiletries. Service was very good. Overall we had a great stay at Grande Colonial. This would be a top choice if you care more about location than having a modern luxurious room.", "offset": [1191, 1281], "date": "2017-04-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "3d0b9cb4-8807-4c9e-927f-7354f5a063f3", "sentence": "Great staff in classic hotel rooms need updating.

I came to La Jola after a week in downtown San Diego. This hotel is going through a renovation but the rooms have not yet undergone any facelifts. The rooms are old as expected but comfortable. The bathroom lacks counter space and you needed to lock the door to keep the bathroom door shut. The room had a somewhat of a stale scent but the windows are operable i did not open them but there is the option. The room had a great size for 2 even with a room with 2 queen beds. There was a nice desk and a nice sitting chair. The television was large and visible from the bed. The renovation is necessary and will be very welcomed. The room service was EXCELLENT and there is even a complimentary turn down service. When checking in the front desk males were not as friendly as the females. However everyone was very good at their jobs. I really enjoyed this hotel and you can tell everyone that works there takes pride in their jobs. I have already recommended this to my friends in person and via social media. I would love to be able to visit this hotel again once the hotel has been renovated. The hotel is so close to all there is to see in La Jola so stay here for a weekend of romance or sightseeing or both.
