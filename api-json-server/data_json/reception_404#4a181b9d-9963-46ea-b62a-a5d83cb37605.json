Overall the ESJ was rather disapointing1. The property and pool area were perfectly suitable if not ultra modern2. The biggest problem was a the loudness rudeness of the guests and b managements inability or unwillingness to do anything meaningful about it. My wife and I were woken up many times and at odd hours of the morning by screaming neighbors and extraordinarily loud music coming from other guest rooms. We made several calls to the concierge who sent security up to check on the issues. However the noise would return shortly after security would leave leading to another call. Wash rinse repeat3. we had heard that certain floors in the main building could be loud because of the nightclub below and had therefore requested a floor on floor 5 or 6. We could not hear the nightclub from the 6th floor but the guests around us were extremely loud4. We tried Brother Jimmys the rooftop barbecue restaurant and bar towards the end of our trip. This was a poor experience in general. Our waiter first explained that the restaurant was out of brisket so my wife ordered chicken instead. The chicken was subpar and she ended up spending much of that night awake and in the bathroom. As with every other food option at the hotel it was priced very highly5. The Italian restaurant Picola Fontana had been recommended to us but was an extremely expensive disappointment. The gnocchi was one of the most bland and tasteless dishes I have ever tasted at a restaurant. I say without any exaggeration that we had have been better off cooking Trader Joes gnocchi. The lobster risotto was pretty god6. We spent a decent amount of time in the casino where many of the hotels louder guests seemed to spend the early parts of their evenings. We experienced on multiple occasions individuals trying to bully others at the blackjack table into making certain moves. This included patently incorrect advice such as counseling a stranger to stand on a 13 against the dealers 107. The service at the hotel was courteous and somewhat helpful when requested but a bit slow and not at all proactive. For example the concierge had no problem sending security to check on the loud noise on our floor but took no steps to follow up with us at all afterwards. They instead seemed to assume that their job was done once they sent security up. One particularly honest member of the staff who will remain nameless told us that the person would counsel individuals looking for peace and quiet to stay at the Ritz. We let the resort know of our troubles at check out and to the resorts credit they waived the resort fee representing approximately 38 per night plus tax. However we would have gladly paid the fee in exchange for some peace and quiet or even the ability to sleep through the night on our honeymoon. The resort knew we were on our honeymoon knew we had requested a quieter floor and simply took no steps to see if we wanted to move to a quieter room or to achieve any lasting solution to the noise problems. This was extremely disappointing. We love San Juan and very much enjoyed our meals and Old San Juan and the time we spent outside the hotel grounds. However we will not be returning to the El San Juan.", "offset": [2071, 2186], "date": "2015-03-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "9987e811-6029-4a79-97fa-663b094aa29e", "sentence": "Great but expensive location.

The beach was great but there was not that many things to do in the resort to call it a resort. There are a lot of things to do outside though and traveling outside the resort is safe.

I was a guest at this hotel this weekend from Friday 52 and checked out this morning Monday 525. My boyfriend and I stayed in room 12 at Las Casitas. From the moment we entered the room there was a strong odor in the room which smelled like sewage. Then once we got settled in and decided to take a shower we noticed there was a leak coming from the vent outside of the bathroom. During my stay I called your front desk at least 5 times in regards to these issues the first couple of calls once the operator picked up and I explained the issue I was transferred to another line which rang repeatedly without any answer. After having that happen 3 times in a row I then asked the operator not the transfer me because no one was picking up and told her the issues and again and explained that we were unhappy and it needed to be fixed. Engineering was sent to the room and then he came in and said he was going to send housekeeping. Minutes later housekeeping came to the room sprayed air freshener and left. This alone was very upsetting to me because first the leak was not addressed on the first visit and second air freshener was supposed to be a solve for something that is probably a problem with the pipes completely unacceptable. Needless to say we left the room to head to dinner reservation with our friends trying not to let this issue ruin the trip and halfway hoping the spray of air freshener would be a solve even though we knew it was not. After returning from our dinner reservations we got back to the room the find a nice sized puddle of water outside of the bathroom over the leaking vent. I called the front desk yet again and when I explained the situation your operator responded with they already came instead of a more appropriate response such as I apologize for the inconvenience I will send someone over again to check on this. Engineering showed up again. when I pointed down the puddle on the floor he immediately opened the vent to try and see what was going on. After minutes of him being up there it was explained that he was not going to be able to fix it that evening but would come back in the morning to work on it. He was apologetic and offered free breakfast to my boyfriend and I for the rest of the stay. The next morning we woke up and although engineering had placed towels up in the vent in hopes of stopping the leak temporarily there was another huge puddle on the floor. We wiped up the floor got ourselves together to head to breakfast and a few hours at the beach pool. We returned to the room around 130pm to shower and get ready to spend the afternoon evening off of the hotel property. Of course we returned to another nice sized puddle of water on the floor. At this point I was completely fed up. Coincidentally about an hour later around 230pm engineering knocked on the door and I asked for 10 more minutes in order for us to finish getting dressed and left the room. Before leaving the hotel I stopped by the front desk and explained my frustration with the entire situation and was offered a room change and 3 pm on our last night at your hotel after complaining about the issue pretty much right after we got our room on Friday. My boyfriend explained that we would not be changing rooms as we were leaving for the rest of day with reservations off of the property and it made no sense to pack up on our last night to move to another room and have to unpack again. This morning when checking out I explained this to your front desk staff again who gave me your card to escalate the issue. While we appreciate the free breakfast on Sunday morning and the offer to change rooms on our last night these are issues that should have been addressed immediately upon receiving the first complaint and it was not had we received these offers from the beginning we would have gladly changed our room at that moment. Additionally it was not appropriately addressed on the first visit to our room ie sending housekeeping to spray air freshener and allowing a pretty significant leak to continue for more than 24hrs. I have stayed at several Hilton hotels in recent years in many different areas of the world and have yet to experience the poor customer service that I received at my visit at your hotel this past weekend. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of urgency and how the issues were addressed by your staff. I try to stay at Hilton hotels whenever I travel because you are known for great service and the properties are usually top notch. this one in particular came recommended to me by a friend and sorry to say this situation really is responsible for the trip not living up to its expectations. I reached out to Ms Wilkerson and have yet to receive a response I plan on escalating this to corporate HQ.

Overall this hotel was fantastic. The only thing I would have preferred would be an all inclusive option. The interior of the hotel was glamorous and very impressive. It was always neat and clean. The staff were all very friendly and eager to assist. The day we arrived we were a few hours early from check in time. Our room was not ready and they offered to upgrade our room from a tower room to a garden lanai. We were not sure what that meant but figured hey it is an upgrade. Everyone we spoke to said the rooms were larger and quite nice. When the room was finally ready we went to the area where these rooms were on the other side of the pool from the main tower of the hotel. It was quiet and peaceful and the room was very large. However we felt like we were away from everything. It would be great for a family but we were not traveling with kids and liked the idea that we could come down from our room in the tower at any time and sit in the lobby or go into the casino. We debated staying in that room and when we opened the curtains to the door wall we changed our mind. A garden lanai it was. and all we could see was foilage. There was absolutely no view of the hotel pool water just big green plants. My husband went called to the front desk and they stated they were not going to be able to move us until the morning. We walked over to the hotel to talk to someone in person. We were able to get the tower room we originally booked back and relocated our things. It was a nice room. Clean well decorated and still quite large. The view was nice of the pools and water. The following morning we showered and realized there was a leak behind the shower head that was going behind the wall and onto the back of the sink. The water pressure was very low because of it. We contacted the front desk who sent up the maintenance man who then went to get a plumber. We were headed out to the pool so we stopped at the desk to let them know. They immediately gave us a different room two floors up and closer to the water. They were very accommodating to us the entire trip. The exterior of the hotel was beautiful. It was well landscaped clean and tranquil. The best part of the stay were the attendants at the pool bar. Keith Luis and Miguel were all very friendly and attentive. This bar was always busy and these three men worked very hard but they never left your glass empty. My husband only drinks one kind of beer and as they were closing one evening they asked him if he would be back the next day. They went out of their way to go next door to their sister property ESJ Towers and bring out a case of beer to stock the cooler so it would be cold the following day. These men deserved every tip they received from us as well as any other customer. By the time we left we did not even have to tell them our room number. Great service. My husband and I enjoyed our stay so much before we even left we began talking about when we could return. This was our first visit to the el San Juan but I can guarantee it will not be our last.", "offset": [1803, 1894], "date": "2016-05-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "296cd7b7-ee6f-4434-99bc-3aa5904e7796", "sentence": "Had to do a double take to make sure this was a Hilton hotel. I have stayed in many different countries with Hilton and I have to say that this was the most terrible experience that I have had so far. The lack of customer service was beyond awful except for a few people. Here is a daily account of what I had to deal with Day 1. I had to wait for 7 hours the first day I arrived to be put into a partially cleaned room there was still a pair of pajamas from a previous guest behind the toilet in the bathroom. I was told to check back in hourly to see if the room was ready and while I arrived at 1 pm a room not the room I was supposed to be in was not ready until 830pm. Caira was extremely rude about the process. This was the beginning of the bad attitudes that I would encounter here. They acted as if you were bothering them or inconveniencing them and were rude curt and disgruntled. The only staff members that were polite and helpful were Kariely Marisela Yaisa and Yvone. Customer service is seriously lacking at this hotel. Day 2. We ordered room service. I ordered an egg white omelet with spinach and another vegetable a kids order of French toast sticks and eggs scrambled with cheese. We received an egg white omelet with cheese French toast sticks with no fruit cup and eggs scrambled with NO cheese. We left for the day around 230pm and at that time there were about 4 cleaning carts on the floor. We returned to the hotel around 130pm 9 hours later to find that our room had not been cleaned the food from earlier in the day was still there and we did not have fresh towels. There was NOT a Do not disturb sign on the door because our room did not come with one nor did it have a menu. I had to borrow one from housekeeping. Day 3 We noticed that the air conditioning unit in the room had leaked causing a huge water bubble above the entrance way. We notified front desk and they sent someone to take care of it while we left the hotel for dinner. When we returned to the room the water bubble had been burst and towels left on the floor. No one took the time to contact housekeeping or get a mop or anything to finish cleaning up the leftover water. Instead we were forced to walk on wet towels that were just left on the floor. Eventually Marisela was able to move us to another room which is the room we stayed in until we left. Day 4 Continental breakfast was included in my room rate. I went downstairs to grab breakfast and ate a mini croissant at my table. I went back for another which I wrapped in my napkin to take with me as we were leaving early for an excursion and the staff in La Teraza restaurant started screaming at me that I was not allowed to take food out of the restaurant. They would not let me take a coffee to go as well even though there were to go cups located right next to the coffee machine. Then I was presented with two checks and when I attempted to explain to the woman that it was included she rudely told me to sign it and that it would not show up on my bill. I crossed an X through one and signed the other. What happened I was billed for a continental breakfast as well as a buffet breakfast anyway and neither me nor the person who was staying in the room had a buffet breakfast. We decided to go to the Italian restaurant for dinner as the entire trip was to celebrate my friends birthday. After we order and received our appetizers a girl in our group noticed a small roach on the table. She killed it with her napkin and notified the staff which in turn told her she was incorrect and it was just a mosquito. She then cancelled her order for her main dish as she was completely grossed out. No one came to wipe the table afterwards no one apologized for the insect or tried to rectify the situation. Instead the staff told her how she was wrong instead of trying to make things better. On the last day I spoke to Yvone which would have been the third managerial staff person that I had spoken to in 5 days. I spent more time at the desk trying to correct things and make my stay enjoyable than I did with my friends vacationing which was the entire reason why I was there. Based on this experience I would tell all of my friends who are planning to take a trip to San Juan to choose somewhere else to stay. it is not worth all of the aggravation and continued disappointment from a staff that obviously does not enjoy their job or want to be there helping customers.

All we wanted to do was lay by the pool and relax the only pool open was this apartment style pool with 100 kids in it. I spent so much more money booking excursions because we did not want to be there. Wednesday night I find out our breakfast all week should of been compt. We did get 2 free breakfasts and 400 back but it is not enough. Our honeymoon our first trip alone together was ruined because of lack of communication between Hilton and the third party bookings. I am very VERY disappointed and upset. When they hotel is finished it will be beautiful I am really sad our first time to PR this is how it went. Hilton should be offering a free week to the people this was wasent communicated to. I would of happily switched locations if I known the extent of the construction.

I asked why they were taking reservations for stays beyond that if they knew the resort would not be open. The agent did not know what to say no apologies no suggestions nothing. She put me on hold and never came back. Apparently not all the staff was aware of the closure.

While we are not typically club people we also had a great time at Club Brava. My stay was great with two exceptions. First we were bothered by the insanely loud music that was played by the pool on Sunday which happened to be Easter. In the morning the pool was surrounded by children and an Easter bunny. By 4 PM there was techno music blasting and the children had been replaced by tons of young men and women. The atmosphere went from family friendly to that of a South Beach club. My boyfriend and I are in our early 20s so we do not typically mind loud music but this was beyond loud and disrupted our last day which we had hoped would be relaxing.

Before booking my trip to Puerto Rico all everyone kept saying was You need to stay at the El San Juan. Every single family member and friend said the same thing. I had stood there once myself about 8 years ago and I remember having a great time. And so when we traveled to San Juan we decided to stay at the El San Juan. Although the property was beautiful we hit a few rough patches with our stay1. We booked 2 rooms and when we went to check in their was no confirmation that we have booked any roms2. Our sheets were dirty3. The air conditioner in the room was not working properly it was warm and kept turning of4. The shower head did not work5. To our dismay we had an awful view of a porch beneath us with a mans underwear drying and the roof of a restaurant and lobby. With that being said however the staff at the El San Juan did everything they could to make our experience better. It was 10 am we just came in to our rooms and noticed all of these issues. I went downstairs and was greeted by Giovani who was not only attentive to each issue but was very helpful and kind hearted. He did his best to try and fix each problem and make us happier guests. He allowed me to check out a few different rooms that were available. Unfortunately each of those rooms had some issues from noisy vents to fast food smells but still the gesture was there. He called house cleaning services to come and change our sheets and duvet cover. Unfortunately they took about a half hour to come leaving us with dirty sheets until after 2 am. He also promised that someone would come and look at the shower head and vents in the morning and gave us half price for the rate of that evening for our inconvenience. Giovani was a great help to us and eased our evening the best he could. Trying to enjoy the next day we decided to go buy the pool. I saw these floating mats in the water and a woman doing yoga on them. Her name was Emily and she was a gym instructor who teaches classes in the pool. One of them was called aquafit basically water yoga. It was only 8 dollars for a class and looked like a lot of fun so I tried it out. I highly recommend the class. It was a lot of fun and a great workout. Emily was attentive patient and a blast as an instructor. For lunch we went to eat at Naples Tratoria Cucina Italiana for lunch. THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE PIZZA. YAY. Besides their great menu options the staff is extremely sweet. Owner Katherine Cruz is the sweetest person ever who truly cares about her customers and provides exquisite service to ensure that her customers feel comfortable and have an enjoyable experience. I had a gluten free pizza which was very yummy along with a salad with grilled chicken. By the way the grilled chicken was so tasty. We were able to speak with Katheryne for a bit and she also told us that if someone has dietary restrictions and is coming to the hotel that she goes out of her way to stock up on items that they may not necessarily have on a day to day basis to give the customer some options. She allowed us to try some samples of gelato. Overall our experience with the Napoles Tratoria was outstanding and we were looks forward to eat their again. However our time was up with the El San Juan. Unfortunately that day no one ever came to fix the vents or the shower head which at this point we were over with. It was our last evening there and we just went to bed. The next morning I went down to the front desk to re explain our situation. They were able to give us complimentary buffet breakfast which we ate at their restaurant Ca\u00f1a. We had breakfast their the day before and it was very very good. Our server was Elizabeth make sure you ask for her she is attentive to her guests and very sweet. The buffet is worth the money as it is only a few dollars more than their menu. They also have the best dessert ever Trembleque. It is a must try and is included in the buffet option. It was time to check out and we were ready to say good by to the El San Juan. At the front desk we had Yaisa Lopez who is a doll. She was super sweet and took her time to talk to us about our experience and always kept a smile on her face. She even explained to me about the Hilton Honors Club and was able to sign me up. Thanks Yaisa. I only wished that we were able to interact with her more. Having more people like Yaisa on staff makes the not so great stay at the El San Juan worth itdo not get me wrong the El San Juan has a lot to offer. It is a great place for couples or a girls trip not so much families. It has brand new gym gorgeous pools and access to the beach. There is A LOT of staff on hand and security at all times. I am pretty sure that if you even dropped a tissue there is someone to pick it up for you before you have a chance to do it yourself. There is a nightclub not recommended its more the 18 and older scene and a lot of drunken people in and out of the hotel that do not even stay there which I am not a fan of. The El San Juan is more of a party scene and for action not necessarily to relax.

Everything you could possibly want or need. But what really made our stay so amazing was the staff. Everyone was so nice and helpful but one gentleman in the pool area Jesie was by far the superstar of the hotel.

My husband and I just returned from a wonderful trip to Puerto Rico. This was our fifth trip to the island. We have always stayed at the El San Juan Hotel. This hotel is incredible. We stay in the pool side villas. They are great rooms with a fantastic view of the beautiful tropical landscaping. We have always stayed in these rooms because we love the room the view but mostly because we love Mireya. She has a great personality and always has a smile on her face. She has been working at the hotel for 26 years. We met her the first time we stayed at the hotel. She has been our house keeper all five times we have stayed. We always make sure we have her floor. We now have the pleasure of calling her and her husband our friends. They are one of the many many reasons we love Puerto Rico. The employees at the El San Juan Hotel are amazing. They are so friendly and they just have a special spirit about them. The employees at this hotel are dedicated and really go out of their way to take care of the guests. The people of Puerto Rico in general are friendly and very genuine. It is that warmth and character of the people that keep us going back to this special island. We wanted to make sure we expressed our recognition of the people property accommodations and food. We introduced ourselves to many of the hotel managers. They have all worked so hard after hurricane Maria to get the hotel back up and running. What a remarkable job they have done. It really looks beautiful. We wanted the managers to hear what a positive experience we had and how much we appreciate all the employees that made our stay so enjoyable. Marangeli is the manager of the pool villa rooms. She went out of her way to introduce herself to us. She wanted to make sure we were enjoying our stay. She also took time to talk to us about the Puerto Rican culture. She was so nice and friendly not only to us but we noticed how kind she is to the employees she is in charge of. It is obvious they have a mutual respect for each other. We appreciate the fact the owners of the hotel treat their employees very well. Many had the opportunity to continue working after hurricane Maria caused major damage to the property. Many employees have worked for the hotel for 20 plus years. The hotel provides lunch every day for all employees. The owners of the El San Juan hotel are very fortunate to have the dedicated kind hearted and friendly employees. The employees are also fortunate to have considerate employers. We had the opportunity to met and talk to Landy Labadie vice president of restaurants bars and entertainment. We wanted to let him know how beautiful the property looked and how wonderful our stay had been. Landy sent a personal thank you note to our room to let us know he appreciated our sentiment. The pool and beach employees are very attentive. They check in regularly to make sure your satisfied and ask if you need anything. We stayed for 11 days so we had the opportunity to talk too many of them. They were very friendly and gave us recommendations and advise about local food and attractions. We took advantage of the incredible fitness center. It is two stories and has a roof top workout area. It has one floor of great cardio equipment one floor of weight machines kettle bells free weights and much more. The building is located near the pool and is surrounded by the beautiful tropical landscaping. My husband and I did one of the beach body boot camps taught by Luiz. Luiz made the class both fun and challenging. He is a personal trainer so he was very knowledgeable and made sure we had proper form and we were doing things correctly. We were happy to burn some calories in this beautiful fitness center because we were enjoying the wonderful food we ate for our pool side lunches. We ate the delicious guacamole with root chips from the CANA restaurant several times. The sandwiches and nachos from there were fabulous as well. The Mahi Mahi and beer can chicken tacos from the beach side restaurant were very good too. Our stay at the El San Juan Hotel could not have been better. People ask us why we always go to Puerto Rico and stay at the same place. They ask us why we do not try other places. We have visited other hotels in and around San Juan and Condado but the properties do not compare to the El San Juan. It has a beautiful breathtaking pool area wonderful beach great food very nice rooms unbelievable fitness center but most of all the people are amazing.", "offset": [2344, 2457], "date": "2019-03-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "c70855aa-8e4e-4e14-9a4d-5346df0f2092", "sentence": "Excellent Service Gerardo.

One day staying there will definitely be a great experience. But as of Spring 2019 it is still not. My guess is Hilton recently bought this property and is trying to change it according to their standards so they are not the original designers of the rooms interior or of the views which open from your window. As a diamond member I expected a comfortable room with a window without cracks and with a toilet which you could enter without extensive experience in acrobatics. I guess it was too early for those expectations. But these disadvantages are compensated by the wonderful food and the wonderful staff which tries to help you every way they can.

Again the VIP treatment and being able to share with the staff who are family after your stay.
