Recently spent 5 nights in three rooms at Hayman with very inconsistent results. The good news is the physical property is beautiful and very well maintained the rooms are lovely and it is so big it never feels crowded. There are plenty of chairs and places to sit by the beach or innovative pools. What was infuriating was that at a fantastic location like this the resort management has not sorted out the service and system problems. I have the same complaints that many have written about here over the last 6 months yet nothing has changed. In fact I discussed my issues with on site management and it was as if they had not heard these complaints before. PROBLEM 1 DINING. Our travel agent who frequently books Hayman said we needed to make dinner reservations in advance. We submitted times dates and they were confirmed. When we arrived we were given a completely different schedule with no explanation including 2 nights at a restaurant we did not want to go to at all one booked at the Asian for a 200 person special meal instead of a regular table and another exorbitantly priced reservation for a Christmas dinner at Pacific. All without consulting us. They offered no place for us to eat the first night and we resorted to room service. The rest of the week was chaotic and we had to eat earlier than we wanted. The situation was so messed up I decided to track the source of the problem and interviewed several managers. This is the situation they only set their restaurant schedule two weeks in advance. Since most people book their trips well before that the reservations do not match with the openings. Then to make matters worse if they do not have enough bookings as they did not for the tapas restaurant on our first night at the last minute they close it. This leaves some people with no reservation at the last minute and changes the flow of where you might want to eat when. So when your request does not match with what is open they do not contact you they just arbitrarily give you a schedule based on their availability. that is why we ended up with a plan that had nothing to do with what we wanted. On top of all of this while the service is generally excellent at the restaurants the price is very very high for what you get. There is nothing you can do as a captive audience. For the record the restaurants are Italian good aps horrible main courses Asian very good Fire fancy expensive restaurant and was not on our list Tapas good casual easy but if you may eat lunch there a lot Pacific excellent breakfast buffet only open for dinner on special holidays and is exorbitant. This dining system is the most ridiculous non consumer centric I have come across in my worldwide travels and it is unfathomable that they have not changed it by now. PROBLEM 2 INEXPERIENCED STAFF POOR PROCESSES We had issues with the butler housekeeping and activity scheduling. The pool bar dining and transportation staff were great. Housekeeping seemed to have no system to retrieve problems and act on them. We needed beach towels and called twice the first day and twice the second until I got the manager Lydia involved. She was excellent and amusingly a literal flood of bath towels arrived at the room. There were many many small issues and our butler was helpless. Almost everything he told us about activities or dining was wrong he did not follow up in a timely way and we realized it was easier without him. Regarding activities it is not clear from their website but even snorkeling needs to be scheduled in advance. Because of the butler mess up we were told that we could not snorkel the first 2 of the 4 days we were at Hayman because they were completely booked. Finally they worked out a slot for us on day 3. We were left off on a nearby island with no instruction on where to go and there was no close reef. It appeared everyone else was going to a place that was loaded with fish. Eventually we were taken there Blue something and it was great. Another staff member said it made no sense that we were taken to the first location. Again chaos. If you can not go to the Great Barrier Reef and easily snorkel something is wrong. The reef is only 5 minutes away and they should have a boat shuttling back and forth. To limit guests with a lot of booking and rigmarole makes no sense. At Lizard Island snorkeling equipment was not only free but guests can do it all day every day.

We spent five days on Hayman Island at the One Only just before Christmas. The hotel has been refurbished and the rooms are very well presented and improved. The lower bedrooms now have direct access onto the huge pool via steps from a decked terrace. We were a few floors up in a lovely room with two balconies over looking the pool and the sea. On the balcony there was a very comfortable double day bed to lie on in the day if we did not t want to be by the pool. We were frequented on the balcony by a few squawky cockatoos but it all added to the Australian experience. There is another pool that has been added and a new restaurant which was all good. There seemed to be a few more families with younger children at the new pool and so now with adult children we stayed around the bigger pool which was a lot quieter. The food was very good in all the restaurants but our favourite was the asian restaurant. We went on a helicopter ride over to Whitehaven beach which is absolutely breathtakingly stunning. The sand is so fine here and I have never felt sand so soft on any other beach I have visited in the world. I think there have been some good improvements to this hotel since we last went 14 years ago and really hope to go back one day. It is not cheap though.

MY WIFE AND I WENT HONEYMOONING TO HAYMAN ISLAND JUST LAST WEEK. I CAN SAY THAT THIS IS REALLY A SPECIAL AND REMARKABLE RESORT. WE ORIGINALLY HAD OUR EYES SET ON THE QUALIA RESORT ON HAMILTON ISLAND BUT ARE PLEASED WE OPTED TO VENTURE TO THE ONE AND ONLY PROPERTY ON HAYMAN ISLAND. For starters from the moment you arrive in HTI you are given VIP service. Refreshing bottles of water were given to us our luggage was taken and we were escorted to the hotels luxury vessel. Upon arrival to the yacht glasses of fine champagne were passed around and the 45 minute ride was the nicest way to embark to the resort. Big ups for the excellent service on board for such a short ride I can count at least three instances where one of the deckhands came around asking if they can provide us with anything. We arrived to Hayman and the check in is extremely efficient. I was nervous as many others were on board and i did not want too much time being wasted on que to check in. Instead an individual rep took us directly to the room and gave us a nice tour and we worked out the check in. We made our way to Aquazure for lunch which was really nice and perfect little bites before we sat by the pool. The weather was incredible which really made the stay so much better. The sun began to set and we went back to our ocean view room to view the sunset from our balcony and feed the island cockatoos who were extremely friendly. That evening we dined at amici which i can say coming from a big city like NY i was really impressed with their pizza thumbs up for the pizza chef at amici. We made our way to the Bar where Cory a very knowledgable and energetic bar tender mixed us up some digestifs prior to going to bed. The bar selection was very impressive considering this resort is in such a remote location i was surprised to see many of the options including Zubrowka vodka. The next day we did a 12 day snorkel trip arranged by the hotel. The reef is like no place i have ever been snorkeling. Little insiders tip ask for some fish food you will practically feel like Nemo when a swarm of fishies chases you for some feed. We got back to the hotel and sat by the hayman wing new pool which is so cool. An overflowing pool just a few steps away from the ocean practically feels like your in the sea. That evening we took a sunset cruise which was great the sky was clear that day and the colors of the sky were so beautiful. That evening we dined at Bamboo and man this place was awesome the veggies were so fresh and flavorful again something you would never expect in a remote resort like this. We ended the evening again where Cory fixed us up some cocktails and we sparked up a shisha like i have never seen before really cool as it lights up and was loaded with different fruits. The spa was amazing as a semi pro cyclist I was so impressed with the deep tissue treatment and I have had my fair share of massages. Last note the brekies in this place are insane the selection of pastries is remarkable and the fruits were so abundant and fresh. Will be thinking about that buffet for a while. Last shout outs to Rebecca the night manager and Hari the GM of the property. Who both went above and beyond to make our stay so memorable and enjoyable.", "offset": [1911, 1975], "date": "2015-01-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "fac5d0b4-b913-4556-bbff-1421f162fe67", "sentence": "chaotic and disappointing service not 5 Star.

That said they were all nice and interesting people and there is a huge problem getting trained hospitality folk to work on islands for any length of time andor for beginners to be trained up to professional standards. And it is very much a family resort rather than a romantic getaway experience. We were having a family celebration so that suited us. The prices are high but the bedrooms buildings and swimming pools were grand as was the natural setting. The food was just hotel standard we did not try the special food events tepanyaki degustations wine tastings etc. because they were very expensive and we live in Melbourne where these things are freely available at much cheaper prices. The casual dining at the pool and the breakfasts were good and better value. There were some free activities sufficient for a short stay but special trips and activities were expensive.

When we arrived after 50min. our host Aime was waiting for us and took us directly to our rooms. There we were checked in in a fast and flawless process. We were at the iconic Pool Wing and had a direct pool access suite which was excellent and beautiful over sized and very beautiful furnished. To make a long story short the food at the restaurants especially the Aqua was unbelievable good. The freshness and variety were excellent and the presentation great. The resort activities are super well organized and it is worth the long long trip. The best activity I \u2019d recommend is the Seabob which is a magnificent experience specially at the Great Barrier Reef. The only main suggestion I have to this property is that there are no Jacuzis neither on the pools area nor at the Spa \u2013 which it is oddly. At the Spa they have a small pool but it is far from being a hot tub. Over all it was an amazing experience and I was surprised with the staff attitude.

The staff are absolutely amazing and certainly made this trip one of the most memorable ones we have been on. The just can not do enough for you and are very genuine in everything they doIf you decide to stay make sure you do the hike with snorkel gear over to blue pearl bay. once you get in the water the ocean life is instant and amazing. We found it far more active than heading out to Langford island which is a short boat ride out from the marina. The snorkeling something I had never done before but since experiencing the ocean life around Hayman we plan to travel more to see the worlds ocean and coral life WOW just WOW. The helicopter ride back to the mainland was amazing and provides you with an amazing Ariel perspective of the Whitsundays although only a short 15 mins Although we probably will not go back to Hayman again as we want to travel more if given the opportunity to go back it would be seriously hard to refuse. The restaurants are amazing with various styles of food to chose from eastern western tapas etc etc etc. The alcohol is very expensive so if you can take your own with you do so. All in all as I said although very expensive do yourself a favour and stay at Hayman it is an absolutely beautiful corner of the Whitsundays. Thank you to all the lovely staff we met during our short stay you certainly made the experience a fond memorable one.", "offset": [178, 287], "date": "2016-08-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "family"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "d49f48fb-4310-4df2-8954-b90c7514373b", "sentence": "Overpriced for what you get. We first stayed here around 5 years ago with one child. The experience then was not fantastic but she was sick that week and the weather was terrible so we decided to give it another go this time with three kids in tow. We booked a double room on the ground floor. Spacious clean and well serviced twice daily could not complain about the housekeeping. Aquazure Pool for the families is fantastic the kids loved it. The pool is warm and not deep. Service Variable. All the staff are really friendly but can vary from being very organised to completely having no idea. Secondly if you call guest services you can be on hold for 10 minutes for some reason we never got through on the first call and had to wait every time we called. I had to enquire about 5 times about a semi submersible excursion because they could not get in contact with the water sports department. Food Completely overpriced for what you get. I completely understand its an island resort but did expect better food service for the price. Seafood buffet and the breakfast were very good but everything else was very average. Bamboo paid 300 for Chinese food that you could get in Sydney for less than half the price. Service was amateur. Amici ok the pizzas were good but 34 for a pizza with three ingredients on it I found to be short of highway robbery. Service was disorganised. Aquazure service was good but 35 for fish and chips 12 for an ice cream cone probably a little overpriced i would say. Seafood and breakfast buffet good selection including desserts sweets. The other disappointing thing is that the only option is still or sparkling water at 10 a bottle. Not sure if tap water is an option but every time I asked I always ended up with still water. Another tip is that you need to book your dinner in advance otherwise you will not get your preferred time. Spa service is excellent ocean dreaming spa on the beach was amazing. rainforest massage was completely disappointing the massage itself was great but the location which is what you pay for the cabana is not in the rainforest nor was it peaceful helicopters landing lawn being mowed.

We found the staff very helpful and friendly for the 4 nights we were there. Some of our group stayed on for 7nights. We felt in holiday mode from the first steps onto the boat with the very welcome champagne and canap\u00e9s. Check in being done on the boat also made it very easy to just relax on arrival. The buffet breakfasts were outstanding and no one in our group felt rushed at all taking time to enjoy the view. Food at other times was great but a little expensive however taking into account it all has to be brought in we felt it was not over the top. Drinks too were expensive but again resort prices. The pools were a delight especially the warmer one Azure however most of the younger ones in our group loved the big pool as some had rooms straight out to it. Both pools very clean and plenty of towels available. The children with us had a great time at the kids club and some of the adults indulged in the spa massages and hair salon facilities. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for staff as they handled our celebrations for 2 of the nights even when our dinner on the beach had to be transferred inside because of the wind. Our group had a variety of rooms and all seemed happy with their choices. Our room was in the retreat area very quiet and relaxing with a 2nd shower outdoors. I would stay there again even though there was no view. Any problems such as a jug kettle not working were attended to quickly. Activities. you can do as much or as little as you like. Most of our group live very busy lives so a chance to relax by a pool with a drink during the day was pretty much our idea of heaven. All things considered yes it is expensive to stay here but if you watch out for specials it can reduce your costs quite a bit. Would I return. yes. Thanks One Only for a great long weekend which will be remembered for years to come not just by our group I am sure but the staff as well.", "offset": [1814, 1952], "date": "2016-12-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "family"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "6d4f2244-d9d3-470c-9197-e8e7eb741b0f", "sentence": "Best holiday beautiful. My husband and I spent 5 nights on Hayman Island for a belated 50th birthday celebration. We had the most fabulous time. The resort and its facilities were impeccable. The service was friendly and fabulous. The activities which were included kept you busy if you wanted to be busy. We played squash did a hike and snorkel and went out on the kayak. The staff went out of their way to assist and were enthusiastic. The breakfast buffet was delicious but I would say the rest of the food would only be rated as good. It could have been better and it was definitely overpriced even for a resort. The day spa was a treat and we indulged in the helicopter trip to Whitehaven Beach where we indulged in champagne and a swim before we flew back to the island. It was such a highlight as the view was superb and our pilot was a delight. The yacht transfers were also a treat with plenty of drink and canap\u00e9s. An absolute relaxing holiday with very friendly and down to earth staff. I loved the live music in the restaurants and around the pool. Absolutely recommend it and would love to go again.
