I recently spent six nights in this hotel and was pleased with its location a few blocks from the White House and. uh. with its overall cleanliness. That is about as far as I can go in complimenting its management. Whybecause they have so many policies that signal to guests that they are stingy and mostly trying to milk faceless business travelers on expense accounts. Let us start with the absence of a coffee maker in the room. Next move on to the refrigerator which is stuffed with expensive items that trigger a room charge when one removes them. So guests can not use the fridge at all. Then there was the shampoo and conditioner replaced only once in four days and only after I asked housekeeping to bring more. There is no ice machine on individual floors either so that means another expense to tip the room service staff. As far as the hotels environs go first the hallways all smelled like smoked meats even on the eleventh floor. Apparently this smell comes from the Argentine restaurant near the lobby. Second overall the lobby and room furniture were dated. The beds were HARD. Finally the view our room looked out on a courtyard of some sort with office windows facing us on all three sides as soon as we opened the blinds. It was a dark room too made me think of the law office where Herman Melvilles Bartleby looked out on a wall on all sides of his bosss office and ended up preferring not to work losing his will to live and starving himself to death. If I worked at this hotel I might do the same. The greatest sign of poor management and corporate stinginess however came on my fifth day at this hotel when I discovered that my reservation for six nights was actually only for four nights instead. I had been staying at the hotel for a wedding which had reserved a block of rooms at a discounted rate. The reservations could only be made by phone not online. I had initially arranged for a four night stay but later called back to extend it to six. When I called to extend my stay to coordinate with the six day stay of my elderly parents the agent assured me VERBALLY that all was in order. What a shock I had when I received a haughty phone call from someone named Babu telling me that I had better come and remove my belongings immediately or find myself paying 500 for the next nights stay. What a further shock I had when I found out that even if I had wanted to pay that 500 I could not because the hotel and every other hotel in DC within a 10mile radius was fully booked. I will admit that one kind soul at the front desk tried to help me find another room and even appealed to upper management to relent a little but to no avail. I ended up sleeping in the same room with my octagenerian parents and aunt a hellish and sleepless two nights. Even more vexing was finding out on the morning after the fifth night that the room I had been in the previous four nights had never been rented out to anyone AND STOOD EMPTY WHILE I TOSSED AND TURNED DOWN THE HALL. I had left a phone charging cord in my former and had to ask housekeeping if they could let me retrieve it early the next morning. The room had been made up but no one had slept there that night and according to the maid it had remained vacant unrented. That was salt in an open and festering wound. So is this a four star quality hotel. No. Would I recommend it to anyone. Not at all. In fact I would urge the interested business traveler tourist or government agent to RUN from it. What a sour end to a hotel visit arranged for a hopeful occasion a wedding.", "offset": [783, 895], "date": "2015-05-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "8ced2e23-7e0a-4b97-8938-3b8f09bb506b", "sentence": "10 min walk from the White House.

I planned to stay here twice in August. Once for one night at the start of the month. And my next visit 10 days later for 3 nights. I left a review for my first stay which i loved. I did nt think i d need to write another review for my second stay but i feel i must. I took a risk booking the same hotel but i booked the same type of room twice which was a terrace room. Even though they messed up my booking the stay was pleasant and i liked the staff a lot. They worked hard to rectify their mess up and my issue. They made sure they block the correct room so when i came back for my second visit there would nt be any surprises. They upgraded my booking and gave me a free dinner and breakfast to keep me happy. As i checked in this time round the lobby was so busy but i was seen to quickly. This time the staff was not as pleasant. In fact a bit pompous and argumentative. I had come off a long flight and to be told with an eye roll that no staff can block a room and that i ve just been given a regular room was very upsetting. Made his previous colleagues sound incompetent. After i told him what the staff did last time i remember the check out lady said i ve made sure nothing can get in the way of the booking and getting the room i PAID FOR he kept repeating himself that i d be getting a regular room. He was nt even trying to look into it. Then when he got over his pompous attitude he realised i was right and they had blocked a terrace room for me. Which is what i paid for. He made some lame excuse about why he was being stubborn and blamed the site i booked with typical. The room i chose is dearer than the room he was trying to put me in. The whole thing was just unnecessary and total polar opposite to what i experienced a few weeks before in the same hotel. Moving on i asked for my stored luggage left it with them after i checked out first time round and they kept it safe for me for 10 days which i appreciated. I handed pompous receptionist the luggage tag that i was given last time upon check out. Low and behold a whole different suitcase comes out. I tell the doorman and the pompous receptionist that this is nt my luggage. His response well that s the ticket you gave me. i said it is nt. he said it is. he is trying to tell me what suitcase i own. interesting. Me it s not my bag but if you insist i can take it up to my room and open it i said it with a smile and joking attitude which is not how i should have handled that staff member at this point. i then turned to doorman and described exactly what my backpack was which was a small shoulder backpack not a huge suitcase. doorman disappeared and came back with the correct luggage. Once again the receptionist was adamant he was right and i was wrong and had another lame excuse as to why he thought he had the right to act the way he did. It s just not what you are used to in a hotel the customer is always right. and I WAS RIGHT. He needs to accommodate me and humour me even if i am totally wrong. That s his job surely. He needs to take a huge step back and put on a game face when dealing with travellers. I d spent the last 3 4 weeks in dif hotels in America and no one spoke to me like that. I came down again from my room later on to settle the hotel fees in cash and he proved even further that he was just downright rude. I chose to not deal with him for the rest of my 3 days. I noticed an attitude shift when he asked what i did for a living and i told him. I do nt need to wear my work uniform around to get respect from you. Even a young traveller with no impressive job deserves good customer service as any paying customer. not just who you deem is at your level. Disgraceful. Never had that type of interaction and i ve stayed in better hotels in every single continent. Considering how nice everyone else was during my first stay this was a big unpleasant surprise. Aug is hot month and i got a few bottles of water from a supermarket the fridge in the room had a sign saying if you move something you pay for it. I called housekeeping and asked them to make room for me in the fridge to chill my own drinks they said it will cost me 25 to do that. Obscene. Once again i ve made that request in 10 s of hotels and the response is yes sir. Not please pay 25 to use the fridge in you room. The room itself was perfect and exactly what i thought i was paying for. Spacious the balcony is private and beautiful. Furniture and housekeeping room service all good. Breakfast was great. My only issue with the room is the water pressure in the toilet. It was VERY poor. Same comment with the other room i stayed in during my first visit. Shower pressure is so weak and NEEDS to be improved. The silly fridge embargo is ridiculous and my interaction on multiple occasions with that staff member made this visit average poor. Shame really ruined all the hard work the staff did on my first visit. I loved DC and would happily go again. Would i go back here for a third trip. Not sure now. had the room been a disappointment the 3 star would be a 2 or even a 1.", "offset": [4883, 4953], "date": "2017-12-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "bd6a98a2-cecd-46bb-a234-bf35f371e891", "sentence": "A Great location lovely hotel charming bar great staff all contributed to a very nice visit in DC.

The restaurant in the hotel is actually quite good. We ate there twice in our 4 day stay. A bit overpriced but then everything else is toI used to work at this hotel in 1976. In those days it was a beautiful hotel. There were celebrities and all kinds of important people staying there. The front desk staff was much friendlier the doorman bellman and concierge staff jumped when a guest needed assistance you did not need to ask. The housekeeping staff placed a Godiva chocolate on your pillow after they made your room. Now the front desk staff is very flat. No real interaction with the guests other than checking you in. There is nothing free no water in the room not even a coffee maker in the room. The bellman and concierge only help you if you ask for help. I was checking out and was obviously struggling with my bags. There was nobody who opened the very heavy door for me or offered to help in any way. When I got outside the doorman was hunched over the podium on his cellphone. I stood there for several minutes while waiting for the Uber that I had ordered before he ever even asked me if I needed a taxi. The room itself was not what it used to be. It is old and outdated. The wall around the air conditioning vent was warped patched and painted over. The carpet was stained. They have a mini fridge in the room but you can not use it because it is stuffed full of all the items they want you to use so they can charge you 3 times as much as it is worth. The Madison Hotel has really list it is glamour. And to think I was excited to bring my son here to show him where I worked when I was his age. I had told him how things had been when I worked there and now I was staying there as a guest.
