We arrived at the W Hotel on my Birthday 28th March 2015 at about 1030am and were greeted by very friendly bouncers door staff who advised us the reception was on the first floor. the reception staff were friendly and upgraded us to a room on the 6th Floor because of my Birthday. We got into the lift. well we got stuck in the lift somehow for a few minutes until someone else came in with their card not sure what happened with the lift it did not go up. Anyway we arrived at our room and it was clean and had great d\u00e9cor. I like that you can change the temperature in your room. The bed was comfy and great views over the city. The TV was very slow for some reason like a computer when it has a virus. We ventured out for the rest of the day the hotel is in a brilliant location and its easy to walk to some of the attractions. We had been out for a meal and some drinks before returning to the hotel to go to bed. My partner complained the next morning he was woken up by the fire alarm going off for a number of minutes waking him up. Our stay included breakfast and although we were feeling a little rough from the night before we went down about 1030am. The breakfast area was comfortable and clean and also had a good selection of fruit and pastry options. We ordered our full English too. After about 30 minutes waiting I think they realised they had forgotten us and about 10 minutes later they came with our full English apologised and offered us a glass of champagne. We turned down the champagne we had had too much the night before and asked if they could give us extra time in the room to check out which they agreed. Later on in the afternoon we came back to the lounge area to have a cup of tea and it cost \u00a3 90 for two cups of tea which included 125 service charge on cups of tea. I think this is wrong and service charge should only apply if you buy food. Also I had a drink that I brought in with me and they asked if we could put it in a glass which was fine but then they tried charging us for two cokes which I got them to remove for obvious reasons. Overall we had a pleasant stay and I would return.", "offset": [902, 988], "date": "2015-04-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "be343399-8556-4e03-88e7-22cc43013849", "sentence": "A Great Location If You do not Intend To Sleep. This is definitely a party hotel with rooms that are too hip to be comfortable. The location is great for walking to all the major sites getting half price theater tickets across the square and eating in Chinatown. But the noise from the constant bar scene and surrounding pedestrian streets can keep you awake for most of the night if you get the wrong room of which there are many. The decor is disorienting as well. Most of the rooms do not have a traditional bathroom with sink and toilet. Instead there is a sink in an island in the middle of the room that is right. that is both a desk and ablutions area large enough to keep all toiletries cosmetics hair care products and your computer. The decor is too cheap looking for the hotel price the bed is uncomfortable and the towels are scratchy. The toilet is hidden behind a mirrored wall as is the separate shower and both are difficult to locate if jet lag has set in. Many of the public areas are mirrored or clear glass thereby adding to the overall disorientation. Although the hotel entrance security is very good there may be an issue with party going guests. A female colleague had people insistently pounding to gain entry to her room in the middle of the night twice.

They are just lucky I am not allergic to fish. Potentially a very big error however I had think twice if you suffer from any food allergy before putting you trust in their kitchen. Having sent in an email to bring this to management attention I have just received a fairly badly formulated email completely missing the point apologising mainly for putting a dampener on my friends birthday and inviting me back to take a gamble at enduring another round with their kitchen with complimentary champagne. The sentiment is somewhere in among the words written but I feel the point sadly missed.

The hotel is in a good location however not luxury at all. you are having to manoeuvre your way around millions of tourists who are rushing to the mms store and Leicester Square. Once inside the hotel is nice but it attracts a lot of people who are there to see and be seen at the W The rooms are nice a little small for the standard double room but they are clean. The windows do not open it would be way too noisy if they did. The menus and services list were old and needed changing. it is quite a young hotel but a bit tacky to my liking.

If you are looking for a good fun high quality hotel right in the middle of everything in central london then you can not go wrong with the W Two reasons I did not give it a 5 review 1. The TV interface is woeful just something as simple as turning on basic TV stations was a 3 minute mission. 2 Food options for Vegans very poor I mean 2017 central London and not even having the word Vegan on the menu very disappointing.
