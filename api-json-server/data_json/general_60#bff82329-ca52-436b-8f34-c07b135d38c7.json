My husband I and our 13 year old son stayed 4 nights over Easter weekend. I wanted to find a place away from the maddening crowds that take over most resorts during Easter Spring Break. we have had some bad experiences in the past at other resorts where you have to fight the crowds for a chair at the pool or beach. Not at Little Dix Bay. I can not imagine this property ever feeling crowded noisy or busy. The perfect place to get away from it all. We stayed in Ocean Cottage 50 just steps away from the beach. The room was spacious with a large balcony overlooking the beach. Plenty of chairs umbrellas equipment on the beach. You never have to worry about finding a place to relax or lacking privacy. Service was wonderful. Everyone who works here is friendly and eager to please. We used the tennis courts and health club daily. Great facilities. Again never crowded at all even during this busy time of year. The food was excellent. I recommend the breakfast buffet with omelet bar. We ate lunch at the beachside cafe most afternoons and enjoyed the food and tropical drinks. The resort restaurants are on the expensive side especially for dinner. We rented a car and ate dinner in Spanish Town most nights about a 10 minute drive from the resort. I recommend Coco Maya tapas restaurant on the beach for dinner.

My husband and I have had the pleasure of spending 31 days at RLDB since our first stay in August 2014. We planned another two weeks in August 2016 until we got the email about the closure. First thing we did was to book 10 days this April then I started researching because I was concerned that this was merely a vague way to describe a renovation that precedes a sale. no different that the August 2013 closure of Rosewoods Canel Bay and its subsequent sale and reopening as an independently owned property. On the RLDB Facebok page I am afraid i asked a series of direct questions but finally got a much appreciated direct answer that the closure is indeed for updates and renovations that Rosewood will not only manage the property but still retain ownership when it opens and that no new rooms are being added so the tranquility and relatively low ratio of guests to staf guests to acreage will be maintained. I pray the staff is able to maintain their employment in some way and return. Aside from the pristine setting it is the wonderful staff that we care so much about who make this resort the place where we can go and all of our troubles worries and stress evaporate. They are respectful and kind and take such pride in their work. My last checkout truly humbled me I had left an expensive piece of jewelry that was also a family heirloom our housekeeper came running after us to place it in my hand. We booked only a week last August because we felt a foolish obligation to try Peter Island for a week after one day we realized that there is no comparison between the 2 and tried to get back to LDB only to find not one room to be had. This is a special piece of paradise and my heart is glad that it will be maintained according to the Rockefellers original vision. With this being said I am now forced to find somewhere to travel in August for our anniversary and I hope that some of you can make some suggestions for resorts with very few people beautiful beaches and natural surroundings wonderful marine life tranquility warm staff and buildings that have no more than 4 rooms in each structure.

A couple of things that were upsetting I would like to discuss because it was a VERY expensive stay and long journey and it did not meet my expectations. I am very thorough with my planning and had sent an email prior to my arrival to ensure that I could see and do all the things we wanted to accomplish no one answered my email. I then called your 80 and requested that they transfer to me to speak directly with the resort which we did. I spoke to a woman who stated that she was overwhelmed w emails. Quite astonished as the resort was less than 30 full when we were there. Anyway I told her to look for my email so that I could ensure that we would make sure all the plans could be accomplished. She told me that I would not be able to travel to Anegada as the ferries are no longer running. I also inquired thru the butlers and front desk a few times while there at the resort and was told the same. When we left we met another couple at the VG BVI airport who said this is false that there are ferries every day. they pulled it up on a website and showed me. This is EXTREMELY disappointing as I now will have to come back to fulfill my wifes dreams of seeing this place. How is it possible that I can stay at some a high end resort and the staff be clueless or not even bother to look into it. They actually told me I could charter a boat for 140 or more which I felt was outrageous. So then I asked my butlers2. if they know of any other guests that may be traveling there or tortola and maybe we could join if there was room and help defer the costs and they told me they do not really communicate with the other butlers and basically made no attempt to help in this excursion request. There is no excuse for the many attempts that I made pre arrival and during that this could not have been discovered that we could have taking a ferry for a nominal fee to travel there. What is the purpose of having butlers if they do not help with something like this. When we arrived we met several people too many actually to be quite honest after traveling an entire day I really do not need to shake hands with 8 10 people prefer to just go to room and shower and maybe while eating there and waiting 45 mins for breakfast they could stop by the table and introduce themselves service is very slow. Also they provide free water in the room but charge 10 for the same bottle when we dine there. Really. They gave us an itinerary of daily events and emailed however every time I asked about it and said its on the itinerary they asked me to show them. like I am lieing or making it up. How is it that they do not know there are complimentary boat rides to the beach or give a map or description of some locations nothing. The same thing happened when I asked for the snorkel trip on the itinerary do you have it can you show me. Crazy. and none of those things ran as scheduled and took 45 mins to arrange. So in short I was less than impressed with the disorganization and lack of assistance to travel to ANegada and appalled they would not know this or even inquire. I would like another run at it but for 70 to stay there I am not really excited to return to potentially have the same experience. How can they be so unaware and at such minimum capacity and completely over staffed and not capable.

So poor that we may never return. The overall facilities the location beach and main grounds remain stunning as always but the level of service delivered food quality and the execution of the refurbished rooms was so poor that it made for a very unpleasant vacation. This was the second week of Little Dix being fully operational after two months of a soft opening and we found that there were still many issues to be worked out. Mostly our poor experience stemmed from an inadequate level of training of the staff so that most of the services were slow and poor. The food service staff lacked the context of how to deliver an appropriate level of service. For example one evening it took over half an hour for cocktails we had ordered before our dinner to be served. When they were delivered they were undrinkable and had to be sent back to be remade. Another morning they lost our order and it took multiple requests for the food to arrive. We also eventually started keeping track of how many different people and different times at each meal we were asked for our room number because it actually became funny but the average was at least three times at each meal. Overall the food quality at the Pavilion was weak and the lack of chardonnay anywhere on property seemed quite odd and disappointing. The food quality on the tapas menu at the sugar Mill however was actually quite good. The rooms have all been refurbished but we were very disappointed with both the design and quality. The mattress was very uncomfortable. We travel all over the world and sleep in hotels more than 100 nights a year. This is the first time that we have encountered a mattress we would consider worth complaining about. The HVAC system was also incredibly loud and was not well calibrated. Finally the design and decor of the room was disappointing. There was virtually no closet or drawer space which seems poor planning since many customers would stay for several nights or a week. There was more space dedicated to a mini bar station than to closet space. The decor was extremely generic and could be found in any hotel anywhere. We miss the way the rooms were previously designed with an eye towards a west indian vibe. Also missing were any kind of outside footbaths or system for rinsing sandy feet. The previous version of the rooms had this and it seems to be a major oversight in a high end beach resort room. The butler program which is intended to be a luxurious amenity was actually so poorly executed that it made our visit worse rather than better. The butlers did not give us an adequate introduction to the property room services etc. upon arrival and had we not been there before we would have been totally lost. Then when we did seek to use their services we had trouble finding them and getting any sort of timely response. However we kept being channeled through the butler whenever we wanted to book anything but we could find him and then we we did he never came back to confirm one way or the other whether he was able to arrange for what we had asked so we would have to track him down again for the follow up. In any event our butler experience was totally unacceptable. While not unavoidable it was also frustrating to have all the water out on the property one evening right before dinner so that we were not able to shower.

The overall property looks great and the room was wonderful though there a couple of small things that could be tweaked to make the stay a bit better. The disappointing part. The staff overall was great hardworking well meaning and friendly. There were two notable exceptions. First the butler who was assigned to our room was simply missing in action. On the day of our arrival we were greeted by the butler. She escorted us to our room and asked about dinner. We said 7 pm at the Pavilion and she said she had make the reservation and come by about ten until 7 to walk us over. She never showed up so finally at ten after 7 we walked over to the Pavilion by ourselves. And there was no reservation. The next day she again asked about dinner reservations and we said 8 at the Reef House. We arrived at 8 and there was no reservation. They were able to fit us in so it was not a significant issue. And from that point on we started going directly to the front desk to make reservations and the only problem we had there was on our last night we requested dinner at 8 at the Reef House and when we showed up there was no reservation not the butlers fault. We had also asked the butler about arranging a car rental for Tuesday. We went to the front desk area at the time we agreed on 11 am and the butler was finishing up with someone while we waited. She then excused herself to check on the car and became clear after about a half an hour that she had dropped the ball again but was able to arrange for the car. On the afternoon of our last day we returned to the room after being at the beach and found a bucket of ice on the table. We had not ordered it. My wife ordered some room service and when it was delivered she asked the woman about the ice. She said that the butler was supposed to be providing it everyday. When my wife told her this was the first time we had received any ice the woman said something along the lines of somebodys been slacking. So our overall experience with the butler service was not great. The second disappointment was with the dining service. And we both basically agreed that the servers had simply not been trained properly. We do not know if that is because there was a rush to open the resort and there just was not time or if this is as good as it gets in the BVI. Hopefully the former. One quick example. The wine service was sloppy. The the server finished pouring a glass he she just pulled the glass away dribbling along the way. And because the tables are mostly wooden slats there were several occasions when the wine dripped through and onto our feet fortunately never hitting our clothes. As I said the staff seemed well meaning but they just did not seem to know what to do. I do want to add that our housekeeper was great and the young man Devon. who served us on the beach was also wonderful. And the spa was also a great experience. Beyond the staff issues the food service itself left us unimpressed. There were a few good dishes but by and large the food was just not what we expected. One example was the eggs Benedict. I had it three times and it was consistent. The muffin was so over toasted that it took a fair amount of pressure to cut through it. The bacon was paper thin. The egg whites were typically translucent not cooked enough. And the hollandaise not a sauce but more like a dollop of sour cream glopy. And this is just one example. So is this a training issue or is there just a skilled labor problem that is part of life in Virgin Gorda and throughout the BVIWe also felt like the menu offerings were a bit strange trying too hard to do something different but then falling short on execution. And the wine list particularly by the glass across all three restaurants was too limited. No opportunity for each restaurant to express itself. I assume the resort has a sommelier that could work with each location to create separate wine lists or at least have a couple of unique offerings per location. The beach food service could probably be expanded a bit more finger foods. And the distance from kitchen to the customer makes it difficult to deliver fresh and not food. I do not know how you solve that problem other that to add another kitchen facility further down the beach or cut back on the foods eg French Fries. that require hot delivery. Just before we left for the trip I read some of the reviews on TripAdvisor and I told my wife I do not want to be one of those people. I think private feedback like this is more appropriate and is hopefully more helpful. We are looking forward to a return visit post CoronaVirus. in a couple of years and we hope that things will have stabilized with respect to some of these issues. Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback and let me know if you need any more information.

I did not like the furniture as. it was low to the ground and not comfortable for a person like me who is 64. I felt like I was in munchkin land. Negative aspects Room service was spotty. We had breakfast in our room each day and during our 8 day trip 3 of the breakfasts were not right. They had either the wrong or incomplete order. Very frustrating to get coffee but they forget to bring coffee cups. Restaurants. The hotel has three restaurants. Our favorite was the Reef which is at the end of the pier where the boat docks. We had a few meals at the Pavilion but we did not find the food as good as the Reef. Another problem with the Pavilion is that most of the dining chairs are too low to the ground. Again not comfortable for a person of my size. Butler service. This is something new to me where literally everything you do in terms of meal reservations special requests breakfast orders go through this one indivdual. Personally I did not like it. Much prefer the old way where you have a concierge desk. etc. Also in our case we were going back to the USA on a private jet from the Tortola airport and I asked our butler where the private jets leave from. He told me to go to the main terminal and our pilots would find us. Fortunately on the way over we checked with our van driver who took us from the LDB boat to the airport and he took us to the FBO which was before the main terminal. Had I not checked with the van driver we would have been let off in the wrong place. Last point. We had an ocean view suite but did not realize at the time of booking that this would be on the second floor of a two story building. My wife who is physically challenged had a very difficult time getting up and down the stairs especially since there were no hand rails. In the future we will insist on a ground floor room. I truly hope LDB gets their act together as we would like to return.", "offset": [0, 35], "date": "2020-03-17 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "6b2ba455-6944-4bcb-95b6-00d3a2282f1b", "sentence": "There were many issues with our stay.

The restaurants wereMising our reservation a couple of our nights and the service was slow and we always had to ask for our check. Finally the communication regarding g our check out and boat ride to Tortola was terrible. We were given the wrong time to be at the boat.
