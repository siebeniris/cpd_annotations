All of my expectations were met and then some. I read other reviews that stated the hotel was dated. I am not sure what they were talking about because I thought the hotel was clean and updated. My son enjoyed swimming in the huge pool and hot tub. The room was spacious and nice enough for our purposes. Maybe only minor complaints were the wifi was not free and the bathroom was a bit cramped. Beds were very comfortable and pillows sufficient. There were several restaurants in the lobby and we ate dinner at the sports bar. Very good food but a little on the high side price wise. Typical 15 dollar burger and 10 big beer type of place.

A note of caution They are in full renovation swing at the hotel starting with the high floors first. I ended up on the 16th completed renovation and they were working above me during the day on Saturday. From 9 am till at least 1. it is loud. BUT I am in a renovated room and it is fantastic. I hope all Mariot properties adopt this bedding. An actual comforter and crisp sheets. The bathroom is sharp and modern with Kohler products I grew up in Kohler Wisconsin. I take pride in the products of my hometown haha. I ordered room service after a long day of flying and the young lady who took my call was extremely friendly and made a few suggestions for me. Food was on time as ordered and great. Also ate at the sports bar in the lobby. Again fantastic service this time provided by Nick. Typical bar food and was great.
