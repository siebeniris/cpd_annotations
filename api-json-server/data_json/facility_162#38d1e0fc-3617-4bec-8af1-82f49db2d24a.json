I am an Acor Club Platinum member which means I have probably spent years in Acor hotels and I am glad to say that I have seldom needed to complain until earlier this week when I had the misfortune to spend three nights over the New Year period in a building site with a sign outside saying Novotel Anecy Centre Atria a Novotel I have stayed in a number of times in the past and was very much looking forward to a New Year break. Instead I needed to find the \u201c Temporary \u201d hotel entrance on the other side of the building from the car park entrance navigate my way through the office block corridors to the lifts to take me to the temporary reception. Although the reception staff themselves were very welcoming the hotel is in an extremely sorry state our \u201c Executive \u201d room was very tired with the furniture stained and grubby and the heating AC operated with a mind of its own I could not control it at all. My wife was very cold during our first night but by the middle of the night the heating had come on with no input from us and the room became too hot. When we checked into the room the alarm bells should have rung when I noticed that while the A C was switched on the temperature control had been set to 30 degrees and it was still cold. All of this was after negotiating three separate lifts to get from the car park to our room on the fourth floor. The hotel restaurant temporarily located in a soulless function room on the first night of our stay Dec 30th the food was very good but the service was pretty ropey. On the second night New Year \u2019s Eve both the food and the service were excellent but on our third night the food and service were both terrible. I think it is worth noting that the waiting staff on New Year \u2019s Eve was different to the other two nights much better and more efficient. In my considered opinion this hotel should close immediately not to reopen until the renovations have been completed or alternatively any on line enquiries or bookings should carry a highly visible warning that the hotel was undergoing major renovation resulting in considerable disruption to the service they can provide. A total of 693 \u20ac for three nights and three dinners for two in a building site is not good enough. In future I will be making very detailed checks on any Acor hotel I am thinking of making a reservation in.", "offset": [690, 948], "date": "2019-01-03 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "6c57cbec-8b80-4646-9c09-381078e46626", "sentence": "Director of Cisco System.
