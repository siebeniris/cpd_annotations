I really got my hopes up when the woman at check in told me I was being upgraded to a king bed. It was not until we got to our room that I realized the pictures online are wildly misleading and the quirky decor and artwork is simply a decoy to hide the fact that this hotel is overcharging you. The room furniture and desk had a surprising amount of scratches on it. If I took a black and white picture of the room it would have been no different than the basic hotel worth 7510 a night. The bathroom was as boring as a college dorm room. The pool has some cool artwork but it is super tiny and does not get close to making up for my disappointment. Essentially I have no idea why this place charges the rate it does. My review might be harsh but I compared every place in the 17525 price range this one actually seemed like the best place to stay. But alas this boutique hotel is simply designed to mislead you with it is aesthetic and trick you into thinking it is fancy and then charging you accordingly. Most of my grudge stems from the fact that I booked it with high expectations. It was supposed to be the one night we splurged on our trip to Hawaii.
