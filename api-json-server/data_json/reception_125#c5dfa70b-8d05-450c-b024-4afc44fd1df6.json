We also requested a bottom floor and handicap room. When we got there we were told there were none available. We had a bad time getting around. This place was nasty. Check out my pics. I did not feel safe in this parking lot either. We could not get the cable to work on the tv. The fridge and microwave were unplugged. I had to move the furniture to plug in the extension cord.

That room had a flashing phone that never stopped blinking brightly during our entire stay even though the front desk staff tried to shut it off a cracked toilet a TV remote that did not work the blow drier had fallen off the wall in the bathroom and a heater that only had the settings full A C and full heat. Garbage sat in the halls throughout our stay. The bathrooms do not have fans in them which leads to them always being damp and the ceilings are molding and discoloring.

I pulled to the front of the door and had to back all the way out because the staff had their cars parked right in front of the door. The lady at the front desk had the nastiest attitude. I do not remember her but she has full lips a ring in her lip she smokes cigarettes and drives a silver altima that is beat up along the side. the Hall way smelled horrible and the elevator was worst. The front desk agent stressed the fact that there was to be no smoking. but the hallways reaked of cigarette smoke. Everything appeared to be out of order. The recycling bins etc were nasty as hell. We booked at about 1 pm and came back around 3 and our room was still being cleaned. The housekeeping lady was very nonchalant but she did try to call the front desk and no one answered BC the staff was outside smoking. We had to walk all the way back to the front desk.
