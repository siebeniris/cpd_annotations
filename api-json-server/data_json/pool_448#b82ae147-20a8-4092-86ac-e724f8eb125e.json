We were very disappointed in the hotel which was really a motel. The pool area was nice as was the view. The room however had a bad smell and had fruit flies. When we complained about the fruit flies a worker was sent to our room with a can of bug spray. Unhappy with that resolve we asked for a different room. When we got to the new room the room smelled as if it had just been sprayed with bug spray. We asked to be given a refund so that we could find a different hotel. Management was kind enough to give us the refund which was credited to Expedia. The rooms furnishings left much to be desired.

I was disappointed to find out that it was wrongly advertised on the third party website that they provided rolaway beds. we were told this upon check in rudely I might add that they have never offered rolaway beds in the history of the hotel. Regardless we did not let this ruin our trip and simply squeezed ourselves in the room. The bathroom was spacious which was helpful in the double room. We also enjoyed the restaurant downstairs and being able to relax at the pool. For the price it was very reasonable and pretty much exactly what you would expect for what you paid.
