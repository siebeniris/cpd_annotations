As many others have mentioned it is quite contemporary in decor and feel but it is looking a bit worn in places. Some things are not terribly functional \u2013 the lack of a closet and absence of comfortable seating in the room \u2013 but the bathroom was great with decent counter space and the bed was very comfortable. It had the slowest Wi Fi in the world \u2013 we finally gave up and went down to use the public computers in the lobby. The pool area was nice but could use additional seating. The heating air conditioning was a bit problematic. We set the thermostat for 70. It would warm up to 70 and then the temperature would drop down to 63 leaving us shivering before kicking in to bring it back up to 70. This went on all night which did n\u2019t give us a very restful sleep. The staff was great \u2013 very friendly and helpful. They had a terrific recommendation for dinner which was n\u2019t among the many chain places within walking distance but their shuttle bus took us there and brought us back which was very convenient.

Enjoyed our visit to Aloft and have used their properties in the past so we were somewhat aware of what to expect. Love the fresh smell when entering the property. Inviting to a modern feel. A few disappointments that we experienced but were in no way a negative to our overall stay. Could be some things the managers can take note of so that others are not experiencing these same things. Since the pool is outdoors they have a dawn to dusk only policy. So no pool after a long hot day we used it to start our day the next morning. The door to our room was cracked open when we arrived around 8 pm. Went in anyways and everything seemed clean and normal. When we went to get ice the ice tongs were covered with some sort of blue material. gross. The beds were very comfortable and the air unit has a fan that you can have on constantly to drown out some of the noises in the hallway. Had a late check out arranged and our do not disturb sign on the door but staff knocked anyways 15 minutes before we were scheduled to leave to ask when we were checking out.

Super close to the Jacksonville airport which was the main reason I chose the property. The front desk staff was nice and polite and let me know it would be busy due to the GA FL game that day. The room I had on the 3rd floor was in decent shape aside from the disgusting mold on the ceiling see photos. When I brought it to the attention of the staff they just shrugged and said they would look into it. They did not look into it during my stay but I should hope they have fixed it by now. The property is located adjacent to several strip malls with everything one could need including shops and chain restaurants. You could get by without a car as the property also offers a shuttle within a certain radius and some of the fast food places are within easy walking distance. The fitness facility 24 hours was well equipped. I did not use the pool but it looked nice. The lobby has some amenities including bagged ice for the room and some food items for sale. Overall I am giving this a three star review. I feel the condition of the room deserves much lower than this and I would probably not stay here again due to the way this was handled by the staff.

Booked this hotel because we wanted access to the beach restaurants and shopping. Awesome location. Pleasant staff. However the rooms decor and simple things offer at competitive hotel locations were a disappointment. There were no toiletry kits in the room. It looked like the room was thrown together and not properly cleaned. The bathroom area contained a stand up shower that allowed water to end up all over the floor. Not to mention the low water pressure of our toilet. The room itself is in dire need of a facelift from the nicks in the wallpaper the headboard the tattered old carpet. Our remote malfunctioned there was no channel guide in the room. We had to request extra face towels there was only one. We could not take our toddler to the pool because the pool and ourside area was filthy. All in all I get the theme this hotel was trying to go for with style.

I \u2019ve been a Mariot member for many years stay at a Mariot owned hotel once a month on average in various locations. And while the \u201c fun \u201d and \u201c funkines \u201d of the Aloft lobby yes there is a bar and game tables and pool area is unique I was sorely disappointed in the basic care and amenities. First the hallways were not clean. I \u2019m assuming this is due to rare vacuuming and the pets. Secondly the only blanket in the room is one on the bed so thin that you can see through it. Even turning the heat on yes it gets cold in FL it did not make for a comfortable sleep. If you request another one it \u2019s the same kind so ask for twoThird. if you like to enjoy a glass of wine in your room but need access to an opener they do n\u2019t keep one at the front desk or with the concierge or even housekeeping. The only available wine opener is the single one behind the bar. So you will have to take your battle to the bar to be opened by the bartender if they can find the opener. which they could n\u2019t. and there is only one. Finaly while someone came into my room and made the bed and took the towels used and unused they did not clean wipe down anything vacuum restock the coffee nor did they replace any of the linens. Which is really inconvenient when you return from a 12 hr work day start to undress for a shower only to find all the towels and washcloths are gone as was your spare see through blanket. One would think that they could just contact housekeeping to bring them towels however in the evening and night hours Aloft only has 2 people on staff the front desk and shuttle driver. So if driver is out your happy but has to get redressed and go to the front desk to pick up towels. Thank god the single persons that worked the desk are so nice as they are having to handle so many customers and needs all aloneOh and just a travel tip note \u2014 no reheating of food is available in this hotel. And bath products is soap and shampoo only no conditioner lotion etcI came away feeling as if all the bling and \u201c fun \u201d in the lobby is to distract you from noticing the missing Mariot standard.
