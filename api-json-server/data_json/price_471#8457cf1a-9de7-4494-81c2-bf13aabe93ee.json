We had Christmas lunch at the hotel yesterday and I was very disappointed. When I worked for the group in the late 80s early 90s the Shangri la Singapore was ranked as the 3rd best hotel in the world. While it still looks good the service level in the restaurant is not what it used to be. The special menu for Blu was advertised as having 4 entrees but in fact it was one. They fixed a fish they called rainbow trout as an alternative but it looked and tasted like salmon. even though I know they are similar this was way to close to call. Additionally it seems every item had alcohol in it with no substitutes. On top of that the staff tried to convince me it was okay to drink or eat it anyway not very smart and surprising for a place with so many muslims. Then to add insult to injury they charge SGD 240 for two iced lemon teas outrageousOn the good side the turkey entree was very good and the portions were generous.

Also like that staff was always quick to bring amenities such as baby soap up to room when needed. Negatives1. I think you are understaffed for breakfasts. High chairs are not cleaned and either service is quite slow staff is still not well trained enough for example when seated no one takes order for coffee tea 2. Have more play options for children. I think u can do with a free outdoor playground and not bundle it with buds. Given your location nestled in the woods and being somewhat near but not too close to Orchard and having such a wonderful range of dining options and excellent hardware of rooms lobby your hotel makes a great choice for many families wishing to stay here. But I think without Buds there is practically nothing a kid can do besides the short baking classes. Even your swimming pool is not exactly kids friendly unlike your sister property Rasa Sentosa. Hence I think it is in your favour if you would increase the range of options for kids activities. 3. Lastly I think you should further integrate the payment options for Golden Circle members. I was not aware that GC members can not pay for the FnB spends at check out with the GC points which was a very big surprise to me. It was not pleasant for me to have forked out extra cash when I already have a sizable pool of points I wanted to use notwithstanding that there is an expiry date to the use of GC points and was mentally prepared to pay with it. Most of your hotel guests dining using your hotel facilities will quite naturally charge to the room. And a sizable portion of your guests will also likely be GC members. I think it makes sense for you to integrate such payment options at check out. Or at least have the restaurant staff cashier to offer the use of GC points at payment and pre warn guests who choose to pay by charging to rooms that they will unable to use points at check out. I did not like I was only made aware of this fact at check out.

Please make updates to your system so that the reality of the situation is reflected in your check in computers and so your staff are aware of your guests that have already paid for their room in advance.

The front desk misled us by insisting the corporate rate 295 night does NOT include breakfast that we have to pay extra 60 person at least to get a breakfast when we checked in. Too late to found out that it should have been included when we were checking out through the guest officer. In fairness they agreed to deduct the breakfast rate but I did not gain any from that because it is a business trip stay. I could have trade the money for convenience but the major disappointment was misleading information. 3. Hotel is not accessible to conveniently grab something to eat or buy essentials.

Room amenities were excellent staff were very friendly and welcoming and polite and the premises were well kept. My children loved the tent in the room and playing at BUDS. And the early check in and late check out were very much appreciated. We were slightly disappointed that the outdoor play area was shut for repairs. We were not informed about it at check in and only found out when we were exploring the hotel in search of outdoor play for the children. It is completely understandable that the hotel is sprucing up its premises during this lull period but I \u2019d like to point out that perhaps keeping the outdoor areas open and the indoor ones shut may be a better idea in this current situation. I had reservations on allowing the children to pay in BUDS but put my faith blindly in Shangri La \u2019s reputation that the area would be well disinfected and took our own precautions as well. Another thing I \u2019d like to point out is that we were surprised that the Line did not have proper crockery for our children. They were offered plates and a small bowl but only a teaspoon accompanied those instead of the usual set of plastic fork and spoon we are used to receiving. Surprised since there is a floor just for children and an indoor playground which does mean that there is a market for families with young children. Small touches like these are usually much appreciated by parents like us. Overall we had a great stay.
