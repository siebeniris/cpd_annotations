This is a large beachfront convention resort. It recently underwent a complete renovation. One tower is still being built but fortunately it does not affect any of the activities. We arrived around noon so our room was not ready. We were offered 20 percent off lunch while we waited. About 30 minuets later while we were eating we were notified that our room was ready. We were on the 8 floor with a nice gulf view overlooking the main pool. The room was spacious clean and had a balcony. Overall the staff at this hotel was among the best trained we ever experienced. Everyone was friendly and offered assistance. Service was excellent The breakfast buffet was excellent but at 30 p very expensive. We had pizza at Pazi a causal Italian eatery. It was good. The frozen yoghurt place was also good but charges by the ounce. There is a fire dancer who performs at sunset each evening. The main pool is huge but even with this being off season was always very crowded. There were no restrictions on jumping ball playing floats etc so it was no a very relaxing experience. The beach is beautiful. We saw many with beautiful shells they found we did not have that luck. The water was warm and calm. Umbrellas rented at 30 per day and twice we were just led to chairs that were vacated by others. There is a weekly activity sheet with different crafts and a number of fitness classes each day. There is An optional 30 per day resort fee which included wi fi 2 fitness classes 2 for 1 breakfast buffet and beach umbrella The only negatives were check in and check out both of which were incredibly slow. There was not 1 line and desks were on both sides of the lobby so associates sent you back and forth. After walking back and forth 3 times we asked why we could not just wait in 1 place. Once we were at the desk it took at least 20 min. Check out was worse. Also since we had an evening flight we were told we could use lockers near the pool. We had to leave a 40 deposit for the 2 keys one which did not work. It took close to 45 min to check out and get the keys.

My wife and I spent seven nights here on vacation. This was our third trip to Marco Island but our first time staying at the JW. The first two stays were at the Hilton down the beach and we had reservations there for this trip too but they did not honor them because the place is STILL undergoing renovation. While they did pull the rug out from under us and I will not forget that they may have done us a favor. Fortunately we were able to book the JW for the exact same dates albeit at slightly higher cost. We felt fortunate in not having to change vacation weeks rebok flights and rental car etc so we paid the extra money. The Excellent. First off housekeeping services were magnificent and far better than anything we ever got at the Hilton. It seemed like no matter when we went to the room between 9 and 4 it had been expertly serviced. No issues at all which is rare these days. Second room 60 was very nice with a good bed awesome bathroom shower with good pressure nice LG flatscren TV 60 inch maybe excellent AC system newer furnishings and a great lanai with two wicker chairs and a table. We put those to good use in the mornings before hitting the beach and in the evenings after dinner especially at sunset. Ah yeah. Third the staff. Austin and Kayle both served their purposes very well actually leading us to a couple destinations on the property that we were unsure about. Indeed every staff member we encountered had a smile and a greeting for us. Again rare these days. Fourth the beach itself. It just does not get any better in our opinion and we have done Clearwater Pensacola Hawaii San Diego Jersey etc. Awesome sand calm water and the roving food drink carts that hit the beach at 130 every day all make the experience a pleasure Raul you da man. And unlike the Hilton chairs and umbrellas are included in the resort fee not extra. And for the first time we actually used the pool. This is another area where the Hilton can not compete as the JW has two huge pools plus a spa pool. The tiny pool at the Hilton is laughable in comparison even with its revamp. We have pools at home but not beaches so we spend the vast majority of our time on the sand. But the pool was every bit as nice as the rest of the experience. The Good We ate at only two of the restaurants on the property out of 10 I think. Quins and Kane were OK nothing spectacular and a bit pricey with three tacos for 20. Good enough I suppose but not even a little cup of slaw or anything. Besides having been to Marco in the past we had favorites already picked out reviewed elsewhere. Also at checkout there was not a single questionable charge to be found on two pages. that is pretty rare these days too especially over a longer stay at nice resort properties like this one. The Questionable. No Happy Hour in the lounge. Really. One of our favorite things about the Hilton was the 2 for 1 Happy Hour served by Earl Bailey the best bartender on the island. Maybe the JW thinks it is above the Happy Hour crowd. Also while the minifridge in the room was certainly handy it is truly mini. But the worst part was it was TOO COLD. Yeah I know who complains about that. Well you would if it froze solid your beer wine water leftover salad and pasta fresh cherries and anything else put in it. It ruined probably 40 worth of stuff. And no it had no adjustment knob. Take it or leave it. Oh and a microwave oven would have helped reheat said leftovers. But there was not one in our room. The Bad Well let us see. Uh. Hm OK NOTHING. From service to facilities to relaxation to cleanliness I can not think of a thing to knock. Coming from me that is high praise indeed. The Bottom Line. This was our best stay on Marco and it has us seriously rethinking our allegiance to Hilton. We will return to the Hilton if for no other reason than to use the future discount I negotiated with them for leaving us in the lurch but I have a distinct feeling that any trips after that will be spent at the JW. I will just trade Honors points for Mariot points. Finally I know there are those who stay at places like this and can not wait to complain about parking fees and resort fees. If you can not afford to stay on Marco then do not go there. Everything here is higher cost than what most are used to at home but it takes a small army of staff to keep a property like this in shape. I wish I had a dollar just for the landscapers we saw. We are lucky that we can focus on value and not price. Not once did I think we were getting shortchanged. We highly recommend this resort hotel and will definitely be back. JW made us believers.

Just got back from 4 nights here and the resort definitely has some ups and downs. It is WAY bigger than we got the impression from the website. There are two large towers and a new adult only tower probably about 80 rooms and many of those rooms were filled with families so LOTS of people. That said we thought the staff was polite and engaged with us in a friendly manner. And with all those people and children we thought they did a good job of keeping the resort clean. Our room was clean and had everything we needed safe coffee fridge lots of towels and water and turn down service. We did not request a ocean view but could still see the beach and the balcony was nice. The downside of the resort is that with this many people and children does spring break never end. there was no way we could ever get near a pool and the beach was extremely busy. The system for getting an umbrella and chairs was fairly efficient some people were lined up at 8 am when the beach shack did not open til 9 amBy the time we sauntered down at 10 am we would only have about a 5 minute wait but we were quite far back from the water. We found the beach staff friendly and polite. The beach is lovely but people are really close together. it is great to enjoy after 5 pm but then the staff start picking up chairs and umbrellas and somewhat ruin the moment. The adults only tower seems to be new and we must ask why this was not marketed to us in any meaningful way prior to our stay. Lifetime Titanium Elite status and age maybe should have been noted in some algorithm but we seriously had no idea there was a separate tower and beach for oldies like us. Had we known Mariot. We did however enjoy the adults only bar and restaurant Tesoro. The food was excellent. Breakfast staff was very friendly and due to the number of people we ended up eating in Ario which seemed to have been set up as the overflow breakfast restaurant. The last morning we ate in maia and discovered it was a much nicer buffet but that it a minor complaint. Most of our issues were things that it is hard for the hotel to control generally somewhat unhygienic and rude behavior by kids and some parents who feel rules do not apply to their offspring like bringing them to the gym. I guess we just expected the resort to be a bit less chaotic and there would be fewer kids in bathing suits and bare feet climbing crawling around.

The answer was No People pay a premium for that tower. Well in order to be a titanium member my daughter has and does pay a premium to stay at Mariots. Not one time did she say I m sorry or is there anything I can do for you. We called the manager and were finally given passes to the adult pool.

Not one offer of help. When I asked them why they were so rude as not to offer to help I got no answer just blank stares. The manager came over to the car and told us they work for tips. Who ever said I would not tip them. He was also rude and slammed the car door shut. Then he proceeded to wave us on.

My stay at the Marco Island JW Mariot last week was one continuous disappointment. From the moment we checked in and the front desk person did not know what to do regarding welcoming a Platinum Elite member to not being told about the services that accompanied the upgrade to the Sirene Tower that I paid for to an overall drab and outdated interior lack of elite service and down right unsanitary. When we checked in to our first room in one of the old outdated towers we found used bandages just under the dust ruffle of the bed. When wiping down the surfaces of the furniture in that room with a lysol wipe the wipe was BLACK obviously no cleaning taking place. No robe or slippers in the room. Very disappointing. When we learned about the new Sirene tower option from friends no one told us about it at check in even though we asked about upgrades we moved that night. They happily took our extra money per night gave us our bracelet key but did not tell us about the services that came with this tower private pool gym breakfast concierge. We had to discover it all on our own. Service was poor from the majority of staff. For example when I asked an individual wearing a staff shirt in the lobby where the gym was he pointed and said First elevator first floor and walked away. Later I learned that there were three gyms he could have informed me about including the one I had paid an extra resort fee to have access to which should have been evident to him since I was wearing my JW Mariot key bracelet. When I made a complaint to Mr Marsh the front desk manager the morning after our check in he just stood there and bobbed his head said sorry and walked away. Not note of apology or any follow up from him. The Spa was also a disappointment. Old outdated and dirty and did not feel luxurious. Things like iced wash clothes outside the steam room are not present. No ambiance or spa feel. Might as well have been a Massage Envy. I had planned on spending a couple hours there after my service but it was so small and the steam and whirlpool area was worn and dirty I decided against it. The waiting room in the spa before your service is not very inviting and it is so small that many women had to stand while waiting. I had my massage and left. The icing on the cake for this trip was how many people got sick from the food that was served al fresco during our conference. I do not know what these people are thinking but they would put out lunch items such as potato salad and onion dip and creamy dressings in the sun and NOT ON ICE. My husband was one of the individuals who became violently ill after lunch one day and did nit recoup until the next afternoon so missed an evening event and morning activity. The hotel was over run with three large conferences during the time we were there so I think they do not worry about guest service since they are at occupancy every night. They are selling a dream to event planners but the reality is a small nightmare. My one and only thanks goes to Hope in the private concierge lounge that I was never made aware of till check out. She listened to our concerns and complaints and comped items from our bill.

My husband and I just got back from a 5 night stay at the JW Mariot. I will start this off by telling you that I am a HUGE MARIOT FAN. I travel a lot for work as well we personal and I always stay at Mariot. I have been gold elite for 2 or 3 years now. Why do I stay at Mariot. Quality and Customer Service. The JW Mariot at Marco Island was not quite up to my Mariot standards. Bad1. Our first morning I called the front desk to request a microwave. You see I have Crohns disease so when I travel I bring lots of things with me that I can eat this helps cut back on the stress of trying to figure out what my body can handle each day. The lady on the phone tells me that the hotel does not have microwaves but that room service might be able to help me. So she transfers me to room service. They ask if it is something that ordered from them and when I said no they told me they do not have microwaves. I hung up the phone with them and called the front desk again. I explained to the same lady that I just talked to that I have dietary restrictions and really need a microwave to warm up the food I brought. She tells me that people normally handle this before they get to the hotel and says something about a note from the doctor. Well here is the thing. from one day to the next I have no clue what is going to both my gut. Therefore I bring foods that I know will not bother me so that I can try and enjoy a few meals out while on vacation. I explained to her that it was not going to be very good if I could not eat food. She said sorry but she talked to a manager and they do not have microwaves on site. This is the first hotel that has ever told me this they usually at least have one in a lobby for guest use. I found it interesting that the suites at the hotel had microwaves but they do not have any onsite guess they do not replace them when they break. I got a call about 10 minutes later from Barbara who calls to tell me that she talked to another manager and they will have a microwave to my room shortly. BARBARA YOU ARE THE REAL MVP. 2. We were relaxing on the beach looking at the JW website trying to decide on something to eat. My husband decided on the mango daiquiri from Quins this menu was listed as Quins beverage menu. We walked up to the restaurant and he ordered his drink. only to find out that they do not have mango daiquiris and they have not in years. So he decides on the dragonbery mojito also on the menu on our phones. Guess what. They do not have that either. Oh the bartender let us know that the menu on the Mariot website is OLD. MICHELE worked her magic and made the tastiest blackberry margarita ever. Happy husband happy wife THANK YOU MICHELE. 3. We happened to be staying at the hotel at the same time as the Scentsy incentive trip. I am not even sure where to begin on this one. After talking with other non scentsy guests the verdict was clear. us folks that paid to be at the resort were clearly not the priority maybe even an after thought. I am attaching picture of the beach the day that Scentsy had one of their events. Those of us that paid big money to be at this resort were pushed off to the side of the beach and given about 50 75 feet for our chairs while Scentsy got the rest of the beach. There was even a cart bringing waters around to everyone but they asked if we were with Scentsy and would not give a water if we were not. 150 for a 10 oz bottle of water. Because there were so many folks with this incentive trip and most of them were given resort credits. On another day they rented jetskis and went on jetski tours right from the hotel. Many of them came back from the tour at once all parking the jetskis right in front of where the beach chairs were. I counted. THIRTY FIVE JETSKIS also attaching a picture. So the part of the ocean that was left for us to play in was where the parasailing boat came to pickup dropof customers. God1. The hotel itself inside and outside was very well kept. Our room was clean. While we did not have our room cleaned everyday the housekeeper on our floor 2 was a delight. Always friendly and willing to give us extra towels bags toiletries. I wish I had gotten her name. 2. We were invited to a Wine Down Wednesday at Ario. Very glad we went to this. Lexi did our wine tasting and was very very knowledgeable. While I am convinced it was a plot to get us all to eat at Ario I have to admit that it worked. There were 14 of us at the wine tasting and after hearing Lexi talk about the wine and food 10 of us were back within an hour to eat dinner. Lexi was a fabulous server and everything that she recommended was great. Our cowboy ribeye was delish. I probably would not order the lobster mac and cheese again. 3. Beach yoga was messy but a great addition. I really enjoyed the teacher. I wish i could remember her name. Monday evening beach yoga. I also took a spin class at the spa which was nice to have access to on vacation. We did not use the pools at all but they looked really nice. Lok into Sirene before booking. It did not pop up as an option for me for the days we stayed but it is 21 and older. They have their own pool and section of the beach. Wish we could have stayed there. Overall The place was very pretty and SOME of the staff went above and beyond for us. However it felt like the JW was more interested in making money than customer service.

We are regular visitors to this awesome and perfect resort. Even perfect places can have issues sometimes. It \u2019s how they are handled that truly make the difference. Last week we checked into our suite and found the room was not ready. Very unusual but not a big deal. However it was a very big deal to the staff at this JW. Our initial rep immediately offered us a temp room and was happy to comp us with food and amenities. As the evening moved on a couple other issues arose. Mariot rooms controller Ema P went into action. I have never been treated with such professional service and an eagerness to delight and make this situation right. Ema was absolutely amazing and made EVERYTHING right immediately. She followed up with us throughout our trip to ensure we were having the best time and any of our needs were met. Ema was empowered by her management to make immediate and continuous actions to ensure their customer was well cared for. GREAT JOB EMA. You are a great asset to your company. Equally as impressive was when I went to check out. I asked to speak to the manager to pass along my positive feedback. This manager came out immediately and knew who I was and of my initial concern. I was so impressed that my small issue had the attention of the management of this resort. She reiterated that her team members are empowered to \u201c make it right for the customer \u201d.

Great property. Marco Island beach in one of the best. Very wide lots of distance to walk. Hotel is BIG. We did opt for the Sirene club. Sort of. We paid an extra fee on top of our rate. The Sirene area is a separate part of property with an adult pool and serenity. You do get a continental breakfast. This breakfast is way beyondD continental. It is worth the upgrade by itself. Just be careful that you do not pick up someone elses omelet. The adult pool was great generally. Laura and Toni were great. However while we were there there was a party of 10 couples or so. Whenever they entered the pool area we went from Serene to Sping break. Adults only does not mean maturity or serenity. These folks chased couples who were looking for quiet away. Laura and Toni did a better job of crowd control than other pool attendants did. I do not know how the hotel can manage this. Overall a great property. There are 2 pools besides Sirene tower pool. One pool has slides and is great for kids. There are movie nights at the hotel. Overall a family friendly place. Like a lot of other hotels Hal and room noise are not isolated. Very comfortable beds and rooms. Another guest review said this was no better than a Mariot. I disagree. The hotel staff and property are better than standard Mariot.

Mariot made a great decision when it transformed this average Mariot resort into a JW. It has become one of most beautiful resorts on the Gulf Coast. Mariot is also introducing a new concept the Paradise by Serene. This is a very large resort and and in spite of that it offers great service overall. Our experience was outstanding from check in to to check out. We received an amazing upgrade to the Paradise tower while our teenagers got their own room. Lindsay went above and beyond to acomodate us. She has a great future in the hopsitality industry. Our suite was spaciuous modern and hip. The views from the two balconies were absolutely breathtaking. The sunsets were romantic and incredible. The resort offers a great variety of activities daily such as the fire dancer the zoo the magician show etc. The 10kAley offers great entertainment for gamers of all ages. The grounds are professionally manicured and the resort offers a number of pools which at times could be very crowded. We were staying during Thanksgiving and it was probably sold out. The beach is beautiful and very wide. The white sparkling sand is unique to this area. The property offers a diversity of restaurants with menus for every taste bud. The food is generally good and the service is above average. The Spa is spacious and well appointed and facilities are first class. We stayed at many JWs and this is one of the best in terms of location facilities service and amenities. It really paid off to be Titanium Bonvoy. I fully recommend the property. We enjoyed it more that the RC Naples. Now a few thoughts about the Paradise by Serene. The adult only tower is outstanding in terms of design rooms and service. It includes breakfast and beach butler service. It is a step above the regular JW service. However for elite members it is not worth the upcharge. As a Bonvoy Titanium member I receive superior service at for instance St Regis Bal Harbor where you have a permanent butler.

My husband and I checked into the JW Marco Island for a few days of much needed RR. The lobby was insane when we arrived with screaming kids everywhere. We paid the upgrade for the adults only Sirene tower because we immediately saw the need. Unfortunately that tower also holds and shares elevators with a game room that attracts lots and lots of kids making it anything but serene. The breakfast was nice but that is about it. The food at all of the restaurants in the hotel is overpriced. The beds were the most uncomfortable hotel beds that I have ever slept in and the pillows were worse. The housekeeping service was excellent in the room but there was literally trash everywhere else. Every single public restroom was littered with trash and badly in need of cleaning. There were empty cups ice cream containers water bottles etc. all over the hotel. We are very loyal Mariot owners and stay almost exclusively at Mariot owned properties. On a comparable level we recently stayed twice at the JW Turnbery in Aventura Florida and there is no comparison. Turnbery felt like a Ritz Carlton. Marco felt like a Courtyard.

First a huge thank you to Janet for assisting with our reservations for February school break for our family of four. Also got us in touch with car service to and from Fort Myers Airport which was super convenient. We originally had a standard two queen bedroom for 3 nights but Janet alerted us to a suite opening and we ended up getting an amazing Lanai Suite facing the water and stayed an extra night. These are the only suites that allow kids and are in the newer tower where conferences take place. Was an awesome room with a deck and steps right down to beach and Quins. Place is perfect for families. It \u2019s pricey but has perfect amenities for families. Two pools kids will spend all their time in the water slide pool by the Tiki bar. We rented a Chicke Hut on the beach for two days and it is WELL worth the price. For 100 120 bucks when look at the relative price compared to the trip do it and book it BEFORE you arrive. They will sell out. They were great for going back and forth to the pool and you get preference from the two or three drivers going back and forth from Quin \u2019s with drinks all day. Shade is great and allows for you to have the kids hang out after the pool in comfort or play the IPads for an hour while mommy and daddy enjoy a beverage or three. We did most of our eating at Pazi pizza and Quin \u2019s most popular casual. Food was excellent and we were big fans of the carne asada tacos with whatever that green salsa was. Also for the kids after 5 pm is 10 K Alley. The Gastro pub arcade was a huge hit with the kids and a nice change of pace after a long day in the sun. Just a great property and would absolutely stay there again. On the flip side had awful awful luck with the kids. My 11 year old got sick the first two days and had to stay inside all day and my 4 year old Got a massive fever the last 36 hours and missed a day and a half having to stay in bed. God bless my wife who stayed with her inside most of the time while I did Jet Skis with my 11 year old and took her to the pool. I want to say THANK YOU to Gia from food service who tried her best to help my wife give my stubborn 4 year old her Motrin. It was a nightmare and she did her best. Also to Chris at the pool we had to cancel our cabana due to our little ones illness and he texted me and got my wife a free drink when she went to the pool. Was a tough trip but the resort was terrific we got 5 days of 80 and sunny and sometimes you just ca n\u2019t keep kids healthy in February.", "offset": [2085, 2208], "date": "2020-02-21", "cpt": "3", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "e2d1be98-468f-4b89-ba99-e2e8d7cab0a2", "sentence": "Late Valentines weekend. Arrival experience As soon as we drove in we saw 6 valet attendants all huddle up hands in pockets and one of them was leaning against a vehicle. One of the attendants finally came over to talk to us. He said \u201c hey what \u2019s up \u201d did not greet us properly and did n\u2019t even offer a parking option or explain the difference in pricing between valet and Self park. At the check in desk we were greeted by a female staff member that was training and Brook they were nice friendly and assured us we had a great room. Once we arrived at the room we were a little disappointed due to the fact that there was no complimentary water bottles the iHome station was broken and the mirror left light did not turn on. Other than those small issues the room was great. We went to watch the fire show and enjoyed a nice dinner at 10 K where Rene who was amazing made our drinks and took out meal orders. The next morning we went to Maia for breakfast where Eloy explained the buffet and a la cart menu. We went with the Bufe selection which was such a great choice. All thanks to Lucy at the omelette station who was genuinely happy to be there on her birthday. After breakfast we went to the pools walked around the beach had Menchies and took our Froyo to the Adult only area in the 5th floor. Once we arrived at the Adult only area we did n\u2019t know that if you did n\u2019t book a room in that tower than you did n\u2019t the privilege of enjoying the adult only pool. The attendant for the Adult only pool was kind of rude and made us feel unwelcome since we were not staying at that tower. Another couple went in after us and the attendant treated them just as rude and the couple even commented on how rude she was. Since that was our last stop before checking out that kind of put a dent in our experience. Other than Brooke Rene Eloy and Lucy I hope they get recognized. the service aspect of JW Mariot was not there compared to other JWs we \u2019ve stayed at specially when every time we stay at Mariot hotels we are always celebrating something. In this case it was a late valentines celebration that went unnoticed by the staff.

Let me preface this review by saying that my family has visited this resort property numerous occasions over the last 15 years for a week stay each time. there is no way to sugarcoat it the hotel has gone downhill and I would not recommend it especially at the price they are asking. Check in. not sure how other Mariots operate but this hotel secretly has its own dedicated reservation desk not affiliated with the Mariot 80 number. What that means is that any room request you make via the Mariot toll free number Mariot web site or a third party travel agency will disappear at check in time which notably has happened at this property several times in the past. In our case we had booked 2 rooms and requested that they be connecting at the time of our reservation 10 months in advance. At check in however the front desk took issue with our request yet why else would we have booked 2 rooms since they did not have it in their system. At one point the assistant manager came out and asked me to prove that I had made the connecting room request really. and then borrowed my phone to email herself the properly annotated reservation email showing the request. We finally agreed to stay one night in a less desirable pair of rooms to be moved to what we had booked the next day. Following that I received a phone call from the manager different from the assistant who leveraged his empathy training to understand my feelings while blaming me and or my travel agent for not communicating the request to them despite the fact that I was put on hold when I placed the reservation while my agent phoned the hotel to document the request. When I asked him how I was supposed to communicate the request naturally he could not point me to a reservation procedure any different than the one I had followed. So basically management does not care and buyer beware. The next day we repacked our suitcases in anticipation of our room move. The assistant manager had told us the day before that we could stay in our old rooms until the new rooms were ready. Since I felt bad about tying up 2 rooms we moved our stuff completely out of 1 room and let the front desk know 1 of the rooms was vacated. Big mistake. They checked us out of both rooms so room charging stopped working and without our permission seized our bags to an undisclosed location. Several hours later when our new rooms became available no one in the hotel knew where our bags were and they were not waiting in the new rooms as originally promisedMeanwhile the billing going on during this time period was concerning. While we had brought 1 car for self parking the hotel was billing parking on both room bills. Furthermore they completely checked us out of one of the two rooms and refunded our full stay deposit and then reauthorized a new large debit for the remainder of our stay why. At the end of our stay we again noticed that the hotel continued to double charge parking that we again had to have refunded. Housekeeping was also a major issue. We did not receive turndown service the first few nights so we assumed that the hotel would not provide it. We did leave some valuables out the 4th night only to have turndown service come. That was the only night that we received turndown service during the entire stay. Either do it every night or do not do it at all. Anything else just looks very careless. And do not wear the robes expecting them to be laundered and returned. After we went through a pair of robes they never reappeared until days later when we requested them to be replaced why do I have to request replacement of an item that is supposed to always be in the room. Most days the shower mat towel was not replaced meaning that we had to use one of the precious bath towels for our shower mat precious because we never had a plentiful supply and there was no turndown service most nights. For such a long stay it would have been nice if the hotel proactively changed the sheets occasionally but that again was something that we had to explicitly request. The rooms were in need of maintenance. The shower area leaked which was compounded by the lack of mats and towels to mop up the mess. The carpeting in all 4 rooms we were in was ratty and had numerous dark colored stains. The closet door in one of the rooms did not shut properly meaning that the automatic light inside never shut off unles you played with the door. Pool situation the hotel has some lovely pools but the management of it is not befitting a place where guests are paying more than 70 per night. The gate doors are kept locked until 8 am resulting in an extremely long queue of guests hoping to procure seats over presidents day weekend the queue probably started up at 7 am resulting in an hour long wait for some guests. Towels are supplied as long as you have towel cards although the staff were very inconsistent about how they accepted or returned pool cards leaving us confused as to what the purpose of the cards was. Guests also had to wear rubber bracelets to enter the pool areas although enforcement again was erratic. I can understand that the hotel may be concerned about non guests using their facilities but the need for multiple authentication approaches seems overbearing and unnecessary. Pick one approach bracelet card or room key and go with it. Beach. the beach is beautiful and a great place to go shelling. Beware of renting a Chice hut the thatched structures just beyond the pool area. We rented one for a day and we were intruded upon by hotel staff noisily setting up a convention activity immediately behind us trucks beeping in reverse loud clanging of furniture being unloaded loud conversation. We eventually asked for a refund which was granted along with a comment that we were not the first to complain. Dining. the staff at all restaurants were the most customer service focused people working at the hotel. We witnessed numerous instances of individual staff persons trying to make our experience nicer. Far better than anywhere else in the hotel. The overall dining experience was sub par though. The food is not very good at any of the restaurants. The best dining experience is probably the buffet breakfast but even there we noticed occasional use of canned jared fruit instead of the real thing. Also the hotel does a horrible job of seating people into the breakfast restaurant Maia. On several days there was an oppressive line to enter the restaurant even though many of the tables were empty. At the 10 K gaming establishment we were served undercoked grilled chicken bloody in the middle. The food was not all served at once one of the dishes did not come out until everyone else had finished eating. The staff at 400 Pazis is great. The food quality is uneven we were served one skillet dish of cheesy bread that was drowning in water. On the bright side our server immediately replaced it and the manager offered a free appetizer coupon for our next visit. Many staff confided to us that the hotel is short staffed. This would explain the inconsistent housekeeping the long entrance line to breakfast the ridiculous queueing at the pool among the many subpar experiences we had. This hotel is not customer centric. It has always been a place that caters to large convention groups. I get it. those are lucrative room and catering contracts that make this huge resort possible. But the hotel is clearly cutting corners all over and those of us who are used to better both from past stays at the same property and recent stays at better properties elsewhere can easily spot it.

What that means is that any room request you make via the Mariot toll free number Mariot web site or a third party travel agency will disappear at check in time which notably has happened at this property several times in the past. In our case we had booked 2 rooms and requested that they be connecting at the time of our reservation 10 months in advance. At check in however the front desk took issue with our request yet why else would we have booked 2 rooms since they did not have it in their system. At one point the assistant manager came out and asked me to prove that I had made the connecting room request really. and then borrowed my phone to email herself the properly annotated reservation email showing the request.

Following that I received a phone call from the manager different from the assistant who leveraged his empathy training to understand my feelings while blaming me and or my travel agent for not communicating the request to them despite the fact that I was put on hold when I placed the reservation while my agent phoned the hotel to document the request. When I asked him how I was supposed to communicate the request naturally he could not point me to a reservation procedure any different than the one I had followed. So basically management does not care and buyer beware. The next day we repacked our suitcases in anticipation of our room move. The assistant manager had told us the day before that we could stay in our old rooms until the new rooms were ready. Since I felt bad about tying up 2 rooms we moved our stuff completely out of 1 room and let the front desk know 1 of the rooms was vacated. Big mistake. They checked us out of both rooms so room charging stopped working and without our permission seized our bags to an undisclosed location. Several hours later when our new rooms became available no one in the hotel knew where our bags were and they were not waiting in the new rooms as originally promisedMeanwhile the billing going on during this time period was concerning. While we had brought 1 car for self parking the hotel was billing parking on both room bills. Furthermore they completely checked us out of one of the two rooms and refunded our full stay deposit and then reauthorized a new large debit for the remainder of our stay why. At the end of our stay we again noticed that the hotel continued to double charge parking that we again had to have refunded. Housekeeping was also a major issue. We did not receive turndown service the first few nights so we assumed that the hotel would not provide it. We did leave some valuables out the 4th night only to have turndown service come. That was the only night that we received turndown service during the entire stay. Either do it every night or do not do it at all. Anything else just looks very careless. And do not wear the robes expecting them to be laundered and returned. After we went through a pair of robes they never reappeared until days later when we requested them to be replaced why do I have to request replacement of an item that is supposed to always be in the room. Most days the shower mat towel was not replaced meaning that we had to use one of the precious bath towels for our shower mat precious because we never had a plentiful supply and there was no turndown service most nights. For such a long stay it would have been nice if the hotel proactively changed the sheets occasionally but that again was something that we had to explicitly request. The rooms were in need of maintenance. The shower area leaked which was compounded by the lack of mats and towels to mop up the mess. The carpeting in all 4 rooms we were in was ratty and had numerous dark colored stains. The closet door in one of the rooms did not shut properly meaning that the automatic light inside never shut off unles you played with the door. Pool situation the hotel has some lovely pools but the management of it is not befitting a place where guests are paying more than 70 per night. The gate doors are kept locked until 8 am resulting in an extremely long queue of guests hoping to procure seats over presidents day weekend the queue probably started up at 7 am resulting in an hour long wait for some guests. Towels are supplied as long as you have towel cards although the staff were very inconsistent about how they accepted or returned pool cards leaving us confused as to what the purpose of the cards was. Guests also had to wear rubber bracelets to enter the pool areas although enforcement again was erratic. I can understand that the hotel may be concerned about non guests using their facilities but the need for multiple authentication approaches seems overbearing and unnecessary.

Lots to love at this hotel with a few minor annoyances. This property is very large especially compared to other hotels on the island. With that being said the staff do a masterful job of keeping it clean and in pristine shape. From the beach to the lobby to the pool areas everything is spotless. However some slight wear and tear in the rooms but that is to be expected at any large property like this one. The rooms themselves are large and lots of space to spread out your things. Bathroom was also a good size although water pressure was poor in the shower. This is a very family friendly hotel so there are kids all over and it can become a bit overwhelming annoying. Thankfully the hotel has added the serenity section which is adults only. I think next time we will definitely be staying there instead. A number of places to eat at this resort and we loved going to the arcade at night which includes mini golf and even a mini bowling alley. So there is lots to do on site which is good because it is a bit of a hike to get to nearby restaurants and shops. As is the case with most JW hotels your bill at this property can add up quickly. With the resort fee parking and fairly expensive prices for food and drinks just be prepared for your wallet to take a hit. But it is worth it for a hotel as great at this one.

The only time I write a review is if the service is that awful or that amazing. I am writing this review for the latter. My boyfriend and I just came back from this Mariot location yesterday and wow. We were VERY impressed with not only the resort itself but the service here is outstanding probably one of the best service I have gotten ever. We checked in with Beca who was very approachable and made our welcome a very warm one. She was very sweet we were off to a great start. While we were getting ourselves acquainted with the resort we must have looked lost because Anie came right up to us with a big smile to assist us on where to go. She was very enjoyable to talk with as she walked us to Quins. We later met Cathy who had the biggest smile of them all. we have bumped into her in the lobby quite a few times and every time she greeted us so warmly. She made sure that we not lift a finger to get our bags to our rooms. Last but not least Dany was another person that stood out to us. We had bumped into him a few times as well and same thing he greeted us very warmly every time and even suggested some activities outside the resort. My boyfriend is big on basketball it is a bummer this location does not have a court but Dany suggested a place outside and spoke very highly of it. We did not make it out there unfortunately but next time Dany. The entire trip we were on Cloud 9. Unfortunately it is rare to see outstanding service but I had to come on here and acknowledge good people at an amazing resort. The ONLY issue was at the restaurant Maia. We decided to go there for breakfast there was about a 20 minute wait which was not ideal but we dealt. We get seated and decide to order from the menu rather than the buffet. The waitress took our order repeated it to make sure it was right and wrote it down. 30 minutes later one of the waitress brings out the food. My boyfriends plate was correct but mine was not. They take it back we wait another 30 40 minutes. In that time the ONLY time the waitress checked on us was about an hour after we got seated to give us a bowl of berries to hold us over. We watched go back and forth to different tables checking on them but did not check on us at all. At that point about an hour since ordering we called her over and told her we were just going to go somewhere else. It was then that she insisted we stay and that the meal was on the house for her mistake. After we finally received our meal it was then that she came up to us to check on us. It was then that she apologized that it was her mistake on the delay. We did eat the food but at that point we were very disappointed. That was the ONLY bad experience we had at this resort and I want to give this place a 5 stars so badly but I had to mention this because it is just too difficult to overlook. Otherwise this is the best experience I have had. The pools are great it is right on the beach. The room was clean. I would highly recommend this resort we will definitely be sure to visit again especially for the service. Thank you for a wonderful experience.", "offset": [216, 359], "date": "2020-03-09", "cpt": "4", "category": "reception"}]}
