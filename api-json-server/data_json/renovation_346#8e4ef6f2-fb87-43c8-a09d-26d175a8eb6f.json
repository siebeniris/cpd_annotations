The answer yes yes and yes and more. The new rooms are amazing luxury and homely you would say home from home. I was so relaxed in the rooms we made the most and out of 6 nights took room service for 2 of the nights. Room service was excellent food was great and the set up on delivering the food made me feel like I was in my own private restaurant. The hotel is simply stunning and elegant the lobby and coffee area are wow. The new redesigned restaurant I think renamed Kitchen Connection is really lovely with a lot of live cooking stations new items introduced on breakfast we loved it. To be honest this is a holiday of holidays where the service and attention to detail is impeccable. I was wowed from start to finish The exec pool run by Earl and his amazing team was a haven of tranquility and relaxation. The gym was as always was great I tried PT with Eric and will be reboking him for our Christmas stay. he was brilliant. Babes and Jouda took care of our massages for myself and my daughter I can not tell you how amazing they are. These ladies have magic hands and we come out feeling like new women. Being honest I was worried about the team and service not being the same. but it was most of the same amazing team across the hotel and the pool had a lot of the same team which was great. Sanjev looked after all of our needs at the pool and the service was WOW. I have 5 weeks and 5 days until my next visit and I am counting down the days.

After our last trip in April we were really looking forward to trying the newly refurbished Jumeira Beach hotel. Wifey Small Daughter and I all thoroughly enjoyed the last stay and were expecting great things. Check In was as easy and simple as last time despite my having left my wallet in the car. We had heard great things about the new reception area and. it was ok. I think I preferred the old one the new look being a bit clinical for my tastes. But it \u2019s just the reception. We were on the 4th floor with a great view of the Burj Al Arab. The corridor and room smelled wonderfully new and clean. The room itself was well appointed and comfortable. Again i could n\u2019t see a vast difference between the new room and our last room. Dinner the first night was in the Dhow and Anchor. Exactly the same as last time. Great food and good selection of drinks. I had convinced myself they had Hobgoblin bitter last time we stayed. If they had it \u2019s now gone but the London Pride was great. Fish pie was very good and Small enjoyed the Mac and Cheese off the kids menue. Breakfast next day was full English again at the Dhow and Anchor. Excellent service and great food. However be careful. The menu says tea cofe juice with the Full English. It \u2019s either or. We opted for juice and were a little surprised to be charged for the tea and coffee. That said after a word with the very friendly manager the charge was waived. This time. I was wondering what they had been doing for the 6 months the place had been closed. Inside the hotel was obviously new but very samey. It felt familiar. No bad thing but was expecting more. Outside the changes were more obvious. The pools have been improved and are great. New loungers and shades on the beach and not too jammed in together. Small loved the kids club when we were last here. It \u2019s every bit as good and she adored it. The Kitchen Connection restaurant had excellent food and good choice. The Italian restaurant also. Der Keller was closed whilst we were there or at least we never found it open. There was also a few areas outside bariered off obviously still not quite ready. So overall staff were great and friendly the place is clean comfortable and a nice place to be. Food quality in the outlets we tried was excellent and the kids club a triumph. I was left a little disappointed that the changes were not as obvious or as extensive as I had imagined. But I am obviously just spoiled as it was so good last time and whilst it was closed we stayed at the Burj Al Arab instead.

Having heard about the hotel refurbishment that ended in October 2018 our family of 4 decided to book a one bedroom ocean suite for the February 2019 UK half term holiday. As time for our holiday approached it became clear that there was new ongoing construction work at the hotel which we were never warned about. I therefore emailed well in advance and requested a room away from the construction work. Having arrived on 16th February we were incredibly disappointed and upset to be given a room directly overlooking the construction room 452. We literally could not have been any closer to the building site and the noise of boulders being moved and drilling was deafening. In this particular suite the floor vibrated every time the drilling started which was almost 24 hours a day. I am astounded that Jumeirah actually believe they can keep this part of the hotel open and operational whilst this work is ongoing directly outside. It is not something you would expect from an internationally renowned brand such as Jumeirah. During our first night the sound was deafening so I emailed hotel manager Mariane who did then organise for us to be transferred to a different suite which had 2 bedrooms and was a bit further away and higher up room 201. Despite this the noise from the building work was still very audible at night. I simply do not understand how a brand such as Jumeirah which I had always considered to be about luxury and customer service can keep the hotel fully operational during these building works.

Jumeirah Beach Hotel also offers free dining on the half board basis for children under 12The only negative things I have to say are the lack of motorised water sport activities as advertised on the website and the fact that we did not know that there was still some construction work going on which was quite noisy at times. We would have appreciated a warning or to be offered an alternative room when we checked in especially since I had mentioned that we were celebrating a special occasion in the booking.
