We stayed at the Corktown while we were in town to see Garth Brooks. Driving into the Corktown area we were immediately apprehensive as the area is not what is depicted online. There are a few newer bars in the area but it is mostly run down grafiti covered buildings. We arrived at the hotel and it looked pretty deserted except for the man leaning against the building drinking a beer. We sat in the parking lot calling other hotels and there were none available because there were back to back concerts that evening. At this point we had no choice except to stay. We went to the front door and had to wait for someone to buzz us in. They have tried to dress up the lobby with large lighting fixtures but nothing can distract you from the bullet proof glass completely surrounding the front desk with a small slot to pass your credit card through or the distinct aroma of marijuana in the air. We checked into the first room small dirty disgusting with stained sheets and the paint was peeling off the walls the toilet did not flush and the walls so thin you could hear neighbors on both sides talking. I called the front desk to complain and they moved us to a king room. The room was larger but still dirty. The walls were stained and the paint was peeling the sheets looked clean but the box spring no bedskirt had huge stains of some sort. We continued to call other hotels with no availability. We decided to make the best of it got ready and called for a taxi. While in the lobby waiting for a taxi three other couples checked in went to their rooms and checked back out. One lady stated there was something resembling feces smeared in her carpet and part of someones weave in the closet. We had a fantastic time at the concert. it is a short taxi drive to downtown however when we returned we had to wait outside for the on duty manager to buzz us in because the card reader at the door was broken. This is not an area you want to be standing around outside at 2AM. I read reviews on this hotel prior to booking it and can only think the positive reviews are completely bogus.

My husband and I visited this hotel on the night of June 27th to go to Comerica park the next day. The hotel is dingy and old on the outside and you should expect the same for your room. The receptionist working was behind bullet proof glass already a bad sign and the lobby smelled like mildew and cigarettes. We thought we had give the room a chance though so we got our keys and drove around to the secure parking. It took us 10 minutes to get our key to open up the security gate and there was extremely suspitious activity going on in the parking lot while we were trying to figure it out. This hotel is located in a terrible neighborhood and I felt very unsafe. At this point I just wanted to get to the room and lock the door behind me. Once we got up to our room the smell was no better the bed spread was dirty and the plaster was cracking off the walls. Also the TV did not work the bathroom was filthy and old with missing tiles in the walls and floor. The air conditioning unit in the room made a very loud clanging noise about every 30 seconds to a minute that I do not think anyone could sleep through. After taking a look around the room we decided that we absolutely could not stay in this disgusting place. We took the keys back to the front desk and told the woman working that we would be checking out. Her unphased demeanor by us leaving shortly after arriving seems to suggest that this is a common occurrence. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "offset": [692, 767], "date": "2015-06-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "b478c5c7-c1cb-40a6-8c81-363b16b0e41e", "sentence": "As a frugal traveler I have been to a lot of budget hotels and this is one of the best I have been to for this kind of price. I have to admit kind of funny when ALL our friends in town for the same event stayed at fancy places and had all sorts of complaints. Check in and checkout were extremely quick and painless the free. gated parking was a fantastic bonus and the staff we encountered were nothing but sweet and polite. As our fan convention was going on a block away the lady running the front desk even had Japanese music quietly playing in the lobby. It was such a simple but thoughtful touch and I really wish I had taken note of her name. That one little gesture did a lot to get us in the mood for a fantastic weekend. I suppose if I had to come up with a downside it would be the lack of frills but that is to be expected for a place within this price tier. Rooms do not automatically come with refrigerators or other appliances but coffee is made in the lobby every morning and the rooms have ice buckets. Wi Fi is free which is wonderful considering a lot of five star places do not even give you that. Surveillance definitely seemed like a priority so even as sheltered suburbanites my partner and I never felt like we or our car were unsafe during our stay. Our room was clean and everything worked without a problem so I have no real complaints. If you are just looking for a simple place to rest at night without anything fancy I had highly recommend the Corktown Hotel. My companion and I have every intention of returning next year. Edit. As much as I try to be respectful I have to admit I am confused about all the bullet proof glass complaints. Guys. it is downtown Detroit and the staff have every right to their safety.

The guy at the front was very helpful knowledgeable of the area and genuinely pleasant. The hotel ownership has obviously put money into updating the place in a city that desperately needs it. Unfortunately that is where most of the positive reviews end. The room was updated and very clean but this is still a block building with concrete floors. Concrete floors block wall. metal conduit feeding all lights gave the place a very industrial feel. Maybe this is considered modern and comfortable to some but not to me. It was dorm room comforting at best but honestly it reminded me of a jail cell. That coupled with the surrounding area made for an uncomfortable sleeping experience even though the bed and linens were comfortable and clean. The gated parking is not exactly 6 foot barbed wire fences but it should be. would not be hard for a thief to access. The park was not somewhere you will want to go read a book. Very green and appeared well kept but also at least one homeless or drunk on every park bench. This hotel is really trying in a city that needs more of it but the area is atrocious. Also if your cab driver does not turn on the meter work out a rate with them immediately or they will price gouge you. Happened on my way to and from downtown do not believe the its a set rate BS.
