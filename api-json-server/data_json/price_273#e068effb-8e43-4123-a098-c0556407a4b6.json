I must admit this review is about 6 months late however I wanted to share my experience of Hotel Penn. This was my 4th visit to New York. We checked in a lot later than usual due to problems with our flight. Upon check in we were greeted by friendly staff who were more than happy to help I asked how much an upgrade to a suite was. That s 10usd a night sir. I politely declined and carried on with the check in. The member of staff then told us we would be put in a suite anyway as there were no King rooms let however we would have to come down the morning after to swap rooms We were fine with this. The room was huge. a large bedroom with an onsuite and then a large but basic living room with huge windows and great views of the city. The morning after we came down ready to change rooms and were were pleasantly told that we were more than welcome to stay in the suite for the rest of our day as we were being soco opoerativeOveral the hotel is pretty basic. However its clean and tidy. The lifts do present a problem especially when there s 100 people all waiting to get into the lift there s about 6 lifts if i remember correctly but only 2 were working during our stayThe hotel is in a great location within 10 minutes of times square and other popular attractions. Best of all was the price we paid \u00a3 290 for 5 nights. about 430USD and this included taxes. Now put this into comparison we are going back to New York in 2 weeks and we are paying 130USD for 4 nights in a similar hotel. Overall great hotel yes its basic but it does the job.

Please do not hesitate to stay here. We had a wonderful 2 nights here. I just think some travelers are way too picky. We had 2 rooms on the 9th floor.

From other peoples bad reviews I was prepared for the worst and was pleasantly surprised. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful I checked in on a Thursday afternoon at 4 with no line. I do not think paying 5 dollars to store your bags is unreasonable and the guys in the luggage room were so friendly they deserved their tips. Our room was clean no signs of bugs of any kind and no stray hairs in the bathroom. Sure the room could have used a paint job and new curtains and bedspreads but I do not call that a deal breaker. The room with the two double beds was a little tight for 3 people but we were not there much anyway. I brought towels and washcloths with me because so many people complained about the stained towels and we had perfectly clean towels at all times. I loved the old features of the hotel hallways and bathrooms it has been there 100 years. The location can not be beat.

We stayed here for 5 nights at the end of January and the room we stayed in was clean had working hot and cold water and a good view of 34th street. that is all you really need for a city visit in New York as far as I am concerned. The issues with scoring a low revue was I found the hotel clearly sets it is pricing around the location alone not the services or amenities included with the room. I can not stress enough how well placed the hotel is for everything tourists want to see when they come to New York. it is right next to a subway station right across from Madison Square Garden and a few blocks from Times Square. I just feel that for the price you are paying they could stand to update the rooms or at least the en suites yes the taps and shower provided hot water on demand and you can have a nice shower anytime but the fixtures in the bathroom were falling apart the faucet was rusted and tiles were coming off. You also need to pay for internet access they have a small room with computers hooked up to printers guests also have access to and can pay for the Internet access by the minute as opposed to 10 for 24 hours. That is admittedly a fairly cheap price but I am a firm believer that hotels should provide all their guests with a basic Internet access package with a decent bandwidth 5 6 mb and by all means offer a chargeable service for premium bandwidth. The staff were always very helpful too with any queries we had and could not do enough to help us explain what we should be paying taxi fares to various destinations so that we were not getting ripped off. So to sum up If you are on a city break like we were and you will only be in the room for 8 9 hours to sleep and get ready to go out again this hotel is absolutely brilliant but do not allow your expectations to rise above a bed and hot water because you will be disappointed. I would recommend looking at similar hotels within a block or two where other reviewers have said those hotels offer a clean bed and hot water because then you are still getting the ideal location because that is all you are getting at the Hotel Pennsylvania only you will be paying a premium because of it is history and prestige.

Just got back from staying at this hotel. The lobby looks fancy but that is as far as it goes. The staff were not particularly friendly or helpful. At check in we were told that wifi was available in our room free of charge and were provided with the password. When we checked out we were presented with a hefty bill and told that it was 21 per day to use the facilities. I explained that we had not used the gym or swimming pool and that we was told wifi was free. This made no difference and we had no option but to pay the bill. To top it off we asked if the hotel could hold onto our bags as our flight was in the evening. They said that they could but it was 5 per bag. As if we had not paid enough already. We again had no choice but to pay the price. I have never known a hotel to charge for this service holding bags as it is usually complimentary. Our friends were staying in the hotel Marcel located nearby who did not charge for this service. We would not have used the wifi if we knew it was not free but I think it is a compulsory fee anyway despite if you use it or not. It is unlikely you will get time to use the gym or pool as there is so much to do in New York so frankly it is a rip off. The only good point about this hotel is the excellent location. The subway was so easy and cheap to use 36 for one week. Our room was very run down with the worst bath I have ever seen. The paint was all flaking off and quite shocking. I had accepted this and once over the shock of the disrepair I was happy with the hotel overall as it was clean and excellently located but the whole experience and extra charges at check out has put the final nail in the coffin. I think the hotel is sneaky with the hidden charges and would probably work out similarly priced to other hotels in the area once all the extra charges are added on.
