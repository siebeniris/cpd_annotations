I finally had the opportunity to go and was so excited. Upon arrival to the welcome desk you are given a yummy rum punch cocktail and are then taken by boat to the island which is exciting to see the dolphins swimming along as you boat across. When you arrive you are shown to your bungalow and told about the amenities of the island. You will have access to all the fishing and boating you like and it is all included. The rooms are large and nicely decorated. There are Key Deer that reside on the island that are very friendly and make for some neat photos. There really is not any beach other than by the restaurant but they have lovely docks that have loungers facing the water for your relaxation. The food is good but not outstanding. They have a nice wine list though we had some special bottles we brought along that we would open each day and bring over to the fire pit to sit and share making the evenings very romantic and relaxing. The down side of our stay was the spa. The spa is VERY expensive and you would expect for the price would be luxurious. Sadly the attendants do not really put any effort into he services and really just phone in the technique. We were hugely disappointed in the spa services. On our last day We got 2 massages and a scrub and also signed up for the steam room. The massages were awful no effort and felt as if the attendant was just putting lotion on us and the scrub felt the same. When we were ready for the steam room we told the attendant we were ready and they told us they had forgotten to turn it on. They took us over to the steam room which is in another building a diving office and attached to the bathroom it is not very nice. We decided not to wait for it. At that point some one brought all our luggage from our room and dropped it off at the steam room for us to then carry ourselves to the departing boat to the mainland. This made us feel like they were rushing us off and they did not intend to carry our bags out to the boat for us. The whole experience was odd and because this was the last part of our stay with little palm unfortunately this is the memory we were left with and probably would try another resort instead of revisiting.", "offset": [1258, 1306], "date": "2015-01-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "73491d87-d4dc-4e2b-8141-92d7b1b9d873", "sentence": "LPI was lovely for the most part.

The hotel proposes several aquatic sport activities which include a catamaran and a boat to venture out and visit other small island close by. Food was great lunch near to the pool is s must do.

I flew into Little Palm with Key West Seaplanes and that was just the beginning of a wonderful stay. This resort is very well run there is a laid back vibe that only the well traveled will notice and appreciate. The food and service were first class but I never felt anything but relaxed and taken care of. The smallest request brought someone to my door within minutes. Some have said on here that the resort is worn etc. but if you have spent anytime in the Keys the fine camps of the Adirondacks or the best spas in Tuscany you will know this kind of quality where everything is done for you either out of sight or with a smile. FYI I am an expert in Key Lime Pie and the one at Little Palm was superb.

Wow the location is spectacular the vintage boat ride out greetings at the pier like Fantasy Island. But the bed is a bit shaped over time though who can complain about a four poster bed with netting in a Tomy Bahama inspired cabin that makes you imagine yourself as Heminway. Overall a great experience but still could be better and for the price should be perfect. The dining arrangement is lovely but the food was a bit over seasoned salt. and there are no vegetarian options on the menu. This is a great place to get away from it all though and that we did.

Have just returned from 4 days at Little palm Island Resort and spa. Many many many poorer. I knew it was expensive but expected it to be worth it. Not even close. Upside great staff little huts were lovely well appointed and very unique. Downside mediocre at best food. Off the charts expensive food. Drinks ho hum and also very priceydo not be looking for beach. Despite pictures taken at clever angles there really is not one. Nice pool. but they let people eat in it. Yuck. Cute little deer that eat the rolls off your plate. and you need those rolls so you do not have to buy the expensive sides to go with your 65 overcooked steak.

Little Palm Island is a lovely destination. American Express platinum card holders receive a small discount of free breakfast every day and 100 per person credit toward activities. The downside is that there are not very many activities and the massages we booked were 300 apiece. After the 100 discount they were still overpriced. The food is fabulous dinner on the beach was beautiful and pleasant and service was excellent. The price quoted by American express travel did not include daily resort fee and meals so we were shocked when we received the final bill.

The staff made a point to call us by name and make us feel very welcome. The menu helped us celebrate our Anniversary by printing a message Happy 30th Anniversary Mr And Mrs Blades. I am so glad my husband talked with Kelly at the spa about setting up an appointment for me. Techla was very personable and as he chatted about never having a massage suggested he have one. So of course to his surprise I scheduled a couples massage for us. What an incredible experience. The food at every meal was delicious and we thought it could not get any better but it did. We took out a boat each day and went to Picnic Island. I highly recommend this private get away. It does not get any better than this.
