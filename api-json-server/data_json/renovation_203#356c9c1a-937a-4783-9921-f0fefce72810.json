The rooms are large and very functional but housekeeping could do a better job cleaning them and maintenance could do a far more better job with their upkeep. The owners seem to be content with keeping the facilities circa 207 rather than updating and retouching its small flaws. Our rooms had many of those like chipping paint creaking closets which do not close perfectly no safety deposit boxes flimsy hanger racks bubbled wallpaper and the like. Again bad but not that bad. The breakfast buffet is good although they could use better quality bagels from the Einstein Bros acros the hall. The room has courtesy CBTL coffee and tea which is a nice plus. We requested extra towels with our reservation but did not get it. We were also told that the Honors rooms are the same as the regular rooms so we opted to stay in the regular rooms. We took a high floor and that made sense except for one day when two of the four elevators were not working here we go again with maintenance and were once taken to the service elevator. Cookie at the front desk was sharp and helpful throughout always with a friendly smile and handing us warm cookies. Julian was also friendly and nice. In fact the staff is mostly very nice and helpful. The lobby also needs some refreshing from the boarding pass machine which dates from 203 to the ATM to the furniture which is worn and torn post modern. In summary this is a good hotel which could be great with a little TLC.", "offset": [945, 1131], "date": "2015-11-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "96c2d95c-4a67-4432-8c83-79646e345f86", "sentence": "Horrible Stay Pick a different hotel. I got into the hotel around 915 am to check in and they informed me that there was no room available at the time. I did do an E Check In and told them it would be fine if I was put into a different room they told me to check back around noon. I checked back at noon and there was still nothing available but I had seen the front desk checking several business guests in ahead of us. The front desk girl was very rude and told me she was doing the best she could as a Gold member I expected better service. We left the hotel and waited for two and a half more hours. We finally got into the room around 230pm and once we got to the room the window had been leaking in several spots due to rain I called the desk and asked if they could put me in a different room or have maintenance come up and take a look at it and they said they were sold out and could bring me some towels which they never brought up. I had to grab towels from the housekeepers cart out in the hallway and line the bench under the window with towels and cups.

When we stayed in July the lobby and pool were closed as they were under renovation. This was our biggest issue. We had nowhere to go. No access to the beautiful outdoor pool and patio on beautiful summer days and nights. Also no lobby to meet our group and hang out. The lobby due to renovations was cramped had three chairs loud and had no AC. I am sure when it is done it will be adequate and beautiful. The room I had was on the 8th floor and one that had been renovated. It was beautiful. I think I was the first guest to stay in it as I could still smell the fresh paint and there was an operators manual in the fridge. Clean beds were comfortable bathroom was large and clean fridge was great TV was huge. Tons of space. Great view of the pool and skyline but so disappointing we could not get to the beautiful pool. Only complaint was the shower faucet turn on was loose and needs repair and the parking garage is very hard to navigate. Even had locked doors one day which was inconvienient.

I travel to Chicago quite a lot and as this hotel was recently renovated I had been eyeing it up with the intention of giving it a try as you never know when you will run across your new favorite hotel and end up coming again and again. I typically like to book suites as I like plenty of room in which to work. I booked the largest available which was the deluxe one bedroom suite. This room was truly lovely. It exceeded my expectation and was beautifully appointed and decorated with great amenities and had a wonderful space to work. I typically like to eat at the hotel as after a long day I do not like to go running around and I found the lobby bar and seating to be really appealing. This is a near perfect experience but we are sadly coming to something that just spoiled everything. Upon checking in the lady was very friendly until she handed me the breakfast vouchers then she became very uncomfortable explaining that both gold and diamond members get the same continental cold breakfast. But she told me to make sure and let them know that I was a diamond member as if that was going to get something more. Because of this 7 Charge I decided not to eat dinner at the hotel and to eat just down the block where for drinks and dinner my bill was 43. The next morning I went down and as I was being seated there was a lady who was a diamond member who was saying that her husband got a free breakfast but now she was going to have to pay 7 dollars I do not know what was going on with that but then my server said the same that I was going to have to pay 7 for a hot breakfast I decided to just opt for some coffee and a roll and then I can just hop down to Yolk where I can get my usual freshly cooked made to order 2 egg breakfast served with seasoned potatoes or cheesy grits. Toast pancakes or english muffin all for 850 and I do not have to get up and get it myself. I took the description right off their online menuLong story short I spend far to much money at Hilton properties every year achieving diamond status to be given the same benefit as a gold member. You have every right to nickel and dime the most loyal Hilton members if you want but by my calculation its risky because you just lost 5150 plus a generous tip for your server because I am not going to be treated this way. Why should a hotel affiliate with Hilton Properties. Because they get access to a ready made loyal clientele like gold and diamond members who the only reason they discover your hotel is because you are on the Hilton reservation website. Now that you have them you can if you choose deny them honors benefits like late check out and never give any upgrades basically you can conduct yourself anyway you see fit however my guess is people will frequent places where properties honor the benefits of the Honors program for gold and diamond members especially. For me it just comes down to breakfast I will not be returning over the 7 breakfast upgrade charge. One of my favorite doubletree hotels in Naples Florida gives me a hot breakfast for free the doubletree in Elk Grove Village gives me a hot breakfast for free the Hilton Suites Magnificent Mile gives me a hot breakfast for free. These are just a few of the places I return again and again because they know the value of my status represents in future business.", "offset": [34, 270], "date": "2019-12-28", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "157ba51f-84bc-46ba-8628-ead0498c6451", "sentence": "Excellent Hotel and Location. we have stayed here in December almost every year for the past 20 years.
