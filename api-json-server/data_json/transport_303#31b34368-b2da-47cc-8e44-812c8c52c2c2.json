We chose this hotel for a boys okay we are a lot older than that really trip to the France Scotland rugby international. The requirements were location in Paris near to the metro and a reasonable location size of room I have stayed in hotels in Paris where someone has to sit on the bed so that the other can get passed and clean. The description of the hotel and the reviews convinced us this one would do. The location of the Pullman Paris Centre was ideal. less than 3 minutes walk from a metro station 3 stops from central Paris. The 3 minute walk was through an area of Cafes Bars Restaurants and Shops that had been developed in old warehouses that previously held St Emelion Wine thus the Metro station Cour St Emelion. This area is popular with Parisians and visitors for the variety of eateries from cafes that serve reasonably priced food all day to higher end restaurants. All in all the best that I can say is that when back in Paris I will not consider anywhere else. The hotel itself was modern very well appointed and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. As above the local area was great and if you are going to something at the Bercy Omnisport it is walking distance. My only complain was that the bed covers were too hot for a Scotsman even with the room heating turned right down.", "offset": [449, 500], "date": "2015-02-11 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "4f821026-aa2f-48f5-b5fa-f5759a0266f2", "sentence": "Fantastic bed and shower.

If you are comfortable with using the Paris trains and metro system most of the Paris monuments are within a 30 minute metro ride with only one change of train. If not comfortable with trains and subways it is a 30 to 40 Euro taxi ride to the center of Paris.

Very modern lobby and hotel room was good sized we did nt spend much time in there anyways. proximity to train station was a big plus. Close to train station was a big plus. Cafes nearby were okay.

So this is the perfect place for a non tourist type stop over in Paris where you have to get from the airport to your hotel easily but you do not want to stay at the airport. At least by taxi shuttle or car the route goes around the eastern edge of the city making it a quick and untroubled trip. Lots of pilots and flight attendants stay at this hotel for that reason. The spoken English is reasonable. Not many foreign tourists stay here because it is not in amongst the main tourist stuff. But having said that you get the real Paris experience because you are not jammed shoulder to shoulder with accents from your own place of origin. Around 100 m from the hotel is a fantastic village comprising several restaurants. But to get to anything else you have to take transport. The hotel looks like it is on the river but you can not access the Seine from the hotel. We liked the large rooms especially by Paris standards that the rooms had an extra door between the main part of the room and the bathroom and door to the hall. This appeared to be there solely for the purpose of sound reduction which worked really wel the location despite having to take transport to get to anything touristyWe found the staff to have little to no idea of anything in the area or any tourist things to do.

After wonderful running in the park next to the Bercy Village and over the Seine we wanted to work out in the Fitness area and use the sauna. The fitness is rather small and not equipped well and the sauna although we have asked whether we have to start it up learnt from previous experiences they assured us that it would be on and we would just have to enter.

We had a fantastic experience at this hotel. Whilst it is not directly in the centre of the city I feel it is in the perfect location for seeing the major sites Eiffel Tower Champs Elyse Notre Dame Louvre etc. but at the same time allows you to get away from the direct hustle and bustle of Paris after a busy and tiring day of sight seeing. You have to walk through the Bercy Village from the metro station to get to the hotel and it really is a lovely location. There are lots of lovely shops and French restaurants \u2013 although there is also a Five Guys burger outlet too. We went to Eric Kaiser and had a lovely dinner. It has a boulangerie attached to it which did amazing cakes too. There is a little supermarket in the Bercy Village where you can grab snacks and breakfast bits from. We thought the Pullman hotel breakfast was a little pricey so opted for bits from the supermarket instead which was more cost effective. If you are coming in to Paris via the Gare du Nord it is so easy to get to the hotel using the Metro. Hop on Line 4 to Chatelet and then change for Line 14 and get off at Cour St Emilion do not make the mistake of getting off at Bercy as the walk is a little far. \u2013 we discovered this first hand. Walk straight into the Bercy Village and take a right and you should stumble across the hotel from there. There is a taxi rank right outside if you prefer to use a taxi we had no use for a taxi. To get to the Eiffel Tower hop on to Line 14 from Cour St Emilion and get off at Bercy. Swap on to Line 6 and head straight for Bir Hakeim which is where you get off for the Eiffel Tower. Arc de Triomphe Champs Elyse Louvre can then all be easily reached from here. We ate at the hotel on our last day and had the Fish and Chips in the bar which was epic. We also had drinks coffees are fab. and the staff were great. They speak great English if you are struggling with your French vocab. All drinks were served with delicious nuts and chocy snacks which were a nice little touch. All refreshments in our room were free of charge and our room also had a free. Nespreso coffee machine with four pods to use at our will. These were topped back up both mornings we used all. In the mini bar we got a can of Coke diet Coke bottle of fruit juice and two bottles of water still and fizzy. Again these were stocked back up both days with no charge. We used room service for a late evening meal at just before 11 pm after a busy day in Paris. The food again was great \u2013 nothing fancy but very welcome after a busy dayOur Deluxe room was on the 9th floor and had a lovely view of the city and night. The walk in shower was to die for and the bath robes and slippers were great to fall into after a long day riding the Metro and seeing the sights. It really is knackering especially with all the walking. Also the TV has English channels BC 1 2 which is nice and the Bose speakers sounded amazing. There was a hair dryer in the room as well as an ironing board and iron. The complimentary shower gel shampoo conditioner smelled amazing and again were topped back up every day. Finally the staff are wonderful. Very polite helpful and friendly. I really do n\u2019t have a bad word to say about this hotel. I must also mention that we stayed in Paris at New Years and it was great. The Christmas markets on the Champs Elyse are fantastic and I would definitely recommend seeing all the sights in the day and at night. The whole City lights up and looks beautiful. I would highly recommend you stay at the Pullman \u2013 you wo n\u2019t regret it.", "offset": [62, 226], "date": "2017-01-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "ee36818f-f2f2-4f1a-ac2b-0f4e25332f9f", "sentence": "Great place to stay.

It was a \u201c pain \u201d. Almost like a nightmare through out stay actually. The room 812 is a nightmare actually. The shower area there is no proper protection for water not to spill out on floor outside shower area clearly. It \u2019s a pathetic design and arrangement. Also head shower the flow is pathetic and top slow. On WC there is no hand shower arrangement. Limited floor mat Rather just 1 made me use the hand towels and bah towels to protect the water flow out of bathroom to room area. So had to live with this worry and trouble on all nights of 23rd until 1st March 2020 actually. It was an honestly an pathetic experience. Had made a request to shift room to a king size bed on probably 24th or 25th Feb 2020 but made to use same room by changing the bed configuration by joining the bed into a King Bed. So nightmare of same bathroom continued throughout the stay. This room looks like a kind of worst room in configuration in the hotel as it is at end and next to some service door probably. So honestly not keen to come back and stay at Pullman City Centre Bercy for sure in future. At price point for room it was basically not worth staying frankly. A friendly advise is please never Officer the room 821 as location and type to any guest as it would be actually unfair to guest clearly. Even a total refund of price if Stay is not enough to consider Pullman City Centre Bercy as a choice of stay clearly sorry. Because a local friend of mine Mr Bertrand Malet who has prepaid for my stay in his name from 23rd February and until 27th February I did n\u2019t want to be impolite and continued to stay back for those nights. As I had also invited another partner of mine from a French Group Mrs Corine Molina who came and checked in on 27th Feb 2020 evening for a night in same hotel She also had a peculiar situation which your staff could n\u2019t not help weirdly. My error she prepaid for 1 night of 27th March 2020 instead of 27th Feb 2020. It was hard for her and she had no choice but to pay again while checking in and she was also very disappointed actually. I am not sure if she had chance to claim a refund back as yet. Unfortunately very less solutions but more rules which are very immature and not an good feeling to comeback and enjoy your hospitality actually. Thanks. Regards.
