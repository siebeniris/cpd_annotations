My stay was only for a few days each time so I can only provide my thoughts for some things. Location \u2013 If working at the shipyards or downtown Norfolk this is one of the best locations. No tunnel traffic to contend with unles you drive to Norfolk but even then you are going against traffic for the most part. For restaurants pubs etc there are several within crawling distance. You can also take the quick ferry across the river to Norfolk Waterside that is less than a block from the hotel for decent eats over there. They \u2019ve cleaned up most of downtown so it \u2019s fairly safe to walk at night again. Lobby and Front Desk Main entrance doors should have been my first clue that this was not a true Renaissance \u2026 the number of dents in those door looked like someone had taken a hammer and just went to town on them. For those looking for a short walk to the lobby from the front doors \u2026 nope. After you walk through the doors you have to walk past the length of the deep conference rooms and around the corner to get the front desk. And then walk the width of those conference rooms all the way down to the elevator. My last stay I was fortunate that I also remembered about the concierge lounge since the front desk folks were in such a rush to give me my key and have me leave. and I was the only one at the desk. It was a simple ask for ID verify number of nights give room keys quickly walk away to room behind desk. Concierge Lounge \u2013. The lounge is decent. No complaints there friendly attendants too. Hallways. One afternoon a chicken bone was found left in the hallway after returning from work in the late afternoon. The following morning it was still there. By this time the shock that this place would not take care of hallways was over. The same held true for trays of food left in the hallway for over 24 hours. I saw this on all 3 visits. Room \u2013. My last stay I had one of the mid level floors which I was surprised at as my profile requests high floors plus every other Mariot places their Platinum level guests as close to the concierge lounge. It \u2019s only a couple of days so no big deal I figured \u2026. then I look at my room. The front door latch and frame looked like someone had tried to break in with cracks and scarring all over hair all over the shower tub floor and sides hoping it was just hard water stains in the toilet and some unknown substance on the walls and adjoining room door. The kicker was trying to sleep that night. Fortunately I had gotten word to return home the following day so I just have to survive one night \u2026. survival of the fittest huhThe couple staying next door decided to yell at their kids. less than 8 years old judging by their wailing and crying until 1230am to tell them to go to sleep and such. Then the excitement really picks up \u2026. in the hallway at least 2 couple decides that they must argue and yell at each other until 230am. Obviously the call to the front desk did n\u2019t solve anything so I just turned the tv up to drown out the nonsense. I was afraid that if told them to keep it down I would be shot at \u2026. yeah that kind of place. So in closing yes I \u2019m done with this place.

The bar food was excellent I did find that eating a table top to be better then at the bar. The bar is massive. I was also pleased to find that the parting garage had a height restriction of 10 feet and was well lighted and very clean. Further I found delight in the fact that the lady vacuuming the carpet made it a point to stop as I approached introduced herself to me and I her. She asked where I traveled from and how long would I be there. She was smiling warm friendly and told me that should she be able to make my staff better she would be delighted to help. If you smoke there are many well appointed areas outside for this. Just past the wonderful fire place nice to sit next to on those cool knights.

I \u2019l get to my issues with the actual service later. Everyone had big smiles greeted you etc. Special shout out to the valet guy up front on Friday night 1019. who I asked where the Monroe ballroom was and he did n\u2019t just tell me he actually walked me all the way back there to show me where it was. He went way out of his way to help with thatSecond bartenders. Winston \u2026 outstanding. All the bartenders when they were there were great. Poured generously and were super pleasantRoms were clean upon check in. Great location and so close and easy to get to the ferry to get to the other side of the river. Now for the issues. First and foremost housekeeping issues. I \u2019m not sure if they were short staffed or what. However I heard multiple complaints of rooms not being cleaned even after several days. The attached picture of glasses was taken at 530pm on Sunday night in front of the elevator on the 9th floor. I saw those exact glasses in that exact space on the 9th floor at 6 am. And I would guess that they had been put there on Saturday night sometime. So those glasses would be there for well over 12 hours. I had my own issues with housekeeping. The second night we were there I called at midnight and requested more towels. They did not arrive. Then overnight I got unavoidably sick and called at 6 am to request a special cleaning. I had no choice. When I called at 6 am I first said \u201c I called last night and requested towels and they never showed up \u201d. The very first words I heard were \u201c I was n\u2019t here last night \u201d. I was pretty appalled at that comment but just said \u201c please send up those towels \u201d. The towels arrived within 5 minutes. My next request though was for a special cleaning including changing the shower curtain. I was told \u201c there will be an extra fee \u201d. My response \u201c okay. that sucks. but yeah I need it cleaned \u201d. \u201c They charge an extra fee for vomit \u201d. I still said \u201c I get it but I need it cleaned. I did the best I could but I need it cleaned \u201d. She said she would tell them. 9 hours later I returned to my room. And nothing had changed. They had n\u2019t come for the special cleaning or even to change out the towels. I called again at 4 pm and the first comment I heard when I said I called at 6 am about the problem was \u2026 \u201dI was n\u2019t here at that time \u201d. So I have now received that response twice. \u201c Still do n\u2019t care I need my room cleaned \u201d. I was told it would be taken care of. I came back to my room 2 hours later \u2026 housekeeping came and changed the towels out made the bed and gave us toilet paper. That \u2019s it. It clearly had not been cleaned as I asked. So I gave up and washed the shower curtain best I could in the tub. Fortunately they did n\u2019t charge a cleaning fee. The bar restaurant area was small for our group but we made it work. As I said above the bartenders that were there were great. However Saturday at noon there was literally no one staffing the bar. After I watched one of our wheelchair bound attendees wait at the bar for about 5 minutes with no one coming over I walked over to the restaurant and said \u201c is anyone staffing the bar because we have several people wanting to order drinks \u201d. The response was \u201c no but I can get someone over there \u201d. What. At noon on a Saturday. Someone did make it over about 10 minutes later and it seemed to stay staffed the rest of the day but I would bet tips were not very generous after all that. Parking is a bit of a cluster. You basically drive in and get a tag. There is no arm that is down no attendant watching other than the valet over at the other end. I ended up being charged all 5 days for parking despite only really having had a car there two days. And then when I said something the response I got was initially \u201c I \u2019l have to have Accounting fix that \u201d. Um what. You ca n\u2019t fix that at the desk. I think she did end up fixing it although I have n\u2019t seen an updated bill. Food in restaurant and catered as we had both was mediocre at bestAlso as an aside the Renaissance hotel logo on the side of the building facing where the ferry picks up \u2026 dirt running all down the side of the building. Really should get that cleaned. For the group rate if I was paying that individually I would have not been very happy. But since it was a group rate that means that if I was staying there by myself it would have likely cost at least 50 a night more \u2026 I would have been extremely unhappy.

The hotel overall was awesome. There were a few hiccups but the staff \u2019s professionalism and attitudes smoothed them over. The A C was broken upon checking in but staff gave us a complementary breakfast coupon to cover that inconvenience. The attendant at the desk was professional and explained the situation to us in detail. The room was clean and the only issue was the movable furniture had some debris under it but overall clean. The neighbors were noisy but I know that \u2019s out of the hotel \u2019s control but they addressed the issue upon reporting it. The rooms were spacious and comfortable but especially the renovations. Valet was perfect and we left for our event and returned to valet service without an issue. I would definitely stay again.", "offset": [145, 260], "date": "2020-03-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
