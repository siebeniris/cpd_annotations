The French lady on the reception desk I think her name was Mena is a credit to the hotel she was wonderful with our 2yr old and always greeted us with a smile and took the time to have a quick chat with our son after he gave her a cheeky grin. It was nice touch how they gave our little boy a bucket and spade with a plastic toy turtle and also a colouring book he was totally made up and this kept him occupied. Also a big thanks to Rebekha aswel for assisting us during our stay. She was also very nice. The room was very spacious and clean with lovely comfortable bed linen. The bathroom was immaculate and we loved the Asprey toiletries everything from Shampoo right down to cotton buds everything you need just fabulous. The pool was a nice size and the access to the beach was brilliant also the hotel staff on the beach were very helpful in getting us sunbeds parasol and drinks. The hotel decoration is very nice and in keeping with the classic Miami vibe. We had such a good time we even ended up booking an extra nightThere is a lovely lady called Tamara Johnson who works in reservations we required a change to our booking and she was like an angel I truly can not thank her enough. On departure a lady called Paola Miranda was very helpful and kind and was so nice to our little boy and kept him very entertained as we had a few hours to kill before leaving to go to the airport.

The service at this hotel does not in any way live up to the reputation established by the Ritz Carlton name. I have stayed in Ritz Carlton hotels on both coasts and in between. Never have I seen such lackadaisical service. Upon leaving Key West I used the highly touted mobile ap to check into the hotel. We arrived four hours later and waited in line to get to the desk to speak to one of the hotel associates. Despite having used the mobile check in function on the ap the process to actually receive a key to the room from an associate was a lengthy and tedious process. There is no separate check in location for mobile check in at this Ritz. After finally wading through the check in process the young lady at the desk informed us she would need to walk us to the room to show us how to get there. With two suitcases two carry on bags and hanging clothes we trudged across the lobby. After traversing the lobby being led by the Ritz associate we arrived at a short flight of stairs where we were forced to carry unassisted our belongings up the flight to a further walk to an elevator. We boarded the elevator and went up two floors where we carried our belongings past the spa and through a hallway of meeting rooms and guest rooms to another elevator which we boarded and descended one floor. We then exited the hallway and walked down another hallway of guestrooms before finally arriving at our room. Upon opening the door one could not help but noticed the frayed carpet in the entry portion of the room. We quickly changed clothes and headed to the beach. The beach attendant very quickly arranged our chairs and towels doing a wonderful job. We mentioned to him we would like to order food and beverage and he assured us he would send someone to take our order. 30 minutes passed and we had yet to see anyone with whom we could place an order. I finally walked back to the area where the towels were and found someone to take our snack order. We then left the beach and stopped in the downstairs restaurant for a meal. After giving our name and room number we were seated where we waited for service. The waiter finally approached our table and begrudgingly took our order not once during the entire meal did he address us by our name which I know to be something Ritz Carlton instills in their employees. After eating we asked for a glass of water. You would have thought we had asked the waiter to consume the contents of the Atlantic Ocean using a straw. As I write this I anticipate a canned reply from management copied and pasted word for word as seems to be their practice at this hotel. Even the responses from management lack the personal attention to detail Ritz Carlton has provided me and millions of other guests at the numerous locations in which I have stayed. In short it is borderline fraud for the name Ritz Carlton to be attached to this chain. It is sad that customers come to this location to stay thinking they are truly staying at a Ritz. They will be missing out on what makes the brand so well loved the wonderful service and attention to detail. Anyone who has come to trust the Ritz brand as I have will be sorely disappointed.
