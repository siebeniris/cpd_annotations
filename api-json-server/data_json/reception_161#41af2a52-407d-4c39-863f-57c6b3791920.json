I booked this hotel having been away already this year and did not want to spend a fortune we also chose the all inclusive option so whilst it is a little limiting we knew what it would cost us. We went just before Christmas and it was relatively quiet so it was easy to get a table in the restaurants. Very impressed with service food etc in all the restaurants we tried them all including the buffet very late the night we arrived I was impressed that they told us when it was closing and we worked around this but they did not rush us out. Nice bar up on the roof musicians friendly and great fun. We did go to the White Orchid the premier restaurant really superb food and service and the best Thai curry I have ever had. We did have a couple of issues and were very impressed that Mr Ahmed the manager of the front office resolved these quickly and kindly. Nice location in that you can have a walk round the harbour and on the beach and obviously if you play golf the golf course note if you walk back from the sports bar that way watch out for the sprinklers. Great for a couple like us but would be super for families with any age kids ours would have loved it when they were younger. There is room for improvement at breakfast and the beach bars but management know this and are working on it.

Again. This was our second stay over the Christmas holidays and once again we have had a 5 star experience. We are a family of two adults and one ten year old. As soon as you turn up at the hotel you are treated like royalty. The staff on reception can not do enough for you and welcome you into their hotel warmly. Before we flew out with Emirates which I have to agree with a previous review not great to fly with we requested the same room number as we had last year room 148 and were delighted to find we were going to get the room again. We were a little early so the reception lady kindly gave us a ticket to go and grab some lunch. The rooms are superb. We just had a garden view room but it was plenty big enough for us and our daughter. The balcony is standing room only but lovely views across the front of the hotel \u2019s gardens. Nice big bathroom daily supplies of water. When we arrived we had a bottle of red wine and a fruit bowl supplied. We went all inclusive and there is a mini bar in the room but did n\u2019t feel the need to use it and pay when we could get what we wanted from the bars. You are supplied bath robes and slippers. The cleaner who looked after us was great and I never had any trouble asking for more toiletries. New to us this year was an inflatable assault course in the sea. Guests are provided with a life jacket for the swim out to the start point. It \u2019s a bit chilly in December but you soon get used to it. The course itself was great fun but hard work for a 40 year old. Definitely recommend it for an hour or so. The restaurants attached to this resort are superb. Our favourite is Divaz \u2019s which we visited twice and is a fish lover \u2019s paradise. We also had steak at the Shooters restaurant and La Traviata which again were fab. We mainly had lunch at the captain \u2019s bar and also tried the sports caf\u00e9 again lovely. The main dining room in the hotel offers buffet breakfast lunch and dinner and the options available are vast. Omelettes in the morning are good although not everyone gets what a queue is and just pushes to the front. The pool area is very nice. You need to get down by 9 am though if you want a bed in the sun might be different during the summer. Pool bar is great for drinks and ice creams. Friendly staff especially Elvish and Denis. The manager laid on a lovely cocktail evening and was very good at interacting with the guests which was nice to see. The Christmas festivities were amazing. They had a winter wonderland area for the kids which was decorated with Christmas trees and had stalls for the kids to play on like hoopla. Christmas day was superb. Eating out in the sun with an amazing spread of buffet food to choose from. Santa paid a visit for the kids plus there were games going on. Camel and pony rides. We also went to Mass on the day and that was very special with the hotel choir singing beautifully. Our favourite bar was the captains bar by the beach. Friendly service and lovely views. Ajay deserves a special mention as he was very friendly with us and took time out to talk to us including our daughter. Also Laxman provided a very friendly service. The Coney family provided music in the evening and would come to your table and take requests. Lovely family lovely singing and again interacted great with our daughter. In conclusion a fabulous Christmas in a wonderful hotel and location with superb friendly staff If the Manager is reading this please give Ajay at the Captain \u2019s bar a pat on the back for his great service \u2013 and tell him Summer Claire and Jason say hello.

The family I have just returned from this wonderful property after a 4 night wish it could have been longer break from the UKs chill. I visited Dubai 20 years ago en route to Sri Lanka and boy has the landscape changed. After a comfortable transfer of around 30 mins through the skyscrapers we arrived at the Jebel Ali where we were warmly welcomed and efficiently checked in. Our generous All Inclusive package allowed for plenty of indulgence and the bar staff quickly explained what was and what was not included. Just about everything was included and there is plenty of choice. The room was of an average size and we had a small balcony overlooking the Marina. We ate in the buffet the Italian beach bar and Shooters. All restuarants were of a very high standard with faultless service. We thought the Italian was particularly good but you would be very hard pushed to find fault anywhere. We would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly for couples and families alike. The warm unobtrusive but extremely efficient service is comedable the location is attractive with a pretty marina and lush gardens encircling the property. Dubai is expensive so if you are likely to be hydrating with a few beers and eating at the fine restuarants the All Inclusive is likely to be the best option.

Overall this hotel was great it was our first time visiting Dubai and we stayed for 5 days on a stopover to another destination. The hotel was presented well and very clean. Our room was lovely we had a view of the pool and sea which was a bonus and they were spacious and the beds were huge. The housekeeping was great and I loved the turn down service they did in the evenings whilst you were at dinner. Both pools were great and the swim up bar staff were fantastic always topping up your drinks and a great selection of cocktails. The main pool was very deep 4 m not an issue at all for us and loads of sunbeds the ones by the pool were always taken quickly but there were plenty of others on the grass areas around it. The food was amazing probably one of the best I have experienced at an all inclusive hotel. There was so much selection on the buffet and it never felt repetitive. We visited the shooters club and had steak there which I highly recommend it was fantastic and the service was quick and friendly. We also visited the Italian which again was brilliant staff were so helpful and chatty and the food was great again. Our air con broke one day and in August it is extremely hot and you need the air con on all the time but someone came up and fixed in within the hour which was great. My only criticism for why I wo nt give it 5 stars is our check in we arrived in the early hours of the morning from Singapore we got to our hotel around 3 am and obviously very tired the gentlemen checking us in was rushing through what was all inclusive and what was not and he proceeded to tell us we needed pay 1000 Dirhams \u00a3 200 for hotel fees and in case we used anything in the mini bar etc which if we did not would be refunded which I completely understand has to be done for some reason there machines were not working and our card kept being declined we must of been there a good half an hour before they resolved it. I felt like this is something that could of been resolved in the morning we would of happily come down or they could of even come and got us rather than making us wait until near on 4 am so they could get the money they knew exactly what room we were in so it was not like we would of gone anywhere.

Firstly I would like to say that we had a lovely time whilst spending a week at the hotel. We certainly felt very relaxed and well rested as we are here as time together before the birth of our first child. We had booked based upon the recommendation of friends who return year on year who stated that the all inclusive was fantastic and the a la carte restaurants were excellent. Whilst I would agree with parts there are also other parts that I would very much disagree with. I would like to state that my wife and I when we book a holiday look for a nice resort all inclusive a nice variety of a la carte restaurants somewhere to relax. This will differ vastly from what a lot of readers may want from their holiday and what we will be looking to book in future so I felt it was important to understand our opinions based on what we like. I will start on hotel location. Our driver from the airport made a comment that we would be driving through \u2018 new Dubai \u2019 through \u2018 old Dubai \u2019 and into \u2018 empty Dubai \u2019. This was not an issue for us as we did n\u2019t plan on heading into the main attraction areas and would stay on the resort but you are looking at a 20 25 minute taxi from the hotel back to what the driver described as \u2018 old Dubai \u2019. We never looked into it but the hotel do put on shuttles to the malls etc. But at what frequency and how many stops they make I could not tell you. On arrival at the hotel the grounds looked fantastic. We drove past the equestrian centre and the golf course that both looked great. We also did n\u2019t take advantage of these facilities. The lobby was rather grand and on initial arrival check in was simple and staff very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately a room was not free for us when we arrived as we got here at 080 local time. Staff were good enough to provide us somewhere to leave our bags and left us with a mobile phone that reception would call us on when the room was ready. This was around 120 3 hours earlier than check in timeOnce we arrived at our double sea view room the best I could describe it as in all honesty is just above average. Whilst it is nicely decorated and furnished it \u2019s only big enough I would say for two adults and an infant. The balcony is even smaller. I \u2019m used to large rooms with plenty of facilities but this just was n\u2019t what I expect of a 5 star hotel. I have stayed in travel lodge rooms with similar decor furnishings and facilities. The air con whilst it worked certainly did n\u2019t go to the temperatures it stated. This would be more like a city hotel room rather than a resort for my previous experience. But none the less a room that was more than acceptable for us as we did not plan on spending too much time in there other than sleeping. BIG WARNING check with the provider you are booking with if you are looking at booking all inclusive to check wether you are being booked \u2018 Deluxe \u2019 or \u2018 Ultra \u2019 all inclusive. We booked via Travel republic who made absolutely no mention of two differing types of package and also stated that there were a la carte restaurants included. We were placed on Deluxe all inclusive and if I \u2019m honest it \u2019s pretty naf. Travel republic later told us that it is a standard package which pretty much just includes buffet \u2019s and a couple of smaller restaurants which are more like gastro pubs and bar food. The a la carte restaurants offer 50 off the bill for guests who do not have the a la carte restaurants included. I will attach copies of what is included on both packages via pictures. We were not happy with this as Travel republic had not advertised this correctly and after some back and forth they admitted that the information on their site was incorrect and we fought and got upgraded to the ultra all inclusive package which is what we expected of an all inclusive and thought we would be getting. The facilities at the hotel are great. There are plenty of pools plenty of places to eat lots of bars a nice beach area and from what I can tell lots of activities for families with kids. I would certainly recommend this hotel for people with young children as there are plenty here and all the families seem to be having fun. Sun loungers have really nice comfortable cushions on and towels are included. All of the areas are very clean and well maintained. It \u2019s clear a lot of effort goes into maintaining cleanliness standards here. One of the big issues I have with this hotel is that which ever board basis you are staying you have to sign the bill for each order. Even as all inclusive you can get large bills to sign although staff inform this is for record purposes I still felt like on check out I was going to receive a large bill. None of the restaurants or bars make it perfectly clear what is and what is n\u2019t included and we felt the need to reconfirm what was included in our package at each one before ordering. The need to sign for stuff that is all included seems pointless to me and in all honestly became annoying in the end. The service from staff was inconsistent to say the least. We found some incredibly helpful others not so. Some staff would run your bill for the whole days worth of drinks at the pool others would make you sign each order. Staff at the a la carte restaurants were excellent. Very attentive and polite and nothing was too much. At the buffets smaller restaurants and bars although food service was fairly quick you could be waiting an age for a drink even if you were the only person waiting. Quite often receiving 1 item off the order then waiting 10 minutes for the second whilst someone else was served. Saying this every staff member was incredibly polite and friendly. Staff at reception were also very polite and helpful I may add. Each and everyone one of the a la carte restaurants were excellent. I ca n\u2019t fault the food and service and this was one of the main reasons for booking this hotel and it did n\u2019t disappoint. Whilst the bars and restaurants vary in location between the three hotels here it was not much hassle using the resorts shuttle services to get to each one. I would make sure if you are booking all inclusive that you select the ultra package as you need to eat at the a la carte venues as they were so nice. You are paying for all inclusive so do n\u2019t make a mistake and have to cover half of your bills each night. The only a la carte experience not included is the tepanyaki dinner in the Asian restaurant. This will come at a 50 discount to guests. We took advantage of this and we had an incredible meal and enjoyed the show. The buffets certainly are n\u2019t amongst the largest I \u2019ve seen but they have a fair average selection and you would n\u2019t go hungry. Other facilities that were available such as golf water sports horse riding shooting range sports complex and paintball all looked great. We did not try any of these so would be unfair to comment but they are there to use. Overall I would say this was a nice hotel and would rate my experience here as three and a half stars out of five. As I mentioned earlier there are some really attractive points to this hotel but two differing all inclusive packages a basic room signing for each order and inconsistent service were enough to drop the score in my opinion. I \u2019m sure other people including our friends who return each year will have a different opinion to ours but this is an honest review as I can give based upon what we wanted from our holiday and what we thought we received.

This was not an issue for us as we did n\u2019t plan on heading into the main attraction areas and would stay on the resort but you are looking at a 20 25 minute taxi from the hotel back to what the driver described as \u2018 old Dubai \u2019. We never looked into it but the hotel do put on shuttles to the malls etc. But at what frequency and how many stops they make I could not tell you. On arrival at the hotel the grounds looked fantastic. We drove past the equestrian centre and the golf course that both looked great. We also did n\u2019t take advantage of these facilities. The lobby was rather grand and on initial arrival check in was simple and staff very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately a room was not free for us when we arrived as we got here at 080 local time. Staff were good enough to provide us somewhere to leave our bags and left us with a mobile phone that reception would call us on when the room was ready. This was around 120 3 hours earlier than check in timeOnce we arrived at our double sea view room the best I could describe it as in all honesty is just above average. Whilst it is nicely decorated and furnished it \u2019s only big enough I would say for two adults and an infant. The balcony is even smaller. I \u2019m used to large rooms with plenty of facilities but this just was n\u2019t what I expect of a 5 star hotel. I have stayed in travel lodge rooms with similar decor furnishings and facilities. The air con whilst it worked certainly did n\u2019t go to the temperatures it stated. This would be more like a city hotel room rather than a resort for my previous experience. But none the less a room that was more than acceptable for us as we did not plan on spending too much time in there other than sleeping. BIG WARNING check with the provider you are booking with if you are looking at booking all inclusive to check wether you are being booked \u2018 Deluxe \u2019 or \u2018 Ultra \u2019 all inclusive. We booked via Travel republic who made absolutely no mention of two differing types of package and also stated that there were a la carte restaurants included. We were placed on Deluxe all inclusive and if I \u2019m honest it \u2019s pretty naf. Travel republic later told us that it is a standard package which pretty much just includes buffet \u2019s and a couple of smaller restaurants which are more like gastro pubs and bar food. The a la carte restaurants offer 50 off the bill for guests who do not have the a la carte restaurants included. I will attach copies of what is included on both packages via pictures. We were not happy with this as Travel republic had not advertised this correctly and after some back and forth they admitted that the information on their site was incorrect and we fought and got upgraded to the ultra all inclusive package which is what we expected of an all inclusive and thought we would be getting. The facilities at the hotel are great. There are plenty of pools plenty of places to eat lots of bars a nice beach area and from what I can tell lots of activities for families with kids. I would certainly recommend this hotel for people with young children as there are plenty here and all the families seem to be having fun. Sun loungers have really nice comfortable cushions on and towels are included. All of the areas are very clean and well maintained. It \u2019s clear a lot of effort goes into maintaining cleanliness standards here. One of the big issues I have with this hotel is that which ever board basis you are staying you have to sign the bill for each order. Even as all inclusive you can get large bills to sign although staff inform this is for record purposes I still felt like on check out I was going to receive a large bill. None of the restaurants or bars make it perfectly clear what is and what is n\u2019t included and we felt the need to reconfirm what was included in our package at each one before ordering. The need to sign for stuff that is all included seems pointless to me and in all honestly became annoying in the end. The service from staff was inconsistent to say the least. We found some incredibly helpful others not so. Some staff would run your bill for the whole days worth of drinks at the pool others would make you sign each order. Staff at the a la carte restaurants were excellent. Very attentive and polite and nothing was too much. At the buffets smaller restaurants and bars although food service was fairly quick you could be waiting an age for a drink even if you were the only person waiting. Quite often receiving 1 item off the order then waiting 10 minutes for the second whilst someone else was served. Saying this every staff member was incredibly polite and friendly. Staff at reception were also very polite and helpful I may add. Each and everyone one of the a la carte restaurants were excellent. I ca n\u2019t fault the food and service and this was one of the main reasons for booking this hotel and it did n\u2019t disappoint. Whilst the bars and restaurants vary in location between the three hotels here it was not much hassle using the resorts shuttle services to get to each one. I would make sure if you are booking all inclusive that you select the ultra package as you need to eat at the a la carte venues as they were so nice. You are paying for all inclusive so do n\u2019t make a mistake and have to cover half of your bills each night. The only a la carte experience not included is the tepanyaki dinner in the Asian restaurant. This will come at a 50 discount to guests. We took advantage of this and we had an incredible meal and enjoyed the show. The buffets certainly are n\u2019t amongst the largest I \u2019ve seen but they have a fair average selection and you would n\u2019t go hungry. Other facilities that were available such as golf water sports horse riding shooting range sports complex and paintball all looked great. We did not try any of these so would be unfair to comment but they are there to use. Overall I would say this was a nice hotel and would rate my experience here as three and a half stars out of five. As I mentioned earlier there are some really attractive points to this hotel but two differing all inclusive packages a basic room signing for each order and inconsistent service were enough to drop the score in my opinion. I \u2019m sure other people including our friends who return each year will have a different opinion to ours but this is an honest review as I can give based upon what we wanted from our holiday and what we thought we received.

Like many others have indicated the All Inclusive package needs to be clearly defined open and transparent. As I recently suggested to a resort manager wrist bands are a necessity and effective in assisting staff members. The Items included in the AI package for example are identified by a small asterisk which I found difficulty viewing. How a partially sighted guest would manage is open to debate. Obviously the Covid 19 outbreak had some impact on our latest visit staffing shortages etc however I thought under the circumstances the resort functioned incredibly well. Congratulations to all of the staff and management. I know other guests were quite angry with fewer reception staff on duty but I would n\u2019t be perturbed unduly worried by their ignorance. Finally thank you once again for a wonderful experience JA is up there with the best especially the restaurants and food quality. From a worldwide traveller I have seen similar resorts fall from grace due to cost cutting exercises ie lowering the quality of their alcoholic beverages. I implore you to retain or even higher the level you have achieved and the resort will prosper and grow for many more years. Hoping to return February 2021. Be safe and take care during these uncertain times. Best wishes Paul.", "offset": [773, 908], "date": "2020-03-23 18:36:34", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
