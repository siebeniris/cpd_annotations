My company has held our annual meetings at the Ritz for over 10yrs. Our meeting lasts over the course of two days. It entails booking room blocks utilizing various meeting rooms as well as their catering service. Their staff most importantly Hope Nudelman are a joy. We look forward to returning to the Ritz each year so we can see Hope and all of the banquet staff at the hotel. They are so gracious and so helpful. They roll out the red carpet for us and they are always available to help us even when we are a pain in the rear. This year we provided each of our clients with free rooms and wanted to provide a welcome package upon check in. The staff so graciously put packages in each room before our clients checked in. The valet staff are very accommodating making sure all of our clients get on the hired shuttle to get ti the airport. I recommend the Ritz for business meetings as well as personal lodging. no matter how small or large your meeting they will take great care of you.
