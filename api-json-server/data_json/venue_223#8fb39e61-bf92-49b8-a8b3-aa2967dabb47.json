I stayed at the hotel on Sunday night so that I could get up early on Monday to attend a large breakfast celebration at the hotel for MLK Day. The hotel room was clean and the king sized bed was comfortable. I especially appreciated the service at the hotel. I was helping to plan the breakfast and had to interact with the staff who were responsible for setting up the banquet room the night before the breakfast and on the day of the breakfast. The staff particularly Derrick and Jenifer consistently met our requests for small items like storing flowers in their refrigerator overnight and setting up extra tables during the breakfast itself to accommodate additional guests. So in addition to the hotel being a great place to stay it is also a great conference center for holding large events. In addition I ate at the bar and had a great Angus bacon cheeseburger.", "offset": [298, 485], "date": "2015-01-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f89594c2-e3de-4853-873a-ea4f83103ed9", "sentence": "Costly but nice.

Only negative is that the conference rooms downstairs are accessed by stairs and that is tough with a suitcase. There is an elevator somewhere by the conference rooms but I have never seen it.

The front desk gentleman was kind enough to move us to another room. Our new room looked ok.

We were here for a conference and due to the amount of people attending we had two different reservations. A single for 3 for part of the week Tuesday and Wednesday. then a double for the rest of the week when we had 5 peopleThursday to Sunday. When it was time to change rooms they told us that there were no double rooms available and we had to move to a different hotel or keep our single with 5 people. Mind you the max for singles are 3 due to fire code. So for Thursday night we had 5 in a single and was given a maybe that we would have a double for the rest of the week. We asked for blankets so our extras people could have them and was told they are in the room. I told this women I checked and we only had what was on the bed the girl said ok I will have someone check on that and never did not anything. We had to wait until a shift change to ask for blankets who without questions he I believehis name was Nicholas who was the only good employee the hotel had that we dealt with got us blankets pillows and offered his apologies because we were not the first that shift to complain adout the morning desk. The woman then tried to charge us the full price for the room instead of the conference price and agrued with us about it. We even showed them their invoice they emailed to us with the discount price. Then because we had two reservations both my husband and I got the free parking pass that the conference offersed one for each room and they would nt take it. The email we got said right into it to hand it to the desk when checking in and they told us it was not valid and we had to get the conference chair to take time out of his busy schedule of running the week long conference to tell the desk this was right. This was along on Wednesday of the week so many people we have talk to had not issues with this. Then Friday morning we had a friend who let us put our staff in their room when we checked out of the single until a room was ready. We got to the desk at 10 am and was told by Nicholas that there was a double room was ready for us. I find this hard to believe that a room was ready this early in the morning when none were last night. Someone had to check out and housekeeping had to clean up all and the computer had to be updated that the room was good all before 10 am. I think not. We also had the same women her name was something like Samantha but was spelled differently most of these issues and she was nothing but rude to us the whole week. Like I said before the night shift guy named Nicholas was the only one the whole week we did not have any problems with. If any stars are to be given he should get 10 stars for doing his job well and having to clean up after Samantha. But the biggest thing was when the power when out. Yes I know they were not the reason the hotel lost power for a few minutes but during thoses minutes I got stuck in the elevator and banged my knee off the floor from the jout of the stop. The elevator thankfully had a fail safe and it slowly bought me to the ground floor and opened without an issue. So good job on that part but when I went to tell the front desk to tell them that I was stuck in the elevator because at the time I did not know that power went out and tought it was the elevator so it can be fixed I was told we know. and he walked away. No i m sorry you got stuck in OUR elevator or asked if I was okay. Random people who were waiting for the elevator asked if I was okay when the door opened and offered me help but the staff could of cared less. What if I was there for more then a few minutes or if I hit my head. The rest of this post I can deal with but this is the safety of YOUR guest.
