The hotel is very well located in piscadeira about 1015 mins from Hato Airport. It has a nice private beach and two pools and whirlpools. In spite of being an old building it is very well maintained spotless and clean. There is also a diving shop and activities inside. In general the staff is very friendly and helpful but the girls at the lounge are outstanding specially Dawn and Karen thanks for all the smiles songs and pampering received during our stay. You both are out of this world love you girlsThe check in was not good a student took care of us and was a disaster but finally after some back and forwards we get all what we paid and reserved. Advise for the management please before assign front desk try to train and prepare for the worst. The room we get was great on the Fifth floor overlooking the Island and partial the ocean. It was renovated no long ago and everything was clean and in good condition. The bathroom is comfortable and well sized a detail in our room suite 502 has a window overlooking the sea it is great to brush your teeth on the morning and watch the sunrise or when you are in the shower the sea is in front of you. This is priceless. The balcony is big with chairs and table to hang outside too. The room has a huge walk in closet very comfortable bed and perfect linens desk bar area and a living room. We had breakfast some times at the lounge and one day at the buffet downstairs my rate included Both which was terrible it is a resort we went down 950 to have breakfast. they were out of omelets because there was no more ingredients ham mushrooms cheese peppers etc unacceptable in a Hilton and there was more things that run out of incredible. Quality of the food was no bad but seems not enough and a bit disorganized. On the other hand one afternoon had a margaritas and hamburgers in one of the terraces service and food were perfect.

I ve stayed at a variety of Hilton s around the world and Hilton Curacao continued the brand s trend of a high quality experience that I ve now come to expect from them. While planning our trip we had read a lot of reviews about the hotel s aging building. While the exterior is pretty out of date it s like walking back into the 60 s. the newly renovated rooms really were fantastic. Nothing old about them. And the general upkeep of the hotel grounds was good. The miniature golf is however in dire need of a face lift though. The resort offered two beaches which was great. The main one just outside of the building itself and another one just east that was easy to get to. I believe they share that beach with the Floris hotel. Just further down was the Mariot s beach another great place to swim and snorkel. And speaking of snorkeling and diving awesome. I was amazed at how much was to be seen just a minute or two off shore. We brought our own snorkel equipment but i m sure they offered it to guests. The entirety of the hotels staff especially the front desk and house keeping were all incredibly kind and helpful. And the shuttle service into Wilemstad was appreciated since taxi s can get pretty pricey. My only gripe with Hilton Curacao the restaurants. We went to 3 of the 4 and they were just ok at best. I ve reviewed Aqua Bligh s Bar and the Beach Bar Grill here. All were OK at best. The two of us often went to the Mariot s SeaBreze beachside bar and grill for lunch and dinner because the service and the food was exceptionally better than anything the Hilton s restaurant s had to offer. This does nt appear to be a secret either. I ve seen countless reviews saying the same thing. When will Hilton begin to improve upon their food offering. They re literally loosing hundreds of dollars to competitors that a short 5 minute walk away. Restaurant gripes aside i really did like the Hilton.

As with all of my reviews I rate a property based on the value that you get for the price you have paid for the experience. This property is a mid price point hotel resort that in my opinion hits the mark of excellence for the type of property that it is. Here are my thoughts on the aspects of the property that I experienced during my stay and whether that aspect met my expectations or missed them. Front Desk Rating Exceeded Expectation. We arrived around 330 PM and there was a short line of guests waiting to check in. There were three people working behind the desk at three work stations so all posts were manned. This is great since this is a busy check in time and the hotel allocated an appropriate number of staff to handle the rush. After a short wait less than 5 minutes we were greeted very politely by Fiona. She smiled and welcomed us. She recognized my Hilton Honors Gold status and upgraded us to the Executive Floor 5th Floor. Our room was not ready so she provided us directions to the Executive Lounge and asked us to wait there and someone would notify us when our room was ready. We were checked in in less than 5 minutes. Excellent job Fiona. Thank youExecutive Lounge Rating. Met Expectation. I have to write this with a caveat. While the lounge itself is nice with a great balcony and modest food and drink offerings the staff makes it a true gem. I have been in much fancier Hilton Lounges but the staff here at the Hilton Curacao put this one on a different level. Petcha Dawn and Karen were all super throughout our stay. Very friendly welcoming and genuine with their hospitality. The Room Rating Exceeded Expectation. The room was nice and clean. The bathroom was the nicest bathroom I have experienced in the Caribbean. It was clean with a modern shower and vanity. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were something that you would find at a much higher end property. Housekeeping deserves some praise here. We had a few special requests and they were timely and thorough in meeting them. The room was on the 5th Floor Ocean side 523 so the view from the balcony was stunning especially in the evening at sunset. We had pizza from Tomatoes see food rating on the balcony our last night there and it may have been the most romantic dinner we had during our stay. The Beach Rating. Met Expectation. I am a bit of a connoisseur in this area. The beach is the entire reason we vacation to most of the destinations that we visit. While the beach is nice and small it did get crowded at times. I attribute this to the pool undergoing a renovation while we were there. There were quite a few people on the beach that would normally lay by the pool instead. This made for a crowd that was a little louder than usual and definitely grungier than normal. By that I mean that they left more trash on the beach than I would normally expect to see. Simply inexcusable given that there were trash cans within easy distance. The hotel staff does reset the chairs each morning and actually hand rakes the sand and picks up the big trash that the people above leave behind. A plea to smokers the beach is not an ash tray please pick up your cigarette butts. there is my rant for this review. The Food Rating Exceeded Expectation. We ate at Captain Blighs Bar Celeste Grill and Cielos Italian. All were very good given their menu choices. Of note the Fish Tacos at Celeste Grill. Cielos is worth special mention here as well. Very romantic with good presentation and impeccable service. The food is very good and Norman provides the impeccable service. Again he imparts a genuine feel that seems to be a theme amongst most of the staff here. Definitely try Tomatoes Pizza and Pirate Bay next door. The food is great and the atmosphere is intoxicating. The Gym Rating Exceeded Expectation. This is not your typical hotel gym. It is a full service gym that sell memberships. It has all of the equipment you need to keep you on your workout routine. Very clean and professional. Overall Rating. Exceeded Expectation. This is a mid priced hotel resort that gives you more value for your money than you should expect for this price point. The staff is overall notable and the ones I mentioned by name are exceptional. Very nice experience. Is it the Four Seasons. No and yes. If you want that degree of material luxury then pony up the cash and pay for it. If you want that degree of sincere and genuine service from that staff you just might find it here.

We read the reviews about this place and flip flopped about staying here so much that we had 2 other hotel bookings as a backup Santa Barbara and MariotAs you pull into the parking lot yes the hotel looks more like a motel from the 70s. That being said the staff are very friendly and make you feel very welcome when you check in. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a Junior suite on the top floor with a fantastic view of the beach and sunset and this helped is to enjoy our stay. While our room had been renovated it did have some wear and tear and housekeeping was to a Caribbean standard. Because of the older style there was a door to this balcony instead of a screened patio door. The parts we enjoyed the most in our room were the balcony and the bed very nice and comfortable. While this gym was large and had lots of equipment it is in need of renovation. Most of the staff on the property were helpful but I would have to say the fitness centre staff were not. For 2 days no sanitizing spray was available despite asking for it. Our favourite part of the property was the beach it was very nice for swimming. We had so much jumping off the dock into the sea and we were always able to find a chair to sit in. That being said the foot and body showers were defective which was an inconvenience since we dragged sand up to our room in a shower that did not drain well to begin with. The breakfast was adequate and we enjoyed it. Unfortunately the food and seating is all outdoor and exposed so birds are quite aggressive and you need to watch everything. We used the executive lounge in the morning for the espresso machine. While you have a nice view during cocktail hour and the drinks are reasonably priced we chose to have happy hour on our balcony. Had we not had our view we would have purchased drinks at the lounge. We also found the hotels location convenient to attend explore the island. There is a great little pizza place called Tomatos a 10 minute walk away. There was only one occurrence when the wind was blowing in the wrong direction and that we smelled smoke from the refinery. Curacao has great infrastructure compared to other Caribbean islands and this is due to the refinery and sometimes you can smell the smoke from the refinery on some parts of the island. Overall we liked this hotel and would stay here again. We feel the hotel is a gem that needs a major overhaul though. There are enough positives to balance the negatives. We feel the staff at this hotel went above and beyond to make our stay memorable and it was. That being said having a Junior suite on the top floor made a difference and had we not had this room out experience may have been different.", "offset": [819, 898], "date": "2016-04-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "7dd560bc-bcc3-49b0-9573-5429ff3e104b", "sentence": "Decent Hotel Expensive Food.

We took the shuttle service into town one day. it is free and provided twice a day. Make sure you book ahead of time at least 1 day before because the van can only accommodate 12 people per ride and it books up quickly. I recommend renting a car even if just for a day to drive west to check out other beaches and east towards town. We liked walking around Punda neighbourhood and dined at a really nice restaurant. We also went north to visit the Shete Bota which we liked very much and spent the afternoon at Mambo beach. it is a nice an lively beach with lots of places to eat or shop.

ADA bathrooms on check in level and lower levels but new lap pool has NO RAILS FOR ENTERING the pool. So parents pay attention to your little cherubs. Better yet keep them over at the other pool. Lots of quirks to be worked out but you will not find a more accommodating staff. Everyone was most pleasant 5 stars. Give this resort some time and they will be the 5 Stars they once were. But if you visit before all renovations are finished do not complain about construction noise. Enjoy the food staff beautiful views beautiful open spaces and the best hospitable staff on the island. Aside from renovation noise you should have a wonderful experience in the newly remodeled renovated Mariot.

The Curacao Mariot Beach Resort is Fantastic. It boasts an Expansive lobby with Bar gift shop and seating area that overlooks the pool and Blue Ocean waters. Recently reopened after three years of renovations. Our room was perfect Clean large bathroom with a great shower. Breakfast was good and the entire staff was friendly warm and welcoming. They went above and beyond the norm. The entire hotel staff was Five Star. The Mariot sits directly on the beach and the ocean waves can clearly be heard inside. One area that was a one star was the pool food and drink service. Each and every time we ordered we waited a substantial amount of time for anything to arrive. Even thenit was usually missing something such as utensils and napkins. The entire operation needs to be redone. The location is idea and a short distance from downtown. Bottom line we would definitely stay here again. The entire staff was exceptional.

My wife and I just spent 8 days at the Mariot Beach Resort in Curacao. It opened in November 2019. it is beautifully renovated but their service is definitely subpar compared to other Mariot hotels. When I booked it on Expedia there was no mention that it had just opened when I tried to change hotels they refused. it is understandable that they are still going through some growing pains but you may want to give it some time before booking so that they can work out the kinks. The restaurants are OK and the food is decent. The breakfast at C spice is excellent and the Salty Iguana is very good bar food great for lunch by the pool. The rooms have poor sound insulation and you can hear everything in the hallways. it is normally OK but when the staff come in for their shift at 7 am they are almost screaming at each other. it woke my wife and I almost every morning. The mosquitoes are very aggressive they need to spray for mosquitoes much more. My wife and I were covered in mosquito bites despite using DET mosquito spray daily. The staff are very polite and kind and it looks like they really want to make it work. they just need to tweak things a bit.

The renovated Mariot re opened November 2019 is n\u2019t quite ready for business and should n\u2019t have opened. It \u2019l take them a while to get ready lots of growing pains. Not worth it if you \u2019re about to enjoy a vacation. The excuse I \u2019ve heard multiple times is \u201c we only just opened everything is new \u201d. No apology no acknowledgment it \u2019s a joke really. When I spoke with other guests Dutch Canadians Americans they all said the same. We stayed here early in January and were quite disappointed. Pool view rooms or Ocean view are nice but do n\u2019t go for a garden view room as there is no garden. Still work in progress. There is only one restaurant aircon set at 16C60F and no one knows how to change temperature. I \u2019m not joking. They even acknowledged. Eating outside. Nice idea except for all the flies and mosquitoes. Nothing helped. Got bitten all the time. At breakfast expect a queue for a table inside or sit with flies all around you. For dinner there is a bit more choice but not a lot. The lobby or beach bar seemed the only solution where you \u2019d hope the breeze helps getting rid of these bugs but unfortunately everyone had that same idea and we had to wait long for a table for 2 and there were only very few guests at the resort imagine if they fill all rooms. Staff there are friendly they offer menus from the restaurant as everyone complained about the temperature there so you can order a steak burgers etc. and have it brought there. Just a shame they do n\u2019t offer Caribbean food or Dutch Indo dishes which I was looking forward to. For the remaining days we ended up renting a Hertz car in the lobby sidenote not even the Mariot Ap recognizes the new hotel as location and had really nice dinners in town instead. Much better option if you have a car. Just do n\u2019t expect a parking spot in the evenings always full. I ended up parking on the side of the road after talking with the lovely girl at Hertz. On a positive note staff is friendly they \u2019re really trying hard but just do n\u2019t have the tools the training and all that \u2019s required for an opening. It \u2019s obvious they lack direction. Management nowhere to be seen. Example the lack of umbrellas. I counted 5 on the beach and about 6 by each pool. That \u2019s it. When I asked if they have another one the reply I got was. \u201dwe only just opened \u201d. There is no water in the room limited Nespreso cups and when I askedwhy they do n\u2019t refill. sure enough \u201c we only just opened \u201d. We found room cleaning sporadic and not properly done. Bin not cleaned. Again same excuse when we asked for fresh towels. Room service food left overs dishes are in front of rooms for up to 24h. No one seems to care. I asked to speak to a supervisor after multiple attempts to get our room cleaned no response. There are just lots of little issues they need to take care of and a few bigger ones. Honestly hotel should n\u2019t have opened. We had 5. fire alarms at night thankfully our last night at the hotel before leaving. No indication whether false or not so most people called the front desk except they did n\u2019t pick up the phone. I went to the lobby met a lovely girl but she did n\u2019t know what was going on. I asked if she called the fire brigade but the answer I got was we think it \u2019s a false alarm. we only just opened. No apology no explanation not even the morning after or when we checked out of course with an inaccuracy on the bill cause it \u2019s all new to them and \u201c we only just opened \u201d. I learned my lesson wo n\u2019t go back to a Mariot that \u2019s newly opened. They clearly lack standards. Perhaps in a year or so this is a good place to visit for now I ca n\u2019t recommend.", "offset": [43, 147], "date": "2020-01-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "5638a2fe-18b5-426f-8843-044fb3b9e5f2", "sentence": "Some hiccups and improvements needed but overall nice. Newly renovated and opened. Great pool area and smallish beach area. Not the best beach in Curacao but not the worst either. Rooms are updated but somewhat sparse. Bed was very nice and comfortable. The TV was notably big maybe 70 inches attached to a chromecast that I never figured out how to connect to. Location is in Piscadera beach which is about 7 10 minutes from Otraband and the Renaissance 15 minutes from old Wilemstad due to the bridge and 20 30 minutes from the nice beaches further up the coast. Definitely get a car as taxis are ridiculously expensive in Curacao and the rest of the Caribbeans. Free parking in the lot. Only tried the lunch buffet at the restaurant once which was limited but had nice servings of picanha. Salty Iguana is the beach bar and grill which has standard Western beach shack food. there is a couple of excellent local seafood options near the hotel. One is right up the street in Piscadera called De Viserij that is famous for their tuna served either sashimi or seared as well as other fish and shrimp in a fish market style setting on the water. The other is Kas de Piskado in Purunchi about 5 minutes drive behind the water desalination plant. there is a few restaurants shacks on the water but Kas de Piskado is the most famous one that both locals and tourists go to. Definitely try the lionfish or they have a few other selections as well. All are pan fried. Both of these places have standard Western prices for seafood but remains rather inexpensive for Curacao prices. The minor issues were the service was rather impersonal and perfunctory and the mosquito situation in the check in area is horrendous. Also asked for cutlery which never came and housekeeping that has somewhat random hours so you may miss it resulting in calling for housekeeping that will never come.

Fortunately the drive to town is not bad as long as you do not mind leaving the property for meals and sightseeing. During our stay a large group of people were celebrating a birthday at the pool at night. They were yelling and making a lot of noise. After we made several complaints to the staff the party was disbursed around 2 am and we finally were able to get to sleep. When we booked our room there was a special to get one night free. When we went to checkout there was no record of this fact in their computers. Fortunately my husband had a screen shot of our reservation to show the desk clerk so they honored the special.

I have to say in spite of a lot of the negative reviews I read before I booked this hotel for a vacation I thought the resort was pretty good coming off a renovation. The room we had partial ocean view was fantastic modern and clean. The staff was overall very accommodating and friendly going out of their way to make our stay comfortable. The pools were very comfortable and they added enough chairs for all the guests to lounge around in. The beach was lovely and the ocean water was refreshing. The location was a short drive from the airport and made getting into vacation mode after a long flight easy. With these positives in mind there were some issues. On our first full day there the water and electricity shut off. It did not come back on for almost nine hours which meant we could not shower or charge our phones at all during this entire time. We were not given any credit on our bill due to the inconvenience nor given any sort of perk as an apology. They did bring around water to the guests but that is a small gesture not quite enough to my liking. There was some construction still going on in the garden area and the lobby even though this hotel has been officially open for four months now. The food at the various restaurants was subpar so we mostly ate out or went to the nearby supermarket to get better tasting groceries and snacks. Service could also be slow at times from the servers at the restaurants and pool to the cleaning staff when it came to making your room at a decent time. Overall I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend others come as well.

The pool is beautiful along with the view of the ocean. The ocean is a little rocky so wear your beach shoes. All rooms seem to have an ocean view. The restaurants were top notch but they could use a few others added to help with variety. There are not many places to walk to but most people rented cars. Taxis are a little on the pricey side.
