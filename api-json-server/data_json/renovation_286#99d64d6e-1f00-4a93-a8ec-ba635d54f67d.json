The checking in and out process was quick and easy via Expedia. The location and layout of the hotel was nice enough. Not too bad getting in and out of traffic. Immediate access to major highway. The bar area was very nice. The room itself was ok a bit small for 2 beds and hubby and I barely fit on the bed together. But it was ok for 2 nights. My biggest disappointments were the cleanliness and upkeep of the hotel as a whole and the fact that the indoor pool was not open. The hotel SERIOUSLY needed a deep cleaning and repairs. Elevators foyers and carpet were disgusting. There were dirty glasses on the 2nd floor piano area both days I was there. NO ONE bothered to clean up the place. The ceiling tiles were sagging and threatening to fall at any given moment. This hotel is beautiful and has a lot of potential to be great. However its 4 5star potential is drastically overshadowed by it is 1star upkeep. Had I paid full price I would have been highly upset and demanded a refund. The layout was beautiful.
