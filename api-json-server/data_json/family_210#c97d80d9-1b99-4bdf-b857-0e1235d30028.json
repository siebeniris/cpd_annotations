We spent a 3 day family weekend in Stockholm end of November 2015. Hotel has great location close to airport train restaurants and shopping and Gamla Stan. Lot of attractions within walking distance. We had booked a suite which itself was very nice. Cool design great mattresses great selection of pillows nice sitting area and a good shower. The wifi as well was good. It had one disadvantage though and it was that it faced an atrium which made me feel a bit claustrophobic. The first night they arranged a christmas party in the atrium and around 230 they started playing loud dance music. We tried to call the reception numerous times to complain but none answered the phone. In the end I called from my private cell phone and only then I got an answer. They managed to get them to play a bit lower but I find it weird of a hotel management to allow such a party in an atrium facing 40 50 of their hotel rooms. We did get a discount as compensation at checkout though upon request. They also had a great breakfast selection but again it is served in the atrium which I found freezing cold crowded and had a terrible atmosphere.
