After several months and a little more than 70 emails between myself and The Cosmopolitans wedding planners I am now told that my wedding contract was denied because my idea of a reception does not meet their standards and they want me to spend thousands of dollars on their catering. I bent over backwards to make sure I followed all of their rules and regulations so that there were no surprises on my wedding day and was even told I could use their own pizza place Secret Pizza to feed my guests in two Wraparound Suites that we would be paying for but come to find out their own pizza place is too tacky for their weddings.

Stayed at this hotel to celebrate my 50th Birthday and had 3 rooms booked ours with a balcony but slightly disappointed that on arrival that there was no mention of my Birthday what so ever. I must confess the arrival was not as expected the receptionist were not particularly friendly but almost cold and was very business like. On arrival into the room which was nice we noticed that there were a few light fittings that were not working there was a plug in one of the bathroom sinks not working the bedside light did not switch off we noticed all this while we waited for around 25 minutes for our luggage to arrive \u2026 Once we told maintenance about the faults they were rectified but in my mind for a 5 hotel they should not have been there in the first instance. The balcony in the room was amazing due to the view but nothing else I would not say that the cleanliness was 5. the doors could have been cleaned to say the least. Being as we are non smokers we were amazed that one evening on returning to our room on our balcony was an empty cigarette packet which stayed on our balcony for the remainder of our holiday was not thrown away by the cleaner which makes me think they did not even go on the balcony. To this day we do not know how it got there especially as we were on level 45 of the hotelHotel itself was nice although rather expensive but we did read this before we went the best place to eat was at Henrys which we went to for breakfasts the food was good the service was excellent every day. Although the hotel had three pools there was only 1 pool open which was disappointing especially as it was the beginning of their spring break so you can imagine the one pool was over crowded by far \u2026 and not exactly relaxing \u2026 We did visit the Rose Rabbit. Lie bar a few times which was excellent for entertainment value with the live music.

Well on checkout their TV checkout was not working and the lines to checkout was huge so I was told not to worry about it they would send me the bill.

If you are staying Friday or Saturday make sure you have a high floor or the nightclubs will keep you awake.

Housekeeping was as expected. Its sister property Aria is superior. I attended the casino bar with a guest and ordered two house Tom Collins. The fact the bartender was stingy with the pour and sloppy with the prep made the 30 bill prior to tip all the worse. For any non event related dining or drinking we simply left the hotel and went over to Planet Hollywood. The Ocean Bar provided call brands of liquor drinks and Martinis 3 for 10.

Overall I enjoyed my two stays at The Cosmopolitan. On both stays I was attending a conference at the hotels conference center on the third and fourth floors. In typical Las Vegas fashion you can not go many places without being corralled through the casino and shops. More on that later. Last year I stayed in the East Tower and had a wonderful view of the Belagio fountain and main part of the Strip. My king room was huge with a sitting area that could accommodate several people and it had a large balcony to enjoy the view. You could bath a family in the shower. It was a bit of a jaunt to the conference areas though but I found a shortcut through the pool area. This year I stayed in the West Tower and discovered that the elevators opened directly in the conference area on the third and fourth floors. I think this convenience for conference attendees may trump the view from the East Tower. The biggest thing I hate about this part of Vegas is that you can not go anywhere on foot without pressing through the overcrowded fly over walkways. I guess this is part of the experience.

Background first. I am a road warrior and a Mariot Platinum Elite. At this hotel because I was speaking at a conference at the hotel and the client put me here. This was a business trip not a vacation. The Cosmopolitan is spectacular Vegas glamour. Over the top. Huge. Must be 30 places to eat. They have more employees I am sure then the whole state of Montana. This place is massive. So the bad news first. If you are a Mariot Rewards person realize that most of the perks are not given at the AC hotels. No executive floor no free breakfast. I did get a room upgrade to a Terrace Suite and the 3 pm late checkout. Lots of walking lots to get from point A to point B not unlike other Vegas large hotels so if you have disabilities consider that. Just getting from the registration desk to my room was a cardio experience as I was in the east tower. While the room was over the top glam and glitz it was more form than function. The bathroom was like a bat cave think SpringHil suites with the backlit mirrors and if you are over 50 and like to see your face when you shave or put on makeup not so good. My suite has a sectional sofa two side chairs a desk chair and there was not enough light anywhere to read a paper. The bed has a wall lamp on either side which was the only light bright enough to read. Even the desk light pretty much sucked. And. if you are a coffee drinker no coffee in the room. OMG. Since I tried to stay on East Coast time at 5 am I am getting dressed to go downstairs to find coffee. coffee addict love my coffee first thing in the AM. no coffee in the room makes me crazy. So again if you are on a vacation no big deal. If you are on business the room is way more form than function but is glamourous. On the positive front. Staff could not have been more friendly. All interactions with staff get an A plus. Had two breakfasts in Henrys 24 restaurant in the east tower and the omelets might be the best I have ever had. If you are a breakfast eater this is the best. There are two gyms. Both very impressive. If you like to workout you will be happy. Since it was 50 for a high. i did not check out the two pools i did not leave the hotel which appears to be very centrally located on the Strip.

I usually always stay at one of the properties in CityCenter whenever I have to travel to Vegas for work a lot. This was actually my first time staying at The Cosmo so I was very excited but my experience was less than stellar. Here is my story When I checked in I did ask for a higher floor and they offered to upgrade my standard two queen bed room to king bed terrace room for a fee. I agreed thinking having the terrace would be a nice treat for myself. When I got to my room I excitedly went to check out view. As I opened the door to step out on to the terrace unexpectedly a swarm of 15 20 huge moths sprung up from underneath the furniture the walls and corners of the terrace. When I say huge I mean they were gigantic. I am not talking about the innocent little white moths that fly towards lights at nighttime. These suckers were at least an inch long or bigger. They were so large they had visible patterns on their wings like some ugly mutant butterflies that migrated over from Chernobyl. I did not even know moths flew that high 52 stories up nor did I know they spent time outside during the day. If anyone else happened to be outside during my moment of attack they definitely heard me scream. I immediately ran back in my room to safety. As I slid the sliding door closed I was greeted with a gust of wind and showered with dry dead moth parts sprinkling over my head and on to the floor. These dead moths must have been lodged above in the track of the door and left to rain down on the next unsuspecting victim of the room me. I was mortified. I absolutely knew this was not going to work and there is no way I was going to be able to enjoy the balcony I paid for. I immediately called housekeeping to clean up the limbs and wing bits on the carpet from the dead moth storm and then proceeded to call guest services. I told them I did not want the upgrade anymore and to just give me a room with a window and queen beds like I originally booked. They were incredibly hesitant in doing so saying they were sold out of those rooms and that they would give me another king terrace room with less of a moth problem. Trusting this I moved to another room a few floors below. I went to that terrace and all I had to do was bang on the glass and surprise. More moths sprung up from all directions this time I kept my door closed. I felt like I did not want to be that person and complain yet again especially when they apparently had no standard rooms available so I bit my tongue and stayed in that room. Big mistake. Fast forward to 3 am I am fast asleep since I have to be up early for a work meeting. I am suddenly woken up to a moth apparently stuck in my drapes fluttering about trying to get out. Not sure how it even got in my room. It was very unsettling and creepy and there was nothing I could do but hope I did n\u2019t choke on a moth flying in my mouth as I slept. The next day I go to the front desk. I explain all of the above and how I just want a normal room with no moths. The front desk employee admitted that I was not the only one to complain about them apparently it \u2019s moth season. and the only thing they could offer was moving me to another room again finally a standard room this time and not charging me for the upgrade fee that day only. that is not exactly fair and I was not happy stuck paying for an upgrade I did not even get to use that I was misled into buying in the first place especially when I reported the moth issue immediately. Anyway I moved rooms yet AGAIN and while the standard room was finally moth free I feel as though they brushed off the moth issue and gave me an attitude for moving rooms. At no point did I give the staff any attitude maybe that \u2019s why they did n\u2019t care. But really how can you blame me for not wanting to deal with creepy large nuisance moths.

My aunt took a serious fall in the front of the ride sharing pickup area due to multiple wet patches caused by a mist machine overhead she has an extremely sore tailbone. A similar event happened earlier in the day where both my grandmother and my aunt almost slipped and fell as well. After falling a hotel staff nearby simply looked at her without offering help and called for security. The only people who helped her at the moment were a few fellow guests nearby. After she came back up she was the one who had to call hotel management for help rather than hotel staff providing any assistance or concern themselves. After security personnel came up to the room to ask for a statement we were told to call up the hotel staff if we needed any further help. I called up the front desk to ask for a heating pad only to be transferred on the phone four times. When talking to security the staff were extremely callous claiming that they could not provide a heating pack despite there being both a Walgrens and CVS just 5 minutes away. Finally when guest services called us later they made the bizarre suggestion to put a wet towel on my aunts back throughout the night. We were completely baffled at the absolute indifference of the hotel staff. Finally upon being told that staff was going to pick up a heating pad from the Walgrens nearby the guest services staff Kendall had the audacity to mention that they would provide it at no extra cost to you as if they were doing us a big service. We were all completely disgusted at the despicable attitude of the entire hotel staff from the lack of concern to the lack of help provided.", "offset": [240, 354], "date": "2019-07-31", "cpt": "3", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 30, "uid": "3bd63e80-a9e6-4571-8647-3d9c1b5bad33", "sentence": "There was a weird vibe through the hotel.

This place is pretty nice but after the power went out in the Chelsea tower and we had to walk down 20 flights of stairs we got to see parts of the Cosmopolitan that should not be seen by guests. There was trash all over the stairs and no communication to guests. I did not run into a single employee until I got to the conference rooms. Even there a group of hotel employees were literally standing square in the middle of the hallway where a few hundred very late conference attendees were trying to get to conference rooms. They just stood blocking the walking area completely oblivious we were all running very late due to the power outage. Thankfully I had gotten up early enough to be showered and dressed but others were not so fortunate.
