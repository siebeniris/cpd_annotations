Across the street from the hockey arena on the canal with a great walkway exercise path across the street from the trolley stop with several great restaurants close by. The aquarium is within walking distance and Ybor City is just a trolley ride away. The staff were professional helpful and friendly. The hotel has nice finishes everything was clean and in good working order. The lobby is stunning with a very high ceiling but the way they have it decorated with huge palm trees and tables with chairs sitting areas it is very cozy not stark. Shower had good water pressure and the A C worked flawlessly. Rooms were very soundproof. The conference facilities were very good with several small boardrooms in addition to large meeting rooms. The hotel is just across the street from the Tampa Convention Center. You can also cross the street by going under the street on the canal walking path. There is a business center that is open 24 hours a day with shipping services. I would definitely choose this hotel if I was staying in the Tampa area on holiday.", "offset": [876, 958], "date": "2015-05-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e1fbc5df-ae7a-443d-8e9c-ec2020833492", "sentence": "We stayed at the Tampa Mariot for a conference in July. The positives are proximity to the conference center the view and the pool area which is lovely and comfortable. But as for the rest I was highly unimpressed. I have stayed in conference hotels all over this country and have traveled in the US and abroad for pleasure so I have a wide range of hotels to compare this one to. First of all people at the front desk were often curt and unfriendly. Second the rooms are very small and the beds uncomfortable. There is no microwave and the mini fridge was hidden behind a false set of drawers on the right side of the dresser so we did n\u2019t even discover it for two days. Coffee maker is provided but only two cups were ever left and two coffees. If we wanted a cup later when we came back to our room we had to hunt someone down to ask for it. Creamer was powdered. Even lower cost hotels generally use real creamers these days. It all seemed so chintzy for a hotel that is supposed to offer some level of luxury. Third in the lobby there were two nice containers of cold water infused with fruit every morning. But when we came in from evening events at about 90 pm it was HOT and we were thirsty. the water was already taken down. I guess that is to encourage you to buy the 40 bottles of Fiji water in the room. The Starbucks in the hotel is far more expensive than the one directly across the street at the Embassy Suites 275 for a cup of coffee vs 195. so we took the one minute walk. The service in the restaurant is S L O W And when we asked about our food rather than apologizing the waitress told us we should expect to wait because we were a large party. We were but we were also the only people in the restaurant. Food was good but we were late to our event. Never once were our glasses refilled. Fourth this is a huge more than 25 story hotel across the street from the conference center and there were far too few elevators. Every morning was a long wait to get downstairs and there was no continuous stairway to provide an alternative. Fifth the parking. There is mandatory valet parking. The cost is exorbitant. But the worst is that when this huge group of people is ready to depart as the conference ends there is pandemonium because the little driveway is where everyone must claim their car and load up. There seems to be room for 12 to 15 cars at most at one time all crowded into a small area filled with people luggage carts strollers etc. It took us more than 30 minutes to get our car and get it loaded. And finally when I checked my credit card it appeared we were overcharged. When I called I was told that a charge of 500 per night was applied in case of any incidentals. That extra money would be refunded in a week. A week. Why. Most conference hotels seem to bend over backwards to be helpful and accommodating. That was not our experience at the Mariot.", "offset": [451, 510], "date": "2015-07-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "3eefe23d-d8b7-4540-9211-bb061616c5b1", "sentence": "Great property as long as your not in a hurry to go anywhere. I really like this property a whole lot. It very nice and my experience from check in forward was pretty fantastic. I unfortunately I have a couple of issues here though that keep from rating it a 5 star property. let us talk positive first though. The location is awesome. You are on the river walk and it is spectacular. The rooms are very comfortable and the amenities are nice too. They are fairly quiet but you can hear your neighbors at times. The shades keep the room dark and the environment seems good. Now on to the bad. 1. I have never seen elevators this slow in a property this busy. This really needs to be addressed. 2. My room was not serviced two our of four days. 3. service in the Great Room bar was pathetic. So I would recommend dining and drinking elsewhere. Give yourself ample time to allow 20 extra minutes for the elevators. The pool and fitness center are fantastic and when the concierge club is open it is very good too. Front desk staff was very helpful and so were the concierge staff. This property has spectacular views too. Beds are very comfortable and the toiletries are very nice too. Wi fi is available for a fee and does not seem to work very well in the lobby areas.

We got downtown view when we requested waterside view online and we secured it by credit card. When we complained at the front desk they said they only have handicap room or room right next to elevator on waterside. Obviously they overboked and tested us with downtown view first. When we checked out the bill included telecom charge and daily parking charges which we did not use. there is only a few places to eat history museum aquarium. Boat tour street car rides to Ybor district. We have done it all in two days. I heard city of Tampa is trying hard to attract people.

This was my second stay at this Mariot. Although the property is very nice and right on the River Walk the pool was closed. Not closed for a few days closed till the end of April. We were there with a convention and probably this was not disclosed or planned at the time the convention was planned and booked there. I was travelling with my husband who was the one that was attending the convention so I had to find other things to do while he was in his meetings. The Embassy Suites allowed guests to use their pol very tiny with limited seating and no place to get something to drink unles you went downstairs to the lobby bar. The only plus about their pool was that it was heated. Very disappointed but the Mariots pool area was very nice in the past and I am sure with the overhaul it will be even nicer. it is just tough to be in 80 degree weather with no where to get cooled off. Also no bathrobes in the room I am always cold and my husband is always hot so I look forward to having a bathrobe to wrap up in.

Stayed here for a conference and was treated well from the minute I pulled up to the valet to the moment I drove away. Carlos checked me in and after extending a warm welcome he upgraded me to a concierge level room with a view of the marina a balcony and a king size bed. The room decor was modern and elegant yet comfortable. Terrific mattress comfortable pillows a Keurig machine in the room and love the spacious shower with the high end toiletries. The smart TV with the option to log into my Netflix or Hulu accounts was a welcome option. The concierge lounge was a wonderful perk a self serve coffee machine that dispenses cappuccinos and lattes was my favorite. One end of the loung is set up like a living room while the other end has a long counter where you can sit with a large group of friends. Beautiful views of the water especially at night. The concierge lounge has a complimentary breakfast buffet with fresh fruit cereal bagels or stop by for appetizers in the late afternoon early evening and desserts at night scrumptious chocolate cake with strawberries and whipped cream. The hotel is spotless the staff go out of their way to make sure you are happy with the service the bar staff are attentive but not pushy. The conference rooms were a comfortable temperature and we got complimentary water taxi tickets for the day. The location is perfect around the corner and over a short bridge are at least 3 restaurant choices and an ice cream shop on the water. Also within walking distance to the Amalie Arena this will be my go to place when staying over in future.
