Stayed two nights and attended the conference for two days including giving a presentation on the second day. I was totally unimpressed. The room was on the preferred floor yet so small that my knees hit the door when sitting on the toilet. When I took a shower I got blasted by cold water I assume when someone next door flushed. And the toilet took two flushes to just move paper away. The airplane noise was loud starting around 7 am. As for the conference facilities. The acoustics and lighting in the rooms was awful. At one point I was in the middle third of the ball room with the dividers closed and the mic in my room was not audible in that room but was in the ones on either side. And there did not seem to be tech support to help. The internet was down for all but the first three hours of the conference. This could be forgiven because stuff happens but the hotel staff seemed to consistently lie about what was going on with it. I was told three times that the internet was back up when it simply was not. And finally I presented in the first session of the second day of the conference. No one had cleaned the room for the presentation over night. So when I came in there were papers and glasses everywhere. I had to spend 10 min tidying the room before setting up my presentation. This is highly unprofessional. I did take the shuttle to the airport to take the MAX into town. That service was appreciated. I also used the the fitness facilities which were adequate for a hotel. They had 2 treadmills three elipticals a couple of bikes. And then a room with free weights and mats. They also had two fitness balls one horribly under inflated which I fell off of because it was under inflated. The staff was very friendly at check in. At check out they did not bother to ask if everything had been ok or I would have reported things like the shower at that time. I had give this hotel a pass.", "offset": [1522, 1593], "date": "2015-02-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f89961a3-70e5-40e3-af63-bc60cba7846b", "sentence": "Very Good Experience. The Sheraton Portland was a very good experience. This is a true 35 star hotel. My room was clean and serviceable.

My room was on the runway side and after the first couple of take offs I tuned this out and did n\u2019t affect my stay at all. The restaurant was good and convenient maybe a little pricey. Nice gym with multiple machines and free weight dumbbells. I would stay here again. The shuttle only goes to the airport and you can catch the MAX line there if needed.

Stayed here many times for business travel. Hotel is a good mid range business hotel right next to PDX airport. Super convenient for those really early flights. Hotel is an older property 1975. and some of the amenities and fixtures could use some updating. Fitness room recently updated and is nice. Probably would not recommend for vacation stay because of the distance to downtown and other attractions just my preference. However if money is an issue the prices are usually cheaper than downtown and the light rail stop is only a short shuttle ride away. Service has always been good and friendly. Never had a problem with room or linen cleanliness. Shuttle service is convenient running every 30min.

We stayed here for 1 night due to an early departure. Hotel is kind of dark downstairs large lobby with little day light. Staff friendly especially in restaurant super local and simply friendly. They have an indoor pool. they are renovating rooms and hallways which is super super necessary. Very little airport noise. We were on the SPG floor 2 connecting rooms we had renovated rooms but it took me a while to figure that out. I had to check TA to check the old pics. Why still an old style popcorn ceiling. All outlet covers and light switch covers are old yellowish instead of a fresh new one. The doors have not been replaced and most obviously the toilet bowl and bath tub were not replaced. They were clean but were clearly not new or nice and crispy white the toilet bowl had lots of staining and it is literally beyond me why you would not replace this as it completely threw me off thinking this was still an old room. The hall way had not been done yet and it clearly showed so obviously still lots of work to be done and since they are still busy I give them the benefit of the doubt but I doubt the tub and the pop corn ceiling will go. Please please replace the toilet bowl with the orange yellow grey water stains marks and those yellow grey outlet covers like they came from grandmas house from the 60s.

I have been working at the front desk of a luxury collection hotel for 21 years now so can be critical of the service industry. My first visit to the Sheraton PDX was four months ago in June. Since this is an airport hotel I did not have high expectations beforehand but was pleasantly surprised by the facilities and particularly the staff. I wish I remembered everyones names but I can not forget two remarkable employees. My first encounter was at check in and was assisted by MARY who has worked at this location for MANY years. She was amazingly friendly and helpful I wish I could have taken her back to San Francisco to work with me. My second encounter was with SARAH who was our server for breakfast. She spent time talking with us and was very genuine and sweet. It felt like we were in her own home and not just a lobby restaurant. We were very pleased with the facilities like the pool hot tub and a clean and comfortable room. Our second visit in October four months later I was amazed at the renovation that had taken place. It was like a brand new hotel. Every part of the hotel that we encountered was so much nicer and it was nice before the renovation. Even with the renovation the best part of our second stay was that the same employees were working and just as helpful friendly. MARY at the front desk remembered me and made me feel genuinely special. I look forward to staying at the Sheraton PDX EVERY time I come to Portland.

I have stayed at this hotel many times and it was a great hotel. It was recently renovated and it seems like they want to get the over 6 million dollars they spent on the backs of guests.

I asked why since I was there first and he said their airline has a contract with the hotel. This person made me feel insignificant and did not appreciate my business. When he saw my displeasure he checked me in first. I have never been insulted more at any hotel and stay at spg properties over 100 nights per year. As for the renovations you need a chair in the hotel room. This is a airport hotel and you can not work on your laptop from a Cleopatra couch. Looks nice but not practical.

Glassware was right at hand not misplaced out by the coffee service. Plenty of towels lotions potions and makeup remover. The closet was right by the entrance yet its doors were designed so they do not get in the way of entering or exiting. Windows could open yet were cabled to go only 4.
