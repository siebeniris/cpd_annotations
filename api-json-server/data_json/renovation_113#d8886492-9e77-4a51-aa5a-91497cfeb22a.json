Very weird when we checked in. We did not know that the hotel was in the midst of being remodeled. The lobby for check in was very small and there was no check in desk just a small little table used for check in. I understand now that they were remodeling but they could have put up some kind of sign saying Check in. We stood in the entry of the hotel for several minutes before we finally asked someone where check in was. A really nice girl said that this table was it. Okay that is fine. I requested a room with a view and she found us a view room but it was not ready. That was okay too. We decided to take a walk down Sunset to get something to eat. She called us about 30 minutes later and said our room was ready. We came back to the hotel and only one elevator was working. We had to wait awhile for the elevator since there was only one working. Okay that is fine too. We finally got to our room and the hotel clerk was right the view was amazing. We could see the LA city lights. The room was in my opinion only 3 stars. It was in major need of remodeling. There was no door on the closet only a curtain and there was no place to put your clothes no dresser. There were somewhat makeshift particle board shelves that were used to put the hotels snacks that you could purchase on. I usually like to put my clothes away in a drawer instead of keeping them in a suitcase but oh well. There was a giant mirror on the wall that contained the television. I really did not like that. It was too distracting if you were trying to watch tv. But I guess it must have been modern decorating. The bathroom was nice. I liked the rain shower head. They had bottled water on the counter for purchase. 25 bottle. Are they kidding. The bed was too hard and uncomfortable to sleep so I took a Tylenol PM. The room was in desperate need of fresh paint on the walls. The baseboards looked like they had been chewed by mice. I expected a lot more from a 4 12 star hotel. Rooms were like a cheap motel. The bar by the pool is very nice with very pleasant bartenders. We tried to go to the Sky Bar but we were turned away because there was a dress code. I understand that but the guy that turned us away could have been a little nicer about it. Overall I would give this hotel a 2 12 to 3 stars.

Front desk staff were excellent likable people. They spoke in normal not affected tones unlike other upscale hotel staff. Every other staff member from housekeeping to valet to wait staff were all excellent as far as efficient and friendly. Very nice folks that deserved and received top level tipping. I never felt compelled to tip they never appeared to expect one so they got the best of what I could give. The room was spacious the view was great. I am a fan of down pillows and the ones provided suited me fine. Linens were a bit haggard. The feather down comforters though good sized were a bit thread worn and need updating. Bed was comfortable and the large sofa easily accommodated my 6 3 self. On the negative side of things our coffee maker did not work and the replacement quickly provided was also a bit finicy. The desk phone also did not work. Valet parking was very expensive. The worst hotel room feature was by far the bathroom. The hotels attempt at modernism failed miserably in the bathroom design. The bathroom has a glass wall covered by a sheer curtain. The design surely looked good on paper but failed the test of practicality. When you are actually using the toilet you are clearly visible from almost any where in the room by whomever else is in the room. Romantic couples may fine no problem here but for those of us with kids or traveling on business with an office mate a buddy or a new significant other this layout sucks.
