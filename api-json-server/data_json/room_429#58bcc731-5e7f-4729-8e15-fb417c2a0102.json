Recently due to the merged SPG Mariot Rewards Program this hotel has become readily available for booking. Once we have done our research we were SOLDThe hotel is convenient located in an area where great shopping and dining is an abundance. it is minutes away from the US and Great Britain Embassies and this hotel has a distinction of being built on a former royal grounds. With that said the service here is impeccable. As a Mariot Rewards Platinum Premier Elite we enjoyed a VIP check in experience in the lounge on the 26th floor. Our benefits includes the Royal Lounge access and breakfast in the lounge or at the wonderful Rain Tree Cafe that offers a wide variety of cuisine options for breakfast 4 pm check out and upgraded room. The hotel has a nice work out facility and a roof top pool and garden that offers tranquility away from the city hustle and bustle. What left me with such a warm impression is the staff. Each one will find ways to go above and beyond to make my stay memorable. In particular Ms Marisa who greets me and other guests warmly every morning in the lobby and the breakfast area. She remembers the little but important things that makes anyone feel special. it is the true definition of hospitality that Ms Marisa and her staff strive for to make their guests feel hospitable and comfortable. During my stay I left a very important item that was made by my mother in my room. Frantically my partner reached out to the hotel and in minutes we had a confirmation that it will be held for us for pick up when we come through BK again. Another example I made a comment about the pleasant scent in the corridors. As soon as I returned from an evening out there was an essential oil burner placed in my room with that amazing scent. Without informing them that my birthday was the day after my departure I was surprised with a nice cake and message. it is the important moments like these that makes a constant traveler like me feel like this place is my home even when am away from my family.

Thank you Kraisorn and everyone else. It supposes to be a luxury hotel but the hotel really do not care about the details. If Athene wants to be 5star and be qualify as a luxury brand the management has a long way to go. I want to emphasize that I \u2019m reviewing a LUXURY 5star hotel instead of a business hotel. We were there to celebrate my mom \u2019s birthday. They did email me and ask me if we want a complimentary blueberry cheesecake or Chocolate vanilla cake for her. Someone ca n\u2019t have chocolate in our group so I replied to the hotel with the choice of blueberry cheesecake. Guess what we received. A Chocolate Vanilla cake. I appreciate the offer from the hotel. However a 5star hotel should handle this more carefully. If you are doing this to make your guests feel welcomed maybe you want to make sure you do n\u2019t mess it up. Upon Check in I realized I upgraded to the Royal Club room with Club Access in my ap two months before my arrival date see photo below. When I arrived I was told the upgrade does not get me club access. I show them the reservation page on my Mariot Ap and I clearly stated \u201c ROYAL CLUB ROOM with Club Lounge Access \u201d. The front desk went to the back office with my phone and came back denying it. The manager on duty bargain with me back and forth about it. From one day access to three day access until front desk manager came out after 30mins and told me she \u2019s going to honor it. It \u2019s seriously annoying and what a joke for a 5star hotel. Guest rom1. The countertop of the bathroom is always messy and dirty after they clean up the room. Most of the luxury hotel MO Four seasons Fairmont \u2026. etc will clean up your countertop and organize whatever you have on it and put them on a clean towel or so \u2026 2. Carpet is extremely dirty in the guest room. My son spent 10 mins walking on it barefoot after the shower his feet were dirty. I am very surprised to see this happened at a luxury hotel. 3. They do n\u2019t offer any amenity for kids besides crib. This is very odd for a luxury hotel. At least carry kids toothbrush and slipper since your carpet is super dirty or make the hotel a business hotel instead of a luxury hotel. I suggest the management to check with other luxury brands to make sure you are updated with this. 4. The AC was broken. The temperature stays at 21 degrees the whole night and we had to call them to come and fix it. The swimming pool is very dirty too. However Sunday brunch at Rain Tree Cafe is highly recommended. They offer a wide variety of half shell oyster grilled lobster sashimi and A La Carte menu included in the buffet.

The Athene Hotel is the worst overall experience I have ever had a Mariot property. It is a misnomer for Mariot to have this property be part of its luxury collection. I an ambassador elite member lifetime titanium member and have stayed over 80 nights at Mariot properties. The positives of the property is that is has a beautiful interior the staff I encountered are friendly the breakfast buffet is pretty good the concierge and bellman were helpful. The negatives are on the other hand are extensive. Some of the items by themselves are not a big deal but collectively really highlights the terrible service this property has for its customers. To begin I had requested to use 4 of my Suite upgrades at the property. I received an email a couple days before arriving stating the Suite upgrade I wanted was confirmed. Just an hour later I received a follow up email stating the first email was in fact a mistake and I did not get the upgrade it stated. The front desk manager at least handled it well for a resolution but this careless mistake was definitely a bad omen for things to come. I checked in around noon last Friday and the property did not even offer me my platinum gift on arrival as every member should be offered. This is a basic item which has been offered to me every other stay but this one in my life. Afterwards though I went straight to my room and ordered room service. I only ordered 4 basic items pizza pasta dessert and a watermelon juice. I repeated the order twice one the call and the in dining attendant reaffirmed 2 more times on the same call 4 total times. This seemed plenty sufficient for only a four item order. She stated the order would be there within 30 minutes. I wanted to shut my eyes and relax for this time since I have been traveling for 22 hours. Low and behold though 5 minutes later I get a call back requesting I confirm the order yet again which makes no sense as it should not be difficult to take a simple order. The order ended up taking close to an hour which was much longer than the time frame that they stated. Additionally the fresh watermelon juice they stated they had was not fresh at all as within a short period time it looked liked the attached picture. Again not being able to deliver a good room service experience is n\u2019t a huge deal by itself but should be very easy for a supposed luxury property. My girlfriend and I were very tired from jet lag went to bed early woke up at 5 am on Saturday and just wanted to take hot showers before heading to breakfast. Unbeknownst to me the hot water in the entire room was not working at all. The shower bath or sinks had no hot water which was unbelievable. Never before have I ever stayed at a hotel which I could not get hot water. Upset and confused we went done for breakfast feeling terrible. I told the manager on duty what happened and he said the hot water went out at 11 pm the night before on several floors. One does n\u2019t expect a high end property to have hot water issues especially if there was proper maintenance of the property. Regardless the hotel had 6 hours to properly communicate to the affected guests of the situation to manage it. They could have easily left an automated message on the phone room or left a note underneath the door instructing the guests as to what happened what they were doing to address it ETA to fix it and temporary solutions to assist guests. Shockingly none of this was done. I asked the manager why they did n\u2019t do this as this is an obvious and easy thing to do he looked at me like a light bulb just went off and said they did n\u2019t think of doing that. I wish I was making this up but you can not make this stuff up as it is so ridiculous. The manager then offered us temporary access to another room so we could at least take a bath andor shower. When we got to the room my girlfriend wanted to take a bath. I filled up the tub and returned five minutes later. Right as my girlfriend was about to get in the tub she shrieked out in disgust as the bathtub had numerous hairs in it many of which looked like pubic hairs. I attached pictures of it as part of this review. Needless to say she did n\u2019t get in the bathtub as it was disgusting. At this point though being at the property for almost 24 hours and needing to to clean up we dared not look at the cleanliness of the shower too as we were desperate. It would have been even more ridiculous to have to move to a third room just to take a shower at a luxurious hotel. A hotel not being able to first of all provide hot water to their guests and then not even be able to provide a clean room is completely unacceptable. Also the elevators do not work correctly at the hotel. You need to scan your hotel key to register the floor you are going to. This is basic enough and actually a good thing for security purposes. However their key scanners did not work properly. It would take sometimes up to 20 times and over a minute of time for the scanner to work. By the time it would work many times we would be redirected to other floors have to get off the elevator get back on and try it again so the scanner would actually register our floor. When you have to go to another floor to take a hot shower and then it is almost impossible to get that floor because the elevators are not working properly it becomes even a more frustrating experience. I have never been to a hotel before where the elevators did n\u2019t function properly. At this point we just wanted to be able to relax as we were on vacation. We had a 90 minute couples massage at the hotel on Saturday. We thought surely a good massage or for that matter even a decent massage would make us feel better. Although we were a little bit concerned believing that the massage experience would actually go smoothly as nothing else has at this point we decided it is really hard to screw up a massage experience. All that has to happen is put on some nice music and get at least a decent massage. Unfortunately even the Athene hotel could ruin a good massage experience. First of all the massage room was just another guest bedroom where they removed the beds which is shocking for a supposed luxury hotel. They used this curvy modern couch as the place where you sit down to put your feet in water which was not relaxing to sit on at all. This by itself is not the end of the world but not what you would expect from a luxurious hotel. The last straw though is what happens next. We both lay face down on the massages beds with our heads in the opening next to each other ready for the massage. The very nice massage therapists turn on the music and then start the massage. Incredibly the CD they used for the calming music starts skipping. skipping badly and nonstop. I did not want to stop the massages this point though as we just needed to relax and unwind after everything that has happened. Stopping the massage would disrupt my girlfriends and I hope to finally relax here at the Athene. I assumed the massage therapist would know to quietly walk over to the machine to fix it. However she did n\u2019t for 30 minutes. At this point it was impossible to relax as if all you hear is a skipping sound that is very disruptive it does n\u2019t matter how good the massage is and your mind can not relax. In fact I got a headache is was so uncomfortable. Finally after 30 minutes the massage therapists leaves the room and comes back and starts playing music from her personal cell phone which was a solution but made you feel like you were at a low end massage place on the streets of Bangkok. This is frankly what she should have done to start with as a gap stop solution as then we could have had a relatively relaxing time. My massage therapist did a pretty good job at the massage but my girlfriend said her massage was terrible as the masseuse did not even focus on what she requested during the consultation. My girlfriend and I have had over 30 couples massages together and this was the first time ever she was unhappy with the treatment. At this point after having issues before I got to the hotel the hotel missing a basic step at checkin having a bad room service experience not having hot water in the room being provided a dirty second room for a shower and then having a terrible massage experience all within the first night of my stay I wrote the general manager Ms Cho Leng Goh an email on Saturday describing my experiences in the hopes she would fix the issues so the rest of the stay would be enjoyable. It is now Tuesday afternoon over three days later I am checked out of the hotel and Ms Goh has not acknowledged receipt or responded to or fixed any of the issues I outlined above. For a general manager of a Mariot hotel to not even have enough regard for even the most loyal guests to respond to their outreach is disgraceful. In some ways it is not surprising as it is indicative of the overall experience that I had at her property. If the general manager does not care at all about customer service than why would one expect to have a good experience at her hotelThe irony is that I was just in Thailand a few weeks ago and stayed at the St Regis in Bangkok and the Phulay Bay Ritz Carlton. Both stays were amazing. The general manager of the Phulay Bay Ms Garcia is the best general manager I have ever encountered. It was the most enjoyable stay I have ever had and encourage everyone to read my review of that property and try and stay there if you can. Now just a couple weeks later I have the worst stay ever and a general manager who cares so little about her guests she wo n\u2019t even respond to them. I experienced both ends of the customer service spectrum in a matter of a couple weeks. There are too many great hotels to stay at in Bangkok including the St Regis to risk having the terrible experience I had for a management team that does not even care about its guests. Please do not make the same mistake I did.", "offset": [670, 741], "date": "2019-07-30", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "f49c6b89-dcf9-4531-8fb5-a325054a93cf", "sentence": "1 night with perfect BF.
