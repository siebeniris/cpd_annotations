We got our room around 3 pm. Room very nice and comfortable. The bath had strange marks in it that look like blood at first but appeared to be permanent staining. Whilst there we used both restaurant bar areas during the evening and they were both very nice with good food and friendly service. The breakfast was great with really good food and good choice. We stayed 2 nights and the first morning the service from the waiter was probably the worst I have ever had in terms of rudeness. The waiter we had on the second day was far better. We used the spa area and massage service. Massage was very good although the spa area looked like it could do with some upgrading. It looked a bit tired and as if it would have been fantastic 10 years ago. Also a bit strange that all the spa areas are completely separate for men and women. If you are away with your other half and you want to relax in the spa area then you can not do this together. Golf course was great. Breakfast was included on expedia rate but they had charged on bill. This was resolved at the front desk. Golf breakfast food bar areas.

We were on the 7th floor and had a small balcony overlooking the hills. It was serene and beautiful. Upon arrival they delivered a full bottle of red wine and chocolate covered strawberries for my birthday. We ordered appetizers 2 nights via room service and it was fast and delicious. We dined every morning in the main dining room for the breakfast buffet and it was a lot of variety and high quality. We had dinner one night in the main dining room and it was one of the best meals we have had in a long time. We ate in the wine bar one night which was excellent as well and in the small pub twice which was also great. The staff was always awesome throughout the hotel.

First the positives. This golf resort and spa is built on 400 acres of gorgeous Austin hill country. There are multiple swimming pools including an infinity pool which were filled with families.

When I checked in the girl working the front desk seemed a bit clueless. And sure enough when I got to my room a good 10 minute walk my electronic key card did n\u2019t work. I tried to call front desk but no answer so had to walk back. They fixed it but no offer for a free drink for the inconvenience. She was also rude to the doorman who seemed to have a learning disability. The coffee shop closed at 6 pm and they do n\u2019t have any sundries mostly junk food and gifts. I needed a decongestant which was not stocked. A hotel this remote should have something like the Mariot Courtyard 24 hour mini mart. My bathroom had bunch of centipedes. Not all the restaurants were open yet. The food at Crenshaw \u2019s was good especially the burger and brisket sandwich. The restaurant near the pool had small tapas type menu.

I was part of a local group of gals who came for a last minute momcamp. I \u2019l start with the positive1. It is a beautiful resort. The all around design is tranquil and very well done. The artwork which I never really notice elsewhere. around the whole place is stunning. 2. The staff are nice. Smiles polite presentable. 3. The rooms are comfortable AC works great and the beds are deliciously comfortableRom for growth Revolves around service. I \u2019l list examples1. There was no ironing board in room. There was no brochure with an overview of resort everything super brief and not detailed. There was no place to charge your phone near the bed and the outlet situation was interesting. The phones had no direction for how to call for anything pro tip dial \u201c 0 \u201d. used our noggin for this one and in a double queen room there were only 2 towels. Side note. when we called for ironing board and towels they were delivered quickly BUT the workers paused for a tip. ironing board and towels should be in the room. 2. 40 valet is unreasonably high. Perhaps if there was a no tipping policy this could work. But that \u2019s just insulting. Side note. the \u201c head \u201d bell hop y\u2019 all slenderish blondish guy was very polite and on top of it. Great customer service and respect3. We were at the pool for 4 hours. Not one server came by to take our order. The tall muscular African American man that brought waters around OFTEN was also a customer service superstar. Very polite and kind and accommodating put him at the bar 4. The bar. I walked up one time to a not very crowded bar. The bartender blonde hair muscular all American looking was in the middle of talking down to his helper guy who was working hard at making drinks for the waitresses they do have waitresses. I stood there for awhile he acknowledged me twice and said I would be next. After 10 minutes of him skipping over me I walked over to one of the waitresses and asked her if she could please bring be a frozen strawberry daiquiri and pointed to my chair which was RIGHT there and gave her my card. She was gracious and said she absolutely would. 45 minutes later honestly it was probably longer. I finally recognized her again and walked up to ask for my card back. She was apologetic. And brought be a \u201c strawberry daiquiri \u201d \u201c on the house \u201d. That was a nice gesture. Halfway finished the high caloric treat i was giving myself I noticed there was zero alcohol in the drink I \u2019m a lightweight and do n\u2019t partake very often. This was confirmed almost instantly when a group of elementary age kids walked up with the same drink I was given. I see what you did there. I \u2019m laughing at this point 5. Bobs Chop House I had heard great things and thought surely this would be delicious. It was god but it was not a Ruth Chris. My steak was meh and my salad was way over dressed. The potatoes were interesting. The carrot was the best part of the meal. Our mixed drinks were again not strong and all i wanted was a tiny buzz. 6. Stop at the coffee shop for a quick caffeine fix and easy breakfast since we did n\u2019t want to eat a large buffet. The oatmeal on the menu was not available we were told we could go down to the restaurant that was serving the buffet and just order oatmeal. When I asked if it was buffet only or if we could order off a menu the response was a little fuzzy and since all of the hotel information see above was scarce. we just skipped the food as we were headed to the spa where they have food. BUT I did order a hot chai late which was 34 foam and scalding hot. At this point I \u2019m getting a little irritated. This is an upscale resort what in the hell is going on. So I return my drink and ask for a cold chai. They politely oblige. The chai itself was delicious but the cup was filled to the brim with ice. So maybe 4 sips. Sigh the \u2018 barista \u2019 had never been properly trained. 7. Off to the spa we went because it costs you your first born if you dare cancel within a week slight exageration but accurate. y\u2019al it \u2019s stunning. The amenities are fabulous. The petite blonde girl was a darling host showed me around and thoroughly explained everything. She \u2019s a keeper. I had a few hours before my facial and planned on enjoying the pool. Also stunning and tranquil and relaxing. The waiter came around. I asked him for towels they are n\u2019t outside and a menu. He brought the menu and I confirmed the kitchen was open. He said it was. I asked again for the towel I mean and ordered my food. Y\u2019al. I ca n\u2019t make this up. an hour and 10 minutes later it still had n\u2019t come. I asked the waiter he seemed unphased. I cancelled it. That was it. 8. Time for my facial. Began with an attempt to upsel to the 300 hydrofacial which with the service I had received thus far I politely declined. Regular \u201c moisture drench \u201d facial was fine. But absolutely nothing honestly nothing special. My monthly 80 facial is preferential to this one that cost 200. As I was checking out from the spa the polite blonde girl asked how everything was. I used the opportunity tell her about the food situation or lack there of. She was genuinely apologetic which was nice. She offered me a \u201c members only \u201d gift of sample sized face serums as an apology. That was nice. In conclusion I give one star because I spent 500 for poor service. It would be so wonderful to have a nice resort so close to my house I can escape to for a break. I do n\u2019t mind spending money when I an actual experience that matches the price tag.

The hotel is beautiful the rooms were nicely redone and the pool area was very nice with the addition of the infinity pool. We loved the renovation but we were very disappointed with several other aspects of the hotel. When we arrived we were provided with chips and salsa along with three beers in our room we stayed a total of three nights and not one time did the housekeeping crew remove the used food bowls from our room. The first day our room was not cleaned at all and we had to call the front desk and ask them to come clean they did come but they just left towels on the vanity they did not clean our room. The next day I saw the cleaning crew at the room next door and asked if she was cleaning our room next she said no because we were in the room we were on our way out. I asked her to clean our room and she said once she sees we are in the room she can not come back and clean it. After a long discussion on how much I was paying for the room she did decide to clean after all. In the three nights that we stayed our trash was never emptied in our room. We had dinner reservations at Bobs Steak and Chop house and when we were getting ready I could not find a blow dryer. I called down to the front desk and they said they are only provided on a per request basis. I asked if they could bring one to the room as soon as possible since we were leaving very soon for dinner. I waited in the room over 20 minutes and they never showed up. I had to go to dinner with wet hair a blow dryer was in our room when we returned several hours later. The Omni is advertised as a 5 star hotel I would think a blow dryer would be provided in each room. My last issue was upon check out. We purchased the golf package and were told all three times we checked into the golf course that it would show up on our bill but be zeroed out. That did not happen our bill had multiple charges for golf service fees and taxes that did not get zeroed out. We also had charges for room service delivery on our bill that we did not authorize. It took us approximately 20 minutes at check out to get our bill correct.
