I travelled with my husband and two children aged 7 and 5 for a family holiday and to celebrate a milestone birthday. We stayed for 7 nights over Easter 2015 on a HB basis in an Imperial Club room. Flight We flew with Etihad to Abu Dhabi as the distance looked roughly equidistant from Dubai airport. In fact it only took an hour and for the saving on the flight fees it was worth it. The airline provided a drop off and collection limo service and it was a bit of a faf finding the Etihad Limo Desk in Abu Dhabi airport ask an Official for directions \u2013 do n\u2019t follow the signs as they take you round in circles. Pre arrival It is worth completing the pre arrival form even if you have n\u2019t booked directly with the hotel. Many of the \u2018 issues \u2019 that others on Tripadvisor have mentioned were alleviated by having the peace of mind that some details were taken care of prior to arrival. Atlantis also telephoned me a couple of days before we left the UK to check on other details and they even called a second time to confirm the model of the hairdryer in the room that really is service. I need a powerful one or else take mine. Imperial Club Deluxe Room \u2013 we were located on floor 11 of East Tower and I \u2019d requested a city view which was granted. I had also asked for a quiet room as I had read something on Tripadvisor about noise from the night club. However our room was above the aquarium and if we opened our doors all you could hear was the constant hum of the generators. Our room looked towards the Dubai City skyline over the waterpark and monorail. However because of the hazy visibility only the faint outline of Burj Khalifa could be seen occasionally. The room was adequate for a family of 2 2 as it had two queen beds. However queen bedded rooms do n\u2019t have a balcony only the King rooms or higher classification rooms do. D\u00e9cor not particularly to my taste \u2013 quite brown dark and dull and it was adequate not wow or opulent as I \u2019d expected for some reason. Espa toiletries were replenished daily and plenty of bottled water provided. Biggest bug bear particularly with little children was that there is no hand held shower head in the bath. There is a walk in shower but it \u2019s just easier to bath them so washing their hair was a bit tricky. If you have a Go Pro take your HDMI cable to view your daily footage as the TV is HD enabled with appropriate sockets for the cable. Enough storage is provided with hangers that actually come out of the wardrobe not those that are permanently attached to the rail. Also there \u2019s an ice bucket ice machines are near the lifts on each floor kettle tea coffee and a minibar which we requested to be emptied so the children did n\u2019t play with the contents. Also 3pin sockets are around but whoever designs hotel rooms why oh why are they not located close to mirrors. Drying and straightening my hair takes long enough without it being made more awkward because there \u2019s no mirror close enough to where the sockets are. Also drying wet things is difficult. There \u2019s one of those washing line type thingys over the bath but it \u2019s pretty inadequate. The bathroom opens up to the main bedroom area with sliding doors but the loo is discreet behind another lockable door. East Tower \u2013 is where the shopping avenue fast food eateries Nobu Kaleidoscope restaurant the main buffet restaurant inside aquarium viewing windows kids club and coffee shop are located. Plus a huge mock up of the new Atlantis Residences. It \u2019s VERY busy as it \u2019s also a public area. As others have said the security is such that as you try to enter leave public areas you will be asked to show your residents key. We did n\u2019t find this a problem at all and in fact if anything helped us feel more secure especially when it came to leaving bags property on sunbeds etc or if the children wondered off mesmerised by all the aquatic life and divers. in the aquarium. Imperial Club \u2013 12th Floor East Tower Seats around 100 people and with a small play area at one end with a tv. Happy hour is 5 \u2013 7 pm during which they serve free cocktails sparkling wine and some alcoholic drinks \u2013. not all drinks are included only those marked \u2018 \u2019 on the menu. There is also a reasonably extensive selection of canap\u00e9s and other food too. However on a couple of occasions it was too busy to be seated and there was a long wait which meant we missed being able to enjoy a cocktail before dinner. On another occasion we were served drinks in the corridor. A continental type breakfast is also served here but as with Kaleidoscope if you arrive after 930 am for breakfast there were long queues. Not sure if booking both Imperial Club plus HB is good value for money given the snacks canap\u00e9s that are available in the lounge. Kids club \u2013 There is quite a bit of security once they are inside which we felt was appropriate. Inside there are several Apple computers and huge tv \u2019s with x box games etc. There \u2019s climbing walls with supervision. but I \u2019m not sure how stimulated or entertaining my children found it which is why we only limited their time there to 1 2 hours. I \u2019m really not sure what they \u2019d do for a full morning or afternoon sesionPol Beach areas \u2013 there are towels everywhere which you can help yourself to and towel deposit points to drop them off after. However most people leave their towels on their beds when they leave. This is really annoying and I think given the number of lifeguards attendants they could be better trained to remove towels when people leave \u2013 it also looks really shabby to see heaps of wet towels lying on unused beds. You can see when people are packing up to leave the pool beach areas and attendants could quite easily clear the space for others to use. Otherwise when you go down to the pool beach at 3 pm onwards all you \u2019l see is sunbed after sunbed with wet smelly towels and nowhere for you to sitKaleidoscope Restaurant \u2013 we ate here every night as it \u2019s easier not to have waiter service with the children and although we knew we could pay a supplement to eat elsewhere we did n\u2019t know how much and never bothered to ask. Food was ok and on a couple of occasions we ordered chicken nuggets and chips for our youngest which you could do at the table. it is quite a dreary looking restaurant and we always booked in advance so never had to wait. Aquaventure Waterpark \u2013 is amazing. The lazy river is vast and because my little boy was under the height limit 12 m for anything other than \u2018 Splashers \u2019 a huge construction of water play apparatus specifically for the little ones it was great. Most of the \u2018 rides \u2019 are taken with a rubber ring and there are singles or twins available. There are also some that include a child seat and on some days there were scrummages to obtain one of these. However in certain parts of the park the lifeguards appeared to keep a stash of these so ask if they \u2019ve got any. There are towels available from the huts and getting sunbeds near Splashers was ok if you arrived before 11 otherwise it was a bit hit and miss. The resort buggies do n\u2019t start running to the park until 945There is a separate entrance to the waterpark for hotel guests and to obtain your daily entrance wristband \u2013 you can also get these from the Imperial Club Concierge. We never had to queue behind more than 2 3 people and there are also regular golf buggies ferrying people from one end of the resort to the waterpark and Dolphin Bay. Dolphin Bay \u2013 we preboked a \u2018 shallow water interaction \u2019 and on the day we attended a short orientation session before meeting Lisa the dolphin. The dolphin bay area is immaculate and reminded me of Disney. The experience lasts around 1\u00bd hours and was very well choreographed. Although around 30 people attend each session you are broken up into 4 5 groups each with a dolphin to \u2018 play with \u2019. The water is chilly even in Dubai temperatures and you are given the choice of wearing a dolphin bay wet suit or jacket. As others have mentioned the photos are expensive but as you ca n\u2019t take any yourself unles you \u2019ve paid to observe you are a bit of a captive audience. Overall everywhere in the resort the staff were helpful friendly and really welcoming with the children. We had a wonderful holiday and would have liked a few more days. I celebrated a big birthday whilst there and the hotel sent a chocolate cake birthday card bottle of wine and huge bouquet of flowers to our room which they had also decorated \u2013 a lovely touch. The hotel certainly was n\u2019t as opulent and lavish as I \u2019d expected but for a family with small children it was near perfect. We will definitely return.", "offset": [1695, 1762], "date": "2015-04-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e45165c4-917e-45c1-9b90-252be7866a0a", "sentence": "Expensive an over rated. I have just returned from a 5 night break and wanted to share the good and bad points that may be of interest in helping you decide whether Atlantis is the place for you. To set the scene we an an average UK couple who have visited Atlantis in the Bahamas a number of times and also visited Dubai before and stayed at the Mina a Salam. Good points the decor is impressive with the aquarium being a central theme. Our room was on the second floor and was very well furnished and spaciousthere is a good variety of restaurants and fast food outlets as well as shops the quality and quantity of food was also very good. The staff were very pleasant and service generally good. The waterpark which is attached to the hotel and is free to hotel guests is really good as good if not better than the Wild Wadi water park on the main land and there was never a queue for any of the slides. Sunbeds both at the water park and around the pools were in abundance so there was never a shortage at any time of day so no getting up at the crack of dawn to reserve them. Bad points Everything was ridiculously expensive. The cheapest bottle of wine was just over \u00a3 40 and this was to be found in the Lebanese restaurant. The cheapest wine in other restaurants was even more. Indeed all drinks were excessively priced. so much so that having a few drinks in the evening was simply not possible as it would have cost almost as much as the holiday. The wi fi rate was also aprox \u00a3 20per day if you booked directly with the hotel it was complimentary but we booked through Virgin Holidays so would have had to pay. HOWEVER thankfully one of the staff let slip that wi fi is free in all the restaurants just ask them for the password. so we managed to save some money that way. We also had a bad experience with noise in our room until 230am which came from one of the restaurants one night. We complained and was introduced to the Food and Beverage Director Alexandre Useglio. He made the right noises and promised to investigate and get back to us but we never heard another word not impresedSumary there seems to be a lot of hype about staying on the Palm. To be honest it makes no difference whatsover. Indeed if you want to visit any sites it just makes the taxi ride more expensive. Its also quite an impersonal hotel due to the size. Compared with Atlantis in the Bahamas its no where near as good and when we go back again to Dubai which we will do for the guaranteed sun we will stay at the Mina a Salam which to us is much better in all respects have a look you wo nt be disapointedSory Atlantis The Palm but you are too expensive and vastly over rated.

We visited here for drinks after a meal. We had hoped to stay here but it was too expensive and so booked the Madinat. We were so glad we did. when we visited the Atlantis it was about 11 pm and so busy with people milling about the lobby area and children everywhere. We have children so are not against this but as a couple having a rare child free holiday this would have been the wrong hotel for us. We would consider visiting here with our children in the future though. The lobby area was very impressive.

I have recently returned from a 7night stay at the Atlantis with my partner and my 3 year old daughter. It was our 1st time in Dubai and the staff at Atlantis made our holiday a fantastic experienceWe stayed in an ocean duluxe room with 2 double beds a huge bath and separate shower. The room was spacious and we were supplied with clean towels and bottled water every day. The cleaning staff also created animals from towels which really impressed our little oneWe ate at kaleidoscope restaurant most nights we had a half board stay which included breakfast and dinner or lunch every day at certain places. The variety in kaleidoscope was huge there was something for everyone. Even our little one who is a fussy eater and will only eat chicken nuggets and chips. The waiters asked the chefs to prepare this for her as is was not part of the buffet. Nothing was too much trouble. All staff throughout the hotel interacted with our daughter and where very friendly and polite. Their service is definitely 5. We stayed during Ramadan which ment the hotel was quiet. It was a very relaxing atmosphere. The private beach was amazing. So calm and relaxing which is want you want on holiday. We spent most of our days at the waterpark and our little one loved the splashes area for kids. Life jackets and towels are supplied and there are life guards everywhere which reassures you. We also had a dolphin encounter which was fantastic. We have seen people complain about the amount of time you get alone with the dolphin. But as there are that many people wanting to have an experience with the dolphins we thought groups of 10 where fine taking into account the health and wellbeing of the dolphins and the fact they could not work all day constant if there where groups of 2. we loved our experience. We would just take a little more money next time for the pictures. We bought 2 photos but did not realise how expensive they where If you are an observer on the beach you can take as many photos as you wish. All in all an amazing holiday at Atlantis and would recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting.

The staff has a talent for seeing if anything is needed without being intrusive and are fantastic and genuine with kids. The housekeeping team should be applauded at the high standard throughout the hotel. The furnishings and fittings are of the highest quality. Food and beverage outlets are exceptional and great quality service and variety. Special mention to George in the imperial lounge who was such a welcoming and caring evening host.

Never in my entire life have me and my family been treated in a way we did today by your staff. As a paying customer I expect to receive a good service and access to all the hotel facilities especially the beach and water park. As a practising Muslim my family and I follow our religion strictly and on my first day I felt that your staff were discriminating against my wifes dress code. I came to Atlantis because of the wonderful reviews I have read and heard about on social media. However the moment I arrived at the beach my experience did not live up to these standards. As you must be aware a Muslim woman must cover herself with a garment called abaya and this is the type of garment my wife wears at all times. As we arrived into the water park and entered the floating hoop with my 2 year old daughter we were stopped by a life guard who said that the clothing she was wearing abaya was not appropriate for the rides for health and safety reasons. Understandably because of the lose clothing there are chances of it being caught somewhere. Very disappointing to hear as we travelled tens of thousands miles to experience the water park however the safety of my wife is important to me. So we then headed for the kids splash area and again as we sat near the water just after the sun beds we were bothered again by one of the life guards. Again for inappropriate clothing which is bizarre because this has nothing to do with health and safety. After explaining to the life guard my wife was only going to be sitting just after the sun beds only to have her feet barely touch the water this was not possible. And we were asked by him to move away from the water. Having being refused access to the park half of the facilities of Atlantis had already gone out of my reach. Not knowing where else to enjoy the water facilities I asked one of the life guards if there was anywhere else to go where the abaya would be OK to swim with. He directed me to the beach and said that it would be fine for my wife to use the beach in her Abaya. So we made our way to the beach and then 10min later we we are approached by a life guard who told us my wife can not swim on the beach with her abaya. Already being refused access to the water park told by the guard we could use the beach and now being told I can not I became extremely upset as there was nothing else for me and my family to enjoy together. I was told that this was for health and safety reasons to protect her from drowning which frankly does not make any sense at all. The so called beach is cornered of with ropes to prevent beach users from proceeding further. To get to the point of the ropes a person can do that walking as the water is shallow all the way until the ropes. So how can a person drown in shallow water. Does not make any sense at all. Besides this my wife was not any where near the ropes as a matter of fact she was paddling with my daughter at the front of the beach were the water only reached her ankles. To be told she can not even do this is absolutely ridiculous and stupid. As you must understand my frustration this was my first hour in Atlantis and I was already being treated unprofesionaly and being refused access to what I have paid for which was truly below standards for a 5 star hotel. I was unhappy with the situation as anyone would be so I demanded to speak to someone more senior. After 10 minutes a supervisor arrived by the name of Alexander who then told me the exact same reasons as the life guard did instead of being diplomatic and coming up with a solution. After another 10 minutes of repeating the same thing I realised we were not getting anywhere so I asked to speak to the manager. James then arrived 10 mins later and unfortunately he could not help the situation as I thought a manager working at the Atlantis resort could do. I must add that James was raising his voice at me which is totally unacceptable and disrespectful and should be dealt with according to your staff disciplinary process if you do have one a full explanation as to why he behaved in this manner and an apology for raising his voice at me. However after another 15 minutes of unprofessional customer service he finally came up with a solution which really did not solve anything in my opinion which was to purchase a Burkina. As a supervisor I would have thought James would have been able to do his job efficiently and offer a solution on the spot but unfortunately this was not the occasion. As I previously mentioned that I am a practising Muslim and the removal of my wifes abaya is a complete no go. However on this occasion I was willing to see if the Burkina was appropriate enough for my wife to wear. Already 30min had gone by and my time at the resort was being wasted by your staff. We were walked to the retail shop by James and shown the Burkina. Unfortunately again there was no solution to this ridiculous issue as my wife is pregnant and they do not cater for pregnant women. Again a major shortfall in the services you provide to me a paying customer and you can not even offer a basic service. As James was not able to provide a solution I demanded to speak to a more senior member of staff to solve this problem which was now taking over 45mins. Instead of the manager coming to us we were told to follow James around the entire park to find the manager. After finally reaching the manager of the water park whose name was Karl I explained the situation to him again after explaining it to 3 different staff members I was beginning to sound like a robot repeating the same words over and over again instead of James explaining it to him himself. An hour had gone by and all Karl was able to say is unfortunately these are the rules and we must follow them. Know he was beginning to sound like a robot. What kind of managers are you employing none of the staff members can even come up with a solution. After an hour of a complete waste of time I decided to go back to go back to my hotel room as there was absolutely nothing for me and my family to do. I am extremely unhappy with the way me and my family were treated and felt we were picked on and bullied out of enjoying what I paid for. The staff were completely unhelpful and made me and my family feel extremely uncomfortable and intimidated. I have never experienced this kind of treatment at all in all my holidays. All I received was a standard template apology email from Hany Nafad the Aqua Venture and beach operations manager.

My husband and I have just spent another fantastic week at Atlantis the Palm. We first came here in 2014 and vowed to return. When we booked back in early January our travel agent informed us that we would be staying during Ramadan and we may encounter some differences. As the holiday drew closer and after speaking to friends who know people in Dubai. We became apprehensive we went online to book a desert safari trip and seen that although the trip was still available the entertainment part of it would not be provided belly dancers music etc. so we decided not to book but on the understanding that we could book when we got there should we still want to go. From what I had read heard it seemed that only limited places would be open during the day. this included the malls and our hotel eating drinking even water and smoking during the day was forbidden and when going out you should be even more covered up than normal. I can tell you now that it was far from like that. Yes during Ramadan the rules change slightly and being in a Muslim country it is only right that we respect their rules. Drinking and eating on the beach and at the water park is totally fine. Restaurants at the Dubai mall were open but only got take away. There were a large number of restaurants at the mall of the emirates open for food during the day. Come 8 pm when the fast is broken. The hotel bar done a 2 for 1 happy hour and any restaurant which had been hidden by a screen or curtain is now wide open. See through clothing including beach wear is not allowed but I think that is pretty much standard practice year round even at hotels. Some of the slides at the water park were closed for maintenance due to this being their quiet time but again this did not spoil our fun. Would I actively choose to come again during Ramadan. No but it also would not put me off if it was the only time I could go and if the prices were favourable. Atlantis has to be seen to really be believed I had recommend it to anyone wanting to come to Dubai yes it is far out but taxis are dirt cheap and there is also the monorail which connects you with the tram and metro network a great and cheap way to get a pout the city. I want to say a massive thank you to the lovely Soresh he took great care of us during our stay we wanted for nothing and his talkers lie in not only excellent housekeeping and customer service but in the art of towel animals. I have seen a few In my time but his are by far the best. He is a lovely person both inside and out and I will genuinely miss chatting to him.

My wife and I and our two boys 8 and 4 have just returned from Atlantis and what an amazing holiday it was. Where can I startFirstly the weather. Most British people are looking for the opposite to English weather for a summer break in July and you certainly get that in Dubai. Not a cloud in the sky and consistently sunny and over 40 Celsius all week. there is an assumption that it is dry heat like a desert which is incorect it is coastal and actually very humid. 40 feels like 50 degrees. It was a shock when we arrived even for a seasoned traveler like me. it is pretty dusty hazy so July is not the time to go if you want a perfect view from up in the skyscrapers. Sun cream is important but water even more so. I saw two people literally faint in the heat when I was there British and German ladies I think and looked to be in their sixties. Thankfully there are pool staff lifeguards. everywhere and they are well used to this they were on the case immediately. The hotel put half a dozen bottles of water in the room every day and it is nededThe hotel itself has 150 bedrooms 22 floors 150 ish staff 19 restaurants dozens of shops from souvenir tobacco sort of places lots of fashion and some not too pricey Lacoste etc up to very high end jewellery and watch shops some items over \u00a3 50k. Also stores like Tiffany co a Porsche clothing and accessories store etc. Not a lot of point going to the malls in my opinion. From the moment you arrive and walk into the huge atrium with the 40 ft high coloured glass central sculpture it is impressive. You can actually see the hotel from 10 minutes away in the car however as the main road that goes down the middle of the palm jumeriah takes you straight to the hotel. I had feared the vast size of the place would lead to a very impersonal and not very luxurious experience but I was wrong. The staff can not do enough for you are all very friendly really great with the kids literally the best I have come across. there is two outdoor pools the main Royal Pool which is huge and has two pool bars and the Zero entry pool which is also huge and divided in two. One side of it flanks the Nasimi beach bar nightclub and has an over 21s area with outdoor sofas and huka pipes etc the other side is perfect for very young kids as no steps and a very shallow slope into the water. Lots of parents here making the most of this shallow water right in front of their sun loungers but also enjoying drinks from the nearby bar. Smoking is ok anywhere outside it seems. Not to forget he vast aquarium in the west tower. 3 or 4 stories high with amazing marine life. sharks huge Rays if your budget is unlimited you can dine and even sleep right next to itAlso joining the hotel is the Aquaventure water park. Quite simply the best I have ever been to. do not forget flip flops because the floor gets so hot it will burn your feet in seconds. Carry these with you on all rides especially the Rapids which seems to go on for miles all round the park but easy to get lost as there are so many exit points. there is so many slides I still had not done all of them in a week. Minimum height for most is 12 m. My 8 year old came on all of them with me but recently they have reduced the minimum height on some to 107 m which meant my brave 4 year old came on quite a few also. there is a lot of slides that you go down in a large circular inflatable thing and our family of 4 did several slides as a group which was nice. There were not many queues when we went 8 15 July never more than say 5 minutes but looking at the size of the queue areas there must be times when this is awfully busy. Food ice cream and drinks places everywhere. Superb kids water park with a lifeguard at every slide and some slides parents can go on also. there is a huge aquarium in the Neptune tower where you can watch exotic fish etc two of the slides here actually finish with you travelling through the middle of the aquarium in a see through tunnel quite slowly by the end unbelievable. This is where myself and my 8 year old did the Ray feeding experience. About \u00a3 35 each and well worth it we stood in shallow water and were given prawns and squid and they smell it in the water and come and eat out of your hand. Amazing experience we both loved this and will never forget it. My wife took my 4 year old on the shallow water dolphin encounter as it is over 6 yrs for the ray feeding. Equally amazing memories for the dolphin encounter but by the time you have paid for the photos most people do as they are so good. it ends up costing more like \u00a3 150 per person. Food is very good at Atlantis. there is 4 or 5 restaurants that are included with the half board package. Most people we talked to were on this as you can not get an all inclusive package here neither at the travel agent nor at the hotel on arrival. You can pay around \u00a3 200 300 per person per week on arrival for the imperial club. Here you can get as many soft drinks as you like tea and cakes etc and alcohol at certain very restricted times some people do a late lunch this way but we chose not to because if you take your MasterCard everywhere with you ideal in the water park as it slips into the room key lanyard. you get 25 off. All restaurant and fod drink ice cream. we must have saved a fortune by doing this. I still spent over a Grand in a week though. Which brings me onto my final point the cost. I booked the 4 of us back in the week before Christmas over 7 months before we travelled through Best at Travel managed to negotiate them down from \u00a3 410 to \u00a3 3750. This was half board for 4 1 week transfers in Dubai unlimited water park access aquarium access and Emirates flights the flight was superb by the way an A380 from Gatwick best flight any of us have ever been on. The initial cost is not too scary for a main summer family break. Bear in mind however that Dubai is one of the worlds richest countries and most things cost a fortune. For example a can of Fanta was 22 AED Arab Emirates Dirham which is \u00a3 5. We choose to eat at 4 restaurants that were not included in the half board package for variety etc this is 150 AED per adult and 75 AED per child for each meal total supplement around \u00a3 100 per meal still not including drinks which is around \u00a3 10 per pint but do not forget the 25 MasterCard discount which adds up to a lot of saving in restaurants. None of the staff tell you this by the way my wife researched this online before we went. there is a 10 service charge included in all bills so you do not have to worry about tips. In summary it is an expensive place to visit and be prepared to spend lots more than you have already paid for he holiday. even if it is just cold drinks and ice creams by the polWe all had a holiday we will never forget and will definitely return. I highly recommend it to anyone with kids a similar age to ours the heat would be to much for very young kids I think or even older kids or adult kids like me will have an amazing time.", "offset": [6571, 6693], "date": "2017-07-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "540a031c-46d6-421b-adc2-93e96742a0cc", "sentence": "Great experience.

We chose The Atlantis Hotel to celebrate my sons 18th birthday as we had stayed in Dubai before and visited the Atlantis water park for a day and he remembered how he loved his day there so much he wanted to stay for the week. I had been doing some reading prior to our trip about The Atlantis on trip advisor and was a little worried it would n\u2019t meet our expectations however after our trip I must say It exceeded most expectations we had and we usually do cruise holidays and there service is second to none but the Atlantis far outweighed any of them. On our arrival to the hotel concierge were quick to welcome us and unload our luggages promptly. Check in was quick and due to me contacting them prior to my arrival to explain I have walking difficulties and could n\u2019t stand for to long they asked me to check in at the Royal Majils so as I could be seated to check in which was a thoughtful and lovely gesture as this is the VIP check in and you could see why. The room that we had was one of the newly refurbished rooms the Regal Suite in the west tower It was spacious with lovely views of the palm and royal pool The interior was modern and very spacious we had a walk in wardrobe which was amazing and the bathroom had a massive freestanding bath in the middle and a separate walk in shower. If I stayed again I would definitely choose the Regal Suite for a family it was so spacious with a lounge a dining table and massive balcony. Every evening of our stay there would be a surprise delivered to our room as they knew we were celebrating my sons birthday my children are very well traveled and have experienced lots of beautiful hotels and cruise ships but the service and the attentiveness and the little extra special touches we received have made this hotel by far the best experience yet. I did n\u2019t experience issues with getting a sunbeds around the pools nor the waterpark. we were travelling in a group as family and friends came along with us and they always managed to get beds I have to add that due to hotel knowing about my walking difficulties they did arrange for me to have a Cabana at the royal pool for my whole stay so my beds were reserved for me Jaime and his staff looked after the guests in the Cabana everyday and really went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and satisfied. my family who did n\u2019t have this always found beds with ease. I have worked in the travel industry for years and I can honestly say after seeing a child drown whilst on a holiday abroad I think the number 1 priority on holiday should be fully trained lifeguards and the safety of guests in the pool and sea. The hotels life guards are 2nd to none every part of the pool water park and sea was being monitored and they also provided life jackets for children free of charge to those that needed them now this really impressed me and something I have n\u2019t seen before. We were half board and the food was very good and catered for all yes you do have a little queue on the busier times to be seated in the buffet restaurants but if you want to avoid this there are other restaurants included in the half board or some with a supplement that you can book to avoid this. Overall our stay was 1010 and we definitely will be returning yes it \u2019s expensive but worth every penny Staff are helpful and polite and go out of there way to help you the hotel is perfect for all ages and for families as the children will be so happy with the water park and so well looked after. Due to me contacting the guest services prior to our arrival they made sure all of my concerns and worries were taken care of and that is thanks to Sugandha D\u2019sa Manager of Guest Services and the Royal Majlis team. We would like to thank you all at the Atlantis for making my sons birthday and our holiday amazing and an unforgettable experience.", "offset": [2410, 2655], "date": "2018-07-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "family"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "0806979b-660f-460e-9a68-45da1791cdc6", "sentence": "Fantastic Holiday. We have just got back from a week staying at Atlantis The Palm in Dubai. Well what can I say. we had a fantastic time. The hotel was absolutely lush. The staff were very attentive and nothing was ever too much trouble. We were concerned before we left about some of the negative reviews but all I can say is we had an extremely positive stay. We had originally wanted to take the kids to Hilton Dubai the walk but we thought for a bit more we could have unlimited access to the water park so we opted for Atlantis. Boy are we glad we did this is not the first time but it was for our kids and it was most definitely the right decision as it is not just a hotel but a whole experience within itself. It has its own malls lots of different restaurants kids club water park on site etc etc so even when we were n\u2019t out sight seeing we were wondering around the huge hotel browing shops watching giant ray fish swimming passed it was lovely. It meant that we did n\u2019t always have to venture very far from the hotel to have a good time we could have not left the hotel at all and had an amazing time just using hotel facilities. The rooms were lovely and very clean. We stayed a few nights in the family suite and then shifted to the delux suite as we wanted to see if it was worth that much of the difference between the rooms. It really was and next time we go yes there are already plans for next time. we will most definitely just book the family suite for the whole duration because the size was large it was like having a studio flat. Really lovely. The cleaning staff are very attentive and there is an option for having your beds made every day or only on the days you want it \u2019s called the green scheme or something similar. The rooms and towels were cleaned and changed daily. The showering products are lovely and the pillows are so comfortable to the extent that we have had discussions around purchasing them no joke. And yes the hotel do sell them although it is 60 aed per pillow. But seriously they are really comfortable. Daily there would be little water bottles placed in the room around eight of them. This is really handy as the water bottle and coke prices are fairly steep around the hotel. We purchased six cans of coke by the pool in a cool bag full of ice for 78 aed. It worked out cheaper with the ice and the bag as opposed to the cans separately. The water in the restaurants were around 23 aed per bottle but they had offers on for unlimited drinks of soft drinks water for 45 aed per person as long as the whole table opted in. Ca n\u2019t remeber how much for alcoholic beverages. It is n\u2019t worth noting that there is an ice machine Outside the rooms at the end of each corridor. We had been looking at the empty ice bucket sitting on the table top all week wondering how much the charge would be for ice only to discover the day before we left that the machine at the end of the hall was an ice machine. DohThe closest buffet restaurant to us was the Saffron it had at least 20 different dishes every day. The staff were Uber nice and the food was so good that each time we we decided to go to another restaurant on site we found our selves heading towards the saffron as we did n\u2019t want to miss the selection they had for that particular day. Each day is a different theme in the buffet restaurants. You can see the theme on their website. You could call up to reserve a table before hand or just turn up we just turned up and the question were never too long although the best time we found for dinner was 6 pm as it was more quieter. We \u2019l try and upload pix of the food however we did n\u2019t take too many as we were too busy loading up our platesThe hotel on a whole was not full of noisy children running around causing mass mayhem as one of the reviewers had suggested. It has a family element and yes there were children but as with any family hotel there will be and the were lots of laughs and smiles from any children that passed by. As far as our children were concerned they said it \u2019s the best holiday they have been too and they absolutely loved the waterpark. The children chose not to go to the kids club even though we had one day complimentary as they did n\u2019t want to miss out on anything. This time of year it is very hot and it was nice to see staff going round the pool and beaches handing out ice pops for free. That was a nice gesture. There was a mehndi hut and our daughter got her hands done for 210aed. There were fans in the hut and the staff were lovely. The henna seemed light at first but following the instructions of the lady who done it the henna darkened over the next few days. The children did the aquatrek which is like having a bucket with a window over your head and going under water and swimming with sharks rays and all sorts of other fish. The staff were great patient and very good at explaining to the children. The children loved it. However as an experience deep sea diver I felt it was too restricted in movement for me. It was good laugh for the kids though as they are nt qualified for diving and it has given them confidence enough to want to go on and do a padi course so they can go diving next time. The waterpark was well worth going too. We had unlimited access with the package we purchased by the way we purchased direct from the hotel website and then booked our flights and transfers with Emirates it worked out cheaper and better deal free wifi unlimited access to waterpark lost chambers half board. last time we booked with virgin holidays for Christmas and we did n\u2019t even get WiFi. The waterpark was so fun the slides were great and the ques not that long. There are free caddies similar to golf caddies that take you to and from the hotel to the waterpark. The kids particularly enjoyed the kids pool section which was like a splash zone with buckets of water pouring down and alsorts. Again the drinks were dear in price. Probably worth buying waterproof pouch necklace for phone and wallet room pass etc as it costs 165 aed to purchase it at the waterpark and if your all in the pool then whose looking after your things. Also note you do n\u2019t need to take towels. as there \u2019s are plenty of free towel kiosks at the waterpark as well as the hotel pools. It should be noted also that the floor around the hotel pool and the waterpark pool heat up extremely quickly and so it would be wise to purchase pool slippers as in the ones you can swim with. they sell them near hotel pool kiosk for 10aed but they are more of a thick sock as oppose to an aqua shoe. Also do n\u2019t forget kids arm bands. We forgot ours and had to purchase it it cost 65aed and I swear they were the ones you get from pound landThe over all message of this very long review is it is a very good hotel. very good attentive staff everything you can want is here although if you want to purchase basics do so for elsewhere as it works out cheaper. There is nothing that the hotel has n\u2019t thought of and the customer is always there number one priority if your unhappy about something they will rectify it immediately and in the bestest of ways it really is top notch customer service.

I had heard a lot about Atlantis and therefore it was a must visit place in my mind. I had been to Dubai in August when the weather is way hot and thus when my parents choose Dubai for a short visit I decided to book Atlantis and kept it as a surprise. Booking experience. I did booking for 3 rooms on the website directly for my trip starting 8th Nov 2018 to 11th Nov 2018. During the booking I selected for 3 rooms with King bed and overlooking palmdrive with all 3 rooms being adjacent to each other. The rooms in the images look decent and website is fairly easy to navigate. Post bokingAfter the booking I was checking my mails and say that there is a discount to Emirates members at Atlantis which was not there during my booking and neither did this pop up. I therefore wrote to them giving details of the discount available being a skyward member. However the hotel promptly refused and I let this matter be. I had seen other hotels being more ethical on thisArival and checkinAnyways we arrived via Emirates flight from New Delhi which landed at 1245 pm Dubai time. We were therefore at the Hotel by 235pm. The checkin process at the hotel was extremly bad and no one to guide customers coming for the 1st time. It looked as if the hotel staff were too caught up in their own and dint bother or have a policy to welcome the guests. I observed this over the next few days as well. Maybe they are not equipped to handle volumesAnyways after asking some staff they guided me to stand in any of the queue which was at the left of the entry. People were crowding around. While standing in one line for almost 30 minutes I was informed by the staff at the reception to move to Bother line since he had many passports to photocopy and he would take time. I thus had to move to another counter. Eventually after 45 to 50 minutes my turn came. All this while my parents were made to sit in the lobby and no one asked them for water. In fact there is no concept to welcome the guests and people are left on their own when they come after a long journeyThe hotel definitely needs to relok their standardsIt took another 15 to 20 minutes for the staff to get all details and then to my shock and surprise informed me that despite my booking and message of 3 adjoining rooms does not have them. Also she asked me if I could take rooms with double beds instead of king bed as opted and booked by me. one definitely did not expect this from such a grand hotelWhen I insisted that I only need king beds and adjoining rooms she said she will need to go inside and check and asked me to wait for 5 to 10 mins. After some 25 odd minutes had passed and when she did not come I had to ask some other staff to call her. She finally come another 5 to 10 minutes after that. Finally I am given 2 adjoining rooms on the 8th floor and one room on the 12th floor. This despite my booking in advance and sending the message I am not given the rooms together. Anyways since it was around 415 pm and my parents were waiting i took the rooms available. It actually took more than 1 hour and 30 minutes for us to check in. Also while I was waiting I observed that the staff in the adjacent line was offering a map cun book about the hotel facilities. This was not offered to us and and I had to ask. The staff did not had them available and had to get it from another desk. So finally we manage to check in after one of the longest wait time ever in a hotel. Room ambienceThe 1st room in the 8th floor had a view of the water park but not the view of the palm drive which we had sought or appeared. Then on the floor right next to the bed there was an earbud. These things are unheard of from a hotel of this repute. Luggage. The luggage took another 20 minutes to come and instead of coming to the 3 rooms as earmarked it was brought in to the 12th floor. So instead of calling the service boy I just took my parents and my brothers luggage myself from the 12th floor to the 8th floor. In room dining Since we were all hungry by this time we thought of ordering some snacks. We were again surprised to hear that it would take around 40 to 4 t minutes for the order to comeIt normally takes 20 minutes for this kind of order in any hotelSo the overall experience if checking in such a reputed hotel was actually one of the biggest disappointments ever I have had. I would surely never recommend this hotel to other travellers and the hotel really needs to get its act right in hospitality There were some positives as well. The room cleaning guy on the 12th floor was an extremely polite guy and always smiling. Then the security guard in the lobby where we would go for breakfast was also polite and always smiling. The water park is amazing though again they charge even the hotel guests for locker facility while the towels are complimentary. It is advisable to stay in another hotel and definitely visit the water park which is an amazing experience.", "offset": [2971, 3061], "date": "2018-11-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "family"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "caf22324-bb14-4d19-8aeb-9260eae912aa", "sentence": "Disappointing.

As they knew it was our anniversary I would have loved and asked for a room with a view as I paid for I did not demand any upgrade and have the package ready upon check in. It was not very pleasant to waste 1h to sort this out upon our arrival. We wanted to catch the sunset but missed it.
