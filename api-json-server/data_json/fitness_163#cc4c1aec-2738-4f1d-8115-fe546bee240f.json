I have been a spa member at Doha Mariot Cornice for 3 years and in this time I have seen some comings and goings regarding staff. The pool staff has stayed consistent and let me say attentive and professional. The Food and beverage staff has changed recently for the worst We now have the View Bar. Fantastic venue for a relaxing drink over the last few months UNTIL. They started stripping the place of its best staff and replacing them with agency staff. Gone has Macka Josephat Raj and Anand only to be replaced by agency staff who have no idea of rapport and courtesy with the paying customer spa member. The last man standing at the Veiw Bar is Nurul Haw who has single handedly run this place with a politeness and welcoming attitude and professional manner and also knows what 5 star service is.

My neighborhood salon makes me a feel more like a princess than Doha Mariot. My friends and I decided to try out the spa service at Doha Mariot and I was pretty disappointed. I opted for the body wrap which required me to walk 20 feet away from the cabin several times to wash the product during the treatment which was not very pleasant. Most of the salons I have visited have a shower area near the cabin and some even inside the cabin which make more sense. During the treatment the thermal blanket placed over me did not make me sweat at all. It was the first time i was trying out this treatment so i did not know what to expect when we got out of the spa my friend who opted for the same service described how warm the blanket made her feel and the you are supposed to sweat all through. Obviously I was highly disappointed upon hearing that. I still gave it a 3 star because the ambiance was good the Jacuzi and sauna was great however the service itself was disappointing. lastly the head massage during the treatment gave me a terrible headache let alone the time i spent untangling the knots.
