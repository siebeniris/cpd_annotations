I booked here with trepidation based on the mixed reviews. If I had not committed to hosting a large private party at the restaurant Bourbon Steak and heard about the infamous traffic I would have stayed elsewhere. Fortunately the stay is short. We are in a large one bedroom suite for two nights only because of proximity to the restaurant. In the reservation I requested the Hibiscus building. That request was not honored and with an attitude at check. in that suggested it was an unreasonable request to begin with. They did give me a high floor as requested just in the clearly in need of renovation Magnolia building. The suite has good space and the bathroom has held up well over the years. The furnishings however are rather threadbare. The living area in particular is shabby. The small balcony which has garbage on the railing from a previous guest has a beautiful view overlooking the golf course. Initially I thought the living room might not matter since we could hang out on the balcony watching golfers while getting some work done. Unfortunately it is too hot and we are stuck in the shabby living room which also has filthy windows and multiple dirty spots in the carpet. For my purposes having a nice living room that I plan to use is the reason I book suites but if I had seen this I would not have booked it. A regular room if renovated might have been nicer. A room or suite elsewhere almost certainly would be nicer. On the plus side we do not hear noise from other rooms which other reviewers said could be a problem. The breakfast is only worth doing if it is included in the room rate. The setting at Corsair is nice the breakfast buffet just okay. I did not have the illusion that this would be a 5 resort but I do expect regular hotel services and a clean room. The room rate is by no means cheap and certainly warrants better quality overall. This is not even up to regular Mariot quality so I do not know how they can brand it part of their Autograph Collection. Right now it is 245 pm and there has been no sign of housekeeping today. The hotel literature says that turndown is only upon request. I am hoping the restaurant experience it looks beautiful will be much better and I will review it separately. The basic service level quality often says a lot about a hotel. When the basics are lacking I am certainly not going to take risks on luxury items like spa services. I booked through a travel agency that specializes in high end hotels. They should know better than to have this as part of their collection.", "offset": [689, 763], "date": "2015-01-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "6b185006-73e7-4b16-80ce-335444dcb359", "sentence": "Spacious luxurious rooms but careful of the extra charges.

There is a nice outdoor pool and a good place to eat breakfast at the Corsair. Breakfast was not included in our stay so I had to pay an extra 100 for me my wife and my child. Our room was feeling a bit aged and probably needs a refurb soon but other guests with us had a modern and fresh room. So I guess it can be a hit or miss.

The room had a balcony with a view of the golf course and a table and two chairs. There was a nice sitting area and a functional desk. The bathroom included a soaking tub and a separate shower. Everything was clean and worked well. The temperature is easy to control. DINING. There is a high end steak restaurant at which I did not have a chance to dine. There is also another dining area which is open for meals and is considered more casual. Breakfast was good here with a custom station for eggs and omelets fruits breads meats your normal breakfast fare. Though it was good it was also expensive. 38 for breakfast buffet and included an 18 service fee even if dining alone. As mentioned it was good but not worth the high cost. Lunch was equally pricey for what you got. The menu was solid. Conference food was good but it did not vary much. Breakfast was the same each day. The plated dinners were almost identical three nights in a row. I realize the conference organizers select the menu but the hotel should be recommending variation. Snacks again expensive. I ordered two sodas no alcohol from the pool bar. They were 12 oz cans poured into a plastic cup and I was charged 18 for the two drinks. SERVICEThe service was outstanding. The front desk was exceptional in handling both check in and check out. They were friendly understood and easily explained the options for my stay and followed up. Several times I phoned the guest service line for various reasons and a person came to up within just a few minutes. They were fast to respond.

Overall the place is nice but the service was inconsistent and the place a little run down for a JW resort. Also you do n\u2019t get much benefit at all for being a high level Mariot customer. First it \u2019s really annoying that no one ever seems able to answer the phone. Leading up to the stay and while here we called numerous times to the front desk valet concierge restaurant room service etc. Always placed on hold. Second we were woken up early in the morning by very loud groundskeepers and motorized vehicles at 50 60 am right outside our 3rd floor window that ran constantly. I called the front desk and complained and they said they would stop them but it continued unabated for another 45 minutes. Not a very relaxing trip to wake up to the sound of loud screeching equipment at the crack of dawn. One night we asked the concierge to make a reservation for us at Bourbon Steakhouse Luckily I called to confirm the day of the reservation because she never made it. The girl at check in gave us lots of incorrect information. She told us Titanium members were entitled to complimentary green fees for golf. Obviously that is incorrect so I told her that must be wrong. Then she said I would get 10 off which also turned out to be wrong because that only applies when the tee time is afternoon. She also told us we were entitled to half off drinks during happy hour 5 7 at the lobby bar. Also turned out to be wrong. She never offered me the Titanium welcome gift until I asked for it after she said goodbye. Then I find out I do n\u2019t even get a free breakfast only a free continental breakfast with an up charge for the Buffet. Really. Not even free breakfast for someone who had been loyal to Mariot for 20 years. So we do the breakfast and it \u2019s just ok. Nothing special. Maybe a little better that what you get in a typical Mariot lounge. And the tables and seating in the restaurant are very worn down and dated. Not at all what I expected from what I thought would be a high end upscale resort. The service was hit and miss. Some people like the bartenders and golf valets were great. Others seemed indifferent or borderline rude in particular the lady who works in the pro shop and certain people who work the phones. The place is very expensive but we knew that coming in. And the place was crazy busy the whole time. Swarming with unattended kids. I assume the water park is a big draw for families so keep that in mind if you are looking for a quiet peaceful trip. If you come during Christmas or Hanakah expect it to be chaotic everywhere in the hotel. Especially during breakfast where we had kids pushing through us in line. And they were constantly running out of items at the buffet.", "offset": [2761, 2821], "date": "2019-12-30", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "e6111b9d-22ad-4960-8de5-a7249e6c8b74", "sentence": "The first time we let it go the second time the hotel proved itself to not be worth the stay. This is our second time staying at JW Turnbery. The resort is dated but the waterpark is an attraction for the kids. We came the first time Sept 2019 the weekend a hurricane was forecast to be bearing down on South Florida. The resort was dirty and service horrendous but we let it go there WAS a potential Cat 5 coming our way. We came back after New Years as it is an hour drive from home and thought it would be a nice way to end the holiday break. We arrived at 11 but there was a room ready so we checked in. I would of rather waited for a CLEAN room but once our luggage arrived we decided no big deal we will have room service clean while we are gone we were at pool 35 4 hours. No one came. No one came to cleanup the old sushi left in the refrigerator or the sofa that fell out with the sushi and exploded we left soda in bathroom sink. Ok perhaps while we are at dinner. So I stopped by front desk again forget caling you sit on hold indefinitely and asked for room service and turndown. We leave a bit before 5 and returned a bit after 7. No one visited our room. Nothing. Now I have three small children exhausted and ready for bed. But since there was no turn down I am literally down a bed we are in a Suite with two beds and a pullout sofa for a family of 5. If we did not have tickets for an event tomorrow I would leave and have Amex refund our money. I will no longer recommend this resort to friends we can simply drive down for the day to use waterpark. If I had been traveling in from out of state I would be raging angry. Sharing here because no one at the resort seems to care.

We stayed in the Magnolia Tower on the top floor in a Jr Suite. We had a large balcony overlooking the golf course and a courtyard. The room had 14 foot ceilings and was beautifully appointed. We spent most of our time in the lobby bar after meetings and ordered room service one night. Everything is great. The staff are helpful and friendly. The food and cocktails were excellent.

We booked here after no availability at Marco Island. The friendliness of the staff is top notch. We missed the shuttle to the beach and one of the valets drove us over so we would not have to wait 25 minutes for the shuttle to return. It was a much appreciated gesture. The water park is perfect for a 9 yo and two 12 yos. They were in and out of the pool slides lazy river and hot tub. My only criticism is that there is nothing for kids to do at night. It is Tidal Cove pool or nothing. There is no pool arcade lawn games or anything else on site. There is not even an area to allow them to roam around. It is not appropriate to sit them in a bar so they ended up watching Netflix after dinner every night which I do n\u2019t love. It is a struggle to entertain in the evenings and in mornings as pool does not open until 930. No ping pong tables games designated area etc. While we are impressed with the staff and property I hope Mariot considers providing opportunities for the entire family in the evenings. We want family time are tired from a day in sun and want to stay on property but there is nothing to do. I feel like the other Mariot properties have more expansive offerings. For that reason we will likely go elsewhere next trip.", "offset": [31, 84], "date": "2020-02-15", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "d74975cb-ff7a-4713-bc24-aba29860a83c", "sentence": "Out of our League. I could probably say ditto to the previous reviewer. This hotel is really first class and we probably would never have selected afforded. it had we not been bused there when our cruise was cut short by a day. And a day is really not enough time to see or appreciate all the amenities two golf courses a huge water park facility onsite. There are multiple buildings and huge open areas as you can see that this is primarily a convention centre. The room was fabulous huge modern comfortable with every imaginable convenience. But if you put a personal item in the stocked fridge there is a 50 fine added automatically to your room. If you lift one of the snack items above the fridge you have 20 seconds to put it down otherwise it is yours and so is the charge. The bathroom would be my dream spa glass and marble everywhere. Spotless. The best of quality in toiletries and sumptuous bathrobes. As well the view was idyllic from the huge double glass sliding doors with a balcony that would rival the size of our entire stateroom on the ship. We looked out to the finely manicured golf course and the huge water park with multiple waterslides and climbing courses. Getting to our room was a quite a hike around and through several buildings. Long inside halls much wider than actual hallways were carpeted and hard to pull or push luggage. We saw the beautiful pool area that had lounges and umbrellas. The whole area around each building was beautifully landscaped and widely side walked. However there were a series of three steps most everywhere and those with walking difficulties struggled when those obstacles arose. There were ramps in various places but not easily visible by those who were not familiar with the grounds. We went to the in house restaurant for lunch. It was crowded and busy and the wait was long because of all the arrivals from the cruise ship. The price was an eye popper. However food was good the gal who served us was great. There is a golf tuck shop that had a few snacks chocolate bars and single sodas. They were 5 each. We wanted to run off our boarding pass for our flight the next day but the unattended FedEx business centre charged 05 minute plus the price of the paper. We waited till we got to the airport. I looked up the price for a room during the night of our stay. 49 plus all the local and sales taxes. I see that the prices have come down with travelers coronavirus concerns. If they stay down it would be nice to go back and really enjoy all the amenities of this resort hotel.", "offset": [1795, 1890], "date": "2020-03-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
