I recently attended the Army Navy football game in Philadelphia and stayed at the Sheraton Downtown which is where the Navy Football team was also staying I am family of the coaches staff. Needless to say the event is very large and all of Philadelphia not just this Sheraton was very busy. We got up to the hotel from Annapolis MD around 7 pm and when we went to check in the front desk agent told us that the room we were supposed to be staying in was blocked off. I let her know that my girlfriend and I were with the coaches staff and family and she proceeded to simply give us another room on a different floor. It was the same kind of room King bed suite that we were supposed to have and I did not want to complicate the situation anymore than it already had been so I agreed to take the different room not a big deal or so I thought. My girlfriend and I get up to our room and begin unpacking and settling in. Then about 30 minutes after we walk in and are getting comfortable ANOTHER GUEST WALKS IN USING A ROOM KEY. I have been around and stayed at many hotels inside and outside the US and I have NEVER had this happen to me. My girlfriend was mortified and I was completely taken aback. The person a young college aged male looked stunned as well muttered a few curse words and ran off back down the hall I am assuming to Guest Services. After calming down my girlfriend I immediately called the Front Desk to let them know of the situation. They apologized profusely and told me they would take care of it right away and that they would call me back momentarily. Well I waited for that call for about 25 30 minutes before it finally came through at which time they proceeded to tell me that they had taken care of the discrepancy and that it would not happen again and they were very sorry. No mention of any compensation no question as to if we wanted to switch rooms or if we needed anything else. They simply said they have taken care of it. After I asked them what they meant by taken care of they just said no one else would walk into my room. Now I have had much less negative things happen to me while staying at a hotel and much more offered to me as a guest to make things right ie comped drinks food one night stay etc. but these folks did nothing of the sort. So I finally had to tell them awkward situation that I expected some sort of compensation for what had happened. My girlfriend did not feel safe I felt as though our privacy had been violated and it gives you the feeling of looking over your shoulder just waiting for the next person to walk into your room unexpectedly. The front desk agent then said she would call a manager and call us back. After about another 10 15 minute wait I get a call back at the room and they offer to cover one half of one night of our whole weekend stay. I explained that I expected a little more than that and she told me there was not anything else they could do. So now after dealing with this whole situation for over an hour I gave up speaking to this lady over the phone and decided to go downstairs. We met some friends and family for drinks at the bar which was great and I finally was able to speak to a manager face to face. The concierge desk John I think was super friendly and helpful in getting the manager to come down. When I explained to the manager what had happened he let me know that it was a glitch in the system that allowed the front desk agent to check two different parties into the same room and that it had happened to 6 other people me included. He then offered a couple of complimentary buffet breakfast cards which were appreciated and then set me up with an SPG Loyalty Account pre loaded with 90 points which is like 90 of one night stay at a Sheraton in the US. Situation finally settled but still a very bad taste in my mouth. And yes there is more. The next night Saturday night after the Army Navy game concluded we were driving back to the hotel in a coachs vehicle which was covered for valet for the entire weekend at a team rate. When we got to the hotel it was packed and the valet door attendant said nobody could valet and that we had to park across the street. We told him several times that we were with the team and that valet was covered for the entire weekend which is when he told us that they over booked themselves and that a holiday party in progress at the hotel had taken all of the teams parking spots. Again just adding to the incompetence that went into the planning of this weekend the team had a contract for quite some time before the weekend. So we hop back into the car to go park across the street as the gentleman at the front instructed only to find out that that parking lot was full as well. And the one next to that. And the one next to that. So here we are supposed to meet up with coaches friends staff and players in the lobby of the hotel after the Navy win and we are stuck driving around a city we are not familiar with after our guaranteed parking is taken away from us because they over booked. We finally found another hotel Embassy Suites who was full but was kind enough to park us up front after we told him the situation Towne Park was the valet operator for both hotels for 10 on the premise that we retrieved the car before midnight. We then walked back several city blocks to our hotel to meet friends and family an hour late. Again I spoke to a manager possibly the valet manager at this point and told him he could send a person to go get the car because we were livid at this point and not dealing with it. They kindly agreed and apologized for the inconvenience and ultimately retrieved our car from the other hotel parked it and had it ready in the morning when we called. And they also gave us another 4 complimentary breakfast buffet passes. All in all I am appalled at how they over booked themselves and mostly mishandled the situation except for a few key people like the valet manager at Sheraton and the Concierge and manager I spoke with. In two years when the Army Navy game returns to Philadelphia I sincerely hope that the Sheraton Downtown is OUT of the equation.", "offset": [4812, 5071], "date": "2015-12-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "f12227c2-fbf9-4bb5-aadf-c2bfcaa9f578", "sentence": "Convenient.
