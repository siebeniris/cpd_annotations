The hotel has a great location on one of the main streets on the River. There were a couple of tour groups staying there during our visitThe carpets in the hotel are old stained and worn but clean throughout the halls and in the rooms. My room was larger than normal Eastern European hotels. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Towels are sufficient but a little thin. There were 3 or 4 holes in my curtains. There was a little mold in one spot of the bathromReceptionists were friendly and speak multiple languages fluently. I arrived to the hotel in the last evening and chose to eat there. I ate at Le Square and had soup club sandwich and fries. The people next to me were having fish and pork. My meal was excellent. The people next to me said theirs was also very good. It looked and smelled delicious. The staff in the restaurant was professional attentive and very friendly. I would eat there again. My breakfast was included. It was a breakfast buffet with an assortment of hot food eggs potatoes several meats etc cereals salads cold meats cheeses breads vegetables coffee teas juices etc. While the choices seemed a little limited I thought the food was tastyThe Main Stret River side of the hotel is a bit noisy. I recommend a room on the opposite side for a quieter room. I had a great price on this hotel. I think it was a good value for me when I consider the service and the price.", "offset": [1379, 1413], "date": "2015-04-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f93e3b49-0f45-4a22-8955-705ada4177ac", "sentence": "Rude receptionist good location. I reserved a room for 2 nights at this hotel via a third party website in January 2015. The third party website had somehow cancelled the reservation and so I asked whether I could pay for a room directly. The helpful female member of staff confirmed availability for the 2 nights and kindly offered me access to the hotels wifi to see if it was possible to reserve a room online for a cheaper price. After a short period of time I returned to the reception as I could not locate a cheaper rate. This time spoke to a male. The male receptionist told me that it was not possible to book a room. I noted with the male that his female colleague had only a matter of minutes earlier confirmed that there were rooms available. In response the male receptionist made a number of sarcastic hostile and rude remarks which naturally caused upset. Suddenly the female member of staff appeared and looked at her male colleague in disgust. This was not the welcome I had expected from this hotel brand. Regardless of the issue with the third party website the male receptionists behaviour towards me tainted my first stay in Bratislava as I was left to find alternative accommodation at 10 pm. I have a number of events throughout Europe over the next few months and will definitely give the Park Inn brand a miss due to the lack of basic customer service and manners which one would expect from an international hotel brand. However on a more positive note the hotel is in a good location opposite the Danube river and just across from the old town. In addition you can get a coach to Vienna 1 hour at 13euro return at the side of the hotel at the Novy Most bus station.", "offset": [239, 433], "date": "2015-05-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "ba973340-835c-4bad-9e0b-c1d3e5d6fd29", "sentence": "Nice hotel near Old town.

The hotel was once on of the most luxourios hotels in Bratislava. Now there are hotels like Kempinski or Sheraton so the Park Inn Danube has oldened a little. But the location is still perfect to explore the Old Town the hotel is in the pedestrian zone. Everything you need you find in the hotel i think there is even a swimming pool the rooms and good not too small and quite. I had an upgrade to a junior suite which was really ok. The prices are very very very good for Bratislava and the location. In some seasons you can book a room for about 50 Euros what is fantastic because it\u00b4s still a four star hotel with all amendities you need. Sheraton costs 25 times more. Very friendly and helpful General Manager who is Italian and does a great job. I recommend it especially if you don\u00b4t wo nt to spend 100 or 150 Euros for a hotel in the center i am sure i am staying here again. There\u00b4s a cosy cigar shop in the lobby the hotel itself is non smoking and cabs taxis available but you don\u00b4t need them to explore the town because to the castle it\u00b4s only a few minutes by foot.

We had two overnight stays here during our recent holiday in July 2015The hotel is very conveniently located right on Hviezdoslavovo namestie probably the biggest of the squares in Bratislavas old town. The term square here is a bit of a misnomer as Hviezdoslavovo namestie is more of a long mostly pedestrian boulevard lined with cafes restaurants bars and the like as well as some grand architecture like the Carlton Hotel the Opera House and the hall which is home to the national orchestra. Our first night was directly after arriving on our flight to Bratislava Airport we left the next morning on the train to Prague for four nights. The room we were allocated for our first night overlooked the hotels inner courtyard. The windows had full length shutters which could be closed to entirely block out the light and we had no problem at all with either light or noise and we slept very well. Our second overnight stay was five nights later on our return from Prague. This time the room had a view onto Most SNP with it is UFO bar and restaurant. though the view could not be appreciated fully as the front of the hotel is almost entirely covered with a mesh advertising KIA cars. Seems a bit bizare to compromise what could be one of the main selling points for this hotel but to be honest I am not complaining as the rates charged by the hotel give very good value and it probably keeps the insects outOne thing to note the air conditioning is centrally controlled and though our first night in the hotel was very comfortable on the second stay the air conditioning was either turned off or set to a very low level. The temperature outside was around 36 \u00b0 to 38 \u00b0 so perhaps the system was just not up to the task during this heatwave. In absolute terms breakfast was a bit below par but again at the price charged for the breakfast included room it was not an issue for me. Staff were all pleasant and efficient.

The beds were comfortable and nice clean bedding. The Breakfasts were very good with a large choice. If anyone complains about this then they must be very fussy. The Hotel offered a Gym and a pool to use free of charge. Hotel Receptionists were very helpful and were always happy to answer your questions.
