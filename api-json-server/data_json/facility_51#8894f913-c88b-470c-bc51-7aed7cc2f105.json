There are good things and bad things about hotels everywhere. But this place takes the cake. Never have I been to a hotel where I paid for cold showers unpredictable thermostats broken elevators management that decided maintenance staff should change the carpets outside the elevators in the middle of the day or paint the doorways of each room holding the ice machine on each floor at the same time. You kind of start to wonder. management do you have any sense. Who in their right minds orders the carpets to be replaced outside of the elevators IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. A co elevator rider getting off on the 3rd floor stepped out into the carpet glue that was spread out at 5 pm. This kind of maintenance should be done in low volume low traffic times like the middle of the night or after 10 pm. I tried to get a bucket of ice only one vending room with an ice machine is available on each floor. Mine was being painted and I was prevented from getting ice by the painter. So I go to the 2nd floor. that vending ice machine room is getting painted as well. I head now for a 3rd try to the 4th floor and I be damned. it is being painted as well. Just unbelievable. I was at this hotel for an extended period of time with a good part of it being unable to enjoy a decent shower. I thought I was not asking for much but nope apparently I was. I got the privilege to pay for ice cold showers. I was one of a long line of customers that complained. Some were offered the opportunity to change rooms others were offered the opportunity to take a hot shower in a room on the other side of the hotel I got offered a massage. Really. That is compensation in your mind for ice cold showers. How about what I paid for. A decent room with a thermostat that works and a shower with hot water. I just wanted what I paid for a basic decent working room of rest. Note that visiting cruise boats oil tankers research vessels and navy boats park outside of the hotel. So your water pressure in the shower will dwindle down to something like a pigeon spitting on you as these boats use the same water line to load up their tanks as the hotel. Also if you want an ocean view make sure its closer to the Rif Fort side of the hotel than the opposite side or all you will see are these boats and oil tankers outside your window balcony. Hotel has an all you can eat breakfast for about 280 bucks give or take a buck. If you eat like a horse then its worth it. If you are light breakfast eater. save your money and go to the Denys about 2 blocks away or the Starbucks on the corner by the theater. Note that there is a mandatory charge 15 service fee which is actually the communal tip fee that is collected and distributed to everyone from the cook the wait staff to probably the hostess. You can not avoid the mandatory tip charge but if your server was exceptional you might want to leave them some cash which they will be able to pocket for themselves. Pool area is interesting. You have a fresh seawater infinity pool with a sand bottom and tiny crabs inhabiting the retaining walls. Watch out or you might step on a turtle too. Then there is the adjacent standard infinity pool which has cooler crisper water. What is most interesting is both these pools are not on ground level but sit on the 2nd floor over a series of shops. So there is no real beach other than what has been trucked in and poured out on top of these shops. You have live palm tries and greenery. so its kind of odd and cool to be on a second story beach. This hotel does not have a sundry room. So if you need toothpaste run out of contact solution tampons or deodorant. you are out of luck unles you walk over to the Rif Fort to a shop called Zazo or something like that. Better make sure to get there when the store is open usually mid day because if you need any of these kind of products in the evening or early morning you are out of luck. There is no minimart or drugstore or anything of that nature nearby other than the Zazo place. I will say that the hotel staff at the front desk are very pleasant and try to be helpful. I found the doormen and bellhops to be out of this world kind and friendly and very down to earth. The staff that man the pool be it the towel lady or the staff at the polside grill all were very nice and pleasant and very friendly and informative. The problem is the hotel and the way it is run and maintained. This hotel is a Mariot ASSOCIATED hotel and not directly in itself a Mariot Hotel. So do not expect the same standard or quality that a true Mariot Hotel engenders. Note that a Mariot Courtyard is just approved to be built next door. maybe you will have luck there for your next visit.", "offset": [523, 632], "date": "2015-08-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2045d80b-7564-4393-bc65-e55124753336", "sentence": "This hotel has everything to please.

The Renaissance is in a convenient location very close to the restaurants shopping and attractions in Wilemstad. We walked to town every day during our 5 night stay and it typically took 10mins to walk from the hotel lobby and across the bridge.

Everything worked lots of outlets US type. NY USA TV channels which was both amusing and interesting given we are from TX. Maid service was prompt and regular even over the weekend. Quality coffee maker in the room. also a small fridge. The infinity pool is worth a visit. But to be honest we went only once as we came to Curacao intent on spending time exploring the beaches near Westpunt versus staying by the hotel pool. We rented our car from Justdrive Curacao so the free parking at the hotel worked out well. The lot was often full on the lower levels so allow extra minutes for the solitary elevator to take you to from the higher levels. The staff were very helpful and friendly but the lobby still felt a bit sterile and unwelcoming despite their hospitality. We ate out all the time at local restaurants so can not comment on the hotel food. Also did not venture into the Casino but it seemed busy. However it did contribute to the definite odor of cigarette smoke near the elevators.
