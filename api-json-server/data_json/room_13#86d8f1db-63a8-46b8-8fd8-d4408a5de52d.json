I will admit I was hesitant to stay here after reading some of the reviews but I booked through a third party so I was stuck. My son and I arrived around 130 on Saturday March 12th. Our room was not available yet but I explained that we had an event that were attending and we needed to get in our room to shower and get cleaned up. She found us a clean room in a couple of minutes and we were on our way. I had called a couple of days before to request a fridge and microwave. She explained the room should have one but if not they would bring it right up. The room did not have one when we arrived but as we were leaving after we checked in I told her and she said she would take care of it ASAP. When we came back everything had been set up and plugged in and someone had put in my water and juice into the fridge to keep it cold. The room the room looked recently remodeled and it was very clean. And I mean very clean. I am very very picky about cleanliness and will walk out of a hotel if it is not clean. Our room was immaculate the sheets and towels were very clean and white. no stains and the bed was super comfortable. No stains on the carpet or curtains and the bathroom was especially clean. Shower pressure was not the greatest and it took a while for the water to warm up but atleast it was clean and there was enough counter space for all my stuff. The WIFi worked great and there was enough cable channels to keep both of entertained. Overall I was very pleased with the room. Now my issues. One the first night we were there. I had left some trash in a bag beside the trash can because there was not any room left in the trash can. When we returned the trash was still sitting on the floor and the bathroom trash did not get emptied at all for two days. Also room service trays sat out in the hallway for two days before they were cleared. The trays were not mine but belonged to the customer in the room across from us And I know it was the same tray. It was gross and it was starting to smell. The room was always clean as was the bathroom but the trash kept getting left behind. Second issue we had was the key cards. The cards would just quit working for whatever reason. But one night we arrived at the hotel at close midnight and our cards would not work. I had to go back down twice to get the cards reprogramed. The third time I went back down the front desk clerk stated she would have to get security to let us into the room. So we had to wait by our door for 15 min while he went and let other guests into their rooms as they were having the same issues as well He commented the locks were old and needed to be replaced and I agree with him. Please replace the locks as soon as possible. The pool did not appear to be open but it was too cool anyway. I did not use the restaurant or bar so I can not comment on that. The lobby was clean and there were luggage cards readily available as well. The parking lot is not big enough for the amount of cars I saw during our four night stay. Every night when we would return we had a hard time finding parking. We had to park around the back by the pool just about every night with the exception of one night. The only reason I would not stay here again is because there in nothing in terms of food and shopping around the hotel. The front desk directed us to a Taco Bell down the street on JFK but there did not seem to much down JFK either just more hotels. There was no street noise coming into the hotel and that was a plus for me. I was able to get downtown in about 25 minutes. Close to IAH and they do offer a shuttle from what I saw.", "offset": [417, 489], "date": "2016-03-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "e4adc83e-b8bc-4ddd-831f-7e9e7c41445f", "sentence": "Nice room and pool.", "offset": [0, 19], "date": "2016-07-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "5bda3e87-df8c-4fc5-82f4-b411311d1c97", "sentence": "The room was very nice and check in was super easyThe ac was out in the lobby The restaurant had a limited menu and one woman that was in management kept giving us dirty looks for no reason.", "offset": [0, 190], "date": "2016-07-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "e82e132a-cd93-4d5a-91b9-b043c357237c", "sentence": "Great location near IAH airport.

I give it 3 stars out of 5 for this rated 3 star hotel. While the location is convenient to the airport I was surprised just how loud air traffic is in out. I have stayed at hotels that are physically closer but yet rooms were much quieter both to external noise and noise from nearby rooms. In fact sitting in my room as I type this review I can hear my neighbor talking on the phone well enough to almost tell you what he is saying verbatim. Check in was rather fast and ok but going to my room I quickly realized why the hotel was available at such a discount it apparently has not been updated since 197. The room has some crazy striped carpet with a love seat and office chair that one might find at a Salvation Army store. The desk area was fairly large though and was nice for working at for the things I needed to finish up after getting in from work.
