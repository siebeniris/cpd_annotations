The rooms were very comfortable and quiet with very nice amenities. First rate bedding well appointed bathrooms and a huge flat screen wall mounted over a desk for winding down at the end of a gaming day. There are a number of dining options available covering various tastes. The casino is moderately sized. The only drawback for us was SLS somewhat isolated location farther north on The Strip. We are used to the south Strip hotels where you can easily walk or take comp trams between multiple casino properties. With one member of our party having mobility issues we found it easier to valet between sites than to take the backroad Las Vegas Monorail MGM Grand to SLS Las Vegas.

I had heard stories of bankruptcy at the SLS and was weary that would lead to a negative experience. I was so so wrong. The hotel is not on the central strip but it provided a shuttle service to the Fashion Mall which is at the center of the strip. Plus they are located by the monorail. Everyone from valet service to bell service to staff at the SLS was so friendly and polite and always with a smile. The line to check in was a bit long but it moved along rather nicely. The clerk at check in I believe her name was Taisha or something with a Ta beginning. She was super sweet and patient with us and very knowledgeable. The room they gave us was gorgeous. and even though the view was not of the strip itself it was still gorgeous. The bed was so comfortable and the rooms clean and spacious. We had a suite on the 28th floor. A bit high so the elevators took awhile and since it was fan expo week it was busy. We ate at 80 degree pizza and it was so good. The Foxtail Night Club is a must.

Let me start by saying that Las Vegas has many top tier hotel casino properties. Thus the market is very competitive. The SLS desires to be in this top tier group but it is clear that not enough money was spent developing the property to achieve this objective. The SLS is trying hard to overcome these limitations by a modern chic decorating style that to me just felt cheap. The hotel is located at the end of the strip which means a taxi or the monorail if you want to go anywhere else. Rooms are small and starkly decorated compared to top tier Las Vegas properties Wyn Venetian Belagio encore. Even the lux tower which is their best accommodations is underwhelming. On the positive side the Beds are comfortable and flat screen tv s are large. Wifi also worked well in the hotel. If you have a lot of clothing there is no dresser or closet in your room. There is a coat rack type shelving unit with small drawers in the bathroom area. Room decor is a stark black and white. Towels and bath amenities in the lux tower were good. The Food is very good reasonably priced for a hotel property and the variety of choices is excellent. Room service was quick for breakfast. Casino dealers were friendly and helpful. Casino is small by Vegas standards but ironically not very busy. Availability of 10. Tables was a surprise for novice gamblers. Service was better than expected given the minimalistic decor of the property. The meeting space is very good and the convention services were generally excellent. Ironically the meeting space seemed to be the most upscale part of the hotel. The lux tower part of the hotel is very clean and we frequently saw staff cleaning public areas. Lastly not having a 24 hour fitness facility is a negative. The gym opens at 6 am which for those on east coast time is very late. Overall the hotel was good for a business convention meeting but lacks the luxury appeal of many of the high end Vegas properties that are available. Note The property is no longer affiliated with Hilton so no Honors perks or points are available. We were told that the Lux tower was sold to Starwod so stay tuned on what that will mean to this hotel.", "offset": [1603, 1699], "date": "2015-12-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "57e6dcde-b80e-467a-ab46-02485139748c", "sentence": "Nice Property Marginal Location.

I have a new friend in SLSWe arrive early and were upgraded to a suite in the LUX tower by a super friendly front desk person. We asked if it were true no coffee in the room and she said yes no coffee in the room. And then she did something incredible. She gave us 2 drink coupons for coffee at Perq. How cool is that. Talk about taking care of your guests. She sure did. The suite was not ready for another hour so we asked for a regular room to start our date night. Within minutes we were in our tiny but really cool room. This room was very tiny. We have a huge house so a small room in a cool hotel was not a problem. But the bass I was hearing from the next room was. I called the front desk and they said they would investigate the noise. I prepared mentally for a long night of bass from our neighbors. I had images of me calling the front desk at 2 am in anger about the noise. Panic struck. But surprisingly after about 20 minutes the bass was no more and I did not hear a thing the rest of the night or morningWe left the room and walked to the monorail for our trek into town to see our friends in Shotspeare at Planet Hollywood go see it. 1 each way for locals on the monorail. 4 round trip for the wife and I. Awesome. Oh yeah before we left we joined the players club and won 12 on some strange slot machine. Not a bad start. I am confident SLS can handle the loss ok. After our nightly adventures were complete we zipped back to our room on the monorail and prepared for sleep. Uh the bed was missing the sheets. There was a comforter only. That was a first for us. But we were tired and in no mood to complain. We fell asleep. The LUX tower was gorgeous. The elevators were spotless. The hallways dark and moody. As I mentioned our room was the size of a closet but the shower was HUMONGOUS. We had a peek at the room next to us and it was huge so not all the rooms are small. The room was very well done and comfortable. The view from the 21st floor was very nice. Interesting choice having a mirror on the ceiling. Lots of amenities in the bathroom. Very comfortable towels. You know how people always say \u201c this robe is so comfortable \u201d. Well the robe in this room was incredibly comfortable. No joke. Probably top 5 of robes I have tried on and I have tried on a lot of robes over my 45 years. Not even a huge robe fan but this robe was comfy.

After a THIRTY MINUTE WAIT IN LINE they offer to put us on one floor for the night and then we can change rooms tomorrow. Elevator talk with other guests and the same thing happened to them. Tell registration we will wait for our non smoking room so we do not have to move floors. So 1 12 hours later no call from the check in so I have to stand in line again for another 20 minutes and finally room is ready. WEED If you do n\u2019t like it make sure they do n\u2019t put you on the 10th floor of the World Tower. I can not explain how badly this hotel reeked of weed smokers. Booked a non smoking room first thing noted upon entry is an ashtray. The whole floor smells like pot. Smacks you in the face. We were already late for meeting friends because of the very long wait for the room. Heavy weed smokers in every room. is not smoking weed still smoking. I have allergies. Decide we will deal with it later friends are only in town tonight. Walk to monorail and the benches immediately outside the hotel on the way there are a weed smoking hang out. Stinks. Next morning notice there is stuff missing from the Saints and Sinners box there is still that ashtray. S S box is snacks. Did n\u2019t want to get charged for missing items or smoking in a non smoking room. Call front desk explained issues. I was told ALL ROOMS are non smoking there is separate company that handles the S S box they wo n\u2019t be in until 1030 am We decide to wait for the S S Person no one shows. We get on with our life. Notice an ashtray trash right next to the elevators. Super long story abbreviated on Day 4 we decide to talk to front desk and are told the 10th floor is ALL smoking. Explained our reservation was non and our conversation on Day 1 with front desk at check in and my call down when we actually got to the room. Manager Pamela took off resort fees but she was also very curt. She did not care at all about making us happy. Guess this happens a lot there or the company decides to hire disgruntled staff to begin with. Did not see one happy worker there. RESORT FESWhat is a resort fee. I have stayed in an all inclusive resort and received free drinks and food as part of the resort fees. NOTHING is free here. No complimentary drinks no discounts to anything. This is a made up fee that results in no benefits to the guest. What am I supposed to enjoy by paying this. It basically is an extra fee for the use of the hotel which I have paid for by paying for the hotel. DECORElevator talk again. Guests agree this place is creepy. Does the hotel know that black shows every oily handprint on the doors and the white walls and furniture show every stainBlack walls with pink at the top. Door numbers in multiple fonts. Disembodied body parts as lobby decor on ceiling. Elevator entrance is a fun house of mirrors. Guests keep each other from turning the wrong way off the elevator so we do not smack into the walls. Giant mirrors just kind of everywhere on the premises. Furniture by Wonder Woman goes with her invisible jet clear and until you walk up to it or see the fingerprints you do n\u2019t know it is there. Anyone else think the large statute in the front looks like a five year old got bored playing with play doh and quit and someone made it into a giant statue. Enjoy finding the business center it is like falling down the rabbit hole in McGes Alice In Wonderland. Giant Black and Red Stripes with clocks on the wall at different times. BATHROOM and CLEANLINESPor design. Open the shower door and you can not help but drip water everywhere. Toilet paper is 80 grit. Bathroom picture looks like a large poster for a lost glove. Having been moved to another room now I know there are just ugly stencils on every bathroom. Had to check my husband for blood as the towels had red stains on them. Dried blood. Yuck. Was n\u2019t his. Beyond gross. ROMFlor to ceiling mirrors. No coffee maker fridge or drawers. 12 hangers. My stuff is draped on luggage and chairs. Desk another open surface to place items on. One drawer holds a safe. You can leave your clothes on the shelves next to the mini fridge. Found the luggage stand as we were leaving because black furniture is easily camouflaged by the black walls. No comfort. First room had a chair tucked into the corner second one did n\u2019t. You do not want to stay in this room and rest up or have some peace and quiet from the Vegas Strip. LOCATIONClose to monorail. CVS across street. FODOverpriced. Wana pay 100 for two hamburgers and three drinks. May I recommend the Northside Cafe. While we were in the Northside Cafe staff decided they needed to clean the giant pipe that goes across the top of the dining area tables. 1 am yes. but this is Vegas. They have to drive in this scissor lift and it beeps very loudly when it moves. The Northside Cafe had great acoustics and the lift driver was inexperienced and our whole dinner was loud. Continuous BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP as he tried to position it. Terrible idea people. Why not just close the cafe for an hour so guests do not have to hear that or cover our food while you clean above us. Katsuya Japanese restaurant. Highly recommend their Social Hour and the Kiwi Envy drinks. Still going to cost you. IN ROOM DININGPrices on in room dining seemed decent we were tired. Called to order told there will be a 5 delivery fee okay sales tax not unexpected and an 18 gratuity. Hey you pay for convenience right. Tried to place our order. Told we were on the wrong menu. Menu is on the TV. Could n\u2019t scroll through and find the dinner menu just the late night menu. I get dressed and to to the Northside Cafe since that is where the menu is for. Food prices are 3 to 5 LOWER in the actual restaurant for each item. So in room dining RAISED the prices added a delivery fee AND wanted 18 gratuity. WOW. PIPE BURSTSMonorail stops at 2 am Get back to room around 1 am Second night in a row the water has been turned off. Call down still working on pipe. Unknown when water will be turned on. First night understood they did n\u2019t know they would have to shut it off. Second night how about some notice. People are up between midnight and 3 am in Vegas. A note under the door a sign on the entryway. Why could n\u2019t the staff do this. As the second person who tried to use the bathroom upon our return from the night out it was annoying that I could n\u2019t flush the toilet or take a shower. Vegas is hot and I could n\u2019t brush my teeth shower or have a clean toilet because the staff could n\u2019t take the time to let guests know about the turned off water. ETC. STORE GOODs StoreI thought this was still under construction. It is not. The walls really are bare particle board. What is with the weird decor in this hotel. Cashier at the Etc. store was the the first nice person we met. Unsurprisingly she does n\u2019t work for SLS the ETC. store is someone else. Sales Lady at the Goods Store was also very nice and chatty. Alas this is where all friendliness ends. CASINOBoring. Dark. did not play here because it was always dead and quite. LYFT UBERCouldn\u2019t see the street names from the hotel entrances there are THREE entrances. Asked a clerk for directions to Uber he was not sure and told us one side of the hotel our Uber was at the other. We could not sprint across the hotel fast enough and were charged a 5 cancellation fee. We noted that on Friday they put out a small sign that indicated Uber lyft that a way but there were two exits to choose from in that direction. Not helpful and could barely see the sign. PLAIDThe people wearing the plaid jackets. Security. Not the worst uniform I \u2019ve seen. WI FIWas there wifi. No instructions in hotel room to use nothing on keycard or in room. OVERALNot a good birthday. Turned 40 and this place was a lousy choice to stay. I was in direct contact with the SLS regarding our issues while we were there and they did n\u2019t care at all.
