We love the sound of the ocean off the beach and do not care if we can sit near it. so for us it was ok that their beach in front of the hotel was crowded and narrow. There is a sandy area around the pool that sits up on the cliffs so we can feel the breeze and walk on sand and hear the ocean w the option for a salt free splash at the pool perfect. However the layout of the pool is ridiculous. If you are in the sandy non beach front you really can not get to the pool unles you go back to the beach bar. And while the pool is fairly large w multiple levels an infinity ending you can not walk around the pool there are 2 access points in my opinion plus one off the small path from the fitness area. Plus the end of the infinity pool is leaking ALOT which made it easy to use this overflow for washing off your feet. Based on the menu and prices we knew better than to dine here plus the reviews helped sway our decisions but we did grab a few cocktails at the main beach bar mixed experiences here. First time we had very quick attentive service next time I had to ask for the menu and after handing it to me she walked away from the bar. literally. no one there to take my order for 5 minutes. we walked to the second bar by the lobby no one there either. This is at around 130 in the am Needless to say we started bringing our own cocktails to the pool. The manager reception for Honors members was nice and they mgt genuinely cares and takes pride in their property. Karen at the executive floor greeted us by name after one visit always with a smile and compliment and so much happiness she was just awesome. We did receive an upgrade at check. in once I inquired about access to the Honors floor which was a very nice pleasant surprise. Other than the beach bar snafu I did not experience any poor service by reception or hospitality. The grounds are really spread out which would be fine if they had a nicely groomed accessible path but to go between the beaches you view the VERY neglected mini golf and what appeared to be dormitory housing. Paths are not maintained and had weeds as well. Resort was not at all crowded few children so it was nice for relaxing around the pool. Easy drive to the airport we rented a car to avoid the shuttle hassle and taxi cost. See my review of Prins for more on that. Excellent choice We walked to Pirate Bay and Tomatoes for dinner a few times. Great pizza at Tomatoes. The casino at the Hilton is super small and run down also but seemed to stay very busy w the local folks. Tip you will need to goto the fitness room to get your beach towel. Cocktails in the executive lounge are very reasonable. Snacks are limited and some people seem to treat this as their dinner so go early. If you face the ocean the bar below and any bands will be heard in your room. which is nice when you are sitting on your deck but not nice when the bass is thumping at 1 am.", "offset": [1340, 1438], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "81df1752-587c-4ff0-bc67-f6a8c1bda733", "sentence": "Housekeeping Lunches.

My husband and I visited this property April 30May 7 2016 for what we thought would be a relaxing vacation. For multiple reasons it was not so. I will begin with the GOOD. Karen the Guest Ambassador is excellent. She was always there to check on us and to provide whatever she could to make our stay comfortable. Azucena the Housekeeper is one of the best housekeepers I have ever seen. She not only anticipates the needs of guests but provides for same. Wonderful wonderful service from her. The pool is peaceful and lovely. Uncrowded with exceptions that I will address later. The lounge chairs are clean and comfortable. Water at the small beach is clear and calm great for swimming and snorkeling. Executive lounge is very nice with nice amenities. Service there is wonderful. Petcha was great answering our questions. All staff encountered were friendly and genuinely tried to be helpful. The Mediocre The beach is white sand but it is not powdery. it is packed down hot and rocky. In my experience soft powdery sand can be difficult to walk in unles you know how from doing it often. One could walk on this beach in heels. Water shoes sandals are needed even to walk to a chair on the beach. The lounges on the beach are old and dirty. The beach area can be hot and humid as the breeze does not seem to blow through here as it does at the pool. We stayed in room 401 which is directly under the executive lounge. Views were wonderful and the room was clean. Granted furniture is old but then I have seen this many times in beach hotels. Bathrooms are spacious but have no storage room for items such as make up bags hair dryers curling straightening irons or anything really. A hand held hair dryer is provided. There is an unlit magnifying mirror that seemed to me to be a 3x magnifier. I bring my own anyway so this was not an issue. There is only one electrical outlet we were able to use being from the US not sure of the terminology. The other outlet is Type F for European appliances. Either way there is only one outlet in the bathroom. Room service is not good. Food arrives cold and sometimes uncovered. Concierge service is poor. We were actually discouraged from shopping in Curacao. The UNACCEPTABLE. There is no pool or beach service for drinks or food that we saw the entire week we were here. There are only four frozen drinks listed on the menus at both beach bars. Bartenders make these inconsistently and most times incorrectly. If you request something different like a Mudslide that is standard at most beach hotels you have to instruct the bartender how to make it. This hotel sells day passes to locals on holidays and weekends. On those days the pool and beach are overrun with screaming rowdy children from morning to night. Even though there are POOL RULES and BEACH RULES listed with signage in two languages the rules are consistently and continuously broken. Security seems to turn a blind eye to this disruption. We and others complained about this with no resultant improvement. If you are considering this hotel check the holiday dates AND they do vary from year to year. I intended to list them but can not as they change. We learned this the hard way as the hotel does not provide this information anywhere. No one seems to be in charge here. We spoke with several Assistant Managers but never spoke to a Manager as one was never available. In summary this could be a great place to stay but due to lack of management inept employees and what seems to be a general lack of concern by Hilton it currently is not.", "offset": [1395, 1462], "date": "2016-05-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "84e8d3e3-2289-45c5-804c-bf3995295c89", "sentence": "Too noisy for people who need sleep rather than partying.

We just returned from a few days at the Hilton in Curacao. I am a very loyal Hhonors member so was excited to see I could use my points and a minimal amount in Curacao. I have highlighted the pros and cons of the property below. Pros. Check in was very easy and the people at the front desk were very nice. They answered questions and provided suggestions on what to do and where to go it was New Years Eve. The beach although quite small is very beautiful. It has a secluded feel and the water is by far the most clear and serene I have ever been in. The grounds of the hotel are also very nice. It seems like it is almost situated on a cape you can walk the path around the hotel and the ocean wraps around it. There are iguanas everywhere which we thought was pretty cool. The hotel is also compact which we liked we never had to walk far to get what we needed. ConsThis hotel is expensive. there is no other way to say it. The first thing we did was order a beer it was only 7 oz. and came to 850. I suppose we are used to staying all inclusive. The food is also VERY expensive. The food. What can I say about the food. Meh. There are three places to order food two outside and one inside. However the inside restaurant was never open when we were there. You can order your basic food pizza burgers tacos. We ordered two tiny fish tacos with no sides 15. I would not complain as much about the prices if the food tasted a bit better. Although the beach was really pretty they did not have a beach butler or waiter. Everytime we wanted another 7 oz beer we had to walk back up to the bar those tiny beers go fastThe pool was just ok. it was full of leaves and debris so we did not stay in it long. Overall I think I would stay there again if I had to. we were just so shelshocked by the prices of everything. The rooms were comfortable and there was a casino onsite which was fun. Definitely do some research before you decide on this hotel in Curacao.", "offset": [486, 579], "date": "2017-01-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "afc576b7-9ba7-4814-a17c-aab7be10712d", "sentence": "Good beach and pool. Let me start with one thing. Hilton needs a renovation but it is not that bad that you should avoid the place. Two weeks at the hotel the first two weeks in may. In the weeks there were very few people in the hotel and the hotel area. At weekends a bit more. Check in was quick and no problem. I did ask for a map over the island there were no maps at all. These came some days later. As a hotel you should never ran out of maps. We had a room with a balcony to the seaside. It was a larger room. As I wrote in the top the room need some new paint at some spots roof needs to be checked up curtains should be change more often. Carpets have stains lamp has spots bedshet was torn and so on. The bathroom also needed some paint and a check up. It is n\u2019t that bad that you want to change room. After a week we did find a small note on the window behind the curtain it was n\u2019t allowed to hang your clothes in the balcony. You need to use the clothes line in the bathroom which could n\u2019t be found. Yes you need to secure your clothes if you hang them at the balcony. Under the balcony there is a restaurant with tables so you can easily figure out those clothes can fly away in the wind and land on someone \u2019s table. At check in they should tell everyone about the rules at the balcony. The door in to the room is very thin. So you can hear people in the hallway and also when people slam the doors. In our two weeks twice they had a delay to clean the room the room was not cleaned at all that day we decide to not call for clean up. I do know why but as I said before it was very few people at the hotel. That should n\u2019t happen. The pool area has a few parasols. It should be more it should be that sort that you easily can handle it yourself. A big hotel like this must have more parasols to their guests. In the weeks we could be alone at the pool area. It was not much people in the beach area either. Weekends were more people out to have fun. Watch out for bird \u2019s spills they do n\u2019t wash the sun chairs so often. They should do this every day. There is leaf in the pool but it varies when they clean the pool. Nothing that bothered us when I went in the pool I did pick it up. At a regular time the staff takes water samples in the pool. That is very good. However the pool staff is more interested in their mobile phones then clean the pool or around it. This could be handling much better cleaning the pool chairs and pick up trash left at the pool. There are three restaurants. First of all room service we tried it twice and it is not worth the money. You can save money and get better food if you go down starts and get something to go. Hilton room service usually have a high standard but this was not good at all. The beach bar had good food. The same with blights bar. The Italian restaurants are more expensive but it is worth it. One thing was a bit troubling some days it took a long time for food get out from the kitchen. And with so few guest it is not ok. The staff could also do a little small talk with each other while guest were waiting and that is not ok at all. The menus are ok but it should be more variation on the smaller dishes to that high price. Breakfast is served at aqua restaurant. I was amazed that staff rather did talk to each other than serve guest. A couple of times I had walk up and order tea instead of waiting for them to come. And again very few guests. There are birds and stray cats trying to steal food. Why. Because guest feed them from time to time. That is not good you do n\u2019t want a bird on the table. At check in you should be informed to not feed the animals and some signs should be put up. The hotels location is some minutes out from the city by car and it is a small city. There are buses from the hotel to the city. Remember you ca n\u2019t take the bus in the morning and take the bus back on the afternoon. You need to decide if you want to be there in the morning or afternoon. We did n\u2019t bother to look up the local bus. We did rent a car. Budget car rental has an office at premises. We had a car at two different occasions total of three days. We went up to Boka Tabla the flamingos and some beaches. When you rent a car remember to go to the supermarket and pick up some drinks and other supplies. Cause there is not a supermarket close to the hotel. I did see it on the map at home but I did a test and asked at arrival. According to the hotel staff you could go by foot not that far. That is not true. You need to pass a shopping mall before you get there. Sidewalks are missing half the way and you will be walking with traffic on one side. In that heat it is not worth it you need a car. There is a corner shop at the hotel but it is expensive as all hotel shops are. The beach is hidden from the strong winds. You can swim over the next beach that is public. The beach outside Mariot are also available for Hilton guest however when the wind is strong there is nothing that shields this beach. Their gym is very new. They have many machines and weights so there are one big plus. They also have two tennis courts. You can rent a racket for 5 dollar however the court also needs an update. You can play but both courts have a hole and there were cat spilling one side. It ca n\u2019t be said enough if you have guest you need to be on top of things. Summary If you have stayed at Hilton hotels in Asia do n\u2019t compare it because this is not near that. This Hilton feels like it does n\u2019t have found its heart yet. The tourism has n\u2019t bloomed out yet. This hotel can be so much more it has a big potential. I overheard a staff conversation and they get complaints from the guest but nothing happens. The management needs to address the renovation and kitchen food staff. The competition is only getting stronger. The neighbour hotel Mariot is now closed for renovation and opens January 2018. The best with this hotel are the pool and beach so close to each other. Would I stay here again. No not when Mariot is opened again. If Hilton makes some changes then yes I would. Would I recommend it now. Yes but you have to do research and look at the map.", "offset": [1552, 1623], "date": "2017-05-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "81a22917-fbc3-41c6-a166-511e146e69d9", "sentence": "Worst Hilton EVER.

The location was only about 5 miles from town but it was a 60 round trip taxi ride. 2 shuttles leave the hotel every day but only 11 people are allowed on each shuttle and it does not run weekends.

There was a trail of crumbs or something in the hallway and those same crumbs were in the hall for 5 days before they vacuumed. Got to our room even more musty smelling so bad that clothes I did not wear I had to wash when I came home because they smelled musty. We had to ask for wash clothes as none were in the room. One day they forgot to give us a shower floor mat I used a towel. Had to have something as mold was around shower tiles and even the door hinges on the bathroom door showed rust. The beach is very rocky and you have to go out a good 10 feet to get to a nice sandy area. The beach next door is nice and sandy so it is not just that the cove collects rocks.

As others have stated property has just recently been renovated. The property is beautiful and the staff was friendly. We booked our trip through AA vacations and paid extra for a beach view with private balcony. When we checked in we got a room with a view of a parking lot and play ground. We could see the ocean only by standing on the balcony so partial view at best. I am a titanium a Mariot member so I requested another room. The general manager was very nice and moved us to a room on the 4th floor with a full beach view. I was told that this was a common issue and that I needed to ask for \u201c front view \u201d in the future. The rooms were nice clean and fairly large. There were no robes or water in the rooms which is fairly standard for most resort properties. We also did not get maid service one day and our request for towels was ignored. I really liked the property and service overall but there were two things that bothered me. 1 the breakfast. As a titanium member I opted for the breakfast option. There seemed to be no knowledge as to how the breakfast coupon should work. I got one coupon for 2 persons to be used for my entire stay. The waitresses either wanted to take the coupon each time then billed us for the full amount and told me i needed to go to the front desk and get the charges removed. The service was also not great considering it \u2019s a buffet. In other places I have stayed you get a bill with the credit applied so that you can leave a gratuity. My biggest complaint was the gift shop. There are mosquitos in Curacao and bringing bug spray is advised. We forgot ours and had to get from the gift shop. They charged us 36 USD for bug spray. You could buy this in town for 11 USD so essentially a 300 mark up.

In room refrigerator and Nespreso machine\u2022 2 pools family pool for wading and an adult pool for swimming laps\u2022 Plenty of beach pool lounge chairs but if you want shade you need to be on the beach by 80 to \u201c reserve \u201d your spot with towels and personal items. The Cons\u2022 European style electrical outlets. If you live in the US bring adapters\u2022. No upgrades or recognition for Gold VIP member maybe gold level is too low for them to notice\u2022. House keeping service was spotty. One day we came back from the beach at 530 to see the maid just starting to clean our room. We had to wait on the balcony for 45min for her to finish before we could shower\u2022. Our coffee machine broke and I called for a replacement which never came. I needed to call again the next day and they finally sent one\u2022. On the last day we arranged a later checkout. When we returned to our room shortly after 120 the key did n\u2019t work. I went down to the desk and they had no record of our late checkout. After 10 minutes of \u201c looking \u201d they could not reactivate my key so someone from the front desk needed to walk to my room to let me in.", "offset": [993, 1037], "date": "2020-03-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "cb59628b-5693-4cc9-903b-f4c2380e04a1", "sentence": "Covid19 Spring Break 2020. We flew out to the Dutch Caribbean island ahead of the global shutdown. We arrived at the gorgeous hotel and had the most relaxing time. The island shutdown a week after we left however we enjoyed the island so much. It is worth the money. The hotel staff is so nice and attentive. The property is new and they did not spare any expense at renovating it. Private beach pool and access to the blue waters of the Caribbean. We will return when this pandemic goes away for we did not enjoy all that the hotel and island has to offer.", "offset": [449, 557], "date": "2020-03-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}]}
