After falling in love with this resort last year we knew we would be hard pressed to come up with something we liked as much. We looked at everything from Aruba to the Virgin Islands to the Dominican Republic to Ponce. In the end we kept coming back to the Gran Melia and we went back and boy are we glad we didThroughout the year I would read bad reviews on line and think Maybe we were looking at it through rose tinted glasses and things were not as wonderful as we thought. Wel all that was put to rest upon out arrival at the resort. There in the Red Level lounge was Josue a resort butler and the finest young man we encountered on our previous trip. His demeanor sincerity and service was and happily still is impeccable. He attended to our needs arranged for dinner reservations for us advised us about day trips to nearby Culebra Island and provided his number for anything we mighty want for during our stay. Everywhere on the property the staff smiled and said hello and were of the friendliest sort. I had been in contact with Yamilis Ruiz the attentive Red Glove Service Manager prior to our visit and was greeted with this warmest phone message welcoming us. She also called several times during our visit to check up on us which was very much appreciated. For those trying to decide if this is the place for them. breathtaking beauty small but swimable beach yes it has rocks and shells and some ocean plant life. buy some 15 Ocean shoes and you will be fine and no night life to speak of. This is an oasis of calm and beauty hammocks all along the beach and that constant breeze that makes it so you never get too hot and so soothing that I never once put my headphones on to listen to music. Red Level upgrade is the way to go. It includes a daily plentiful breakfast buffet at Cafe Soleil and lots of great smiles and attentive service especially from servers Lisa Jeante Eliomar and David and omelet maker extraordinaire Paola. The manager was also very attentive and we told her how pleased we were with the service. Make sure to reserve your Bali bed included with Red Level each day. Josue and Tony were extremely attentive at the adults only Red Level pool. The HUGE regular pool complete with columns and fountains is open 24 hours a day which is a very nice perkThe 3 onsite restaurants plus Cafe Soleil where breakfast is served daily and lunch and dinner buffets are served several days a week are all very good. Lots of people say they are too pricey but you can get entrees for under 20 which is certainly reasonable for resort dining. Try the mofongo at Passion and the filet mignon or oso buco at Tempo. Our room was lovely and housekeeping checked on us at least a few times a day.

Kasey at the Avenue Bar was also outstanding. What I did not like was the beach. It was rocky and seaweed filled. It was not a beach that you could take a walk on. The room service was uneven. My room was not made up twice when I returned from the pool at 430 PM. A couple of times we only received one set of towel and another day there were no face clothes. The service at the Wet Bar was slow and on one day I ordered lunch to go. I stupidly did not check my order until I got back to the Red Level pool and found that I received two sandwiches when I only ordered one. I was charged for both too.

A lot of people use the pool and I can understand. The room After we checked in and the red level front desk and got our bands these banks are supposed to be like the all inclusive bands but they are more like a cool tropical bracelet we went to our rooms. We had gotten two rooms and had requested that they be near each other but they were able to get us anything to close. It was not to much of an inconvenience and it was a blessing in disguise we probably we have been at each others throats had we been in an adjoining room. We checked in to our room and was greeted by a hot blast of air dirty cup on the dresser and a wet couch. It had felt like the people had literally just checked out of the room. We had planned on going down to the bar that night but it has started raining pretty hard and we decided to just stay in and watch some TV. Well then we find out the TV does not work. We called down to the red level front desk and they were able to move us into something a little better on the second story of a different building. Though we lost our spot right next to the red level pool I would do anything for some AC. The second room was much better but still very hot. It was the common theme of Puerto Rico though. Throughout the week we had our TV quit working and our safe quit working. The staff at Gran Melia was very nice and sent someone out as soon as possible each time we had an issue. We were not there to watch TV but when the drink prices at the bar are 7 a beer we decided to get a couple six packs off the resort and drink them in the room while watch the NBA finals. The staff Everyone seemed extremely nice and courteous at the Gran Melia. I feel like I never had to open a door because there was always someone there to open it. The front desk people were great and the bartenders in the red level lounge were very nice. While drinking during the complimentary happy hour they gave us great recommendations on where to go. Overall I might stay here again if the price is right would be nice to find somewhere with some better ofsite dining options.

While the common areas were mostly acceptable except the tennis courts we found our room bldg 7 to be tired worn and in dire need of updating. Peeling wallpaper soiled sofas sliding doors not working properly should not go unnoticed by staff and should be reported repaired or replaced. This lack of attention to basic hotel maintenance by house keeping was equal to the clear disinterest demonstrated by several other members of staff Avenue bartenders front desk associates and pool attendants in particular. Your staff represents your hotel and brand and is your main point of contact with your guests. Having them enjoy interacting with guests with courtesy and respect is clearly a must in your industry. Sadly this was lacking. More robust recruiting and training should be considered Dinner at Tiempo exceeded expectations for quality of food wine list service atmosphere.

Deposit I understand all hotels have security deposits but this one was a huge surprise to me as it was a 500 deposit on a credit card they expect upfront. They do return this after your stay but again it was just very unexpected. The resort credit that was included is a form of a coupon book. The rooms were very humid and smelled of mildew.

From the moment you enter pass the security gate thing nothing screams welcome to our resort. it is pretty open land with some palm trees here and there but nonetheless i look past all that and continue driving. The actual resort hotel I am going to call this a hotel from here on out is about 5 10 mins after the gate gate attendant just told me to keep on driving. When you pull up to the hotel you notice a sense of emptiness. There is two parking lot one valet and one self parking both with hardly any cars but the valet was ready to open the door and get the bags. The main hotel lobby is very open and spacious with little pods everywhere with fish in them. Now here is where the issues begin For this hotel being so empty it somehow took 45 mins for me to check in. There was one person at the front desk helping a disgruntled customer and no one else in site for at least another 30 mins. Once someone else showed up she started to check me in but could not find my reservation no bigie it happens. She eventually called someone and got me squared away even upgraded me to the ocean view room for the issues. The bellman was from honestly not professional at all. He tried to act more like my homie than a professional bellman but whatever people have different personalities right. So lets move on he did not know which golf cart to get in which mean loading one finding out he does not have the key to that one him going to get another one swapping everything to that other cart and no we are on the way. Mind you we stood around for 45 mins already trying to check in. Our room is upstairs so in an attempt to not make more than one trip the bellman tries to carry all the bags at once once he realized he could not he asked me if i could carry one of the bags myself. I could look past the personality traits and the golf cart but this is very unprofessional for a resort. The room was nice and the bellman quickly showed us around it and asked to get us some ice to which i agreed. While he was gone we noticed a dirty towel next to the bed had make up on the towel another sign of the lack of quality. When the bellman returned i told him about this towel at which point he questioned if it is even dirty and then commenced to smell the towel. He then took it with him and left. The TV did not work just continued to show no signal on an extremely clear day. There was no water in the fridge we were told there was some and once on the balcony you ca nt get back in if you close the sliding door with our smearing your finger prints all over the glass. I have no idea who thought that was a good design. Oh and i forgot to mention unles they plugged in the fridge as soon as we arrived it was not working. And yes i checked and the temp was turned to the max. The hotel resort is very open which in one hand can be nice as long as that open space is filled with people in this case there was probably a handful or two of people on the entire resort which made the entire place feel completely deserted and very dreary. The lack of reviews for this place made me weary to begin with but i decided to go ahead and give it a shot since the pictures looked nice but we canceled our reservation immediately and went elsewhere. I should have known something was up when the total number of cars in self parking was 3 and only 2 in valet including my own. Needless to say i do not recommend this place to anyone at all especially not for the price. If you are looking for a resort style place in this price range check out the wyndham which is not much farther and if you are willing to spend more money stay at St Regis.

Sort of like an adults oases. We did have a few problems that were more stressful then they could have been but the staff made every attempt to address any issues. The property is very big. To assist the staff around the property they have the staff drive large golf carts around and will drop you off at your room. We saw this online before we arrived but we thought it would be optional. There was very little information on it. Honestly the parking lot was so far away from our room that we relied on this transportation and that was a little frustrating. It was fun to ride but to rely on it was tough. I like to park right outside my own room. If you forget something in your car you have to wait for the staff with a cart and go all the way back to the parking lot. What made it a little harder was that when we arrived we were told to wait outside and a cart will be by every 10 mins. Well we learned that you can call the front desk and they will send it over to you. Once we learned this a day in it was a little smoother but I had still prefer to have my car closer to my room. Beware if you are injured as my partner was. We were looking forward to resting relaxing and exploring but woke up to very loud cleaning staff in the mornings. Our room was very nice. Large modern and clean but it was right next to the cleaning supply closet. We asked them if they could keep it down but were loud each morning. After we called and mentioned it to the front desk they were much more quiet for the rest of our trip. We were very grateful for their kind respect for our rest during our stay. One last thing. The parking situation was not explained to us. Again they fixed the problem right away but it was a little confusing and stressful for us right up until check out. When you get into the parking lot you get a ticket. Hold on to that ticket. Or you will not be able to leave the parking lot without it. Also you will not be able to leave the parking lot until paying for parking as well. We nearly paid full price for visitors for each day we were there instead of the discounted price for guests staying at the hotel and its a big difference. This part was confusing and still is to us. Long story short is that the parking is run by a separate company and its not a perfect process but they are working on it. They were more then happy to fix the problem. Our overall experience was amazing. I would recommend a stay here to all my friends and family. If they add some addition information on their website so you are more aware of what to expect when you arrive I believe it would really improve the experience of this large and gorgeous property.

My overall headline of this stay is The Hyat Regency Grand Reserve is not yet at the service level I would expect from a Hyat Regency Hotel. Positives The staff is generally friendly and aims to please The rooms are large clean and well furnished. I especially like the bathrooms the shower was one of the best I have experienced at a hotel The hotel is small enough that you can walk anywhere. although they also offer golf cart service The pool area is large and it was never hard to get a chair I emailed the concierge ahead of our stay with some questions and each time I got a response within hours. Areas of growth The service at the pool bar was not good. My fiance went up to the bar to order a drink and was ignored for 5 10 min. I tried after and the same thing happened. There were 6 7 employees behind the bar but they all seemed frazzled busy. Finally a server approached us at our seat and offered us drinks The lunch buffet was low quality. Breakfast was somewhat better but still much lower quality that meals I have experienced at other Hyat Regency properties I would expect more food variety given that the resort is secluded and it is difficult to get to restaurants outside the resort There is an overall lack of attention to detail around the resort. Some examples of this are no soap in the mens bathroom in the lobby landscaping seems outdated etc. When I was emailing the concierge I noted that my fiance and I were celebrating our engagement and asked about possibly paying to upgrade our room. He said that he forwarded our request to the front desk but then this was never addressed. Even if an upgrade was not available I would have at least expected a reply to my request. I know Hyat recently acquired this property I honestly think they reopened it too early. I do think this will eventually be a really high quality resort.", "offset": [1411, 1558], "date": "2020-01-02", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "dd68e3e3-03e3-48aa-92dc-e792f24bbd1e", "sentence": "Great property that is new clean and very open. Our room was spacious and clean. We were the furthest from the pool but rode the \u201c Trolley \u201d golf carts back and forth which was very convenient.

The main building was very nice again spacious and open air. We loved the little coffee place and went to the bar the nights we were at the hotel which was great. The front desk service was very accommodating and the concierge gave us some good suggestions for old Sa Juan and the rain forest.

We just stayed here for 5 days with another family. First the good the property itself is beautiful and the rooms are spacious clean and modern. The staff with a few exceptions were very friendly and courteous. With that said the service was atrocious. We set reasonable expectations. We knew it was n\u2019t a Four Seasons or the nearby St Regis. But it got to the point of being ridiculous. Day 1 we checked in left our bags with the bellman as instructed and met our friends for lunch. More than an hour later we started heading to our room only to spot our bags still sitting on the luggage cart. The bellman apologized and we waited for them to be delivered to our room. No big deal simple miscomunication. Later that same evening we ordered room service at the Regency Club through the manager on duty. After more than an hour no food so we asked the manager if she could check. At this point she informed us that she had given us the wrong menu ops and that our order was never placed. She handed us a new more limited menu and the process began anew. We finally received our food close to 2 hours after our initial order. Day 3 On New Year \u2019s Eve 7 us went to dinner at the Japanese restaurant on property. They lost our initial reservation but managed to accommodate us. The restaurant was almost empty. We each ordered a meal and over the next hour and a half they would deliver them one at a time or at least some of them. After an hour 4 of us had already eaten and 3 were still waiting. We politely asked where the other meals were and the waitress rolled her eyes at us. We were astounded. 20 minutes later I excused myself to find her and to cancel our remaining orders. She seemed completely put out and apologized without a trace of sincerity. I asked to speak to her manager and she came over to see what was going on. I explained the situation and she comped the meal. Nice but 2 people never ate dinner. Also one of the kids ordered a Coke. After almost 30 minutes we asked the whereabouts and were told the syrup was gone as if we should have somehow known this. So I walked across the lobby to the bar and ordered cans of Coke and delivered them to our table. This should have been handled by one of the waitstaf that was mostly just standing around and chatting only two other tables were ocupiedThe concierge was useless. All of their partner tours were booked and they refused to call anyone else on our behalf and told us we would have to make our own arrangements. They also could n\u2019t make reservations at the restaurants on property for reasons that are n\u2019t clear. When we checked out we requested bag pickup but they predictably did n\u2019t show up so I dragged all of our luggage several blocks to the lobby. Pool service was spotty at best with only 1 2 people taking drink and food orders. Room service delivered a dessert on two different occasions without utensils. My wife ordered a Black Russian and was told that they could n\u2019t deliver one because it could spill. Huh. I asked why they could deliver a glass of water but not a mixed drink so they decided to risk it. What arrived was milk spiked with vodka. To be clear the employees were very friendly but they were in serious need of training which is a failure of management. I could n\u2019t in good conscience recommend this property to anyone not until they get their act together. Maybe they \u2019re still sorting things out as they transition to a Hyat Regency but if that \u2019s the case they should n\u2019t even be open. We had reservations at the steak house on January 1 but cancelled because we had no faith in their ability to provide even average service. Finally and this one is more funny than anything else our newly remodeled room did n\u2019t have a single towel hook. There was literally no place to hang a towel swimsuit etc. Our friends \u2019 room did n\u2019t have one either. That \u2019s sort of incredible but not really surprising.", "offset": [2757, 2839], "date": "2020-01-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "4f95b396-5fd4-420d-ba17-c179834c6259", "sentence": "Will become excellent with modifications to staffing.

Now need to change to make it excellent coming from former Disney cast member1. Everyone picks up litter glasses no matter your job. I had to pick up a glass that was discarded on New Year \u2019s Eve and put it in a garbage can and it was STILL there four days later. 2. We loved the kitty there but make sure you get her and dogs on property fixed. Then again I love the Fairmount dogs3. Create a checklist for housecleaning. Room was not cleaned and when cleaned inconsistent. One night we had to call for cleaning another for towels4. Pool bar drinks are watery. Staff bar better for less wait time. Turn down music so staff can hear you. Stick with Latin music. Music was all over the place and one day music radio station with tons of swearing. Make an adult pool if you want that. Do n\u2019t play pop or country. Theme is Caribbean. Stick with it. Good price point on food. Add plain rain chips or nachos. 5. Breakfast by far the worst part of the whole trip. Over priced buffet. Food bland. Sausage so bad stray cat ate it last. Egg cups had no taste. If you charge 25 a head I expect AMAZING tasty food. Great staff member at omelette station. The rest Of staff were hit or miss. Bird poop all over sears outside and had to ask staff in groups of two just hanging out chatting to clean off seat. If you were not \u201c their \u201d table staff not attentive. Lots of talking to each other. 6. Make the staff a team from the outside there appeared to be a lot of \u201c that is not my job \u201d attitude. You see a cup. Stop. Pick it up. 7. Reservations at some restaurants a total mess. Have ONE reservation person. 8. Decor at two higher end \u201c reservation \u201d restaurants amazing. The other two was tired and in need of updating. 9. Outdoor bar. Get that tv to the side and out of my face. Awful. Staff the bar better. Long wait times. Be able to pull pool bar attendees there. Cross training to have adequate staffing at all times. 10. Shutles run shuttles to airport Luquilo beach kiosks and rainforest at least on certain days. Felt trapped. Or offer more by way of activities at hotel. Yoga or pool cycling would be great easy.

In 48 hours have made 3 requests to housekeeping. all answered in minutes Regency club is exactly as described in other posts good to very good limited selection.

Some areas of water do have sea grass others areas you can swim and wade. Nice patio. balcony with every room bathrooms are big. But as other posts say only one hook in entire room. Ask for more extra hangars To work around That Shower tub room area is slippery when wet so make sure you put down towels mats that are providedThere is an avis rent a car desk on property Lobby bar has entertainment some nights.
