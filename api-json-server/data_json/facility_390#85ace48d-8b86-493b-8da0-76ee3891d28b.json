The only things we did nt like were we could not be seated at the Hard Rock Cafe for breakfast. We were previously told by the cafe employee that no reservation was needed for breakfast just come before 10 AM. We were there both days by 1030 AMOne day we were turned away and were told they are not serving breakfast any more even though it was only 1030 AM and we can see the kitchen staff prepaing egg omelets and pancakes. The second day we were turned away we were told the cafe was full. There was a football Eagles game playing last Saturday morning. The Cafe was only letting in Guests that had Eagles football shirts on. Also Saturday night in the North Tower Elevator was vomit on the floor of the elevator.", "offset": [78, 115], "date": "2018-10-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "c22b1927-a98b-405d-9f15-dcc1075f8b12", "sentence": "The hotel is clean and beautiful however the elevators broke and we had to go 33 floors with our luggage by foot on the stairs.

I have been to the Taj Mahal back when it was open and the place was a complete miserable dump and very tacky. So I was very surprised to see how cleaned up and attractive it has become with the newly opened Hard Rock. The room I got was a queen in the North Tower and below market entering the slower winter season but it was spacious and enough room for a desk sofa love seat and coffee table entertainment console and very large windows. The bathroom alone was large enough to sleep in. I love the glass door shower and complimentary Sweet Grass toiletries. The marble and stone look is definitely fresh and cleaner in appearance than the gaudy purple mauve gold and cheetah skin aesthetic of yesteryear. I did not get a chance to see the restaurants or entertainment but I will definitely be back for the great lineup of shows coming to town in the next months. HR is a great place to stay for a fun overnight or weekend trip out of town if you are local or coming from the NYC or Phily areas.", "offset": [509, 579], "date": "2018-12-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "d5bd68b9-33ff-4d1e-ac08-034995d95603", "sentence": "Celebrating a friend \u2019s 60th birthday.
