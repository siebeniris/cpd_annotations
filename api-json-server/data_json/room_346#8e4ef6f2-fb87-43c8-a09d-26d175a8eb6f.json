After a long time in Dubai actually moved here for a three night stay with the family. what is good well location rooms views and the food only tried breakfast and Jamie Italian. Breakfast was particularly good better to get there early given the queues that began to build up after 9 am. What did not go so well well too much. First at check in we did not have two rooms together despite having called to ask various times and in fact they had been booked in different classes and therefore different floors which was clearly never going to work. We then got our rooms sorted but only one was ready this was 30pm. Waited too long for second room only to get it at 6 pm and find out someone had smoked in it but it had been signed off as clean. This was a non smoking floor. Made a complaint and was moved to a different floor which was better. Along the way a suit got left behind and they logged it as lost property which is a bit odd given they knew they had moved us from the one floor to another. Not very impressed with that. After that well kids club was a bit of a joke in substance. In form it looks great but nothing was full and they would not do any activities. None of our kids wanted to go which was the plan. So in sum the hotel looks good and has a great view. But it seems too busy and a bit over confident.

This was our first stay at the Jumeirah Beach although we had visited friends there in the past. We usually stay nearer The Walk and generally at the Hilton Jumeirah. The hotel is looking dated in some areas now particularly the reception area which is also chaotic much of the time. Whilst the staff are generally very pleasant and do their best to help you overall they are not in the same league as those in the Hilton. There appeared to be a lot of staff who were just not totally familiar with their surroundings and could not answer what were normal basic enquiries. Having said that the staff in both the buffet restaurant and the kids club were very good. We stayed in an Ocean Deluxe Balcony on the 7th floor which was perfect. Many people had said that the balconies were a waste of money but I disagree. Yes the balconies are small and quite enclosed but it is just nice to have access to outside space. The room itself is of a good size with a lovely bathroom but having a third bed in the room rather than a sofa bed was a bit of a pain. Room service and cleaning etc is efficient as you would expect and the bathroom amenities are of a good standard. Food in general throughout the hotel is very good especially in the buffet where there is always plenty of variety but the quality of drinks varies enormously depending on which bar you are at and of course they are ridiculously expensive. One thing that does let the hotel down is the location as there is not really anything going on around it should you fancy a stroll. The big advantage of being on The Walk is that there are plenty of options for eating and supermarkets where you can buy soft drinks for the fridge and at almost \u00a3 60 for a can of Coke in the mini bar you do not want to be using too much from there. There is a very small shopping mall right opposite the hotel but there is nothing much in there and I am sure it is not a coincidence that there is no supermarket in there or nearby. The hotel pools are very nice. We spent most of our time around the kids pool which has a very gentle gradient and non slip surface at the point of entry and the regular rounds of free ice lollys were very welcome especially with our daughter. The beach is immaculate and food drink service on there is good. We booked a half board plan which overall was pretty decent value when compared to paying for meals as you go and the vouchers you are given do offer good flexibility with restaurants in other Jumeirah owned hotels.

We stayed here in February 2017 at the end of a family trip to Dubai. Initially we stayed at a Novotel near by The Mall of the Emirates while we did all the sightseeing stuff and then finished off with 3 nights at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. We had a club room which was spacious and plenty of room for the 4 of us 2 adults and 2 kids. All the rooms face the sea so everyone has a great viewBeing in a club room we had access to the club lounge downstairs the upstairs lounge is only for adults snacks and drinks during the day and in the evening which we think was worth the extra cost. Access to Wild Wadi water park was complementary and the hotel has its own entrance to the water park. We had access to all the restaurants for breakfast. I am not sure if this is standard or if just for club room guests but I recommend the main downstairs restaurant as the variety of the food was excellent and there were food choices for everyone. Also included in the cost was airport transfers to from the hotel. Since we were already in Dubai the hotel agreed to pick us up from our other hotel.

NO MORE my adres in Dubai after 8 years as a regular guest. For around 8 years JBH has been my adres in Dubai either for business or leisure carrying new colleagues and business partners on each stay. However for the 2nd time this year 1st in March and 2nd now in November. I got hardly disappointed with the present lack of basic care on guests wellbeing and health. that does not match this kind of hotel. Despite included on my guest file or should be as any hotel does. both times I sent 3 emails to the hotel in advance remembering my room basic usual requests. Twin beds sharing room with a colleague and Feather free bedding available in every hotel worldwide due to severe allergy to feathers this in order to get my room accordingly at check in time always very late in night at 2 am needing to rest after long flights. The hotel reply by email confirmed my requests ready at check in time. However both times our check in started at 2 am upon arrival and we got the room to rest only around 2 TWO hours later around 4 am. Both times room was one king bed and all bedding feathers pillows duvet everything. totally oposite to the requestedI could have had a severe breath health crisis due to incompetence of the hotel services previously advised. And they tried to make twin beds putting a ridiculous small extra child bed in the middle of the room. in this level of hotel. My business colleagues both times said they will never come back to this lack of level hotelin Dubai. After waiting at reception for almost 2 hours. at 4 am they finally gave us a twin beds room and changed the feather bedding into regular one as requested. This is completely unlike the high level I always referred on my TripAdvisor reviews on JBH as my only adres in Dubai. SO FAR. It was not a fault of reception employee on the contrary ISA was amazingly diligent trying to resolve with a lot of internal calls late in night. the big mistake created by all lack of coordination in services that previously managed my reservation process really there was no information on my file as I provided in advance. Thanks to ISA he saved the hotels bad image. SO this severe lack of guest wellbeing and health care due to services incoordination twice in a year is too much for us. Jumeirah Beach Hotel is NO MORE my adres in Dubai on my next stay I will change the hotelNot so important but confirming the present services lack of coordination was the hotel car previously booked they asked me by email to choose a Bmw or a Navigator I choosed the Navigator for 3 hours to run in Dubai traffic. After arriving the hotel they send me the Bmw instead to take us back to airport. Everything was wrong. so many mistakes in such a short time in JBH services. Thanks to Ibrahim the very competent driver that have had a wrong info from the services we could resolve the mistake and have a pleasant drive in Dubai he saved also the hotels bad image. One last note to breakfast buffet at Latitude restaurant it was always superb till now. On my both referred stays this year breakfast was not so good choice and quality. Fruit and cheese were very poor and bad quality even. When I asked for goat cheese every hotel worldwide even 4stars displays it now on the breakfast board in several varieties. they told me they could get me some ONLY because I was claiming they coudnt put it at the discretion of all people according to orders and actually brought to our table a small plate with 3 thin slices of goat cheese roll. Exactly the same procesus for the mango and bad quality papaya. No coments for such an elevated breakfast price.

We have an 8 and 5 year old so the 5 slept on the corner sofa while the 8 had the pop up bed the hotel gave a second bed too but the sofa was ok for us. Amazing views of the Burj al Arab.

Free valet parking always efficient to get the car. although sometimes very busy at the actual turning circle outside the entrance.

Bring water and towels and set up stuff where you want. There are lifeguards always on the watch the most attentive I \u2019ve seen. At least one in the water on a canoe as well. The beach is great. Lovely fine whitish sand. Early December the water was cool but enough for me to get in and snorkel but the kids found it cold. Some of the pools were chilly too but the executive pool was lovely and warm. The free access to wild wadi is great. The wave pool is salty and warm and great for kids. The splash play area adjoins the wave pool so the kids loved playing between the two. The rides are so so for 5 and 8 year olds. The only real ride worth it is the jumeirah sceirah which is a bit beyond my two but not me woho.

The receptionist was a nice egyptian man ca nt remember his name We stayed there for a week on half board basis The room is very nice and cosy and the view to the ocean and Burj Al Arab is priceless. I have 2 kids and they were so happy in the hotel once we arrived they were given their keys to access the kids club and also a voucher to redeem and get free drinks. The swimming pools are very nice and they offer great service. My kids were in live with the popsicles they offer everyday as complimentarythe kids club and kids pool are very safe for young children. The beach has nice activities as well The food breakfast and dinner are of a great variety and high quality. For the dinner it is normally same arrangement but everyday with different theme of a certain cuisine. Every night we find a gift on the bed for the kids and also for us as Adults.

It is under renovation and throughout the day I kept hearing the construction noises and dust from the construction site. Also the rooms are no longer as spacious as before.

I stayed in Jumeirah beach hotel for two weeks with my partner. I \u2019m going to go through all of my experience in this two weeks containing the good and bad times. My partner and I were celebrating our anniversary here at the hotel and my birthday was just before we flew out to Dubai. So when we arrived at the airport we was greeted amazingly by staff at the hotel and taken straight to our room which was an ocean beach club room with a great view of the Burj Khalifa one side but then horrible construction on the other side. My partner and I did n\u2019t mind this construction at the time and got ready to go and have some breakfast. Upon telling the hotel about our anniversary they did a lovely shaped swan made out of towels and petal roses all across the bed with a chocolate cake which was absolutely amazing. Once a couple days had passed as we arrived on a Sunday morning I do n\u2019t think construction was going on that much as there was n\u2019t much noise but once the couple days had passed you could hear loud bangs from the diggers bleeping from vehicles reversing which actually woke my partner and I up numerous times in the nights. It was n\u2019t just evenings that this was going on it would be starting from early hours in the morning all the way through the day right into late hours past midnight everyday. As this was effecting my partner and I \u2019s sleep through the night I went down to reception and asked to speak to a manager. The members of staff ran straight away and he came along. I explained the problem and obviously had paid a lot of money for this holiday the construction was just too loud and needed something to be done. The manager apologised and stated to me to give him a couple of hours and he will get back to me. I heard nothing after a few hours to which I went back down to reception and spoke to Mike who works at the front desk. Mike was very very helpful throughout my time in Jumeirah beach hotel he went above and beyond his position to help me and was amazing. Once I \u2019d spoken to Mike to ask if the manager had said anything back he stated that the manager is aware and has just said \u201c okay \u201d to the fact I was waiting at reception for an answer. I ignored it and got on with my day went to the pool and got dinner to which it was around 230 hours where I then asked Mike again if anything had been said by the manager. Mike was in absolute shock that I had heard nothing from nobody and was very sympathetic. I went to bed and left it the whole day to not say anything till around 180 hours. At this point my parents came with us to Dubai but were staying in another resort Al Nasem which is just a buggy ride away from Jumeirah Beach. I paid extra for my partner and I to use the club lounge and also have access to the executive pool. For a good few days we went to the executive pool and the members of staff were amazing in particular Gobi and Paul. Everyday they reserved our beds and had a cooler bag filled with lemon cold towels bottles of water with ice all around to keep it cool. Gobi and Paul were always checking that everything was okay with us making sure if we needed anything and we \u2019re absolutely amazing making our time at the executive pool worthwhile. They always made sure if we needed a reservation at any restaurant and would assist if we needed one done. The slight problem that we did not keep going to that pool was the water. Unfortunately the water was literally like a hot bath when you got in. The temperature was just so warm that when you \u2019re really hot in the Dubai weather and want to cool down it just was n\u2019t working. As you can imagine this was horrible. I have been to Jumeirah hotels in Dubai for many years since I was a child. I remember as a child coming to this hotel and being amazed. The interior of all the hotel has changed completely even the rooms which look lovely but unfortunately no work has been done to the pools what so ever and they look exactly the same as they did ten years ago which is a shame. As my family were in Al Nasem we went over there for a day to spend at there pool as you can use other facilities in different hotels. The difference of the water was unbelievable. I felt chills as I was walking into the water and having my breath taken away from me which in my eyes when I \u2019m sweating hot is what I want to cool down. After seeing this and also seeing that there was more of a selection of newly refurbished pools we decided everyday to take a buggy to Al Nasem to use their pool as it just had a nicer relaxed feel to it and also the water being cooler. I have now finished the day and gone back into the hotel where I spoke to Mike again asking for the manager as I had heard nothing. At this point Malika was in ear shot of me explaining how unhappy and disgusted I am with how I was treated. Malika and Mike immediately worked together and got hold of the front desk manager Swapnil who came to see me within five minutes. Swapnil sat me down and listened to everything I had to say and actually took it on board unlike the other manager. Swapnil offered to make our stay more comfortable an option of staying in a room with a balcony or to upgrade to a suite. I asked for some time to speak to my partner to decide and come back to him but whilst I said this Swapnil immediately asked Malika to lock both rooms so no one was able to book them whilst I was able to make a decision. This was more professional and what I expected from Jumeirah staff I felt I was treated as a customer and not just a piece of dirt which is how I felt I was treated from the other manager. We decided to take the suite after Malika had showed us around and it was absolutely stunning. This was closer to the construction but strangely could not hear as much noise when sleeping or maybe we had been there for some time that we was just becoming used to the noise. As I said before about Mike Swapnil and Malika went above and beyond their job to make sure our stay was welcoming and luxurious which was amazing and I thank all of them profusely. As the holiday went on our stay starting becoming slightly better with lovely meals at many of the half board restaurants available to guests to use and also free drinks at club lounge from 180 200 hours. During the day going for afternoon tea at club lounge was okay from 160 hours onwards but if you were to get there when it opened at 150 hours it was like feeding a zoo. Families rushing and pushing past to try and get hot panini \u2019s and other hot foods. The chef would struggle to get past with freshly cooked panini \u2019s where there was so many people crowded around. When I used to come as a child the club lounge had a much better layout. It had PlayStation Xbox and three to five computers available for kids to jump on and use to keep them occupied whilst parents would get food. Now there is a tiny little area for toddlers and no area \u2019s for teenaged children so you have them running around banging on glass and causing riot as there \u2019s nothing else for them to do. Overall paying for the club lounge was only worth it for the free alcoholic drinks from the specified times I stated above but as I stated the pool we hardly used as it was so warm. As days went on we had Celerina cleaning our room everyday she always had a smile on her face and was absolutely amazing at her job. Celerina would always ask if we wanted her to come back when we was in the room at the time she came to clean and she always came back to do an amazing job. Unfortunately Celerina went off sick due to hurting her hand and I hope she recovered okay but whilst she went off we had other cleaning staff. Now at one point our room did not get cleaned for two whole days. The bed was made and someone had been in the room but the towels were not replaced shower gels or shampoo \u2019s. This was a problem as the showers within the hotel are lovely but the doors would not close properly. This caused a massive water issue within the bathroom having to use more towels on the floor to mop up everything. At one point the water covered the whole bathroom floor from where it would leak out the doorway of the shower. This was a nightmare especially when we had no towels to clean it up. There was a big pile of towels gathered on the floor and the sides and I had to call reception to prompt someone to come and clean the room as it had n\u2019t been done for two whole days. I can assure that I did not press the do not disturb button neither and that no one came to the room. Celerina then came back from being off sick and was again doing above and beyond her job always smiling and making sure we had lots of bottled water in the room. A few nights before we were leaving Dubai early hours in the morning at around 060 hours I received a phone call on the room telephone which seemed to be from kids. I was confused as I was half asleep answering to which they said \u201c wake up call \u201d numerous times they were also laughing in the background to which at the point I knew it was n\u2019t the hotel and was in fact a prank. This woke my partner and I up and caused us to feel quite rubbish the following day. I feel like there should be some system in place to not make it so easy for kids to pick up the phone and just call any another room they want at any time. In the evenings it was humid but I enjoyed the weather especially where I \u2019d been before to Dubai where as my partner did not. It was her first time in Dubai and she was n\u2019t quite used to the heat and would get extremely hot when getting dressed up for a fancy meal. The problem was that there was an efficient buggy service where throughout the day were absolutely amazing being outside constantly sweating from the heat but always smiling. I made good conversation with lots of them as they were always so respectful to me. The problem was in the evenings where it seemed to just all fall apart. Everyone is ready at the same time to go for meals and queue \u2019s would start to build up in the seating area outside where you could be waiting around ten twenty minutes for a buggy to take you to your desired location. Obviously this is quite frustrating as you \u2019re getting hotter and hotter whilst other guests are getting frustrated and trying to push in whenever they can when a buggy arrives as everyone is in the same position getting extremely sweaty and hot. As I stated though all buggy drivers were amazingly friendly and always smiling especially that some guests were very rude and arrogant towards them but that would n\u2019t stop all of them smiling and doing the job the right way. Halfway through the holiday at around 090 1000 hours each day my partner and I could hear what sounded like drilling. This drilling was even worse than the construction outside as it sounded like it was right inside our room. This woke us up numerous mornings and even after a nice day at the pool where you want to come back and possibly nap before going on your hectic evening the drilling would be happening at around 160 hours to even sometimes as late as 20 hours. This was horrible as I could n\u2019t even hear myself think let alone try and sleep. I believe the drilling is from where there is a gym and spa located outside of the hotel. Now they are trying to bring it all inside the hotel and this is causing the noise to be so loud. Mike again was so amazing listening to my problems throughout the holiday and even when I asked for a specific beach bag that I had saw he arranged for it to be delivered straight to our room within hours. This was after so many attempts of trying to ask the reception the same thing and had no luck. Mike was just amazing throughout the holiday with pure kindness and politeness I could not fault him on anything and he was a massive part to our holiday. Celerina was smiling right up until our last minutes of leaving the hotel and even got a picture with us before we left which I thought was really nice. Overall our stay at Jumeirah Beach was a very up and down stay and I understand this is a very long review but if I knew now what I knew of the hotel before i came I could n\u2019t promise i would \u2019ve stayed at Jumeirah Beach just for the price that we paid and for the value of the stay that we got. Although the names I have mentioned above made our stay so so much better and did their upmost best to do so all the way right to the end of the holiday. I do feel that the price is similar to Al Nasem hotel which is much more newly refurbished and has only been open around three years but has a lot more to offer including a Shisha bar with music playing till quite late with a lively atmosphere inside. I am not saying that I would never stay at Jumeirah Beach again but until the construction is completely finished I do n\u2019t think my partner and I will be back there but next year we are looking into staying at another Jumeirah resort in Dubai as we do love the atmosphere Dubai brings. The staff made this a 5 review but because of the let downs in the hotel it just was n\u2019t good enough.
