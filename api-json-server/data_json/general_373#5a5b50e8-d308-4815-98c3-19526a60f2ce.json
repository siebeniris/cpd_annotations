I have had the benefit of traveling extensively and staying in many five star hotels. Those are always nice but it does not take the top tier eg Four Seasons to make it an exceptional hotel stay. I look for room functionality and good service. My reservation was booked for the wrong day. The front desk staff on 91 around 4 pm did not make an issue and found me a room. One that was great. The room was a nice size simple shower which trust me is often a hassle between the shower heads that ruin your hair or figuring out how to work them and great placement and plenty of plugs to power up. And it was quiet. that is all I ask for and good service. Well without going into specifics I will tell you that I ended up leaving my laptop in the hotel lobby. I realized this as soon as I checked in at the airport. My colleague immediately called the hotel and asked if they could locate the laptop they did as we knew exactly where it was at and bring it to me in 25 mins. My laptop was delivered in 25 minutes in a lovely town car. I am sure it had a nice ride. I was so shocked that it did not require follow up and they did exactly what we requested. I do not know the name of the gentlemen at the front desk around 2 pm on 9 2 but he was wonderful. Gloria also was helpful at the front desk with getting my luggage and handing me a bottle of water as I ran out. Obviously a VERY hectic day. This Mariot rocks. I am not that picky but it is not that often there is not something that is off and there was not a beat that was missed at this hotel.

I was looking forward to staying at this hotel. Location on the map looked great. That was the best part. it is all downhill from there. Location in front of a lake with relaxing views. We had a room with a lake view and balcony. In the balcony there were 2 cheap looking chairs not very inviting. We checked in early. The hostess cheerfully greeted us and said our room should be ready in 12 hour so we waited in the patio area. It was a nice sunny albeit windy day. So it was a good way to de compress after a long drive. The balcony lake view room is the largest disappointment of all. It felt old and dated. But worst of all it was FILTHY see pics. It must have been a while since housekeeping dusted and cleaned. We even found an ice bucket with melted ice behind the balcony curtain. I was not able to take a pic of it but my husband said the phone cord was coated with dustSince I was there for business and only staying one night we decided to stay put. But never again. We would have been better off staying at a hotel 12 the price they charged.

I had a reservation to stay one night at the Dallas Mariot Las Colinas. I arrived at 10PM the night of my scheduled stay. They have a tight parking garage with very poor signage so from your arrival to the front desk can easily be 5 to 10 minutes. I got to the front desk to be told they did not have a room for me they gave a vague excuse about an engineering issue. They said they would pay for my room at the nearby Courtyard. I went to the Courtyard and they said they would accommodate me but the Mariot did not have a payment arrangement with them so if the Mariot did not make payment accommodations by the next morning they would charge my card. As it was 1030PM at night and the Mariot had promised to pay I stayed at the Courtyard. At this point the Dallas Mariot Las Colinas did not have a room for me did not use the Mariot phone ap or a courtesy call to inform me of the new arrangements before I arrived at 10PM had a poorly signed parking garage and sent me to a hotel it did not have a payment arrangement with. Obviously not good but not all that worthy of a bad TripAdvisor review. It is what happened over the next month that merits this poor review. Five days after my stay the Courtyard had yet to receive a payment from this Mariot so they had to charge my card for the stay which cost more than my reserved night at the Mariot. This started weeks of my calling the Dallas Mariot. Each time I called I was routed to another voicemail account. I left several voicemails but a no one ever called me back and b the charge was never reversed from my credit card. Worried I would never get the charge reversed I contacted corporate Mariot. They did get back to me via email. Several days later I received an email from the Mariot Front Desk Manager stating that the Mariot would pay the Courtyard. Five days later I again checked my credit card and called the Courtyard and sure enough they still did not have a payment from the Mariot. I again contacted corporate Mariot and the Dallas Mariot. Two days later the situation was resolved 30 days after my initial stay when the Courtyard decided to rebate my hotel charge since I had been through so much trouble to get the Dallas Mariot to pay. Needless to say I am incredibly disappointed with both the Dallas Mariot Las Colinas and corporate Mariot. It should not take one month of un returned phone calls and emails to get a hotel to do what it promised to do and is a standard industry practice. Ultimately it was my efforts and those of the Courtyard instead of the efforts of the Dallas Mariot that resolved the issue and got the substantial charge taken off my credit card.

This Mariot has a new look according to them and it shows. The lobby is fresh expansive and nice without being opulent. It \u2019s not far from DFW probably less than 30 minutes on average and is situated in the middle of a large shopping dining and multifamily residence area. There are plenty of other hotels and office parks nearby as well so the location is quite good for whatever you might need. If this hotel has recently been renovated it seems likely that they did not make the rooms smaller. I imagine that if the building is quite old the same room design and architecture was left intact while the entire property got a facelift. I did not ask if I had received an upgrade as Mariot SPG Gold but my room was huge for a non suite by hotel standards. The king bed was flanked by a sleeper sofa and a separate ledge was available in the corner of the room for storage. A large closet is featured and the bathroom is massive \u2013 rarely will you be this comfortable in a hotel bathroom with a long wide shower and tons of counter space for anything. The work area is ample TV is probably at least 46 \u201d there are plenty of USB and 10AC connections plus a couple of 240AC connections which was a surprise. Mariot only made one small mistake with the room \u2013 where the space exists for a minifridge is actually just an empty cabinet. That \u2019s a letdown for a room this inviting but overall not a major negative. Service in the hotel is great \u2013 the front desk is quick efficient and friendly and the restaurant staff for breakfast was fantastic. so helpful accommodating and warm. They even asked if they \u2019d see me the next day and I felt it was genuinely because they liked serving me. You can tell people take pride in what they are doing as staff in this hotel. I\u2019m big on hotel gyms and this is obvious from any hotel review I do. The gym at this Mariot is quite large has high ceilings and a large window to make the room feel even larger. The equipment selection is above average with plenty of dumbbells pulley stations and a pulup bar as well as Swiss balls and mats plus the usual compliment of cardio machines. For the amount of space provided I \u2019d like to see ketlebels and possibly a squat rack but the entire fitness area is above average.
