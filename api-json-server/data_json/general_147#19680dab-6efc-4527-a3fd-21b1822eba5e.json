In terms of resort it is beautiful. Close to other islands but we did not mind that. Their staff is amazing and very friendly. The best asset of this resort. Special shout out to the bar manager and head of food and beverage up there. Everyone comes and welcomes you when you first get there and share their information so you can make any special requests. Spa is great too and secluded. Food was amazing as well. My wife likes one is the dips they have and before leaving the chef gave us sample and recipe for it. Little touches that make a big difference. Diving school is great as well. A must do if you stay here. This would have been a 10 star review if it was not for the post checkout experience. We were there in nov and this hotel runs a program where you can sponsor growing corals for life and dedicate that to someone. They promise to send you a link with the video of the coral etc once it is planted and if you have time you can do it yourself too. So we decided to donate and dedicated it to our niece for her bday coming up in Dec figured it would be a cool memory for her as she can come visit the coral in future and we also contributed to a good cause. Confirmed with the front desk when checking out and marine center rep that he will def send the link to video in next 2 3 days. Told him our plan for the bday so he was aware. Now it is been 4 months and even after multiple follow up emails to hotel Markus never received any link or information from them. We were not able to do the bday gift and now it makes me think they are running some shady business there and no corals are being planted. Otherwise why would they never send even after multiple follow ups.

We stayed in April at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura in the sunset villa. This is my fourth trip to the Maldives and I have to say that this property is the worst amongst all those that I have visited before. I almost regret not going back to any of the previous properties and instead relying on the Four Seasons name for this trip. I stayed previously at Anantara Dhigu Jumeirah Vitaveli and the W Hotel each of these hotels have exceeded my expectations one way or another. Except the Four Seasons which makes this experience very disappointing. I will focus mainly on the issues that require MAJOR improvement1. The room is very basic and small. do not expect luxury. This is the first category of rooms and I get that. But other hotels have a luxurious feel even to their first category rooms. Something that we definitely missed in this hotel. 2. The beach outside the room is Extremely rocky and full of dried corals. You can not enter the sea without being hurt. it is very unpleasant. None of the previous hotels that I have been to in the Maldives had this issue. I called the reception and asked why this was the case and they indicated that there is an area good for swimming next to the main pool. This is confusing cause if I paid to come all the way to the Maldives then I expect to be swimming infront of my villa. Again another disappointment given our previous fantastic experiences. 3. My sister called before arrival with a few days to explain that we are marking an important celebration hence the trip to the Maldives. There was no acknowledgment whatsoever. Maybe I am too pampered with the excellent service that the Starwod Hotels provide that I expect the same everywhere. There was a handwritten welcome note in the room I would have been impressed if there was an acknowledgment to our occasion in that handwritten card. Again so much to learn on customer service from the Starwod Hotels Group 4. The snorkeling is a BIG fail. You can only snorkel on one side of the island and you barely see fish. No turtles no starfish. Even the variety of fish is not that great. We were informed that we have to go on a boat trip in the middle of the sea to snorkel properly of course for a price. Once again we did not have to go anywhere further than our door step in the other hotels to have a beautiful experience for snorkeling. Again very very disappointing. 5. Staring staff while you swim. While we are swimming in the sea the passing staff members would not respect privacy of guests. Some staff kept looking again and again which made us feel uncomfortable. 6. The island is one hour after Male. ONLY On the island. The phone is adapted to Male timing but on the island it is one hour later. Very confusing. Apparently they said that this will make us feel that the day is longer. In reality it made us feel it is shorter. Cause instead of waking us at 6 for the yoga class at 7 we have to wake up at 5 am. Similarly breakfast ends in reality at 930 but on the island it is 1030. Some of the positives1. The housekeeping was excellent. The team followed up on requests that they did not understand and they cleaned up the room properly. 2. The food at the restaurant is fantastic. Amazing quality of food at all restaurants. Very impressive. On the second day of our trip one of the managers of the hotel approached us and offered to give us an upgrade for our current room as we had complained to a few staff about our room the beach and facilities. We checked the room before shifting there and it did not provide a big difference to our current room except it had access to a better beach less rocky but because it was a few villas away from our current villa then we decided not to change and stick to our villa. I would have appreciated this gesture more if it was offered on the first day after our first complaint. But having an offer to upgrade to another average room on day 2 left us indifferent. In summary if you will be paying money to come to the Maldives I suggest that you do not come to this hotel as it does not provide value for money. It is expensive probably for the brand name the facilities definitely does not live up to the expectations once you have tried all the other beautiful properties and hotels in the Maldives. There is a lot that this property has to learn from other properties in the Maldives in terms of customer service to start off with. They lack the basic knowledge of making guests feel special and acknowledging their happy moments. Very indifferent not personalized service which again left us feeling disappointed. I rated it poor cause this is not a five star hotel in Maldivian standard. I will return to the Maldives again and again but make sure that I never go back to this property.", "offset": [2086, 2129], "date": "2017-04-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "10724833-ec68-4bed-9235-0bdba23d0534", "sentence": "RR and how.

Arrived after a week at the pristine Velasaru Resort expecting to be blown away as we normally are at a Four Seasons Hotel and Resort. Sadly we were disappointed mainly because of an infestation of flies in the main dining area which was beyond doubt the very worst experience I have had in any country I have ever travelled to around the world. The resort seemed to think it was acceptable to apologise but I believe they made a grave error in judgement. No one in their right mind would go back to that. They did have another restaurant at the other end of the resort which was clean and did not have such a bad issue but when I suggested they close the main dining area and move the buffet breakfast to the other area they politely said they were working on it. but nothing changedWe decided to eat in our villa as it was just not possible to select food that had not been walked over by many many flies. Absolutely shocking and totally unaceptableExcuses about a village close by and the rainy season being the cause however we are used to good health food standards and in this instance the hotel should have closed that venue down and made alternative arrangements. Personally I believe a very good clean of both the area utensils and the floors and walls would have gone a long way to sorting out the problem. Anyway the villas were pleasant and nicely located either over the water or close to the beach the spa was underwhelming nice therapists but datedVery nice Italian hairdresser brought in for the week and that was fabThe resort did arrange an outstanding buffet in the beach at the far end of the island for our company farewell we were with a group of aprox 60. but sadly around the bar there were loads of flies again but interestingly on the beach where the tables were set up was fine hardly a fly in sight.

The island is not too big so you pretty much could walk across from one end to the other within 15 20 minutes so you do not have to wait for a buggy all the time and could enjoy a morning evening stroll. Sunrise side of the island is most popular as you are a walk away from the snorkeling site.

My partner and I holidayed here 24 28 March 2017. It was the best and most amazing vacation of our lives. From the moment we were met at the airport and taken to the Four Seasons Lounge there we felt that we were in very good hands. Even the hotel staff who met us there were super friendly and immediately made us feel welcome. The airport lounge itself is small but it is fine because you are not there for very long and there are soft drinks and snacks while you wait. The boat ride from the airport jetty to the Kuda Hura is short and pleasant. As the stunning view of the azure turquoise waters against the green islands take us further and further away from the stressful reality of our daily lives being on the well appointed boat that is all white with soft baby blue upholstery reminds us of the famed luxury of Four Seasons properties all around the world. As the boat gently comes to a stop at the hotel jetty the first things youl see are the wonderful thatched roofs of the structures of the resorts. You will also see the adorable spa boat that ferries guests to a tiny island where the spa is located just a short disatnce away. On the jetty you are greeted by the friendliest angels the staff of the resort who give each guest their warmest personal attention right off the bat. Their greeting is quite accurately Welcome to ParadiseCheck in is a breeze as you sit in the lobby that looks out to the jetty and one side of the beach and you are served cooling drinks and refreshing cold towels as they brief you about the property. My partner and I chose the Romance package for our holiday which included a romantic four course dinner for two at the Indian restaurant Barabaru. So at check in we were presented with the menu choices and wine pairing options too just so everything is ready for our dinner on the second day. Next we are driven to our sunset water villa one of the electric golf carts that ubiquitously roam the resorts and are on call whenever any guest needs a ride to and from their rooms. It would have been nice if we had bicycles to cycle around the resort but the hotel staff said it was not provided and that too may bicycles around the island would make it seem too busy and less idyllic unlike what paradise is supposed to be. He has a point i suppose. The water villa is a dream within paradise. Beautifully appointed the ambiance of the room was a perfect blend of island chic with modern luxury. The bedroom was perfect with a sumptuous bed and all the modern amenities you could ask for. I loved the reading nook that had windows you can open and jump out of straight into your private pool. On the terrace of the villa we also absolutely loved the over water hammocks from which you can see the fish swimming below you in the crystal clear sea water and we loved the whole setting of the terrace. If I had any improvement to make It would just be to provide a roof over where the outdoor sofa is placed so that you can still sit outside when it drizzles or when the sun is too hot and you still want to be outside but in a bit of shade. The bathroom was spacious with its own access to the deck terrace and the large bathtub also has a view of it and the ocean beyond. The toilet has a hand bidet which for me is absolutely a hygiene essential. The restaurants at this resort are all excellent and because the resort is aware that as guests there you are not likely go anywhere else for the duration of your stay they try to create variety by changing the menus frequently and by having different themes to liven up the atmosphere. We joined the beach side barbecue on the first night and had our romantic dinner set on a private thatch roofed gazebo of the Indian restaurant right on the water complete with a traditional music trio playing live music in the background. We also tried the Italian restaurant and bar which were both amazing. Daily breakfast at the main restaurant Hura Cafe is great with a wide range of local and international dishes available. I loved the smoothies and the asian noodles station in particular. Needless to say all the restaurants were priced on the high side. but then one would not be staying at the Four Seasons if one were too concerned about such things right. Perhaps the hotel should consider a dining inclusive package for guests who just want to have it easier and know everything is already paid for ahead of their arrival. just a thought. The thing that left the most impact on my partner and I however was not the rooms nor the restaurants nor the many activities that you can get into during your stay. What took our breath away was how the staff treated us. There was so much genuine warmth and caring that was evident in how each of them interacted with us. In particular I would single out Irene Johan and Renata who went out of their way to ensure everything went perfectly well for us. They are the embodiment of Four Seasons philosophy of treat your guests how you wish to be treated. When the time came for us to sadly leave this Paradise we had a late flight well after the hotels noon check out time. But Four Seasons Kuda Hura did what very few other hotels would do unles you are a regular or a platinum member of their loyalty program they gave us an equally beautiful room with a plunge pool. to stay at until our departure time at 9 pm from the Hotel jetty. And we are just firs time guests. How is that for clasThat made all the difference for me and I immediately knew then that the Four Seasons Kuda Hura will be a place we would be returning to annually year after year for many years to come. On a final note There was a small incident where I carelessly left cash in the safe of our temporary room and only realized it when I was back home thousands of miles away. I called Kuda Hura immediately but for some reason i was not able to get through. My partner somehow managed to find Johans social media feed and i sent him a direct message explaining who I was and what had happened. Within minutes he called me back on his personal line and assured me that they will assist me all the way. I then was in touch with Renata who was very comforting and assisted me very attentively until the matter was resolved and i received my money back with minimum hassle absolutely no extra charge. I doubt any other hotel in the world would have been able to do that with such ease sincerity and kindness. The Four Seasons Kuda Hura is in one word. INCREDIBLEInded when the staff greet you with Welcome to paradise. on your arrival they are not kidding. They speak the truth. The search is over.

We recently stayed at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura for a week to celebrate my wifes special birthday and take in some time in the Maldives for a beach holiday. I have gone into a fair amount of detail in this review as a Maldives holiday is a big decision. But for quicker reading the summary below helps. If you are looking for a beach holiday that surpasses your expectations in every way then the Four Seasons is the perfect way to do it. It goes way beyond the luxury of the property itself every person goes out of their way to ensure you are having the time of your life. every minute of every day. We arrived as guests and left as a part of the family. Beyond the physical amenities and the incredible gastronomy of this resort what makes it truly special is the staff. Without exception everyone we encountered went way beyond our exepctations of a top class resort. it is very clear that this is something they pay attention to and everyone is personally accountable for making that magic happen. We had several opportunities to observe the team at work and what stood out was how that management team remained visible and active whether it is helping with daily duties no matter how menial or interacting with guests during each meal and during the day. If there is one thing that sets this resort head and shoulders above the rest it would be this. This is not our first stay at a Four Seasons property but it is by a large margin our best Four Seasons experience to date. ArivalWhile the airport itself is nothing to write home about the Four Seasons experience begins once you are through customs. We were escorted to a Four Seasons lounge and could relax while our luggage was transferred to a speedboat. The transfer to the resort then takes about 35 minutes whereafter you are welcomed to the resort by the management team. Villa style AcomodationWe stayed in two different villas the sunrise water villa and the sunrise garden villa. Both rooms are incredibly luxurious and I think it is a personal preference as to which view is preferable. The sunrise villas are identical to the sunset equivalents but on the opposite side of the island. Our rationale was that the best way to enjoy sunset is with a cocktail in hand meaning we would be watching it from the Sunset Lounge. we are happy with our decisionWe enjoyed having the 2 different rooms. Unles you are certain of your preferences opting for a few days in each is a good idea. Just remember that you are then packing up your hotel room mid way through your stay but the luggage transfer process happens seamlesly behind the scenes. Villas are spacious and sumptious. Each had a super king bed generously sized TV which you should never need Bose sound system complimentary Nespreso and tea making facilities and walk in closets. The bathrooms are amazing double basins supersized bath as well as indoor outdoor showers. The private pool is indulgent and lovely. The outdoor area around the villa has at a minimum sun loungers a day bed under a gazebo and a general area to enjoy the sun. Rooms are serviced twice a day as can be expected in a property of this category. But what I appreciated most was the attention to detail. Normally evening turndown focuses on just that the bed and a pair of slippers. At Kuda Hura I noticed how outside towels were refreshed clothes were neatly folded and one evening my book received a Four Seasons bookmark too. Pools and public areasKuda Hura is located on a fairly small island which means everything is in easy walking distance. Grounds are immaculately maintained. In addition to the private pools at each villa there are 2 main pools one of which is for adults only. The all access pool has a swim up bar perfect for when the need cocktail now impulse kicks in. Sun loungers are available around both pools and on all beaches. These areas are serviced which was welcome. And every few hours someone does a tour of duty with a smoothie or ice lolly of the day. The final daylight hours are best enjoyed from the Sunset Lounge near the lobby great cocktails with an amazing view. Alternatively the Reef Club bar is an outstanding alternative. The cocktail menu is limited but the team will make absoutely anything you prefer or will get creative when you ask them to. WiFi is offered throughout the resort including on our boats to and from the airport. Unles you pay extra it is adequate for email and messaging but not really video calling. RestaurantsThere are 4 restaurants on the property. All are excellent. Some nights offer a fixed menu while other nights are a la carte. I had recommend you spend a little time planning your evening dining when you arrive and make sure you try to get the right blend you are looking for. Breakfast is a lavish affair with a wide variety of global options. We enjoyed venturing beyond the full English into some of the oriental options on offer. You can expect to see a full selection in continental buffet cheeses cold meats fruits etc. The pastries offered each morning are out of this world expect to find several varieties of croissants danishes muffins doughnuts and other goodies. Eggs waffles and pancakes are cooked to order. A highlight for us was the juicing station also freshly prepared. Lunch is available at 2 restaurants. Alongside the adults only pool is Reef Club which offers Italian cuisine. You can expect fresh pizza pasta salads fish and the like. Portions are generous so consider having a starter and mains to share. The calamari is a winner. Alongside the larger pool is Cafe Hura where the breakfast area is set for lunch. Expect to see more international options on the menu. The highlight included fresh fish of the day and the lobster crab pasta. Presentation is superb and food is excellent. For dinner one is spoilt for choice. And every option is excellent. The Kandu Grill is an upmarket grill expect to see red meat fish and shellfish. The Reef Club transforms into an upscale Italian bistro overlooking the pool. Barabaru offers some of the best Indian food around. Finally Cafe Hura offers a more international menu complemented again by fish and shellfish. I had suggest you try them all you can not make a wrong choice. Every night were were overwhelmed by the selection. In particular the fresh seafood bought from local fishermen is moutwatering. In all restaurants for all meals presentation is world class. Portions are generous by European standards but it is worth indulging in at least 2 courses. Your waistline might not thank you but your tastebuds most certainly will. The wine list is generous and the selection by the glass will not disappoint. In addition the team can make any cocktail you choose. For the birthday evening we decided on the private BQ for our 2nd night at the resort. If you are looking to indulge this is the perfect choice. The team had created a private dining area on the beach and we had a dedicated chef and server for the evening. As for the food. some of the best sushi I have ever had made from locally sourced fish followed by shellfish fish and tenderloin. Dessert was equally impressive. Hint. if you opt for the BQ make sure you arrive hungryFitnes RecreationThe 24h fitness facility is generously appointed with weights and a good selection of cardio equipment. Sunrise yoga is lovely. Being an island there is a great selection of complimentary and paid for watersport activities. There is a lovely area on the sunrise side of the island for snorkeling which was always teeming with wildlife. We used the kayaks on the sunset side and were fortunate to see quite a few stingrays in the shallow water. The excursion to the western side of the athol to take in the turtles is well worth the time. Whatever your preference there will private or group activites to suit. Being in the Maldives it is essential to take in something to observe the marine life and the Four Seasons provides amazing options. Taking some time out when you arrive to plan any activities is well worth it as not all activities are available every day. SpaThe island spa for which the resort is renowned was being renovated while we were there. Temporarily the Four Seasons team had built Garden Spa which occupied a few of the garden villas. We thoroughly enjoyed their signature massage but opted to spend most of our time on the beach or around the pool. Environmental PolicyI was pleasantly surprised to see the steps being taken to reduce environmental impact. In particular bottled water still and sparkling is made on site in reusable bottles. Also shower gel and shampoo do not make use of plastics. The Four Seasons also plays host to one of 4 turtle rehabilitation centers in the Maldives. They run education programmes for kids and adults and have a team dedicated to protecting this important species. Finally the hotel supports a coral regeneration programme. it is not news that that the Maldives has suffered from the impact of coral bleaching. This tragedy is also evident during snorkeling. But the positive impact of the programme is also visible. We enjoyed spending time with the team to hear about their programmes and it is clear they appreciate the support of the hotel too. Special MentionsFinaly the resort hosts a behind the scenes tour. If you are interested in seeing how the magic happens this is well worth the 90 minute investment. I found the scale of operations astounding. Clearly the resort does not have city conveniences and yet still have to provide a first world experience. And that takes a lot of work. I was able to observe the staff dining facilities the engineering facilities including power generation and water desalination and finally the food storage preparation and kitchen areas. Clearly providing a world class dining experience where you require military style logistics is quite an endeavour. And it has to be matched with a team that can prepare everything on site. And that includes a bakery that operates 21 hours a day. And FinalyAs mentioned above the stand out is the entire team and how well they work together. To experience it as a guest is very special indeed. There are a few folk that stand out to us in ensuring that our experience for 1 week was truly a slice of heaven on earth. These are Razaq in the Recreation team Amito in the restaurant Danu the resident cocktail magician the servers Mohamed Das and Rajendra Branka Maximilien Giovani and Joseph. Aflah and Tamil deserve special mention too for ensuring our BQ evening was so incredible. And these are just the names we could remember but should not be viewed as a slight on those we do not immediately recall.", "offset": [483, 618], "date": "2019-11-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "9fe86c2e-5ece-40cf-aad6-644f6c4d7a21", "sentence": "An unforgettable festive season. What an experience. Our family spent almost two weeks over the festive season in Kuda Hura and we could have stayed many moreThe nature of the island and its surrounding waters are beautiful no doubt with many activities to fill the day however the truly differentiating element of our stay was the entire Kuda Hura team and their exceptional service. Nail from housekeeping always greeted us with a smile and a positive attitude while carrying out his daily duties. The entire breakfast team was always attentive and quick to anticipate our needs and we looked forward to our daily morning conversations with the team. Osama went above beyond to cater to all of our culinary cravings and was happy to recommend a great selection whenever we were undecided. Giovani created a fun festive atmosphere on the resort regardless of the time of day. Also a huge shoutout goes out to Maxime who really embodied the years board game theme and brought it to life everyday. He also ignited a new competition in the family when he taught my brothers a variety of new board games. A mention should also go out to the bands who performed every night. As for the activities Behnan offered wonderful relaxing yoga classes which were adapted to the appropriate level as well as massages both of which helped work through muscle tension for one of our family members. In the water sports centre Firash was very enthusiastic and spent many hours with my brothers who quickly went from beginner wake boarders to confidently throwing tricks by the end of our stay. At the dive centre Tony and Susane helped two of our family members who were first time divers to feel incredibly safe and comfortable in the water. They offered thorough explanations and briefings and offered the opportunity to see some great sea life while remaining in a comfortable environment for beginners. I completed my PADI Advanced Open Water certification with Moose who made the entire experience so seamless and fun. Despite not having dived for 10 months I quickly felt comfortable again as Moose guided me through all of the briefings with detailed information about each dive site and helped me improve the different skills such as underwater photography that I undertook for my certification. I even completed a night dive which was a completely unique experience. The dive centres facilities itself are top notch and the varied amount of dive offerings meant you could see something new everyday. On our dives we saw nurse sharks white and black tip sharks sting rays giant moray eels and a variety of schools of fish to name a few. I highly recommend it. Overall we had an incredible time and were very sad to leave we can not wait to be back. Hats off to Randy and the entire team.", "offset": [2288, 2359], "date": "2020-02-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}]}
