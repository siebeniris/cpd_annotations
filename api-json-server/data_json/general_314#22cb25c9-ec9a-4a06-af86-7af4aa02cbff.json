Coffee stations inadequately serviced during our scheduled breaks. An inordinately long time for food service at our gala. A dismissive attitude when one of our table mates indicated that they had a severe allergy. A bar with only one bartender scheduled for a two hour break in our program they knew our timing. The bar on our last night there closing at midnight basically losing our on thousands of dollars in business. We also had issues with the billing of our rooms but that was more to do with Westin corporate rather than the the hotel itself.

As our meeting included a presentation the dinner was buffet style served before to be consumed during the presentation. The buffet layout was as follows Cutlery followed by chopped lettuce croutons and dressing a mixed salad with cucumbers tomatoes and onions followed by what seemed to be a pasta dish with mixed vegetables a breaded chicken cutlet dish salmon with a tomato sauce accompanied by standard white bread rolls and for dessert individual canoli mini tiramisu and macarons. It would have been nice to have labels on the dinner menu items to know exactly what was being served. Additionally as we consumed our dinner the server repeatedly asked us for coffee tea during the meal and if we said no at that point she removed our cups. The other server was quite attentive in replenishing our drinks for the initial part of the evening however after the presentation had started and we had begun our meals our servers did not come by to replenish our wine beverages or clear our dishes. Although it was a buffet style dinner once the presentation had begun approximately 30 mins into the meal the servers began clearing the buffet table so that individuals could not go back to the table if they wanted to. They also began clearing the unused tables of lines chairs and cutlery while we were still there.

They charge 120 a day to park your car outdoors. Room service was prompt. The food was so so. An advertised ground chuck hamburger in their menu was actually a frozen processed piece of meat. Note to hotel restaurant manager. if you advertise ground chuck it should be ground chuck. The hallways are super dull and dark. Air conditioning was extremely noisy when starting and stopping. It almost sounded like someone was entering the room. Cleaning of room was not thorough. Lots of restaurants nearby walking andor a few minutes by car.
