With more complaints finally was moved to the smelliest side of hotel. Colleagues of mine also had a poor sleep as Police Dept called to stop crazy party at 2 am. Security were useless as were the yet again pointless front desk staff. Maybe this is Hyat policy. Require the front desk staff to frustrate clients and try to get clients to put shut up. my company left nearly 250 this week at Schaumburg with monthly visits to IL we might try the Renaissance Courtyard etc each month as the only good things about the Hyat Regency Schaumburg is the location good breakfasts friendly shuttle driver and free parking. and for bad long wait for hot water poor front desk staff smell on 5th floor coridor 5305356 in effective security staff.", "offset": [758, 1020], "date": "2015-05-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "b21a06a3-772b-4c24-981a-52ba5ca20b01", "sentence": "Great value and location.
