This was our familys first time in Cancun so it is hard to compare to other hotels in town but there were some really great things about the hotel and some less than ideal qualities. Positives our 8 year old loved the kids club as the staff were lovely and enthusiastic. She met people from Mexico Japan and US and wants to keep in touch. The service overall was excellent from the restaurants to the concierge to the maid service. The restaurants provided lots of options and were generally quite good. Loved the Cevicheria and the breakfasts. I got a good massage at the spa and the beach was nice though the water was rough. Finally the best part of the trip were the off site adventures Chichenitza scuba across the street at Waterworld rep at Condesa was great snorkeling and cenotes with adventuras mayas and swimming with dolphins. Negatives the room size for a family of four was a bit small. The bathtub was chipped and was so high that if you have small kids or mobility issues it would be a challenge. The pool was cold and unfortunately so were the hot tubs. There is a gym in the spa that is free but you do not have access to the working hot tub steam room or dressing room unles you buy a spa treatment. Overall I was satisfied with the hotel though it was expensive. On the ride to the airport the other couples complaints about their hotel made me feel better about our experience.", "offset": [1100, 1247], "date": "2015-01-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2fefd82d-a8b8-46ff-a4f3-9969ec2dcbd7", "sentence": "The answer is NO.

The whole place is old and tired and in desperate need of a renovation. I do not feel we got what we paid for. We had a facial and body scrub at the spa. I booked it as a couples treatment with my husband. They forgot to put us in the couples treatment room so I asked them to put us in it. It took them 10 minutes to set up the next room. They still finished the treatment on time and it felt very rushed so we did not enjoy it. We did not complain at the spa reception but we did write this on the comment cards. The man on reception saw our cards and said he would have the manager contact us the next day to rectify the mistake. Of course we did not hear from anyone. Also during my facial for some reason the therapisted plaited the end of my hair then spent a long time fiddling with it. I asked what was wrong and she said nothing was wrong.

I booked this hotel because the TripAdvisor rating was 14 in all of Cancun. We were sadly disappointed. Maybe because our last trip to Cancun was in 205 and we stayed at the Cancun Palace gone after Hurricane Wilma. Our expectations were to be in awe as we had been then. It was a far cry from the Palace resort experience. Good 1 Most of the staff was very acomodating from beginning to end except the security staff which is detailed below. Had it not been for the remaining staff I would give this hotel a Terrible rating2 Rosato Kalmia el Mexicano Kambu and the cevicheria all had good food and friendly attentive staff. Juan Jose J was awesomeBad 1 SECURITY. Do NOT loose your belingings because security staff is rude and condescending. I lost my iPhone Friday evening. I spoke with the people at the tables where I had been sitting and they suggested the waitress took it. Security was rude when I told them what the other folks had said and then insulted me professionally in front of my wife. This was inexcusable in any hospitality seting2 LACK OF OUTDOOR SEATING. The hotel had no place out of the weather to sit other than the main lobby. It rained the first four days of our visit and there was no covered area outside to sit and socialize. The lobby bar was busy after the pool bar closed at dark which meant the lobby was very crowded and noisy. Very little air flow through the lobby created some rather humid conditions which in a crowd is not a pleasant experience3 RESTAURANTS The hours of the restaurants were ridiculously complicated. Rosato el Mexicano and San Telmo opened at 530pm and only for a few hours. el Mexicano was not open two of the eight nights we were there and Rosato was not open this past Friday night. Kambu closed before dinner hours each day. The pizza oven by the upper pool were unreliable at best. And room servicwe gives yoyu a canned 30 minute estimate for delivery but likely it will take closer to an hour to get your order4 ROOM CONDITIONS Our room was a bit run down. We had a ground floor garden view with a small terrace out back. There were not enough seats for all the terraces so neighbors constantly took chairs from others if they need outdoor seating. There were broken stone tiles on the terraces which gave it a very run down lok5 SLIPPERY CONDITIONS. Granted it rained our first four days and I am not holding the hotel responsible for weather conditions. However all the surfaces around the pool and in the brezeways between rooms were VERY hazardous when the slightest bit of moisture was present. The staff were very busy trying to squegy the areas as fast as possible but it was rather pointles6 WIFI. Our wifi was good for the first few days but by Wednesday it had gone out in the room. The lobby wifi was still working. Istead of listening to the issue we had in the Sun Tower instead the concierge immediately transferred my call to Tech Support with the provider and thn the wait was too long to hold on.

This was an incredible vacation. The staff was amazing the hotel was so beautiful and clean and the food and drinks were the best. Upon your arrival you will enter a beautiful grand open lobby were you will be greeted with cold beer and water. We got upgraded to a ocean room two for the price of one I have read some reviews where they were charged and some they were given a free upgrade I guess it depends on your luck. My room was huge and the bed was very comfortable but I guess that depends on your preference of mattress. The rooms could use a little updating but it was nt too bad. The room staff was great and cleaned your room everyday and were also very accommodating to my grandma who has allergies. The restraints served great food the service at night especially in the Mexican restaurant seemed slow but there also was not very many waiters either. Our favorite restaurant was Kambu out by the pool lunch was delicious I recommend the fajitas and dinner was delicious too. Breakfast at the buffet every morning always had different options every morning and they were very good as well. Shout out to two of our favorite waiters. J down at Kambu and Alberito at the fish restaurant who took very good care of our family. The gym had nice machines and plenty of options to fit in a good work out and seemed very clean. I had a massage down by the beach which was AMAZING and definitely worth it. A couple things that this hotel lacked night life there was none really except some shows at night and the one I saw that ruined all the shows for me was the clown performance which was honestly kind of freaky. We went out a couple of nights down in cancun I recommend Carlos and Charlies for something to do at night. Like I said before it could use a little updating. The elevators were slow one was broken part of our stay and looked like it had been pryed open. The air in the rooms could be a little colder and the ceiling fan in my room was very unsteady so after a while it made a lot of noise.

One of the chefs from the Hotel Josue greeted us and invited us right away to the restaurant. It was a very pleasant warm welcoming by the entire staff. We were celebrating my son and my niece birthday and they made sure they got an extraordinary experience during our stay. We were delivered a very tasty cake to our room to celebrate my son birthday and my niece. While eating at the restaurants they were also served personalized desserts for them on their birthday. We were treated like royalty to say it on simpler words. The very last day we were prepared a good bye meal that was prepared by chef Manuel I believe was his name that was very tasty. Also the waiter J or Juan Jose was extremely friendly throughout the week.

Our Mexico experience overall was a good one. However the hotel experience was disappointing. You are not informed that there are 2 out of the 3 buildings shut down for renovation. I knew going in that there would be renovations going on by my own research the hotel does not tell you when booking and it was worse than I thought. One night the water was shut off until 4 am. This was unacceptable in my opinion. The first day we arrived we saw the renovations going on and you basically walk through a small closed off hall by boards to get to the one building that is open. We were excited to be in Mexico so we were not going to let the construction mess it up. Later that day we met a group of people in the pool that had experienced money being stolen from the locked safe. We did not think anything of it until it happened to people in our group. The hotel manager promised to take care of the situation and did nothing about it. Which was very upsetting. We knew the cash more than likely would not be recovered because anyone can say cash was stolen however a simple kind act to make sure their stay was good after that would have made a big difference. The room had a nice view however it always had a sticky musty feeling to it. Especially the bed. All of the food was sub par except for the Italian place. That was good.

The morning buffet lunch and dinner buffet was small with little to no change in food. The restaurants fed us mediocre food if you did not want to have an up charge for every meal deviating away from the all inclusive part of our package. We made a reservation for the steakhouse which you would think would have all of the common steaks on the menu they did but it was all for an up charge. The hotel itself looks a bit outdated and dirty on the first impression. The quality of the hotel is essentially really nothing special. What really made our vacation great was the pool service staff and especially the chef of Kambu who found us every day and brought us his very own specials grilled seafood.
