I have stayed in many fancy hotels in Dubai Ritz One Only Royal Mirage The Westin Mina Seyahi but this property has to take the cake. Let me start with the location located on the quiet area of Jumeirah Road far from the crazy traffic of Dubai because you are surrounded mostly by residential villas. This also makes for a wonderful skyline view if your room is on the non sea view side of the hotel. The rooms are massive. Even bigger than the standard rooms at Westin Mina Seyahi which they always boasted were the biggest standard rooms in Dubai. You have the signature large walk in closet and also a large bathroom with a built in TV behind the mirror. Breakfast buffet charged extra is amazing you feel you walked into a deli. You have stations offering everything you can imagine and a beautiful outside seating area. The staff are everywhere and they jump in whenever you need something typical Four Seasons. The lobby has a nice lounge where you can have a quiet tea or coffee with two talented ladies playing the harp and flute not your typical piano. There is also a cigar lounge perfect for short business meetings and talks. While you are there or even just visiting Dubai you HAVE to eat at Nusrat. The famous Turkish restaurant which is a meat heaven. Nusrat was refusing to open outside of Turkey but finally his first opening is at the Four Seasons Dubai. But make sure to book ahead cause it gets REALLY busy. This place has won my attention and my love it is my new place to stay in Dubai. Well worth the wait.", "offset": [1230, 1283], "date": "2015-01-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "5f9a1f24-2a12-40e7-afd4-62a3fbc8407f", "sentence": "Uber luxury tradition and a lack of pretension in one amazing package. Travelling to this breathtakingly beautiful new addition to the Four Seasons brand with children 13 10 6. The interiors are stunning and exude luxury and are absolutely five star. The quality finishes and attention to detail are exceptional. Staff are welcoming and friendly and are attentive to every need. Children are welcomed and amply provided for. We are staying in rooms 204 206 which are accessible from the main corridor by one door which opens on to a small foyer which has 2 doors leading off to each bedroom. The rooms are enormous the marble bathrooms are gorgeous with bath separate rain shower double vanity private toilet bidet. Both rooms have a gorgeous balcony overlooking the pool sea with lovely seating and chairs. Slippers robes gorgeous bathroom amenities pool bag free water in the room provided at all times. Lovely treats are left in the room every time we have been away from the room we return to find a beautiful and thoughtful gift left behind for both the adults and children. Darya the Guest Relations manager is amazing. The pool men are lovely and no sooner have you sat by the pool they come and provide water bottles in a little cooler and set up your towels. The pool has a lifeguard on duty too. It is HOT here. currently 9 am and it feels like 35 degrees so after the amazing buffet breakfast we are already by the pool. Buffet caters for everyone and I can not fault it the service is outstanding. I really want to go on and on about the styling and the design which is exceptional. Absolutely luxurious without the pretentious feel there is no looking down on anyone and everyone is treated beautifully by all staff. Sometimes when you travel to exclusive establishments with children you feel paranoid that your every move will be monitored however I have never felt anything less than comfortable in this hotel. The hotel is only 6 months old and everything is running perfectly. Room service is very quick and is served like it would be in the restaurant. Location on the beach is fantastic. The pools cater for adults and babies. There are massages and other treatments available by the pool including pedicure manicure for ladies and their little ladies also. The exterior is Arab in a gorgeous way and that is what first drew me to this hotel. I am absolutely in love and planning my next trip back already and my kids have already expressed their desire to move here. The Four Seasons have really made their mark in Dubai with this property and I have found this property to be worth every penny. I will not bother investigating any other property when I return I will be very happy to return to this piece of paradise.", "offset": [1995, 2071], "date": "2015-06-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "26ab9a2d-dfd6-4feb-86c3-92e2110b8fd7", "sentence": "Good Addition to Dubai Hospitality.

I was at the resort for business meetings for a week. This was my longest trip away from my 2year old daughter and needless to say I was dreading itOnce I got to the resort I was super pleased. The weather was lovely the skies bright blue and the sun shining. Perfect set up for a great startI stayed in the sea view suite with a lovely view of the hotel pools garden the beach and the sea. The room was gorgeous. Everything from the bathtub oh the bathtub. to the dress decor and the huge balcony all wonderful. What stood out was the service I was taken care of by the chefs the restaurant staff I feel terrible for not remembering their names. This was the chef from Kerela and the two guys in the restaurant from Bangalore and Delhi Rohit and S. They made me some wonderful tea and did not give me an opportunity to miss eating at home. I have definitely packed on a few pounds in my stay thereMy meeting manager Maher was absolutely a dream to work with. Everything went so smooth. I had to think of stuff and it happened. Sumit was supporting our break service and was fabulous. The best part of the week was having these wonderful meeting rooms with natural sunlight and a little balcony right outside. It made working so easy. Great food great service perfect weather and lovely hospitality. As if I was a guest and being taken care of by family. Thanks everyone you have made a lovely impression and I would love to be backOne of the highlights was the Turkish coffee at the Shai salon gorgeously served see pics. The view from the Mercury lounge was quite nice. If I had to pick an area for improvement it would be housekeeping.

We had booked for a weekend dinner for 6 at their Ramadan tent and at the time of booking were informed that we would be in a non smoking area which we were ok with. Once we reach the hotel we are taken to the restaurant SOUQ for a seat which we protested as we could go to the restaurant at any time and this was not the Ramadan tent. It is interesting to note that the Hotel let us walk out of the Resturant which was mostly deserted rather that giving us an option of dining at the restaurant by removing the minimum spend condition that the Ramadan tents have as this was the Resturant The staff who took our reservation did not inform us that the non smoking area was in the Resturant and not in the Ramadan tent. It was a total waste of time and was disappointed with the way the Restaurant manager handled the situation. Not expected from a chain like Four Seasons.

Room we stayed at a corner suite. it is very spacious it has two balconies two full bathrooms a living room and a big bed room. The interiors and decor were just ok but the suite has everything you would need in a room.

I had late breakfasts at the Shai lounge I thought the experience was just OK but the service was not very refined they need improvements on food quality service and communication. To the contrary we ordered room service and the food was so delicious and the room service guy was so professional and presentable.

We were told tomatoes were optional extra in a salad. Side salad was poor. This is very disappointing for the Four Seasons brand.

I am not one to write reviews but felt compelled to discuss the amazing experience and service I have had here. In particular the pool staff are incredible and work very hard to make sure your trip is as comfortable as possible. Leoman Madushka Shehan and Ramy are just a few names to mention who work in the pool area and despite the intense heat their energy and exceptional level of service is always maintained. This is my second time at Four Season Dubai and I can not express enough the level of elegance and attention to detail. It is impeccable from the moment u walk into the lobby you are greeted warmly by the reception staff. The rooms are huge spacious with a big balcony too and I can guarantee you will not sleep in a more comfortable bed. The pool area is stunning with a kids and adult area overlooking the beach and beautifully maintained gardens. The breakfast is to die for spoilt for choice fresh and just out of this world. The interior is beautiful you will be in awe as you walk around this stunning hotel. But what truly makes this hotel is the staff. The names I can mention are endless. From the lobby staff to house keeping the pool staff and those in the restaurant. They look after you very well and always go that extra mile to make sure your stay is as enjoyable as it can be. The atmosphere is remarkable and without doubt it is the staff that make your stay and experience so memorable.

Warning this is a gushing review because there is literally nothing bad about this hotel. I stayed here for three nights on a long layover after a long flight from Los Angeles and before a trip to Africa. I can not speak highly enough of this hotel and the Four Seasons staff. The property was beautiful and quiet and cool and lovely. It smelled great in all the areas of the hotel and my room was such an incredible retreat from the city and the heat. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was undeniable five star luxury. The staff were so diligent about housekeeping and the evening visit to prepare the room for bedtime was wonderful. Despite it being ramadan the hotel was serving breakfast and room service 24 hrs. The breakfast buffet was so varied and interesting and the staff were so attentive and patient. Five stars through and through. The pool area was beautiful and the quiet pool is a particularly nice touch. The staff could be called by pressing a button next to your lounger and they provided plenty water and towels throughout the day.

Sometimes we all need a little time out to take time for ourselves and switch off from the world. that is why choosing the perfect hotel is important to give you just that. If you are looking for a hotel of the more mature and certain class then this is perfect. No brash or loud people running around or jumping into the pool just elegance. I chose the four seasons Jumeriah resort and I have to say the level of service the friendless and facilities met all expectations. The room was large and provided all required amenities. From a comfy bed a sofa to chill out on and look out onto the balcony to the relaxing bath tub everything was perfect for a relaxing atmosphere. The room services came with a tablet for easy access to review what to do where to eat and a list of all the hotel has to offer. The TV came with an excellent selection of TV channels which is always a plus. For me though it was all about the pool and the sea. I was looking forward to relaxing by the pool on a comfy lounger looking out at the ocean. The polside staff we excellent attentive and the little touches of refreshments cold towels were a pleasant touch. The fact that the hotel separates a family pool to an adult pool is rare in some of the hotels in Dubai but makes such a difference. Both pools are large and offer couple and family cabanas if like me you do not want to be fully exposed to the sun. In the evenings the choice of restaurants bars or lounge areas is vast. From Coya to Hendricks to one of the sea food restaurants providing views of the ocean I defy anyone who says there was not much to do. So for me Would i go back. Most definite.
