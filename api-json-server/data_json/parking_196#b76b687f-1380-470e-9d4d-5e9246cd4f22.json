The rooms were just your standard modern hotel room. Everything was clean and all the expected amenities were to be found. Our group of five stayed two nights in two separate rooms and there were not any complaints among the lot of us. The hotel is within walking distance of restaurants and shops and crucially right next to the red line metro stop which will take you into the heart of tourist DC in about twenty minutes. it is nice to be able to drive here park in the deck 12night and avoid the hassle of driving in DC at all.

Was pleasantly surprised with the hotel. The customer service was excellent. I really believe they do not have the word no in their vocabulary. The rooms are clean and nicely appointed but feel some minor maintenance would elevate the quality overall. We did have a couple issues during our Saturday thru Tuesday stay but the hotel staff solved 1 quickly and without any question but the other was a difficult one since it involved other guests. All I can say is The walls are not thick enough to mask the banging of a headboard or squeal of ecstasy from the adjoining room. Very uncomfortable to get any sleep after midnight and into the early morning with all the noise and very embarrassing since our daughter was staying with my wife and I I was in no position to handle myself as well. I know the hotel staff tried to rectify but to no avail it just amplified the situation. They offered to move us at 2 am but at that point it would have been our second move in three days. We were not there on pleasure but for a funeral so this did not helpOn a brighter note. The continental breakfast was very good with excellent choices during our stay. The attendants of the breakfast were very attentive nice helpful and full of smiles. In fact all of the employees were happy and helpful and it helped us to relax. Though what I am assuming was the Hotel Convenience Store Owner who helped me while purchasing a 3 soda he was very rude to me since he did not have his updated charge list for the day and I did not bring cash down from my room. Heck if I had cash I would have bought the 250 soda from the vending machine on my floor. He basically treated me like I walked off the street to try and screw him out of a soda that cost him 25c. My suggestion call the front desk and ask If I am staying there instead of treating me a deceitful person. He did give in and made me sign a receipt but not without saying I do not know you why should I trust you The location of the hotel is excellent. it is right at the entrance to the Metro. Also its only a couple blocks to great food choices and a short drive to shopping sightseeing and additional restaurants. I also liked the ease in which you can access the major highways to get wherever you need to go. A short scenic drive through Chevy Chase and your into DC. We got around with no major traficIf booking and you have a vehicle try to book a package with free parking it saves you money and it is hassle freI would stay here again for a short trip top DC area.

Even with the Construction. We stayed at the Hyat Regency without choice my husbands work booked us to stay here while visiting local area for holiday party. This hotel is a 5 star hotel by far with a beautiful lobby great staff and beautiful modern traveler friendly rooms EVEN with the horrible parking garage construction experience. I will include the bad part first please read threw the entire review because the room and hotel itself makes up for the garage mess and keeps it at a solid 5 star rating. Upon arriving and entering the parking garage we where furious. They are clearly doing MAJOR construction in the parking garage which is attached to the hotel. We spent about 30 minutes trying to find parking. some signs say go right then left you literally have no clue where to park. We just kept circling around the garage in a dark dust cloud of a garage. Lots of other cars where confused as well as everyone is looping around in the parking garage which has construction signs equipment tarps wires everywhere. major mess. We finally found parking. The jackhammers where so loud we had to cover our ears as we covered our faces in our jackets to shield us from the dust cloud. Every single car parked in the garage had about a inch of brown dust construction grime from all the work going on 247. The elevators inside the garage did not work either so we had to find our way out of the garage dragging our bags threw the filth. Upon checking in the lady behind the counter was very welcoming and made us feel better after the mess of the garage. She said because we where so upset about the garage she was going to give us a room up on the 8th floor quiet up there and a great view. The lobby was beautiful and besides one tarp on what seems like escalators that were not working it was not any construction in the lobby that was major. I love their glass elevators that climb up into the bee comb style lobby. Each floor wraps around and you can look up and see each floor in a very modern feel. The hallways where clean and beautiful. Our room was just as lovely. For 200 a night it was well worth it. Most hotels lack the most important features to make it a comfortable stay and here they nailed each important thing well and beyond lots of room comfort cleanliness tech lots of outlets. can not get over how room LARGE and very spacious the room was. The carpets where spotless the beds where fresh clean and the bathroom was spotless clean. The beds where very comfortable and the TV that faced our beds was a 60 inch or larger with great quality images. I really enjoyed the color theme of the room and the modern wallpaper and bedposts. I really loved all the outlets in this room. sometimes hotels you have to fight for spots to charge your tech gear not here. They even had USB ports in the walls with the outlets so you do not even need a iphone brick you can just plug in your usb to the wall. The room is VERY modern and tech approved. It feels like a brand new room to be honest very nice. My favourite part of the room was the beautiful white bathroom. What a beauty with great lighting. It has a large walk in vanity area that has the large sink area bathroom towel rack and makeup vanity attached to the wall. The actual bathroom that has the shower and toilet was in another door within the vanity area great feature. You can be using the actual sink and mirror while your guest can be in the actual bathroom closed at the same time. The mirror was bright great for ladies putting on makeup and had a digital clock IN the miror which is great because while getting ready in the morning you have a clock to watch. Great modern tech add. Very roomy closet is in the vanity room as well which includes your room safe. The hotel may be going threw a lot of work but it still will leave you feeling great. The only negative was the parking garage which once you bear threw the mess and park and enter the hotel you will be impressed. We loved our room got great sleep and enjoyed our stay.

Instead we get an extra charge and it was from that. If you want to charge people just for water why does not it say you will get charged 4 right up front. Pathetic.
