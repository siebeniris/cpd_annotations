My boyfriends company is working at the convention center for the week. I decided to tag along for part of the stay to have a little mini vacation. The property is beautiful. The location is perfect.

We plan on seeing the Lightening game on Tuesday. Amalie Arena is literally RIGHT across the street. It is so prefect. You have to valet and it is 24 dollars for overnight. If you come prepared for that it is actually awesome. I can see why someone would be upset if they did not know that before hand. The front can get really busy and congested I recommend calling ahead and having them pull your car up for you. It is worth it and really stress free that way. The only downside for me is the fact that the pool is closed. I did see a review on here before we came stating that the pool was closed. I was hoping it was just the pool itself and not the whole deck. But it is the entire area. I believe they are resurfacing and making it nicer. You can not really complain they are improving so. You are allowed to use Embassy Suites pool. It is a Spa Swim Pool. it is 104 degrees all year round. It got a little cold the days I was here so it actually worked out really nice. It is located on the 3rd floor rooftop. They have about 30 lounge chairs and a few tables. It was not busy at all so there was plenty of room. I would LOVE to come back when the pool renovations are done. The pictures of it before reno look amazing so I can not imagine how great it will be when done. As for the room it is pretty basic but nice. There is not a fridge or microwave just a cooler that keeps drinks around 50 degrees. I believe you can request a fridge though.

After each stay at a Mariot I get a survey which asks if I was greeted as a Mariot Rewards member. It \u2019s been 5050 in the past and when I checked in here once again there was no mention of my membership. My wife and I took a shuttle to the hotel from the airport and when we arrived at about 40 on a Saturday afternoon the hotel was bustling with guests. We did not have to wait in line to check in and had a great room overlooking the river with a private balcony. The room had 2 double beds a refrigerator and a coffee maker. It also had wireless wired Internet access. We did n\u2019t eat at any of the on site restaurants but we did order a pizza from room service. We would recommend ordering a pizza from an outside restaurant. We also did not take advantage of their spa fitness center or rooftop pool we spent all of our time ofsite enjoying the Florida Aquarium Ybor City and the Tampa Riverwalk. Our rating of the Mariot is based on 2 issues. First they have a door hanger that will let you earn rewards points if you forego room service. We hung this on Sunday and Monday but took it off Tuesday. Our stay was until Thursday. No one ever serviced our room. I know we could have called the front desk if we needed anything but obviously there is a disconnect between the door sign and the staff. The second issue was the day we checked out. We arrived at the front entrance at 630 AM to await our Shuttle to the airport. At about 635 AM construction workers closed off the driveway to the entrance. No one told us I just happened to notice someone moving orange road cones and walked down the driveway to see what was going on. We had to walk out to the main road to catch our shuttle. It was no big deal but reflects Mariot \u2019s commitment to their customers.

I just was not expecting anything like that in a hotel of this level. And they did not deny anything once they were confronted with their profession.

Pre concert stay to see a famous Beatle so hotel was booked out and rooms were at a premium. When we arrived we were very pleasantly surprised with an unexpected upgrade. We received a suite room on a high floor overlooking the channel and could not have been happier. Just the two of us in this huge suite with two separate balconies and great views. The lobby is clean huge welcoming and fantastic. Walk out the back to the channel and there is a jogging biking walking trail right behind the hotel. This concrete path goes from the hotel to various points take a right and walk along the channel past the Tampa Convention Center and beyond and I bet you will see the local pirate ship. Take a left and walk past Amalie Arena the Aquarium and cruise ship port further on down if you like seeing big cruise ships. The location of this hotel is literally right across the street from the Amalie Arena and the Tampa Convention Center. The public trolley a real one on rails has a covered stop just outside the front door of the hotel as well take this trolley to Ybor City for nightlife or to just eat lunch dinner at the very famous Columbia Restaurant a landmark in the area since 1905 the oldest restaurant in the state. Spanish style as in Spain not Mexico. Get the 1905 salad if you are not afraid of garlic hand made at your table and get a sangria as well. Cool gift shop with cigars and Spanish pottery next door. Make reservations for this restaurant or you will never get inThe suite room we had at the Mariot was beautiful clean spacious and high up. Had a safe coffee maker sofa bed king bed table chairs on each of the balconies for morning coffee very lovely.

Request the channel view to see boats or a city view if you like to see the pretty lights at night. The outside pool area in this hotel in on the third floor rooftop. You can walk around the pool deck edges and see the Amalie Arena Convention Center or busy people below going to and fro while you relax with a drink. Pool is big and the whole pool area was recently refurbished and it is clean. there is a pool bar as well and you can order food from a limited menu at the pool get the famous Cuban sandwich. will not disapointFod at this hotel is not typical hotel food. it is really good but you are going to pay a high price for the convenience. Do the breakfast buffet or do like we did and order room service and enjoy it on your balcony to order breakfast hang a tag on your room door the night before with your selections and they will deliver it next morning at a time of your choosing. there is a small Starbucks on site as well. there is an American style restaurant in the lobby area typical fare but good a breakfast buffet dining room then there is more formal fare either inside or sit and eat chanelside on the patio restaurant in the back. there is a more formal dining room as well but not sure if it is open at all times or just special occasions. There are boat docks behind the hotel so theoretically you could navigate your boat right up the channel to the hotel and dock. Not sure how that works or how much you have to pay for the boat slip but it is an option. Ok enough about all the good points heres a few areas that may or may not need improvement depending on your point of view. the sofa couch in the suite looked 1970s style burnt orange color a bit worn and probably should be replaced. Some of the threshold floor tiles between rooms were cracked and needed replaced. The pool area is beautiful but they need to put out more umbrellas for shade. In the hot afternoon Florida sun you can burn almost instantly and they only had about 6 or 8 chairs under umbrellas and 4 or 5 clamshell chairs with limited cover. Not aceptable put out more shade umbrellas please. Parking tip if you like to self park there is a parking garage that charges daily just a block or so from front of the hotel right next to Amalie Arena. They have valet parking as well and the use the same garage for valet. There are uncovered lots as well nearby you can pay to use but why do that when you can use the garage. There is no on site parking here but the garage is literally a block away and easily walk able. Wi Fi tip join the Mariot Rewards program for free Wi Fi. Or you will pay. The Wi Fi was not anything to brag about and could have been faster just in my humble opinion. A word on Starbucks the Starbucks in the hotel is small and very limited and they close sometime in the mid afternoon. This is really not a full service Starbucks. If you want the full Starbucks experience there is an Embassy Suites hotel right across the trolley tracks from the Mariot very close and the Embassy Suites downstairs lobby has a full service Starbucks with food and it is open I believe all the time. Walk over there if you are picky about your Starbucks. it is accessible from the outside on the first floor of the Embassy Suites so you do not have to actually go into the lobby and it is very close to the parking garage as well. If your attending an Amalie Arena concert or Convention Center event here and the Mariot is booked out there is an Embassy Suites across the street. I have stayed there as well. it is not nearly as impressive as the Mariot and it is not on the walking jogging path and it is not on the channel. But if the Mariot is booked it is a good second option. hint Embassy Suites has an uncovered walking bridge from their second floor over to the Tampa Convention Center. But I had still prefer the Mariot no question. I hope my review helped the Mariot Tampa Waterside is a great rather upscale place to stay for families couples or business travelers.

First and foremost i travel a lot and this is actually the first review i have ever written. i usually come to the Mariot waterside property 3 5 times a year to meet up with a business partner. The newly renovated rooms are beautiful and the hotel is gorgeous. But this last trip to Mariot the customer service was at a all time low. I remember the pool service about 6 moths ago was the best i ever experienced at any property but over this weekend it was terrible. i ordered room service food from freshbite or something like that the bartenders told me 30 45 minutes i said that s kinda long but fine. the food came up an hour 10 minutes later and i watched it from a distance on the other side of the pool and the server dropped it off at the bar. it stayed at the bar for another 10 minutes and i finally went to the bar and asked is this my food. the guy bartender said yes you have to come and get it. Well i did nt know i had to get my food all the way across the pool. Number 2 i waited at least 5 10 minutes a drink. pool service has dropped dramatically since last time i visited. so we decided to eat in the newly renovated restaurant garrison tavern. it was nt that busy for a Saturday night i ordered a burger that was average nothing special and it also took 45 minutes to come out. The server was real nice and he said this is the usual for our kitchen i m sorry. i thought that was funny but he gave good service better than the pool. I hope all these problems get fixed soon cause its def not Mariot brand standard.", "offset": [966, 1034], "date": "2019-04-18", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "6148c78a-afcb-4b30-9297-693ecb731347", "sentence": "Awesome pool area. My family and I recently took a vacation to Tampa. Hotel was great. Friendly staff pretty views and an unbelievable pool area. Bruce who was the pool attendant was great. So attentive knowledgeable about the hotel and the area. He really has great customer service skills and treats all guests so well. We wound up booking a cabana for multiple days hung out and had a relaxing time at the pool. Thanks to a Bruce great trip.", "offset": [322, 414], "date": "2019-10-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}]}
