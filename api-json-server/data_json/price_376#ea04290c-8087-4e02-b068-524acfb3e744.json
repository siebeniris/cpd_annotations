I have stayed at the Tivoli several times and it is just what one would expect from a good hotel of this standing. The bedrooms are a good size and the beds are satisfactory. The communal areas are spacious with plenty of choice from quiet lounges and alcoves to a comfortable bar area to the relaxing outdoor area by the pool. Entertainment is laid on some evenings but there are plenty of quiet areas to relax if it is not your style. There is also a small computer room and a library. Breakfast is buffet style with a wide choice of hot and cold food with some variation from one day to the next. The outdoor car park is free but a bit rough and uneven though that is not a major problem and there is an indoor paid for car park available too. Overall the hotel is good value for money.

Lagos. Portugal. Recently spent a week at this Hotel with a group of golfing friends. Tripadvisor Reviews suggested this as an ideal Hotel in the Lagos area of west Algarve. They were right. Though not a true 4 star Hotel as per criteria it was ideal for our needs. Easy driving distance to a range of Golf Courses and walking distance to a great selection of good value Retaurants and Pubs. The Hotel site in the centre of Lagos set into the hill has dictated that the structure be built on a variety of levels. This makes it very intersting though a bit confusing in finding ones way round. It also means lots of steps and level changes. There are 2 main lifts Reception area at front and rooms area at rear. Floor numbers on each are different. Floor 1 at rear is floor 1 at front. The rooms have older type TV sets and do not have coffee tea making facilities. Free wifi is available from reception on signing up for Hotel Group Membership otherwise there is a charge. There is also a charge for use of the underground car park. \u20ac 15 for the week. The Hotel pools indoor and outdoor are excellent as are all the other Hotel Facilities. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The Manager Ana was most pleasant and attentive. The breakfast had a great selection of offerings to suit all tastes and the Lounges were good for entertaiment and pleasant surroundings. The Hotel could do with a coat of paint which we understand is due before high season. We would certainly return and recommend it to others.

The location is great for beach and for access to the cliff walks not to be missed. We took a bus out for the day to little beaches and town and that was because the staff was so helpful with their suggestions.

We enjoyed our stay at the Tivoli Lagos. The location is great and the rooms are nice enough. The free breakfast is excellent and the pool area is pretty good. I was not happy with the wifi charges though. Ok you do not provide free wifi like most hotels but the prices from the service provider you use are a bit excessive and they charge per device. For a couple that would like to use multiple devices you would have to pay for each of them and it just adds up to too much. This is unnecessary. Also note that the main photo for this hotel shows a pool on the beach which is what I expected at the hotel when I arrived but the photo is from the hotels beach club which is a few kms away. The beach club is great and we took the free bus there and enjoyed it but I feel that using the photo from there as your main photo is a bit misleading. it is a good hotel and good value for money and would stay here again and if the wifi charges were not so excessive I would have probably given 5 stars.", "offset": [856, 1008], "date": "2015-07-08 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "price"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "b737fd27-d300-4751-a1cb-887a417e7040", "sentence": "Great stay in Lagos.

We followed our porter as he carried our two 25 kg bags through about 200 m of passageways and up 32 steps to our rooms. The rooms we had were a little tired with a lumpy bed and tiny thin pillows. The curtains did not completely cover the windows so let in quite a bit of light in the morning. I have not seen a box TV in a hotel for ages particularly one small as the 14 inch in my room.
