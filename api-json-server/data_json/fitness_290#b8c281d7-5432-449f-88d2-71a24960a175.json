The lovely gentlemen at the front desk I ca n\u2019t remember his name was always so pleasant. This time was very different. I guess they are under new management and I am not impressed. The new \u201c manager \u201d was dismissive and spoke to me like I was a kindergartener. When I asked about their pet policy she assured me that they NEVER allowed pets. I always brought my shitzu who was more than welcome until her pasisng. The previous front desk manager even noticed she was n\u2019t with me the first time I went there after her passing. When I asked about a per hour rate she said the NEVER do that due to their LOW rates. I assure you I have done it in the past. June rates are always lower. The lower pool had tiles missing all around the pool. The upper pool was extremely cloudy the entire weekend and it \u2019s not a pool I would swim in. One of the spas was the same murky and cloudy. There were police there all through the night on Saturday and a police presence in front for the majority of the morning. Did not know why. There was also a drive by gang shooting there last August in the parking lot. I was not impressed at all by the new management or the condition of the hotel.

I was booked to shoot something out in Palms desert the weekend of 419. I was traveling alone and have never been to this area so before booking a hotel room I called a few to hotels to see if I would be able to do an early check in since I arrived in the morning. I called as records show. Ivy SPA and spoke to an older woman Lois I believe. I asked if I would be able to check in sometime in the morning and gave her my time of arrival before booking the room. She said absolutely I can check in any time in the morning on 421 but she recommended booking right away since there were only few rooms left. I booked the room and headed out I am from Boston. That morning I called 15 mins before I arriving to make sure the room was okay. A man answered and said I would not be able to check in until 3 pm I had to do a video shoot at 1 even after I explained that another employee confirmed I would be able to check in hence me booking a room with that specific hotel. To make a long story short I ended up turning around missing out on a gig and also wasting money on a hotel room I never used because I was given false information. I called later that day for a third time requesting a refund and spoke to the older woman who was extremely rude and ended up having up on me. I called my bank to dispute the charge and three months later I see the Hotel has taken the refund back. I call again on 710 and speak to John the Front Desk Manager explained the situation and was told that I am pretty much lying. He was rude from the very beginning and told me He knows his staff and they would not say that and he can not do anything based on something someone else said. He then told me to go find the older woman I claim said that and talk her about the refund. Aside from their employees not knowing their own policy they are scammers and have terrible customer serve and ratings. I do not believe I should have had to pay for a room I never used especially when they approved an early check in which is the only reason why I booked. I could have simply gone to another hotel in the area. The only reason the room as canceled was because the woman on the phone during the third call told me to cancel it so someone else could use it since they were busy for coachela weekend.", "offset": [301, 352], "date": "2019-07-11", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "9ef1d0d8-7681-4805-a35e-258f0ceef821", "sentence": "Regardless of any marketing or advertising you might have seen regarding this place being upscale or remodeled this place is equivalent to an lower average Motel 6 with a good location.
