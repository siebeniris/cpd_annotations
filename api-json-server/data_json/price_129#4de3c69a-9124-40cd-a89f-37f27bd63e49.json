We have just had 4 nights at this hotel and it is the first time we have stayed in the Courtyard style hotel by Mariot. It is a great idea and cuts the cost enormously. NO cutting back on room comfort or cleanliness just cutting out all the unnecessary things that add to the cost of running a hotel. The grounds were lovely the location is great but the one thing I would say is that Mariot need to review the menu and the quality of the food available. Some of the staff were less than atentative and some of the food well below the quality of a hotel of this stanard. We ate at the resorts either side of the Mariot which provided fantastic food.

We had an end unit very quiet Lovely water sky views but could not swim lots of current action. Check in and out was fast and easy. The staff was always helpful. We were celebrating our 44 th wedding anniversary and the entire staff signed a card for us and gave us a plate of fresh fruits very nice The location of the hotel was perfect for us.

Wow. This place was just not what we expected from Mariot even for a Courtyard. The rooms are ok a little small but well appointed but the bathrooms are incredibly SMALL. Literally you have to close the door to get into the tub. Smallest bathroom I have ever seen in any hotel ever. We really had some problems with the maintenance cleanliness of this place too. One day we had a huge wad of black hair on the towels and in the sink. The tub did not drain. The bulbs were out in the vanity mirrors. The television had reception problems. The a c was so weak we were hot all night. The bathroom near the beach was filthy to the point we would not use it. The cushions on the outdoor lounges were so dirty that we had to use our towels on them have not the maintenance folks heard of outdoor fabrics. On a positive note the restaurants and bar were excellent. The food was very good and the service exceptional. Happy hour and half price appetizers are a great deal here. The landscaping is nice and well maintained. One other thing that was really bothersome the property hosts private parties and when those people come in they take over the pool and hot tub bringing coolers glass lots of noise and a generally bad atmosphere. One group was so intimidating that the hotel guests completely vacated the entire pool area. I was really surprised that the manager would allow groups like this to overrun the property. I did complain but the desk staff acted like I was unreasonable to expect to sit in the hot tub without two dozen gangster like teens cussing and making fun of hotel guests. Terrible experience. The manager did credit us with one nights stay and sent a fruit plate which was a nice gesture but it hardly makes up for the week. Lastly though this place is on a beach it is very coarse and steep and has a lot of sharp glass on it at the south end. Not good for night time walks or swimming.

Based on the reviews I read beforehand I knew that there would be some issues with this hotel but expected overall it would be decent for the price. My husband and I stayed for a week on the north end of the hotel next to the events tent where they have the luau twice weekly as well as weddings. Not a great view from our balcony and since it was so small we never used it. The luau was not as loud as we had expected and was done by 830pm so not a big deal. However a wedding held outside was way too loud and went until about 100pm. I feel that guests should be prioritized over events and that the music needs to be kept at a reasonable level. Our major complaint about the hotel was the housekeeping. The day we arrived we noticed some issues the shower was disgusting ie bodily fluids smeared and the hairdryer and iron were broken. Called front desk and asked for these issues to be remedied. Housekeeping eventually replaced the hairdryer and the iron although unfortunately it was with another broken iron. It was not clear whether they actually cleaned the shower. And for the remainder of our week stay the shower tub was NEVER cleaned. The bathroom was generally tidied and towels replaced but it was clear that cleaning was not the priority. Throughout the hotel it is clear that it needs a thorough cleaning doors elevators walls all look rather filthy. Later during our stay we started noticing some hives on our skin around the neckline. We tried to narrow down what may have been causing it and wondered about the pillows or maybe the chemicals used to clean the sheets. When I looked at the pillow closely under the pillow case there were large yellow stains. As such I left a note on the pillow asking for it to be replaced. Sure enough when the room was cleaned the pillow was still the same stained one. This was near the end of our stay so I let it go. Our final complaint is about the parking. You are asked to pay a 14 day parking fee or a 20 day resort fee with parking and have a parking pass to display. We noticed that most cars did not display parking passes and we even forgot to put ours out one night but it seemed irrelevant. Lots of guests park at the parking lot for weddings and the luau and I presumed they did not have to pay for parking. We realized that we probably could have parked in the lot for free like everyone else the hotel charges a rather high parking fee but the parking lot is not patrolled from the looks of it. Some positives like most have mentioned the hotel is in a great location with easy access to restaurants grocery stores etc. The pool area is okay small but seems to be the focus of the hotel and has a nice ambiance. We could usually find a chair by the pool. One note the pool is not heated and was colder than expected. We did not eat at the main restaurant but did have several meals at the bar which were decent no complaints. The beach is great to look at but we would not swim there waves are quite big this time of year. Overall we would not return to this hotel. By putting more effort into their housekeeping and into actually prioritizing guests this hotel could be much better. it is the small things that add up to an entire experience.", "offset": [2195, 2312], "date": "2017-07-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "8ca0d65b-520f-4c8b-9d40-4f59cfa2d81d", "sentence": "Amazing location.

Got in late and was greeted by Andrew at check in who was friendly and welcoming. We loved our room on the 4th floor. I thought being above the pool might be a problem noise wise but they must have great soundproofing because we never heard a thing. The room was large and comfortable and I loved the decor. The only teeny tiny minor negative I have is that housekeeping was sometimes rather late like after 3 pm in making up the room. But they did a terrific job so all was fine. We ate in the lounge almost every day because the menu was varied prices were good and the staff was great. Oh and the food was good too. And we definitely appreciated the free coffee in the lobby in the mornings tip for mgmt. you need more as it was sometimes gone as early at 8 amOther reviews about the beach here not being so great are true but because we are not beach people we did not care. We were out sightseeing and hiking every day. And Carie the Concierge helped get us set up with our activities and answered any questions we had. She was very knowledgeable and helpful.

The setting. You are 15 20 minutes north of LIH Airport. The property is 5 minutes south of the tourist hub of Kapa\u2019a. There is a large Long \u2019s Pharmacy store just before the parking lot to the hotel with all the conveniences food drinks and beach needs one may want. They had great prices on macadamia nuts and local coffee. The property has a massive parking lot and when we arrived at 11 pm most of the spots were occupied. The spots are ruled very narrow I was afraid that our car would get dinged every time we parked. The main entrance was beautifully lit up at night. The reception area was a small nook in an otherwise large spacious and open air lobby. There was a bell hop station and a tourist desk near reception. The restaurant the serves breakfast is also off the lobby as is the bar and the entrance to the pool. We were upgraded from a garden view room to an ocean front room due to elite status with the hotel chain. However no one acknowledged our honeymoon even though I notified the hotel and even let the reception know after checking in. This was in stark difference to being congratulated at check in at the Courtyard in Kona. On the other hand we were impressed that reception waved the resort fee and gave us two free Mai Tai coupons due to our status. We also opted for the 10 person day food discount due to our status. The room. Our oceanfront room was at the end of the farthest building from the lobby. We had to walk through two wings to get to our room. There was a small lot next to our wing with an entrance to the building which was convenient. However it was impossible to access the beach or the grounds from our building one must walk all the way to the lobby in order to do so which is inconvenient and annoying. The room was huge and had a large king size bed a cabinet housing a flat panel TV the coffee maker and the mini fridge. There was no tea or tea maker in the room so if you bring your own be prepared for the taste of coffee in your tea from the coffee maker. There was a desk and chair as well as a couch with a coffee table. There was a large balcony directly facing the ocean. Watching the sunrise from the balcony was a beautiful moment. There was a yoga class at sunrise just under our balcony. The closet contained a safe. There was also a small bathroom and a second vanity with a sink just outside the bathroom. The water pressure in the shower was strong but the shower head was tiny. The toiletries were cheap Paul Mitchell brand. The d\u00e9cor of the room was dated and could use a refresher. The bathroom and vanity were badly dated and should be remodeled ASAP. The free WiFi worked great in the room and throughout the property and the TV had all the cable channels one would want. The laundry room was convenient but only accepted coins. The grounds. The pool was large and had a fire feature installed at its perimeter. The bar was just off the pool. There was also a large Jacuzi off the pool. The showers were oddly placed in the corner of the pool and were not easily visible from the beach. The pool area was nicely designed with modern touches. This was in stark contrast to the dated d\u00e9cor throughout the rest of the property. The beach here is beautiful but not swimable. There is a concrete wall built five feet from the edge of the water which keeps the surf from pounding onto the beach and eroding the sand. The strip of water from the beach edge to the concrete wall is very rock and one could easily get hurt entering or exiting the water. The narrow channel of water also has a serious undertow as the water which makes it over the breaker wall tries to escape back into the ocean. The landscaping fronting the beach is lovely with trees and green grass but this is not a swimable beach so beware. The food. We tried the 25 person breakfast buffet. This buffet is not worth the price tag it comes with. Selections are limited and you are much better off ordering a la carte. We enjoyed the Loco Moco an egg over a burger patty drowned in gravy with friend onions and mushrooms over rice. One item that annoyed me was labeling the breakfast syrup which is just high fructose corn syrup as maple syrup. This is not a five star hotel so I did n\u2019t expect real maple syrup but mislabeling in such a way is unethical and must be stopped. I complained to the restaurant manager but this was not changed during the three days we were there. All in all we loved our spacious ocean front room and the cheap breakfast thanks to the 10 person day coupons we had. The location tends to get a lot of rain so use it as a base for your beach time on the southern side of the island. Do n\u2019t book this place thinking you can just laze about and enjoy the beach here.
