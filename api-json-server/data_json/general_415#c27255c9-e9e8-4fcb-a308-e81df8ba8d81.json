We specifically chose this hotel due to the indoor heated pool so our children could swim. Unfortunatly the pool heater was broken and the pool was closed according to the signs hanging on the entrance doors.

The room did not include a refrigerator which normally may not be a big deal however we keep water and juice boxes for our children and we had no where to put them.

We stayed here because of it is proximity to Tufts not to Boston. It is conveniently located near 95 but that would be the only great thing about it is location. There are closer hotels to Tufts. I am a Gold member so very loyal to Hilton. The hotel feels old. there is a pool in the massive lobby and the rooms open into it. Even though we were not really near the pool we could easily hear the noise of the pool in our room. Fortunately it stopped at 10 pm. Our room was average. The dresser was unbalanced so when we put clothes in the drawers they slid open. My husband had to put a wedge in it to keep them closed. I would not expect that in a room that I was quoted 279 per nightIf you need a place to stay traveling from Point A to Point B near 95 AND you get a good rate then this is your place otherwise there are lots of better places to stay.

Only a 1 night stay at this hotel but enough to write a review. When I pulled in i had to pull off the road to allow the local firefighters to get ahead of me. As I pulled into the parking lot the second engine arrived and then the third. Not too unusual yet. But pulling in to check in when the people were streaming out was a little disconcerting. But I have been around so I do not rattle easily. Turns out that a guy taking a REALLY hot steamy shower tripped the smoke detector as I was told by the fire guys. Still okay with that. There was a big church event so they had to stop the concert and all leave the building. Okay I get it. But when the fire guys say it happens often that is not acceptable. They were used to going to the hotel and dealing with this issue. Hilton folks you got ta fix this sensitive alarm. Unfair to guests to have to drop everything and leave. Then after the evacuation the people had to return to their rooms but the line for the 3 elevators was backed up. I had just checked in. And realized I would have to wait for at least 30 minutes to drop my bags and try to get food. It was about 8PM2 tour buses had also just arrived with a full complement of Asian tourists. Unfortunately the only restaurant open was the bar and lounge. Hm. I wondered about that. Then I found out that 1 elevator was not working. HmThe room was big and the accommodations were nice. There is a nice pool and workout room is okay as well. The hotel is big enough but I think it needs a process refresh. Although the room layout was good and the features of the room were also better than other hotels in the area I found a few too many remnants of the last guest under the covers. She must have had long black hair. Odd I thoughtOveral I got the room on a price deal. So I sould not ask for too much. But the facility is actually quite good. But the operation needs a bit of a refresh. Fix the hair trigger smoke alarms for a start. This hotel is out of the way from everything so a car is needed. There are restaurants and shopping close by and it is right off of 95 and 93. I would stay there again and give it one more chance.
