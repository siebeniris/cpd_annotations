Off season rates are amazing thru booking com. Other reviews when I was booking noted older rooms or too quiet but my daughter and I did not have that experience at all. Rooms were immaculate spacious and we had a garden view so it was cool and quiet. Pools were great. we went in the inside outside and hot tub in the evenings. The location is great for beach and for access to the cliff walks not to be missed. We took a bus out for the day to little beaches and town and that was because the staff was so helpful with their suggestions. Breakfast was fantastic fruit vegetables cheeses meats breads great coffee and then lots of hot meal items as well. Classy waiters and breakfast room as well. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a classy and fun visit to the Algarve.", "offset": [731, 773], "date": "2015-05-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "c17e1e7c-78f7-4f15-b386-6cc3345e2692", "sentence": "Ticks all the boxes. Just home after 8 nights in Tivoli Lagos. This is a great hotel in very many respects. The rooms are basic with the usual fairly rubbish fridge but how much time do you spend in the room. We are out all day and so for us the room was adequate. There was a good sized balcony and because the bedroom has an inner door separating the hall wardrobes and bathroom from the beds it was very quiet. We were not disturbed by corridor noise at all. The hotel is a sort of warren of various areas. The reception is very modern and on the ground level. A sweeping staircase brings you up to a very modern and luxurious bar area with lots of seating areas and little alcoves nooks a library and other sitting rooms. The breakfast room is up another level and is very impressive with a brickwork ceiling. Breakfast is exceptionally good. Huge array of food. The bedrooms let the hotel down slightly as they are much more dated than the public areas would suggest however the hotel is very clean. Other plus points are that the hotel gives you large blue beach towels which you can change every few days so you could actually avoid bringing your own beach towels. Also the free shuttle bus to the beach which was always scrupulously on time. The journey takes about 10 minutes. The beach is gorgeous. Plenty of free shaded sun loungers for hotel guests. The beach club which hotel guests can access is great. The food there is reasonably priced and delicious. There is a lovely pool there and clean toilets and shower facilities. The beach set up is a great bonus. At the hotel the pool is smallish but very nice. There are plenty of loungers there although the best ones tend to be taken by around 830am although they do become free later in the day. The town of Lagos is a 5 minute walk with supermarket and plenty of shops and restaurants. The traditional Portuguese restaurant to the right coming down the drive of the hotel is fantastic. One day we took a boat tour of the caves and this was well worth it. We used Seafairer but there are so many operators. This cost \u20ac 10 for adults and \u20ac 5 for children. It takes about 90 minutes. The very modern marina with boat tours and several restaurants is a short walk away over a dramatic bridge. The hotel is ideally placed for town or the Marina. We noticed huge taxi queues in Lagos every night for the people staying in the out of town resorts which are not walkable no matter what they might say on their websites. The Tivoli hotel also has an indoor pool and health club facilities. Eva the English beautician therapist is amazing. The nicest beauty therapist I have ever used and reasonably priced. All in all this hotel ticked all our boxes and although we are not particularly fussy we do have fairly high standards. I can not understand a lot of negative comments here we got our room for 3 people at around \u00a3 75 per night and the hotel was well worth the money.", "offset": [1851, 1950], "date": "2015-07-31 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b085307d-a041-4eb5-a108-c39c6d7b0497", "sentence": "Tivoli Lagos 072015. A large hotel 3 10 mins walking to town centre and beaches. Swimming pool at the centre of the complex. Room was basic but comfortable clean.

Things like the older 4x3 television or low wifi signal do not bother me as I am there to get away from all that. The only minor negative is the hotel pool side sun bed hogging. The management need to implement a 1hour no use then lose policy to free up towels on sun beds that are not in use. I would recommend this hotel and use it again.

On the minus side it is a huge hotel so a bit impersonal we prefer the more boutique type of hotel.

We did have a terrace but it overlooked a roof next door and the street below.

So do not be put off by some of the negative reviews. The hotel complex is a bit of a sprawl but you soon get used to it particularly as our rooms were in the block furthest from Reception. The communal areas and the outdoor pool are really nice and ideal for having an early evening drink at Happy Hour. We found all the staff friendly and helpful and the free shuttle bus to the Duna Beach is a real bonus. The choice at breakfast was amazing but get there early as the breakfast room can get busy from around 9 am. The location of the hotel is very convenient for the marina and the town is about a 10 minutes stroll or a bit quicker if you go over the hill.

If you want to stay then brace yourself for a misogynistic and homophobia vacation. My wife and I were visiting the area on a well deserved holiday after a difficult year. Our goal was to enjoy the sun and sea. We \u2019ve traveled to many coastal Mediterranean cities in the past and have always met incredible people who were inclusive and welcoming. This hotel was quite the contrary. Upon arrival we checked in and found that we had two separate beds even though we requested that we have a single bed because this trip was in part for our honeymoon. After revisiting the front desk some disgruntled employees moved us to another room with a single bed. No apologies for getting it wrong. Throughout our checkin process the staff kept telling us to check out the rooftop bar and boasted about how unique the view and experience was apparently not to be missed. We headed up there in the evening and it seemed like part of the roof was used by a wedding so we walked over to the other empty half of the roof where we also saw other non wedding guests in shorts and slippers were sitting. I was actually wearing a nice summer dress so our attire should n\u2019t be an issue. As my wife and I were chatting a waitress came up and asked us to leave because the wedding party had \u201c paid a hefty price \u201d for the roof. But still there were no signs indicating a private event plus we had the blessing of all the hotel staff. The waitress was nice enough so we said ok and started to walk to the door. Out of nowhere an incredibly rude waiter used his arms to herd us towards the doorway where we were going anyways and telling us to leave every step we took. There were several reasons that this is unacceptable 1. Since there were other hotel guests in shorts and T shirt \u2019s the only conclusion is that we were not welcomed because we were a same sex couple. 2. The waiter that herded us out was incredibly rude and making it sound like we were making a scene which we were not. We \u2019ve also experienced other misogynistic and belittling comments when we asked for the restaurant hours on another night telling us that we got the hours wrong etc 3. We complained to the front desk about it right after and not only were we not met with empathy but they gave us the impression that we were in the wrong. Forget about this place.
