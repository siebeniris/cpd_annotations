Do not stay here if you do not like other peoples filth. After traveling for 14 hours on my first day all I wanted to do was take a shower and upon entering the shower itself I found two large clumps of hair and a half used bar of soap still in the shower. I immediately exited the shower and called down to the front desk. I was too tired to have anyone come up that moment as it was almost 12 AM 3 am est time which is traveled from. I was assured the following day that someone would come in and clean my room including the large clumps of black hair that were strewn about the wall however after returning to my room the next day after nine hours of sitting in a conference all day having not been able to take a shower now for two days I entered the shower again to find the same two clumps of hair still on the wall and dirt and grime on the drain of the shower. At this point I called back down to the front desk and was received by a person who seemed put out by my request for simply having a clean room. I was told that it would be cleaned and given a bit of an attitude as well. I then called back about two minutes later as I was livid and no longer had time to wait for someone to come clean my room as I had a 6 of the clock appointment to attend. The person told me they were sorry but there was nothing else extended no responsibility taken regarding the lack of cleanliness in the room. I have stayed in many many hotels varying in prices as well as star ratings and I understand one mistake but an entire staff making a mistake and then not taking a responsibility nor rectifying the issue is completely out of my realm and uncaled for especially in staying in a 350 plus a night resort. unfortunately I have two more days at this location. I have extremely low expectations. The hotel staff themselves have been extremely unhelpful I was placed in the furthest tower from my conference and after hauling my own bags and not being asked if I needed any assistance I asked two additional hotel staff if they can help me find my room and the exact answer I was given was sorry I do not know where that is. The only positive things I can say for the hotel itself would be for the restaurant and bar staff. Perhaps they should eradicate the front desk staff and management and have them replaced with the bar and restaurant staff. You can refer to the photos that I uploaded that are also timestamped showing that the hair was left there.

I stayed here at the Desert Springs Resort for a work conference and workshop totalling five nights. So quite an extended stay which gave me a chance to experience much of the property although I am not a golfer. So if you are looking for that perspective you can stop reading now. The resort is lovely. This part of California is beautiful and the resort fits in well to the landscape. My room was not the most up to date in terms of decor but it was not old feeling either. I was assigned a room in one of the furthest locations from the main lobby. Eventually I found this bothersome as it is quite a long walk from the rooms in the wings. Next time I would ask to be in the main building with easier access to the lobby etc. It seemed that most if not all rooms had a balcony. Clearly some views were better than others. One thing I really liked about the hotel is that it offered a number of dining options. Because I was at a conference I was not able to try them all but the sushi place was very good. The pool area was crowded on the weekend especially but still comfortable. Drink service was inconsistent and expensive but adequate. The pool attendants were helpful in terms of helping with umbrellas etc. I spent one long afternoon at the pool and enjoyed my time there. The gym and spa were very nice although not quite as posh or extensive as I had hoped for in a resort of this size. I found them to be merely okay. I attended many sessions and meals in the conference space. I thought the offerings were fairly standard in terms of the rooms but I thought the food and beverage service was outstanding. Probably the best I have seen despite having attended this conference and others for over 15 years. Truly exceptional FB for a conference. One of the most interesting features of the hotel is the lagoon with a functioning boatfery. While I did not take advantage of this feature I am sure kids would love it. This boards in the lobby area which has a central bar small sushi bar not the one at which I ate and a Starbucks. The lobby is in an expansive atrium which extends maybe 8 floors up. It was nice and seemed like a comfortable place to hang out. Overall I recommend this resort.

I just completed a 3 night stay I had attended a conference here. I want to start by saying that my family has been owners at the Mariot Vacation Club for nearly a decade and have stayed a numerous Mariot properties over the years. This was my first stay at this location and unfortunately it will be my last. My complaint is specifically regarding my Mercedes which was damaged while left in the care of the valet team and my interaction with Mike Highland who is the Customer Service Coordinator of Towne Park the manager of the valet service at this hotel. I had like to point out in advance that the fee to valet your car at this Mariot is 37 per day which is very high but not the basis for my complaint. In all I paid 148 plus tips to leave my car parked for 4 days. I checked in my car on the Thursday I arrived. That Friday when I checked out my car to run to the local Target at that time my car was completely functional. I had like to note that when my car was pulled around and delivered to me on Friday the car window was rolled up. This point will be more important later in the story. When returning my car on Friday night I was able to open my door functionally. I had the windows down up because I was driving in the evening and I had the a c on. When I was greeted by the valet attendant I was asked if I had like to keep my car close by in case I needed access to it the next morning. I told them this would not be necessary because I would not use the car again until I was returning home. Fast forward to Sunday morning when I requested my car be brought to me so I could leave with my wife and daughter who met me at my conference to enjoy the pool. When my car was brought around the valet attendant had the driver side window down and opened my car door from the outside of the car which struck me as odd. After loading my vehicle I sat in the drivers seat and notice the handle to the inside of the door was flimsy and pushed completely open as of someone had ripped it right from the door. I attempted to close the door and open it from the inside using the clearly broken handle. To the surprise of no one I was not able to open the door to my car from sitting inside the drivers seat. I immediately went to the window to let them know and the manager on duty let me know that they were sorry and that I had have to file a formal complaint claim and someone would reach out to me. Now I was very upset but it was not that persons fault my car was broken. They were just going through the process and getting me on my way. I assumed that I would handle it with the hotel claim company when they contacted me in 3 to 5 business days as I was informed. Roughly 3 hours later Mike Highland contacted me. I was actually pleasantly surprised because I assumed they were handling my claim quickly or at least calling to apologize for my trip ending on a such a down note. However this was not Mikes intention. Mike was quick to let me know how busy he was meetings all day he said. However he had time to speak with every driver who was in my car and gather a record of every single time my car was moved and it was then that he let me know that every driver who moved the car from Friday to Sunday reported being unable to open the car door and that it was simply that way when they accessed the vehicle to make a long story short it is was not their fault. Now I let him know that when my car was brought to me Sunday my window was down and that was when I was first surprised. His exact words were we always leave the windows down which I know is untrue because my car had the windows left up on Friday when my vehicle was brought to me. I let Mike know that I had like to see a copy of the reports that he had collected and he said to me I can go ahead and file this claim on your behalf but I can tell you most likely it will get denied because it is a mechanical issue and not something we can really prevent it is not like one of our drivers drove and crashed your car. He then said by giving my car to them I agreed to these terms so there was nothing I could do to dispute it. This irritates me beyond belief. This guy Mike Highland a Guest Service Coordinator called me just to tell me that no one on his team had anything to do with my broken car door and even if I wanted him to do the work of filing the claim I would get denied. The fact that a brand a respected as the Mariot entrusts their guests personal property to guys like Mike is incredibly disappointing. I never once insulted a member of his staff I did not ask to not pay for parking I did not demand money be discounted from my stay. I simply filled out the paper and was hoping someone would have the maturity to say they damaged my car. As someone who just spent 148 parking my car 148 parking my wifes car 186 playing golf 25 eating on site and 10 for a room I expected a lot more respect from Mike Highland.", "offset": [1599, 1760], "date": "2019-03-31", "cpt": "1", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "26d1cee4-e088-4597-bde8-07133a07185e", "sentence": "Beautiful venue with a large outdoor lake.", "offset": [0, 42], "date": "2020-02-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "venue"}]}
