We had a great view of the waterfront even only at the 5th floor. This hotel is very convenient to all waterfront activities. Breakfast was also top notch and included an omelet station to go with all of the usual breakfast fair. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something right near the waterfront aquarium Amalie arena and cruise terminals all within walking distance. The hotel is also located right on a trolley stop. I would happily stay here again. The room was very comfortable and the afternoon reception and continental breakfast was top notch.

Expectation management comes into play a bit. To the point now the facility itself was typical of other Embassy Suites. No shuttle available to and from the airport which I suppose is just something I have become accustomed to. The evening happy hour did not have the normal fruit finger foods and mini sandwiches. Again just expectation management really. Have become accustomed to that not the chips and salsa and Guacamole only bar. The bartenders were very nice though. We had called for extra towels only because you normally get three but there are four in our family. did not mind that of course but called never got them. Again no big deal. So a few hours later called again. Still nothing and wanted a dry towel to shower with. Went to the front desk to get one told they have to bring it to us. They did so that time.

I \u2019m a Hilton Honors member and I \u2019ve always had positive experiences at Embassy Suites. Our problems with this hotel can be boiled down to a lack of concern for actual customer needs. We arrived on 7619 and learned Valet Parking at 30 a night including taxes was mandatory. Upon arrival I looked around for help with our bags and saw others struggling with their bags and nobody offering to help. So I assume bell service is not available at this hotel. When we checked in at 420PM we were told our reserved renovated room was not ready as promised and she had no idea when it would be ready. Seriously she could not estimate if it was going to be 1 hour or 10 hours. I explained that we had plans for the evening and would they hold the room until we returned around 1 or 2 AM. The clerk offered to secure our baggage and they \u2019d contact me via phone when the room was ready. However I was informed that if I did n\u2019t check in within an hour of being notified my room may not be held. I should have left at that point but after some negotiation I was offered an older non renovated room on the 5th floor. The room was not what I reserved and wanted but it was available for immediate check in so I would not have to wait in the lobby for hours. This room cost about 15 less. I do n\u2019t know if the renovated rooms are better but our room was a major disappointment. A C and hot water were barely adequate and took a long time to reach desired temperatures. The hot water never actually got hot. The black out curtains could not be closed completely about a 2 inch gap so the street lights and Convention Center kept the room really bright all night. Sleeping was difficult. The plumbing had serious problems. Every time we flushed the toilet it made a loud high pitched whining sound that lasted about a minute I timed it. My wife and I could n\u2019t flush the toilet at night without waking the other. Housekeeping did a good job. The room was clean and the linen and towels were newer. The bed was very firm. the way we prefer. The safe refrigerator and microwave worked well. TV \u2019s were a little small. They do not have enough elevators. We saw long lines for elevators going up a couple for times and we had to wait several times to find one going down that had room available. The Embassy Suites free breakfasts are good and a real value add with eggs made to order and most sides you can get at a Deny \u2019s. However there is inadequate seating areas in this hotel. Around 90AM on both days we saw a lot of people holding their plates in their laps and eating in the lobby. When I called to retrieve my car Monday morning I learned you ca n\u2019t call from your room to have your car retrieved in advance you must go the garage and present your ticket. So on Monday morning we stood and waited in the garage for 40 minutes to get our car this is the service I paid 60 for. If you stay at this hotel you should seriously consider parking someplace else and using Uber to get around. You \u2019l spend less time and money. Also insist on a renovated room but plan to wait hours before it \u2019s ready for check in. Embassy Suites is usually my first choice but in this case I \u2019d recommend you go somewhere that has a little more focus on meeting service commitments like reserved rooms check in times. bell service valet service etc.", "offset": [2483, 2590], "date": "2019-07-10", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "48c88c3e-bd85-4c7c-bd9a-d0902d4421e1", "sentence": "Terrible.
