Mariot hotels are always my first choice when traveling. The service is consistently top notch the rooms are not only clean but also well maintained. But best of all the beds and linens are designed for a good night sleep. The Courtyard Mariot in Barbados excels beyond the typical hotel expectation. The staff is professional yet personable and friendly. I was there for 9 days and all of the staff members I encountered were warm welcoming and eager to make my stay enjoyable. Everyone not simply the front desk is knowledgeable and willing to answer questions about transportation shopping site seeing restaurants local hot spots etc. I applaud the management for recognizing the benefits of interaction with the guests beyond the front desk and hiring great people Angela Ulanda Carmen Diedra Vernita Repley and others. to make it a success.

I stayed here twice in 2015 the first time with my wife In May for the cricket and then in December for my brothers wedding. My expectations were of a standard Mariot Courtyard but the experience on both occasions was far better. Rooms are good clean spacious and comfortable. There is small gym and small outdoor pool and terrace on the first floor. There is a large open plan lounge bar restaurant area with covered outdoor terrace. The initial impression of the restaurant is more McDonalds than fine dining as the menu is on lit signs above the order counter. However the food is really good and reasonably priced for Barbados. Breakfast buffet is quite limited but with interesting things like a fish dish each day. We also had an excellent buffet lunch there on mothers day when lots of local families came in all dressed up after church quite a contrast to other times. What makes this hotel special is the staff who are attentive and friendly. Special mention of Ulanda who was brilliant on both visits. we both loved her personality so much and have become Facebok friends. All the staff were good and so kind when my wife was unwell. Although across the road from the beach where sunloungers are available this is not a resort hotel and has a mixed bag of customers flight crew business people and tourists. There are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby and it is a short taxi ride into Bridgetown or down the coast. Definitely not your standard Mariot Courtyard.

Exceeded My Expectations. Stayed around 10th Sept 2017. Had one of the Executive Suites would highly recommend if you can push your budget to it. The suite was very spacious huge bed nice big bathroom big bedroom big lounge area small kitchen area in the lounge with microwave coffee maker small fridge. TVs on both rooms with sufficient channels although more is never a bad thing. Nice small balcony too. Michael at the front desk was excellent on check in and followed up by bringing us up some welcoming drinks after check in thank you Michael you are a star. Generally all the staff here were excellent especially as they were under pressure. Bar Restaurant staff seemed under a lot of pressure even though September is a quiet period they seemed to struggle especially in the mornings. Had to wait a while to order breakfast however they did never complain when we ordered off menu some specifics. Hotel was in general very clean however upon check in to our suite we did find remnants of a previous guest in the form of some nuts on the floor. Stains on the cushions of the sofa were also a little concerning as some looked like blood stains. We did not mention this to staff as did not want to make a fuss. Location wise it is not on the beech but you can get to a beech area just walk across the road and down some steps through another what looks like hotel or drive down the road for more beech space. The area around here is known as The Garrison area for obvious reasons google it and some bits on the south side do look run down but the Hotel itself is well presented in amongst all this and the main entrance is at the rear which is useful and away from the main road. There are a few places to eat around here also and a shortish walk to more food places in the southerly direction. If staying here and going out and about hiring a car would be beneficial. Although taxis are all over the place and supposed to be fare regulated we found this is not a strict policy and you can be charged quite a lot to go not a far distance especially at night. We did hear some adjacent room noise and it was not a busy period so I assume during busy periods noise from adjacent rooms up down side could get annoying we did request a quiet room and judging by what we had I think they made the effort to accommodate this. A C was very effective in rooms and generally around the Hotel it was very comfortable very hot and humid outside. so the A C effectiveness was very welcome. Pool. yes there is one a small one on an elevated floor outdoor. It is usable but not very scenic. If your looking for a beech front hotel this is not for you but if you want to compromise and have good accommodation with a short walk drive to nice beech areas then this is the one for you. Well worthy of it is 3 star status as marketed on various booking sites. I would not hesitate in booking a room here again in the future should we travel to Barbados again. I think it shows good value for money given the other options in Barbados and what you get for your money exec suite anywayThank you Michael and all those at Courtyard Mariot The Garrison for making us feel so welcome and assisting us during our stay. My reviews are based on facts and real life personal experiences.

My husband and I traveled from Chicago for a weeks long stay at the Courtyard. Upon arrival at the airport we were greeted by our pre planned driver. Everything went as it should. We were greeted and assigned Room 305 which looks over the pool and its windows look directly inbetwen the trees to the beach. The room is just a simple Courtyard room. It is away far enough from the elevator that you hear no noise. I did note that the housekeeping do not call out and are very quiet in the morning. There are not enough words to write about how wonderful the staff is at this hotel. Sonja and Vernita at the front desk An Margaret at the restaurant Doria and Aaron April in housekeeping. each one with a smile a mile wide always happy to see you and wish you a happy day or greet you upon your return. We took the Williams Tour around the island for the day. Rooster was our tour guide and he was great. The restaurant at The Courtyard has a pricey brunch at 55 BDS we did not eat it. However the lunch and dinner menus were very reasonable with a multitude of choices. Anything we ate tasted great. My husband and I only found two things that we would change. The first was that the beach located across the street to the Coconut Park is available to guests of the Mariot hotel. It is a beautiful beach and it was not truly explained that we could use the chairs and eat there as well. Also when we left the beach we tried a few times to go to the pool. It was always having a maintenance check. I would move the pool maintenance to 8 or 9 pm so that the guests can enjoy it between beach time and showering for dinner time.

The location of the hotel was perfect. Close to the city restaurants bars and pubs there was a salon at the location as well. There was always sufficient parking the WiFi was great the pool was easily accessible and there were always fresh towels in the room. The daytime staff at the hotel were extremely helpful with booking tours and reservations for lunch dinner. My group and I came in later than expected due to a delayed flight. The hotel was not accommodating with a taxi service or an arranged airport shuttle even though we called to inform them of the delay. When we got to the hotel they assigned us 1 King bedroom and a room with 2 Queen beds even though I booked 2 King rooms. After inquiring about it the male receptionist was extremely rude and explained that those were the closest rooms to each other which I never specified in my booking process. The receptionist never asked us if we were Mariot reward members even though I booked through a third party booking agency. I also had issues with my credit card and the hotel \u2019s machine. I asked the receptionist to do an ofline transaction and he was clearly unaware of what the ofline process was or probably did n\u2019t even know how to use the visa machine because he insisted on swiping my card three and four times. After getting up to the double queen room the in room refrigerator and the vent in the bathroom were n\u2019t working I \u2019m not sure if the vent problem is an overall Caribbean hotel issue or if it was just this hotel.
