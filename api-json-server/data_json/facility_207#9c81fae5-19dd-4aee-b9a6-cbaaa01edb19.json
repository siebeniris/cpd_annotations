I had booked Holiday Inn KENSINGTON London from 5th to 10th Sep On 6th night when I entered hotel and went to my room it did not open and showed a yellow light rather than green. I was suffering from very high fever and my condition was visible that I ca nt even walk anymore. I went from 12th floor to reception and asked for new key card. This guy was busy chatting with his girl colleague and I told him that she I am so sick. He said that room key card console battery has gone down and that is why its showing yellow color. And promised to send someone to open door and replace battery in max 5 min and must be captured in CTV FOOTAGE. I went back to 12th floor and sat at floor. No one came for 35 min and I had no energy to again walk to reception so I called from mobile to hotel reception and showed my anger on delay and not even being sensitive to a sick person. She said 2 min someone will be there to open door. Again 30 minutes no one came and at last u had to go to reception in extreme bad condition and I lost my temper and yelled at the person who had promised me 5 min and for one hour 5 min no one came and they made me sit on floor and he was still occupied chatting with his girl colleague. Then 2 to 3 hotel staff came and told me not to speak loudi said you can see how bad situation I am in and it is clear deficiency in services by your staff and why should not I shout at him. Then secretly they discussed something and said you need to pay 150 GBP panelty as you smoked in room and it is illegal. I said I have never smoked in my life and I can get you 100 proofs. But they said we will not open room if it is not paid now. On gunpoint they extorted the money as it was 1030pm and they knew my condition so I had to pay this. On 7th morning at 7 am I got a call in room thar you need to vacate the hotel I said I have paid and booked till 10th Sep and I have very bad medical condition. Then at 12 2 goons staff of hotel came to my room and said you yelled at our staff so you ca nt stay here and we have cancelled ur. I said you should rather apologize for poor service and false commitment of 5 min. And later after 65 min when I challenged the service and yelled you fabricated a story of smoking and on gunpoint extorted money. But they made me out of hotel at 1230pm and said your reservation is cancelled. I had booked 7th and 8th sep nights on IHG reward points and 9tu night by paying 97 GBP. I did not get anything back and wrote to IHG REWARDS WHICH HAS HOLIDAY INN AS MEMBER. They replied after 3 days of followup that we cross checked with hotel and they have confirmed that you stayed until 10th Sep and not 7th as claimed by me. I sent them Park hotel Lomdon booking invoices payment proof to prove that I stayed at Park and not Holiday inn. But again after follow ups get some reply that hotel staff has reconfirmed my stay till 10th sep and not 7th. I asked them to get me q 10 second CTV footage showing my entry in hotel after 7th Sep 1230pm when I was forced out illegally and as an act of revenge and racism in such bad condition and I have sent you proofs of other hotel stay invoice and payment reciept. Then I sent them Google maps location from 7th Sep to 10th Sep in London which clearly showed that at what time where was I Then IHG agreed to the mistake and refunded IHG REWARD POINTS for 2 nights. I asked them about 97 GBP paid for 3rd nighr to be refunded and they said as per cancellation policy of Hotel you do not get any refund if you donot stay. I said I had paid to stay only till 10th and because of racist goon staff i was forced out illegally because i challenged service of reception guy and how can you tell me cancwlati0n policy. This is exceptional case and I did not cancel it I was forced out plus also get my 150 GBP refunded which was extorted on gun point by fabricating q story and damages and what action are you taking against hotel staff who did not do his job who illegally forced me out of hotel and staff who twice provided false information to IHG Rewards club that I stayed until 10th Sep and not 7th Sep when they illegally pushed me out. No response till date. I had to provide all proofs to prove that I did not stay after 7th Sep And till date my 97 GBP PLUS 150 GBP AND DAMAGES OF HARASMENT AND ACTION AGAINST STAFF IS UNDER CARPET.
