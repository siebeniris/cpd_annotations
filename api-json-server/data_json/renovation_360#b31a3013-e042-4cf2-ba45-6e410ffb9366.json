I had last stayed or dined at Taj Conemara Chennai almost a decade back. I have always enjoyed staying there or dine at Raintre restaurant. So when I heard that after almost 2 years of renovation this iconic hotel of Chennai was re opening I decided to stay there when I visited Chennai recently. As I entered the hotel I was welcomed well by Ms Ankurita the duty manager at Taj Conemara. The check in was swift and efficient as they were expecting me. The entrance and the lobby are looking new contemporary efficient. The flower arrangement in the lobby was really nice. They upgraded me to the Colonial Room. The room is spacious with a very big private sit out overlooking the swimming pool. The room is done up tastefully retaining some old world charm yet contemporary. The amenities and facilities in the room are good too. I went around various parts of the renovated hotel and all seemed new. A few areas finishing touches were going on which I believe should be done in the next week to 10 days. Jiva Spa also should be functional in a weeks time. But overall the new look is nice. Raintre Restaurant The Verandah Restaurant are nice too. The live traditional performances at Raintre will also start in a weeks time. Overall a good visit to Taj Conemara reliving nostalgia. The staff is very friendly and eager to look after your needs. I am sure the new beginning of this iconic hotel will also be great.", "offset": [852, 922], "date": "2018-10-28 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "43a33722-f21d-41b6-9ce1-51557803e1c0", "sentence": "Even after the renovations the warmth of the property is intact.
