The hotel is centrally located near the city center and accessible with public transportation. The hotel has a pool and gym but the amenities are not included in the hotel rate. There is an extra 25 usage charge. Additionally my room rate included WiFi but some nightly rates may not have this benefit. The entrance to the hotel has driveway for a rental car to park and check in.

The bed had hairs on it had to ask them twice to come and change the linen. They did give me a pool key with no upcharge just hate to be charged for this. It was very quiet sleep very well.

IF this review seems a little scattered its because my experience was conflicted. On the plus side this hotel was super clean in a great area. The rooms were very comfortable excellent bed excellent bathroom. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the little details throughout the hotel. The staff were also extremely pleasant and again truly professional. However there were a few things some which I am sure were just one offs and others which are just part of the hotel which dampened my love for the place1. AC in room was super loud sounded like a lawn mower everytime it turned on. I am sure this was a room specific thing and I honestly did not bring it to their attention until I left. so not sure how they would have done with fixing it2. The fitness center is 25 day. Now the pool is nice but the regular exercise equipment is not only a step below what I have seen at truly high end fitness centers but there is nt a lot of it given the size of the hotel. Further I am not used to higher end hotels charging at all for their fitness center let alone this much. Definitely be aware of this extra cost3 Wifi Was decent in the meeting spaces. But no free Wifi in either rooms or even the lobby again not on par with comperable hotels4. Business center is a pay for everything model except boarding pases5. Hotel TVs are great quality but poor channel selectionI guess in the end for a hotel which feels high end I felt like I was nickle and dimed or a ton was put into some details while others were done on the cheap.", "offset": [816, 1004], "date": "2015-06-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "0615f9de-2882-4d04-ba16-3f927a0bbc23", "sentence": "Great Central location.

Hotel Niko is clean well located in Union Square and the staff is always friendly and professional. I was in town for a conference so I had a conference room rate of 200 I can not imagine paying the regular 350 for the Petite Queen room. The room was about the same size as most other hotel rooms not tiny like others have reported. The bathroom was clean and although there is only a 12 glass door for the shower it never leaked out onto the floor. There is no tub for those who prefer baths I prefer showers so that was fine. I understand the extra charges can be annoying but the pool fitness center rate is 25 per STAY not per night as others have reported. Upon reflection I think that is a reasonable policy it keeps those who would otherwise just play around away. I chose not to purchase a pool pass because I was too busy. I also realized later that the ceiling of the pool room is glass and all the rooms above can look down into the pool I had a clear view from my room I prefer not to be watched while I swim exercise. The one complaint which I share is the extra charge for high speed internet 1395 day. I chose not to pay it and the speed was mostly OK for checking email etc. but could not have supported streaming. They should consider raising room rates by 10 and just give everyone high speed internet. I did not try any of the restaurants or room service but it did not look any more expensive than other SF restaurants. Overall this is a very nice place to stay and I especially liked how polite the staff were. Also it is an easy walk to the Embarcadero Ferry building because you do not have to go over any hills to get there.", "offset": [834, 893], "date": "2015-07-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "4e772af7-f455-47b6-a9b8-f16503ffe432", "sentence": "The bed.

We happen to book this hotel by chance for our trip to San Francisco. boy did we luck out. We usually stay at a different hotel when in the area but we had some family members that really wanted a hotel with a pool for the kids. There are not a lot of hotel pools in the area where wanted to stay. The hotel is beautiful inside but the first thing that hit us was the amazing customer service from the minute we arrived. Everything from the valet 60 daily. we moved across the street to public park for 35 to the bellman made our arrival very welcoming. The rooms we nicely decorated and the beds are so comfortable. One of the best things that they offered was the hotel text messaging. I used it daily for everything from dining suggestions housekeeping needs to checking out. Really quick to respond to all needs. I hope more hotels start to using texting with their guests. The only areas of improvement would be the pool area was kind of dated and the room service food was not great but in San Fran there are so wonderful places to eat why order in the room right. One more added note would be that the area of the hotel had quite a few homeless people. Aside from those few little things this hotel is a stand out for sure. It helped make our vacation run smoothly.", "offset": [252, 320], "date": "2015-07-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "40b09779-0fda-4321-a217-b634c38f8f33", "sentence": "Fun for all ages. We toured the California coast as a family four earlier in the month. The Niko was our last stop and it did not disappoint. My criteria for choosing a hotel included an indoor pool as August in SF gets cooler and proximity to transportation and dining. The addition of a Starbucks and restaurant at the Niko just made it more enticing. First off the staff was wonderfully helpful and professional from the parking valet to the concierge. While the reception area is busy and slightly impersonal keep in mind that there seems to be a number of business travelers either attending conferences in the hotel or around town. Thus we needed to wait to check in but it was handled swiftly and professionally. If traveling for business it should be wonderfully familiar. The room was graciously sized and accommodated my husband my teen my twen and I comfortably including the luggage we brought with us for a two week trip. What I really like was that our room had hallway convenient place to change with opposite sex children in the room a large closet to store clothes and luggage a large bathroom were two of us could primp at one time if necessary and a dressing area where we could store toiletries that did not require water. The beds were super comfortable after days touring the area. The hotel was convenient to the cable cars Chinatown and Union Square so picking up food or supplies was quite easy. Additionally getting our car from parking or grabbing a taxi from the stand outside of the hotel made getting to further off destinations a snap. The two best parts of the hotel however were the pool and the restaurant. The pool was full sized and in a sunny atrium with a hot tub. There was none of the slimy high school pool in the basement feel to this indoor pool. Additionally there was an outdoor spot just outside of the atrium in case it was warm enough to sit outside after your dip. It was not warm enough. We only tried the restaurant for breakfast the last morning but we wish we tried it earlier. The buffet was incredible especially the Japanese breakfast items but everything else was wonderful as well. Surprisingly the prices were much more reasonable for a hotel breakfast than we are used to seeing. Since there are few true breakfast places in the area if staying nearby I would recommend it. The dinner menu looked fabulous as well. We just did not have enough time to try it.", "offset": [1703, 1789], "date": "2015-08-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "e7d9f7c0-7e2b-4ece-8665-ed92d64dba35", "sentence": "Small rooms very friendly good location.

The hotel is right next to Westfield and the cable car which takes you to Pier 39 and Alcatraz. However it is also right next to the Tenderloin area which appears to be the bad part of town. If you always make sure you go out of the hotel in the right direction it is not a problem. We did not try the pool as it was an extra charge and we would not use it but we could see it from our room and it looked lovely. The on site restaurant Anzu was beautiful and the food was delicious but it was crazy expensive and the portion sizes were the smallest I have ever seen.
