The restaurant staff were pleasant but not well trained as they brought drinks without trays failed to notice when drinks needed replenished and brought our food that was not cooked correctly. After mentioning about the steak issue my partners food was left on the table and not refreshed. The original waitress a girl with dreads in her hair never returned. The picture is the amount of fat from a 10 oz steak. Plates were removed from the table mid meal and I was clearly unhappy. This was not acknowledged but swiftly ignored. The bill was simply brought over as a slip of paper and placed directly on the table. After the service standards falling short the waitress has the audacity to leave the 10 service charge on the bill.

This had always been my favourite place to stay in Leeds and after a long and busy day I looked forward to the very friendly greeting as I checked in at Reception. I have not stayed for a while and was impressed at the refurbished and fresh look of the hotel when I arrived this timethey have done a lot to upgrade the look of the hotel but something else has been lost too. The vibe of the hotel felt very different the receptionist was professional but the personal touch has gone. My room was lovely fresh and clean and very welcoming. Unfortunately one lift was out of order when we checked in so there was a long wait till the lift arrived. Finally the lift arrived at our floor juddered and shook to a halt. The doors did not open mild panic from us but eventually the lift took us back down and then up to our floor where we escaped quickly. Later we realised this lift had now been taken out of order too. We walked down the many flights of stairs to Reception to ask when the lifts would be fixed and what alternative provision there was for guests. Unfortunately the man on Reception was rude dismissive and really not interested in our concerns. We were told we had just need to use the stairs. No mention of guests being able to use the service lifts if necessary. We were all rather shocked at this attitude it is so different to the excellent level of service we were used to. All of my colleagues try to stay at this hotel in Leeds despite there being several locally which compare in terms of price and service. After dinner in a local restaurant we returned still no lifts in service and now facing a very long climb up the stairs to our rooms. Again the man on Reception was asked when the lifts were likely to be fixed. He said the engineer was due soon but by morning there was still no lift although staff finally told us they could help with bringing our bags downstairs if needed. Breakfast was another disappointing experience. they have changed the menu and removed favourites such as muesli and pots of yogurt. When we mentioned this the only response from our waitress was a shrug of her shoulders. It felt as though there has been a cost cutting exercise and as a result the breakfast choice is no different from other hotels in Leeds. I know issues like broken lifts can not be helped but something really important has changed at this hotel. The smiling helpful and friendly vibe has gone and been replaced in one instance by a rude member of staff and in others the response was mechanical albeit professional.
