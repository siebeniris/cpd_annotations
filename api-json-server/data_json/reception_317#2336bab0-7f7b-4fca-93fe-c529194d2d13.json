I booked The Carneros Inn for a quick overnight girls get away to Napa for wine tasting. Check in was super quick and friendly. Our reception person also booked dinner reservations for us during check in. The rooms are actually little cottages with a front porch complete with rocking chairs. There is also a secluded little patio with 2 lounge chairs dining table and chairs and an outdoor shower. The room was tastefully decorated very clean with a huge shower. The bathroom floors are even heated. There is also a working fireplace. We found the beds to be extremely comfortable. The view from the adult pool and Hilltop restaurant is AMAZING. So beautiful and peaceful. Everyone is so welcoming and friendly. I forgot my toothbrush and they had one to me complete with a little tube of toothpaste within minutes. If I could say there were any downsides I would say you need mosquito repellent although this is no fault of the resort because you are just immersed in nature. My friend and I had several bites and there was also a mosquito in our cottage. Also we had a 40 breakfast credit which I am not sure if it is really work it. A breakfast for 2 will be over 40. We had an omelet and it was probably the worst omelet I have had in a long time. That being saidit did not take away from the lovely cottage and the customer service and overall luxury of the trip.

So as stated this was a surprise to me so i did not get the opportunity to research in advance like I normally do. The resort is visually stunning. we pulled up about 1 am from a delayed flight and it was gorgeous. since I did nt know about private cottages we pulled everything out to check in. No point in doing that each room is a private cottage spread out acros the property. we were escorted to our cottage and it was private and cozy. My only complaint is it was not spotless kind of a bummer and the only reason they do not get 5 stars. Service was with out flaw. An itinerary was pre planned and booked by my husbands request for wine tours and maps with timing was all layed out. Dinner at the farm was good service was a bit off my huband had still and i had sparkling water they kept mixing up what water was in what glass kind of obnoxious considering you wasted my bottle which then kept getting tossed. The bonfly is great very small only fits 48 people. Breakfast is great hubby said best pancakes he has ever eaten not sure if i should be insulted. because its small Weekends are impossible for breakfast as its also a locals place. We also ended up having dinner there and it was great service and food consistently on point. You can borrow bikes at the front desk and take them for a few hours and visit close by winerys or just a little excersize. the hill top pool is quiet and overlooks vineyards. Over all a fantastic experience. Quick tip they say the pool is 24 hours however we went to the hot tub about 9 pm and it was super dark which was not a problem but we could not find a towel.

Read this before you book. Planned a weekend at Napa for my 40s birthday. We chose Carneros for the first time. I will make it short just so people can read it easily. Pros. The staff at the restaurants including the pool restaurant are really great striving to provide great service. Great food at the restaurants. Cons. 1 Had two reservations called 3 days before arrival to make sure they combined both. They confirmed over the phone. They did not. 2 Arrived late and tired just to hear So you guys are moving cottages. After mentioning this was a bad mistake on their side front desk guy without apologizing and with an attitude which is a cultural trademark for them as I came to understand later did combine the reservation. Also 3 days before arrival I used their website concierge service where they let you choose and buy items to be in the room by the arrival like wine and chocolate. Nothing was in the room and front desk had not any information regarding my choices on their website. 3 Changed my card on the front desk during the check in they charged 200 deposit in the new Amex card. 4. In the morning we were checking out we called early to make sure the card on file was the right one. It was not. They somehow managed to roll back to the old one So how did they charge 200 on the new one. Will I ever see this money again. I do not know the answer to these questions. 5 Safety I was almost hit by one of their trucks all the time being driven through the small streets of the property. The guy saw me on the back and turned in my direction anyway missing by inches. I got scared he laughed and shouted I got this. No apologies. Wonder if it was a kid that they got scared and moved. See picture for the size of the truck. For reference resort streets are good for one SUV at a time6 Air conditioning at the Cottage failing. Had to call maintenance twice the cottage was at 86 degrees. 7 Room service always leaving dirty things behind as you can see by the pictures. One day they knocked on the door for the evening replenishment visit we asked them to come back 20 min later they never did. 8. The only place you can have lunch on the premises is at the Bonfly Cafe. it is a lovely restaurant but it has around 20 tables most of them seat two. Meaning 1 2 hours wait. Only other options are pool or convenience store snacks sandwiches. Food is good at those places but we were not in the mood for having a sub for lunch in Napa. 9 Outdoor furniture at the cottage private garden are dirty. As you can see by the pictures. 10 Pools are not spotless as you would expect in a resort of this caliber. At any given time you can spot dirty resting at the bottom. 11 Beds are too soft in a bad and old fashioned way. Our backs were busted from sleeping on it. 11 When checking out we called before hand to make sure the right card was on file I wanted my Amex points to count. like I said before it mysteriously was not. I asked how was this even possible since the hotel charged a fee on my Amex when I switched it in person when we arrived at the front desk. The women on the front desk then went on to explain how they can not switch cards by phone. Again I explained the same thing again she went on to explain how they can not switch card via phone. it is like a twilight zone where you are speaking crystal clear English and they play dumb asking you to repeat or just faking they do not get it because of your accent. This story ends with the front desk lady disconnecting the phone on me. I guess. she got frustrated. Yes. We were many times forced to repeat ourselves over and over again on the most basic things to the front desk people while they made strange faces like as if they are making an effort. even though me and my wife speak crispy clear English we live in SF she works at Apple in Cupertino and I wrote 5 published books and founded 3 start ups related to education. So English communication is definitely not an issue on our side. The same did not happen at the restaurants. I guess our Brazilian accent is too different for the front desk people to handle but not that different for the ever helpful restaurant crew. To summarize the hotel needs to completely renovate its Cottages including furniture and painting. And they also really need to properly train and teach their employees on topics like respect and diversity. Not coming back not worth the money and stress.

The only reason for the Almost in this review is the Boon Fly Cafe.

Then when we showed up in the morning the waitress pointed to the clock and said we stopped serving breakfast five minutes ago. when we asked if they could just do some simple eggs or anything brunchy. she said no. no explanation no accommodation or suggestions. compare this to the help at the Market on the property where they could not go out of their way enough to help us prepare a picnic lunch for a fun adventure.

Our stay here was totally different this time than the first and not in a good way.

Also cushions and pillows on pool seats all had bird poop on them. Not kidding. Lastly room service messed up our order not once but two nights in a row.

For our first visit to Napa we had high expectations for this resort at 60night but sadly it did not come close to meeting them. When we got to the cottage we immediately noticed a few things. The first was that it was so small and tight there was no suitable place to put your luggage this is a resort after all guests are expected to stay a few days. There was no glass door around the shower so taking a shower meant water got everywhere and there were stains shoe prints all over the floors. We called housekeeping to have someone come out to clean the floors but no one ever showed. We later walked out on the back patio and almost stepped on a 4 screw. Nice. The next day we were getting ready for breakfast and I noticed that the air vent for the AC was completely caked in dust dirt. To think we were breathing that junk in all night really frustrated us to the point where we had to bring it up with management. Simply put the room we were initially placed was in no condition to be used for guest use. The manager we spoke to was very understanding and quickly moved to a larger cottage and threw in a bottle of wine for our trouble. ColThe Harvest cottage was much more spacious cleaner and had a more enjoyable back patio with gas fire pit lounge chairs and an outdoor tub. Compared to the previous cottage the old cottages back yard was next to useless. Not that it is that important to our overall experience but one thing that was consistent between the two rooms worth mentioning no one paid attention to or cared about. the details in these rooms. Light switches and fixtures are all different colors types with a mix of old new a result of cutting corners during renovations for sure. One of the windows in our new cottage was broken and would not close. We also noticed various key things were missing from the rooms iron ironing board soap wine opener etc resulting in more calls to housekeeping. Just a bunch of smaller issues you would not expect to see at a luxury resort that resulted in multiple housekeeping calls which were not always remediedOn the second to last day no one ever came to clean our room despite having the request service light turned on. The next morning we noticed that there was no TP or shower soap resulting in yet another call to housekeeping. Our keys stopped working two hours before check out resulting in yet another call to the front desk. As for the restaurants at the resort we had mixed experiences. My wife ordered a 30 martini. at the Farms outdoor lounge and our server disappeared for almost 30 minutes before he arrived with our drinks. At the Hilltop service was consistently slow food orders often had a 30 minute wait. We overheard one of the servers mention that there was only one person working in the kitchen for the entire restaurant and pool area. All of the staff we interacted with at the resort were very nice but it is pretty apparent that they are understaffed under trained or both. The exception was Boon Fly Cafe for breakfast get the donuts. and Farm for dinner get the porterhouse. The service and food was generally excellent at both spots. The spa was recently renovated and is very nice but way overpriced for what you get a 90 min deep tissue will run you almost 300. The only amenity available is a steam room nothing else. The high priced massages and lack of other spa amenities means this spa should be skipped. If you want a better spa experience for your money there are plenty of better places to go in town. The rest of the resort was mostly a disappointment. The heated pool was nice and had great views of the valley but was noticeably dirty the entire week. The inside of the hot tub had the color of green algae one other guest I met said she would not step foot in it. There are a number of rat traps visible all around the property and some areas of the resort appeared unkempt while others were perfectly manicured. I also noticed an open electrical panel with exposed wiring on the outside of one of the cottages. I stopped by the front desk to inform them but three days later it still was not fixed. Some folks would call that a fire or safety hazard. Overall we would not go back to Carneros as it seems the new management at Carneros is simply dropping the ball. We really wanted to enjoy the resort as it offers a nice location on the outskirts of town with great views of Napa and friendly staff but unfortunately the lack of good service attention to detail apparent disregard for guest safety comfort and high price will leave us going elsewhere.", "offset": [2341, 2441], "date": "2018-08-10", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "8b60bec4-b2c6-4ef3-b07f-a879666c48e4", "sentence": "Great property but harvest cottage was a disappointment. Beware of Verbena 6. My wife and I stayed here for four nights for a wine country getaway and were looking for a picturesque setting good food service facilities and a spacious room to relax in addition to the public areas. This met all of the criteria but the room came up well short in quality compared to the rest of the resort. Upon check in I received an upgrade to a Harvest Cottage through the AMEX Fine Hotels Resorts program after just a few minute wait for it to be ready which I was very very pleased about. A bellman showed us to our room Verbena 6 where we had a small parking area just steps from our cottage which was convenient. He was very friendly and helpful with information but a bit too eager as he unloaded a suitcase out of the back seat of our car without noticing it was unzipped. This led to my DLSR camera and a few other items falling onto the pavement. he is human and humans make mistakes but it was just the start to a disappointing room experience. To the resorts credit the front desk manager called me shortly after asking about the situation without any notice from me so the bellman owned up to the error and they were proactive about it. When we checked in I found dry dog food on the floor in the bathroom. What does that 150 pet cleaning fee go towards after a pet stayI was excited to get the Harvest cottage because it is the only type with an outdoor fire pit and tub in addition to the outdoor shower. I was excited to use it but when we returned from dinner I noticed only two of the six outdoor landscape lights worked. In fact one of them was laying down. Except for the flood lights which are harsh. the patio was completely dark at night which killed the atmosphere to relax outside at night with a fire etc. The safe did not work and it took two phone calls to the front desk to have it fixed. They said they had have someone come look at the lights but they were never fixed and there was no follow up from them after that. The umbrella was missing for the table and chairs on the patio. The pads on the two chaise lounges did not match one was thin and clearly designed for a different type of chair. Additionally we wanted to do have in room dining on our patio but the extreme slant of the patio table rendered that nonviable. Inside the walls were all bare with no artwork anywhere. In fact there were bare hooks where it looked like artwork use to be and should be like over the desk. It looked like this unit was recently renovated but not fully completed. There was masking tape around fixtures still from the paint job and paint overspray on the fixtures that were not taped off. The HVAC return vent was pretty nasty too. In summary this room was not ready for use and should not have been available in this condition. For 70night these items matter and it was a huge disappointment. This upgrade felt like a downgrade seeing as I can not realistically believe all rooms are like this. After a quick read on TripAdvisor it looks like the guest who stayed in this cottage before us wrote a review apparently the safe was broken for their stay as well and their stay also explains the dog food through no fault of the guestTwo of our four mornings we were greeted with loud leaf blowers and mowers before 830am. This needs to be changed for a luxury resort of this nature this is not welcomed by any guest. On to the positives The location is great. it is a 10 minute drive to either Sonoma or to Napa but has a remote feel to it. Very convenient. The staff are all very friendly and nobody would walk by without acknowledging you. The wait staff at Boon Fly Farm Farm Pavilion and Hilltop were all very good and friendly. At the Hilltop pool they were very attentive and we never found ourselves looking for a server to order a drink or food. The view from Hilltop is stunning and a drink during sunset was very relaxing. The pool was clean but the hot tub could use a scrub down. The vegetation and gardens throughout the property are well kept and fun to walk through between the rooms and public areas including numerous fruit trees. Our dinner at Farm was delicious and reasonably priced for the quality of food provided. Boon Fly was good for a change of pace with a basic but tasty food menu plus the amazing donuts. We ate at Hilltop for breakfast each and it was fantastic tasty food and great service. If the resort can focus on improving the details and correcting room issues I would recommend staying here. However until then I can not justify recommending this to others because of the nightly premiums. For rates at this level the rooms need to be in good working order at a minimum. The overall property was very good but the room was poor.", "offset": [2395, 2497], "date": "2018-08-29", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "aff9e85f-f3f4-42cb-a24e-4a7481a36b82", "sentence": "Good hotel. Instead of appearing a trailer camp the room was fine with a big and good bathroom. The fireplace is very good and providential. It was raining and cold. The staff was very gentile. The concierge was not so helpful to get us to exclusive wineries but the usual was fine.

Lovely resort with great food on site. it is close to napa and a number of wineries no issue getting an uber to nearby sites. The staff was really helpful and friendly. Loved our meals at Bonfly try the donuts and just reading on the hilltop taking in the view. Like most resorts the spa was expensive however the services were excellent and the amenities were really well thought out. The reception constantly offered water or a glass of wine. Other reviews raised concerns about the grounds I can easily believe it was tied to large wedding the night before. Everything was really well kept during our visit. we are already discussing a return trip.", "offset": [291, 414], "date": "2020-02-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
