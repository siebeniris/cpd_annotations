Oh was I wrong in fact things have gotten worst. The room was in poor conditions. The furniture and linen need replacing. When booking I had requested all down bedding be removed husband has allergies. We had to wait while the bedding was changed. That was not not a problem. The problem was the bedding was old and dingy looking. The doors to the closet and baseboards were in need of paint with clipped and bubbly. The worst was when I wipe down the toilet with my Lysol wipes. There was so much urine. I started to request a new room but I did not have more wipes for a new room. It was really gross. With farther inspection there was dirt on the bed table legs. As you can gather the room was in poor condition as far as cleanliness and furnishing. I was ask when I checked out how my stay was and I did make my complaint and I was apologized to by the front desk and ask why I did not let them know so that they could have changed the room. Like I explain in my review and to them I did not have enough wipes for the next room after finding such poor conditions in the first room. As a courtesy and for being an spg member they did give us addition starpoints and paid for our parking to say the least. Also the hotel is noisy they do have signs in the hallways asking guest to be considerate of other guest. But I guess some guest do not think it applies to them. This hotel is in a lovely area but the hotel needs some training for the cleaning staff and renovations. They need to get bad with time instead of worst. We will not return to this hotel.

TLDR. A Sheraton property in a great location at an affordable rate. Hopefully more positive changes to the property in the works. Would recommend over the Westin Virginia Beach Town Center. Easy 38 4. I stayed at Sheraton Norfolk Waterside Hotel for one night over Memorial Day weekend. This is a review of the hotels platinum benefits. The welcome email notified me that there is a parking garage within walking distance and is 8 or valet for high fee. I arrived late and even for the preholiday rush it appeared to be busy. There is plenty of room to pre park and offload your bags. I was greeted by ShaVon sp and even with the mobile check in was quickly given the run down switched my points option to the breakfast buffet option in the lobby restaurant. The hotel had availability and I was pleasantly upgraded to a suite on the 5th floor. I needed a late check out and they were able to accommodate. I was concerned about some of the negative reviews but I found the front office staff incredibly friendly the hotel is nearly completed with their renovation and the room was spacious clean and comfortable all at an affordable rate. Hopefully they continue to make positive changes and other customers have an opportunity to experience similar service. The lounge has evening banker \u2019s hours open and close early. 5 7 PM on weekdays and maybe shifts an hour later for the weekends. I missed that I was told breakfast in the lounge is continental so I opted for the buffet. Excellent choice. In the late evening I visited the Waterside restaurant. They offered a flight of 5 local beers. Unfortunately their options were subpar. With such great breweries in the area the restaurant could really source better beers. The She Crab soup bowl was pretty good but not award winning not that they are claiming it. It could use more crab meat. Also the hotel does not extend a 20 discount to platinum members eating at the restaurant. I really dislike the inconsistency of the restaurant benefit. Some properties offer some do n\u2019t but no body knows. The fitness center and possibly the pool ca n\u2019t confirm was sadly under renovation. The hotel moved free weights a few cardio machines and other misc. fitness gear to an empty conference room adjacent to reception. It forces you to be a bit creative good not great but for a short stay it sufficed. The morning buffet was top notch and highly recommended. The omelet fully loaded is a good portion and leaves room to sample other hot plates. I would avoid the scramble eggs those were horrendous. The rest of the breakfast spread was tasty. I did n\u2019t spend much time in the club lounge but you can still find after hour snacks nonalcoholic drinks and a working espresso machine. The lounge has comfortable seating arrangements and a large TV if you wanted to watch some sports game and BYOB. At the end of my stay I asked valet to bring my car around and the did quickly and professionally. All was good would stay here again if ever in the area.

My family hosted a reunion in Norfolk over the weekend. With most of the family living outside of Virginia and very little to go on other than photographs and a sales pitch we opted for this place as the host hotel. As an SPG member and avid traveler I can say that not only is this the worst Starwod brand hotel that I have stayed in but it is probably one of the worst hotel stays that I have experienced in my 20 years of traveling as an adult. For this hotel to be advertised as a world class hotel is just well fraudulent. This was glaringly apparent from the moment we stepped foot on the property. Upon arrival the front desk staff was cold and unwelcoming no smiles no thank you for being an SPG member etc. Even though they had a two week notice that our party would be arriving early and even picked us up from the airport none of our rooms were ready and we were advised that they would call us when they were available. Two hours later our room was finally ready. Additionally four months prior while making my reservation I requested a room on a higher floor and was told no problem. With that said I was upset that we were placed on the third floor with a view of a tree. We immediately called down to the front desk and requested to be moved. We were again met with attitude and told there were no other rooms available and they mysteriously had no record of my request. When we asked to speak with a Manager we were transferred to a voicemail. We left a message and 4 days later have yet to receive a call back. We were however moved to the 4th floor right above the old room with the exact same view. While the hotel was close to capacity this past weekend I had several family members check in after me who are not SPG members but were placed on the 7th 8th and 9th floors so they lied to us about being unable to accommodate us. They just did not care. Aside from a remodeled lobby the rest of the hotel is about 3 decades past its prime. The elevator was dirty. The rooms are outdated and filthy. EVERYTHING including the TV was coated with dust. The bathroom had mold in the shower a chipped toilet and cracks in the wall. The room reeked of body odor and urine. Later on I was horrified when one of my children discovered a pair of urine soaked underwear underneath the bed that housekeeping failed to remove. To make matters worse our room was only cleaned once during our stay. When we inquired as to why we were told they were behind. So we just asked for fresh towels which took them 1hour to bring. Sadly we heard this was the case from several other family members. Interestingly enough the housekeeping carts and two of the cleaning ladies always seemed to be on our floor even as late as 6 pm. They seemed to be doing more arguing and using profanity rather than cleaning rooms though. When we pointed out that our small children could hear their inappropriate language they told us they were just frustrated because the hotel was short staffed and they were running out of clean linens and towels. As far as WiFi goes the hotel advertises free Internet for SPG members which I can not vouch for since I could never log in. They also advised us during booking that the hotel offered a complimentary shuttle within a 3mile radius. When I called to arrange transportation I was told they could not accommodate us because the airline pilots in the hotel received priority over other guests in the hotel. I then asked if any pilots were leaving or coming in the next 30 minutes as the restaurant we wanted to go to was only 1 mike away. Rather than answering my question the transportation rep simply said he could not help us and then hung up the phone. While I did notice a few pilots during our stay I also noticed the shuttle bus parked in front of the hotel every time we left for dinner and in the same when we returned. Speaking of food the banquet food was surprisingly good. In addition our Event Manager Shelton was professional and personable.
