I had wanted to go to Little Palm Island for years. I finally had the opportunity to go and was so excited. Upon arrival to the welcome desk you are given a yummy rum punch cocktail and are then taken by boat to the island which is exciting to see the dolphins swimming along as you boat across. When you arrive you are shown to your bungalow and told about the amenities of the island. You will have access to all the fishing and boating you like and it is all included. The rooms are large and nicely decorated. There are Key Deer that reside on the island that are very friendly and make for some neat photos. There really is not any beach other than by the restaurant but they have lovely docks that have loungers facing the water for your relaxation. The food is good but not outstanding. They have a nice wine list though we had some special bottles we brought along that we would open each day and bring over to the fire pit to sit and share making the evenings very romantic and relaxing. The down side of our stay was the spa. The spa is VERY expensive and you would expect for the price would be luxurious. Sadly the attendants do not really put any effort into he services and really just phone in the technique. We were hugely disappointed in the spa services. On our last day We got 2 massages and a scrub and also signed up for the steam room. The massages were awful no effort and felt as if the attendant was just putting lotion on us and the scrub felt the same. When we were ready for the steam room we told the attendant we were ready and they told us they had forgotten to turn it on. They took us over to the steam room which is in another building a diving office and attached to the bathroom it is not very nice. We decided not to wait for it. At that point some one brought all our luggage from our room and dropped it off at the steam room for us to then carry ourselves to the departing boat to the mainland. This made us feel like they were rushing us off and they did not intend to carry our bags out to the boat for us. The whole experience was odd and because this was the last part of our stay with little palm unfortunately this is the memory we were left with and probably would try another resort instead of revisiting.", "offset": [647, 789], "date": "2015-01-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "b1114622-83e5-4e7c-8222-66b2bc2f9118", "sentence": "Relaxing Getaway beware of. My husband had a conference at the Resort so this was our first time on the island. All the staff were very friendly and very helpful.

The resort is a true relaxing getaway with no cellphone use allowed except in your suites and no TVs in the suites. The bathrooms are bit dated but otherwise the acomodations were great. There is a library that guests can borrow or leave a book behind which was very convenient. I spent much time reading on the beach on the hammocks and by the fire pit areas at sunset. The Chef was amazing. Food was presented beautifully and delicious. My only complaints are that we were not advised we had a Full Meal Plan and exactly what that included so we did not take advantage of the various courses for each meal. We also were not advised about the No See Ums which attacked me during our stay. We had a lot of breeze wind during our stay but the last day on the beach was brutal.

Slumber cocktails kept us smiling all the way to check in. Surreal moment when two small deer followed us to our room. Day spent kayaking through the mangroves. A couple more Gumby slumbers and a relaxing moment in our private hot tub on the deck. Next a nap in our own private hammock. Showering outside of our bungalow under blue skies was amazing. Dinner beachside at sunset is a must. The chefs are top notch. While at dinner I arranged for the staff to decorate the room with candles and soft rose petals. This is a service that you pay for but is well worth it. So very romantic. My wife can not stop talking about it. Late checkout allowed for us to sleep in and enjoy breakfast in our room. Order the French toast. DeliciousWe had time to take a boston whaler out to the sandbar. Amazing that the resort allows you to take the boat out yourself. We had a blast anchoring the boat and jumping overboard into the ocean. We finally made it back to our room to pack and take the ferry back to shore.

This is the place to go of you want to unwind and press the pause button on the daily grind. We arrived at the check in station and were greeted with a delicious rum concoction the Gombay Smash. That alone became three they are addictive. The boat ride into the island was reminiscent of taking a Venetian water taxi from Aeroporto Marco Polo to your hotel in the Serene Republic. Seriously you will feel like Bond. We were greeted at the dock by our concierge who gave us a tour of the island and told us do what you want the place is yours. She meant it. Want to go for a swim at 2 in the morning go for it. Feel like lounging on the dock why not. Want to sleep on the hammock two bungalows away it is yours. When we got to our room after the tour our bags were there as was a filled ice bucket and mini bar. Our room their basic room was amazing. We loved the high four post bed the soft comfortable linens and the outdoor shower. Even though the island was fully booked that means 60 guests total. we had total privacy and never felt cramped. We occasionally saw the couple on the bungalow next to us and one time heard the couple on the bungalow attached to us. Breakfast on your porch delivered on time and perfectly prepared. Polside drinks were made with top shelf ingredients and perfectly crafted. We never had to look for out server and she often anticipated our needs she quickly figured out we alternated water and a drink. Every single staff person was welcoming and approachable. The Dining Room is second to none. It is one of the highest Zagat rated restaurants in all of Florida and my wife told me it is the third highest rated hotel restaurant in the US. Everything was prepared perfectly. The servers were fantastic and the menu changes daily. We opted for the 5 course tasting menu both nights and loved it. The only annoyance was that the restaurant does not strictly enforce the dress code. I wish they did because it adds something intangible to the experience. The only thing that we did not like about the trip was having to leave. I recommend taking advantage of the Fine Hotel and Resort plan through the American Express Platinum Card. It really added some valuable benefits. We had Suite 4. It faced the bay and had an eastern exposure. I would readily stay in that one again.
