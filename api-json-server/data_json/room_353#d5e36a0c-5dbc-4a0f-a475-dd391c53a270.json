I had checked in via the mobile ap but I knew there was no guarantee that the room would be available when we arrived. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that by the time we landed in KL it was already ready. The lady at the West Wing welcomed us and brought us over to the East Wing for check in. The staff were kind to give us an upgrade to the Executive room with lounge access on the top floor. that was such a pleasant surprise. The view of the Petronas Twin Towers was beautiful. They had also remembered the requests I had put in before my stay regarding pillow choice and bed type. One of the qualms I did have about the stay was that the restaurant offering breakfast was full when we went downstairs and we were directed to the West Wing. The reason for this was to cater to the groups staying at the hotel. I am puzzled as to why this has to be the case if they come down late why do other guests have to be inconveniencedThe other concern I had was the shower door in the room. The hinge between the door and the glass panel is not sealed and there is a rain shower in the bathroom. This inadvertently means that when we shower the bathroom will get very wet the floor towel was soaked. I did raise this with the staff at the lounge at check out and he said they would have a look in to this. Would definitely stay at this place again.", "offset": [891, 1062], "date": "2015-12-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b12ce46b-f093-41a4-919d-a183a61f45c5", "sentence": "Not bad.

I can imagine how majestic the Renaissance used to be back in the day. Huge compound massive pool splendid spa 2 wings strategically located off Jalan Sultan Ismail not far from the imposing KLCBut like a former beauty queen time has taken its toll and she has seen better days. Everything is rather dated. The furniture in the room looks old there were peeling walls obvious water leakage stains loose hinges on the cupboards faulty lamps stale air in the room the list goes on. Upon checking into the room we decided to take a shower in the tub. To our horror the water could not be drained effectively resulting in a pool of water around our ankles as we showered. It took almost an hour or more for the water to be drained off. But to the hotels credit the front desk did send a plumber who came promptly to rectify the problem when it became obvious that it is an occurring issue. We called housekeeping to request for firm pillows. But for some reason they did not quite understand what firm meant. We tried hard not soft but to no avail. They did deliver some pillows but only got it right after a few visits to the room. Not the most efficient but credit when credit is due housekeeping did return with more firm pillows eventually. Overall I would say the service is lovely and prompt. Sure there are some kinks and inconveniences but no big drama. Beds were unbelievably comfortable the blackout curtains worked like a charm that we overslept on a few occasions. Complimentary toiletries were lovely WiFi signal was strong decent cable channels on the telly. I only wish Mariot would show Renaissance some TLC. It feels like a neglected child compared to the parent hotel a few train stations away at Bukit Bintang. Shame indeed. One last note I do especially that they do not have any employment discrimination. One of the chamberperson who looks after my floor is a deaf and mute man. While he could not hear me nor articulate himself we understood each other perfectly through the universal language of hand signals and gestures.

We stayed for 3 nights in July. We arrived early but the check in staff were helpful and allocated us rooms straight away. Both rooms were in the East Wing one was pool facing and the other had a view of the Petronas Towers. The view of the pool was obscured as the exterior was being painted and this also meant that areas around the pool were coned off. Both rooms were large but the decor was tired and the carpet in one of the rooms was damp from water leaking from the bathroom. However the beds were very comfortable. The location was convenient a 10 minute walk to the Petronas Towers and the monorail station was close by to get to other areas of the city. Crossing the roads was an experience though.

This is my first time experience check in to Renaissance Hotel Kuala Lumpur. Before this i always check in to Renaissance Hotel JB and i am satisfied with their services. Actually i am quite afraid to check in here at the first place since this hotel was built in 196 Very old hotel. But when i step inside the hotel lobby all the feeling totally change. 360 degree. This hotel is really look luxurious with the marble finishing the chandelier looks very nice and luxury. For your information this hotel consists of 2 wings East wing and West wing. But one wing have been closed for renovation and will be opened soon. This hotel has a basement car park RM10 day for unlimited in and out. The car park elevator to the hotel lobby was located at the wing that have been closed for renovation. So do n\u2019t be afraid if you did n\u2019t see the hotel lobby first when you come out from the car park elevator. Need to make a short walk to reach the hotel lobby. I have been attended by Mr Faizal at the check in counter. He is a polite friendly and very helpful person. Even though he wearing the face mask Covid19 precaution he still trying the best to make me feel comfortable with him. Good job Mr Faizal. Keep it up. My room of choice for this first time experience is Executive Suite with King Bed and Sofa Bed. The room was very spacious. I think can accommodate up to 4 adults easily. This room have separate living room and bedroom with one toilet with wash basin at the living room and the bathroom complete with wash basin sitting toilet bath tub and shower room. This means that this room has 2 separated toilet. The air cond were in very good condition and have enough cooling sensation for this huge room. The air cond have separated controller one for living room another one for bedroom. Sofa bed also have in the bedroom and at the living room. So for me there is no problem to accommodate 4 adults in this room. There are 2 big screen TVs i think 49 \u201d or 51 \u201d size and plenty of channels available at the living room and in the bedroom. Breakfast is at Revolution Cafe at the G level same level with hotel lobby. Plenty of food and all of it are very delicious. Cafe staff are friendly with the guest and they always try to make all the dining guests feel happy and comfortable. Good job guysOveral i am very satisfied with Renaissance Hotel KL. I am looking forward to stay here again when i need to be in KL in the future. To all staff of Renaissance Hotel KL good job to all of you. Really love to check in here again.", "offset": [1640, 1734], "date": "2020-03-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}]}
