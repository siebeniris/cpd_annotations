We stayed 3 nights in June as part of a tour group of 30 plus adventurous folks all experiencing Salzburg for the first time. Like most old hotels in the center of historic towns in Europe the Goldener Hirsch is a mix of old world charm and first class services created amid dated but functional facilities. With historic preservation standards controlling renovations today only so much can be done to expand rooms widen halls modernize plumbing etc in these grand old properties however we found the Goldener Hirsch to be an excellent example of how to best maximize the improvements that can be made. Finding our room took a bit of fun doing as it was down several corridors and up three flights of stairs there are lifts available. We were expecting the room to be on the small side however we were pleased to find it contained a sitting parlor a large main space and a full sized bathroom with adjoining lavatory. We were fortunate to have 3 sets of operable windows which at night complimented the minimally effective cooling system struggling to recover from the hot weather of the day. Staff encountered were all excellent however I wish to especially compliment the bar tender an older gentleman whose name I am embarrassed to admit I forgot to management. He went out of his way to insure that our satisfaction was meet. Breakfast was conducted in two rooms on the first floor which was pleasant however became crowded and a bit too busy during peak times. The food although good lacked variety however service was excellent and fast paced. As many others have stated we found a major benefit to guests of the Goldener Hirsch is it is proximity to the most important cultural and historic venues in Salzburg making it a brilliant place from which to base your stay.", "offset": [628, 759], "date": "2015-06-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "96e57e83-d45e-4275-a962-e8bd49c2cc6f", "sentence": "Amazing hotel in historical Salzburg.

The hotel rooms are spread out among a number of adjacent buildings and even I believe a building across the street form the main hotel the one pictured on the website home page. That building was the one we stayed in. Part of the building dates to the 15th century so there are some historic quirks but absolutely nothing that makes for a less comfortable stay the quirks just add to the charm. Our room overlooked the main pedestrian street with big windows that opened to catch the action of which there was quite a bit because we happened to be there during a festival that celebrates the founder of the city. Many pedestrians families and a bar next door with revelers enjoying their drink in front but when we wanted absolute quiet we closed the windows and remarkably all the street noise was gone. Because the rooms are spread out among different buildings it is hard to say what the other rooms might be like but ours was large furnished with antiques including a wonderful folk art armoire. The bathroom was large and modern. The location could not be better however because the street is pedestrian the address of the hotel is not the best way to get to the hotel by car the best way is through the back entrance. So if you are driving into Salzburg rather than taking a taxi or similar do yourself a favor and look at the hotel website for driving directions.

We had 2 suites each for 2 nights and 2 guests while traveling through Europe on vacation. Excellent service and traditional Austrian charm exude from every corner of the historical Hotel Goldener Hirsch. A definite high recommendation from me for its service location and suites. DETAILSWhat I liked. Suite booking through American Express Platinum Fine Hotels and Resorts has its perks room upgrades upon availability is one of them. In this instance it worked incredibly well as we found ourselves in two lovely suites. The suites are decorated in a traditional Austrian way. In any other setting you would expect something much different from a suite product but in a hotel whose buildings predate Columbuss landing in the Americas and in a city that has Austrian Alpine charm in abundance I could not imagine the decor being any different. The suite was a good size with tons of storage space and large windows that could open out for the fresh Alpine air. The bathroom was also sizable with separate shower and tub a huge vanity with lovely amenities and a separate WCLocation right on the main street in Old Town Salzburg walking distance to almost anything in the tourist sector of the city the Goldener Hirsch offers not only elegant if not formal service but a great home base to explore the city. Breakfast. breakfast service is attentive and efficient. The spread is good offering the basics at a high quality. What could have been better. Access temporary. There was construction on the main street during our stay making arrival and departure by taxi awkward. This was a temporary situation that will likely be rectified by the time you might arrive. Room Locks while the charm of the old style keys that you give to and retrieve from the front desk at every exit match the hotel in many ways there are drawbacks.

The Hotel Goldener Hirsch offers a unique Starwod Luxury Collection Accommodation in the very heart of historic Salzburg. Located on the city \u2019s charming main pedestrian street it \u2019s an easy walk to most of the main sites of interest in the historic center. Mozart \u2019s birthplace and residence museums shops churches restaurants the main squares Mirabel Gardens and to the funicular that takes you up to the Hohnsalzburg Castle for a decent workout you could also take the stairs to the top. Staying at this hotel is like taking a step back in history. It \u2019s not your typical 5star. If you would prefer something sleek and modern with a deep soaking tub and a spa this is not your place. But if you crave something charming and local with period and local furnishings with top rate service in a historic building that is close to everything do stay. The hotel \u2019s staff from the front desk to the attendant in the on site shop are all delightful. They were well versed in local restaurants and gave me several fantastic suggestions for lunch and dinner each of them exactly what I was looking for at the time be it upscale or casual. Towels and washcloths were replaced in the morning and in the evening. Turn down service pulled the curtains and left chocolates on the pillows and water at the bedside. It \u2019s these little details at which this hotel excels. The Austrian locals are not a particularly smiley bunch so it was lovely to always have a very kind and friendly staff at the hotel upon return from an outing and this high service level was consistent during my four night stay at the hotel.

My bed and pillows were comfortable and maybe it was partly the quiet but I slept well every night. My duvet was clean and so soft and fluffy like mine at home. My air conditioning worked very well for the 86degre days during my stay. The safe was working toFurnishings are very classic carpeting and locally woven rugs wooden armoires tables desks. My room had two fabric covered chairs and a little couch. Curtains matched the bedding and the fabric of the furnishings. The bathroom had a nice sized counter top and plenty of hooks and bars to hang towels and robes on. The shower had a tub on the narrow side very European but the water and the water pressure were both AMAZING. So amazing in fact that I quickly forgot about my initial annoyance at the narrow tub. I LOVE a delightful shower. Water quality in Salzburg is phenomenal \u2014 it tops anywhere I have ever been outside of some parts of Canada. In my opinion the city \u2019s tap water tops its bottled water however I found that restaurants were so eager to sell you bottled water that they seemed to get annoyed when I asked for tapBreakfast is offered on site or to your room. There is also an on site restaurant and bar however I ate every meal outside the hotel as I enjoy exploring. There is a small in room bar cleverly tucked in a wooden cabinet with a handful of options. The one water I took was correctly added to my bill at my departure.
