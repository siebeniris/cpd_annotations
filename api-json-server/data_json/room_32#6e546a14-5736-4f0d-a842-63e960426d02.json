I have just returned from a one night stay at Mitpe Hayamim Hotel spa and I am so sorry that it was only one night. From the moment we checked in the service was impeccable. Manor at the front desk yesterday and Faudi at the desk today did everything they could without cloying to make our visit pleasant. Many of you have already heard about this hotel so what I have to say will not be new. The spa treatments are professional and worth every moment spent being massaged or peeled. The room we were on the 7th floor was simple but luxurious with sheets that enveloped you. The bathroom with its jacuzi was enormous and I loved the soaps provided by the hotel. The room had a small balcony which perfectly accented the wood floor and furniture. And of course sitting outside provided us with a sense of serenity and nature. birds all over the place with the scent of the flora. As far as serenity goes the hotel just seems to come by it naturally. but it is clear that this was studied efort no cell phones in any public area except outside and no smoking in the hotel at all although smoking is permitted outside and on balconies. No children under the age of 18 are allowed and this adds to the peaceful atmosphere. The food is great. We ate in the vegetarian dining room fish is served there with organic vegetables and fruits cheeses breads and more grown on the property. Every morsel was special and I had to pace myself. The organic fennel soup was out of this world asked the chef for the recipe and am hopeful that he will provide. I am not sure what else to single out because whenever you go the produce and food will be made from what is available. but you will not be disappointed. More importantly was the service. Yousef and Liad set the tone for the restaurant. and it was interesting to note that as people left practically everyone stopped to thank them. In fact when we left the hotel today I noticed those who were checking out stopped to thank members of the staff who had made their visit enjoyable. I did not eat at La Mouscat this time but this is not to say that I will not eat there next. The chef is outstanding as is the manager of the facility and it is worth a drive up for dinner. I do want to thank Galit who is in public relations and advertising for the hotel. She is professional charming and extremely warm. and I want to make it clear that I am not in any field that deserves special treatment unles being an underpaid English teacher is just that. However the entire experience at the hotel has made me determined to start saving so I can go for two nights next time so I will have time to take a tour of their gardens dairy and fieldsEnjoy.", "offset": [597, 683], "date": "2015-07-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "03c3ecae-898c-4059-9d7c-72499735df90", "sentence": "Shshshsh do not tell anyone.
