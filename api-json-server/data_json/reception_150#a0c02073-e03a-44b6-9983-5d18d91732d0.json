We decided to return to the Four Seasons Punta Mita after a five night stay in October of 2015. We had such an amazing vacation that we decided to stay for 10 days this year. I have stayed at many five star beach resorts around the world Mexico Bali Tahiti and Hawaii. The Four Seasons Punta Mita is our favorite for the following reasons Location Punta Mita is located about 45 minutes from Puerto Valarta airport. Getting to Puerto Valarta from the US is very easy. For us it is only a 25 hour flight from John Wayne Orange County. It is even closer for travelers from Dallas or Houston. Facilities The Four Seasons Punta Mita is built on an exceptional piece of real estate. The hotel straddles two beautiful beaches. The ocean water is warm and the surf is small so it is safe adults and children. The view from the pool is absolutely spectacular. The resort is organized so that nearly all of the rooms have views of the ocean. Activities The Four Seasons Punta Mita is the perfect destination for laying on the beach or by the pool soaking in the sun and reading a book but if you want more activities they have that too. There are activities most free scheduled throughout the day. There is kayaking snorkeling fishing yoga nature walks aqua aerobics to name a few. Service Besides occupying one of the finest beach properties in the world what makes the Four Seasons Punta Mita special are the people. We received excellent service throughout our stay but there are a few individuals that went above and beyond to insure our stay was truly exceptional. Those individuals are as follows. Front desk \u00b7 Marco Zefiro Front Office Manager. Marco greeted us when we arrived at the hotel which I greatly appreciated. When we had a problem with our room he was instrumental in rectifying the situation. We throughly enjoyed our stay in large part because of Marcos excellent customer service \u00b7. Jorge Serano Assistant Front Desk Manager. I spoke to Jorge before our visit and he was very helpful. When we arrived and had an issue with our room he was very helpful in resolving the issue. He is very professional and does an excellent job. \u00b7 Rita Carvalo front desk A recent transfer from Portugal Rita has a fantastic personality. I enjoyed talking with her on several occasions. She does a great job in making guests feel at home during their stay. Concierge \u00b7 Luis Barera Concierge. When I vacation I rely heavily on the concierge services. Luis is by far the most capable Concierge I have ever experienced. His demeanor is always extremely friendly and he is superb at remembering names. It is a great feeling when you walk up to the concierge desk and Luis immediately greets you by your surname and asks how we enjoyed the previous night \u2019s meal which he booked. Luis has been with the Four Seasons Punta Mita for 16 years and is a fantastic resource during your stay. Beach \u00b7. Rafael Casilas I am not easily impressed but Rafael is impressive. We relaxed on the beach the first day of our visit. When we awoke the next morning and went down to the beach someone had already set up towels on the chairs we occupied the previous day. We were disappointed considering there were virtually no other guests on the beach. Rafael approached us and directed us to the chairs where we sat the previous day. We assumed the towels were placed on the chairs for another guest. Rafael informed us that he had set up the towels on the chairs in anticipation of our return. It is a mark of exceptional service when staff anticipates your needs. When I joked that we were going to tire him out if he continued to provide such excellent service he surprised me by knowing the exact date of our departure. The fact that he knew that information which was more than a week away was extremely impressive. \u00b7. Hugo Guerero Hugo is super friendly and provides excellent service. He works very hard and takes the time to talk to the guests to insure he is meeting guests needs. Dining \u00b7 Ricardo Fernandez. I wish all of the restaurant staff was as professional and adept as Ricardo. While we only had the privilege of having him wait on us once for dinner he went out of his way to make sure we had a great dining experience. My two favorite Mexican dishes are carnitas and mole. When I asked him which was better he suggested I order the carnitas and he could bring me a side of mole. A simple suggestion but one I greatly appreciated and went a long way to making our dining experience one of the best during our stay. When I told him how much I enjoyed the carnitas I \u2019m a carnitas snob and joked that I was going to sneak into the kitchen to discover the chef \u2019s secret Ricardo offered to get me the recipe. He returned a few minutes later with a typed out copy of the recipe with detailed instructions. Now that \u2019s good service \u00b7. Oliverio Ramirez \u2013 Oliverio waited on us several times at Ketsi for breakfast. After only one visit to Ketsi Oliverio memorized our drink preference and special food requests. I really appreciated his ability to remember our preferences and the excellent service he provided during our stay. Dining. Perhaps my only complaint about the Four Seasons Punta Mita is the quality of the restaurants. There are three restaurants on the property that serve dinner. Aramara Bahia and Ketsi. Having dined at all three multiple times over our last two visits I must say that the quality of the food and the service is not up to the standards of the rest of the property. \u00b7. Aramara is an Asian themed restaurant. I \u2019ve traveled extensively throughout Asia for nearly 30 years and dined at many of the best restaurants in Japan China Hong Kong Thailand and Indonesia. I am a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Aramaras menu a mixture of Japanese Thai Chinese with some continental dishes. Unfortunately none of the dishes are really true to the tastes of the Asian countrys dishes. The sushi rolls are very expensive even by Four Seasons standards and not very good. I love Thai food but the Thai Curry Noodle did not taste like any Thai food I have ever experienced. Other dishes are good but the eclectic menu is disorienting to the palate. It is like going to a restaurant with a European theme and having Mexican interpretations of Italian German and French food all on the same menu. \u00b7. Bahia is a seafood and steak restaurant. We dined twice at Bahia during this most recent trip. I was not impressed with the service during either of our visits. The food is good but not exceptional. \u00b7 We did dine at Ketsi once and had a great meal in large part due to the excellent service we received from Ricardo Fernandez. Fortunately there are several excellent dining options off property but I wish the food at the Four Seasons Punta Mita was better so that we would not have to go off property so frequently. Overall we love the Four Seasons Punta Mita and hope to return every year. I highly recommend you consider vacationing at this exceptional resort property.", "offset": [3818, 3885], "date": "2016-09-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "d038d6a3-77f4-45af-bebe-77ac333be126", "sentence": "Last Minute Weekend Getaway. We booked a beach view room for a long weekend 3 days before going. Truly a last minute trip. After a private transfer from Puerto Valarta Airport to the hotel we were greeted by the polite staff who seated us offered cool moist scented towels to wipe our hands and faces then a fruit drink with tequila while they ran our credit card. Then we were whisked to our room after a tour in the golf cart. The pool and beach were enticing. We watched whales spout and breach about one mile offshore while we sipped cocktails and enjoyed the late afternoon sun. The weather the breeze the perfect temperature and the peacefulness of the resort eased our minds as we reveled in the beauty of the surroundings. The staff served our every whim. They learned our names almost immediately and greeted us personally at each of the dining venues and classes we took. The Pac\u00edfico Jack Nicklaus golf course was outstanding complete with hole 3B which requires a laser shot across the surf to a small island. Staff stand by ready to take you out to the island in an amphibious vessel at high tide when the cart path is submerged. We learned about the endangered sea turtlesand helped eighty or so 7hour old hatchlings crawl into the surf and their new home for decades. In 15 years these adult turtles will return to the same site on the beach to lay their eggs. A great experience for young and old guests. We took nature hikes beachside yoga classes ate and drank locally inspired fare and decided we would return for another weekend in 3 months. It was wonderful and a typical Four Seasons experience exquisite service thinking of literally everything including a tequila foot massage in my beach chair and having my sunglasses cleaned and polished just because.

My husband and I decided to spend our 10th year wedding anniversary at this terrific resort. We are big Four Seasons fans and at first we were a bit concerned with the location of this property being almost 1 hour away from the local attractions in Puerto Valarta. We were not planning on renting a car. But after arriving to the resort in Punta Mita we discovered quickly that we did not want to venture out at all. Make sure you pick up a weekly activity sheet they have them at the breakfast in the restaurant each morning or at the lobby. They have something different that you can participate in all throughout the day. If you do want to leave the resort area keep in mind that it is behind a multi manned security gated community. They keep track of who leaves and enters via your name and room number each time. We did not realize that local taxis can not enter the gates to pick you up they can only enter if you are in the taxi with them ie returning from the city or airport to the resort. If you do not choose to rent a car like our case the resort offers their own private taxi cars. They are more expensive than regular taxi cabs. Even to give you a ride to outside of the gated community compound they will charge you 8 140 pesos one way. Once outside the gates there are much cheaper local taxis at the stands to take you wherever you want to go. There are a lot of posts on the forum posts for Punta Mita Four Seasons inquiring about the noise construction. We did encounter the noise as well they do construcion mon sat 9 6 ish but it was tolerable. I tried to attach a video of the noise and the areas of the resort it affects which is by the main lobby beach and the main restaurant but you could not figure out way to attach on the TA site. Instead I posted some examples of the construction site. Reportedly they are building a 2level sports bar that will have an outside area and multiple tvs. they estimate end of November for completion. Our room was upgraded due to Amex FHR thank you Christina front desk for giving us a fabulous room. We stayed in the Estrela building. It had a hammock and spectacular view of the ocean. I highly recommend buildings 100 400 they go go by different names. ex. Estrela building 200. if you can get one of them. Housekeeping did a great job everyday. My advice is to call the front desk and schedule your daily housekeeping service and nightly turn down service if you would like to have a set schedule. We did that and they were always right on time based on the hours we picked. The staff around the resort is fantastic. Some of the most friendly people we have ever met on vacation. They will leave a wonderful impression on you. Always polite with smiles. We were told multiple times by different staff members when we wanted to give them an extra tip for either giving us a ride to back to our room on their golf carts or giving us a hand with bags etc that it is not necessary. In fact they seemed a bit uncomfortable taking extra money because the service charge includes everything. Never had that experience in a resort. I do appreciate their honesty. While on the topic the restaurants in the resort have the gratuity included on your receipt. Obviously you can opt to pay more should you wish. We enjoyed the different activities around the resort. They have 2 beach areas and there is a kisosk at one of them where you can get complimentary snorkel gear kayaks non motorized equipment. etc for up to 2 hours then they charge you for extra time. They have bicycles right outside the lobby area that you can use within the main gates of the resort community free up to 1 hour. The gym has lots of equipment and staffed during the day. We had a wonderful time and plan on returning soon to see their new and improved restaurant.", "offset": [3672, 3729], "date": "2018-09-12", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "7ff82e40-4063-422d-852e-cbdfea58839c", "sentence": "Great hotel but few flaws. The Four Seasons Punta Mita is a beautiful hotel that you must visit if you can. The layout of the hotel is good and although it is quite big they have golf carts you can ride around if you need. There are two sides to the beachI must warn you that you can not swim in most western Mexican beaches a lazy riverlacking a current a small shallow whirlpool hot tub a main large pool overrun with loud screaming children and an adult pool complex called Tamai. The attendants around the pool are quite good quick to bring and change towels for you and bringing little sample treats around every 30 minutes or so. The restaurants were a little below average for Four Seasons see my other reviews for that. Our room was quite nice our personal favourite out of any Four Seasons we have stayed at including our overwater bungalow in Bora Bora. We had a private plunge pool that was well maintained a hammock and a wide sitting area. We could also borrow movies if we wanted. Some of my personal favourites from this visit. The Thanksgiving week Smores barErika was very helpful supplies were in abundance they even included water. Water was in ABUNDANCE. Free bottled water all around the hotel they had bring you little coolers at the beach and the pool many bottles in the room in the lobby and in the restaurants. The hotel was also kept relatively bug free bug spray was provided to each guest and staff would spray special sprays however every other family member besides me got bit. A falcon was trained to circle the facility to keep it rid of birds and ridding it of sht. Also a man would enter the pool to bring a bar to guests and another man named Jose would come clean glasses and wear sunscreen around his waist. Some improvements I had love to see on the next visit The beds are decent but the pillows are terrible. Even after we called and got replacement pillows our heads still hurt. Golf carts also have to share paths with people even in areas not plagued by the construction of the new restaurant people would have to compete with the carts. Customer service seemed to be good but a few touches did not live up to the Four Seasons name. On the first day I expressed some interest into some sauce I had received in the room but the waiter immediately said that they did not have it in that part of the hotel only at the other parts. This would have been normal at another hotel but it was below Four Seasons quality. At the Four Seasons in Bali at Sayan staff members delivered plates of mangosteen to my room because I had expressed a liking for it. This went similarly with my complaint to a man named Wiliam at the Front Desk. Being used to the customer service at other Four Seasons I was struck back when he tried to charge me for some extra fruit sent to the romonly one fruit was sent of each variety we did not get to try all of them. All in all this is a good hotel and I recommend that you stay here if ever in the Valarta area over any competitor.", "offset": [1337, 1508], "date": "2018-11-25", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "33431ace-8732-4f92-b4b8-0fe195399f96", "sentence": "Paradise in Punta de Mita.

Everyone was so accommodating. I had recommend downloading the Four Seasons ap to access the daily schedule and restaurant menus. I had also recommend having a staff member tour you around the grounds via golf cart. There were two restaurants available to choose from but another restaurant is currently under construction. From Aramara I had recommend the Korean barbecue pulled pork and skirt steak bowl. The seafood linguini at Bahia was also great. There is an extensive room service menu as well. On the grounds is a lazy river a huge main pool area with a large jacuzi and the adult pool area that is totally awesome. Of note happy hour is 5 7pm in the adult area.

This place does not disappoint. The staff are so friendly and willing to go the extra mile I believe that is the true reason we always come back. We were here over Thanksgiving break 2019 This is our third time here and they are continually working to improve which I love. This time we were greeted by the housekeeping assistant manager Alonso when we checked in. He asked us what time we would like our turn down service and what time we usually were in and out of the room for best service times. This was awesome in theory but did not quite work out as one day we came back to our room at 5 pm and the room still had not been serviced the first time. usually there is an initial clean and then a turn down. They left a lovely gift of cookies and chocolate milk for the kids and limeade in the room for us. they also provide bug spray so you do not need to bring thatKids club greeted the kids with candy and a toy at check in. We were told they no longer reserve beach chairs and did a much better job of explaining all amenities this time around. For example we found out there is a washer and dryer. Also new from last time and one of my previous suggestions was that there was a cute beach bag in our room to borrow during our stay. yay. Bahia was excellent as usual. First night had the grilled octopus my hands down favorite and a salad and the hubby had the grilled yellow fin tuna. does not look like the kids menu has changed that much. My only gripe during our stay is that during previous stays they provided the kids with kids toothbrush and kids toothpaste and so we did not bring them any expecting they would be provided. Only this time they did not have any and the ones provided were adult and spicy for our kids. It also seemed like they were reluctant to give us extra bath products while LOcitane is lovely its super watery for my thick long hair and just myself uses a whole small bottle. We always need extra because the chlorine and the salt do a number on all our hair. While they always did when we asked previously they would leave us 2 3 extra bottles but this time we would only get on extra tiny little bottle and only when we asked. They had more pillow options this time. I hate feather pillows and prefer foam pillows that are flatter and this time they had some. Made my sleep a lot better. Still nothing can beat the pillow menu from the Mandarin Oriental in Paris. Now they let you hook your iPhone up to the tv to stream whatever streaming you have. Or you can watch whatever they have on tv. This is only a positive if you stream. The new Dos Catrinas is beautiful bright and airy. Food was excellent and reasonably priced for a resort. I love that they have lots of Mexican cuisine. Dinner choices were excellent and delicious. Waiters gave us excellent recommendation. The fish wrapped in banana leaves and the mexican pizza were delicious. If you have not had the Mexican coffee different for breakfast and dinner I highly recommend. Also the mexican hot chocolate is also fabulous. The upstairs bar is also a lovely place to sit and relax and have a drink Service at the pools are still excellent but we were initially told that they would not reserve chairs and that it was now first come first serve. But then we discovered that you COULD reserve chairs which made me a little upset since we had been there for so long. Sunscreen is provided in three different SPF although I wish they would say if they contained zinc or not as I prefer the physical sunblock I am super pale. Also it is more environmentally friendly. The only downside to the main pool is that there does not seem to be enough umbrellas shady spaces. There seemed to be a lot of people who wanted to get out of the sun and what a glorious 85 degrees it was too. I guess if you want shade you have to go to the lazy river or the beach. Pool side massage is also available for a price and there is been a change to paper straws and biodegradable cups. They still need to work out the straws as they did not last the entire drink and would get mushy. Maybe bamboo like in costa rica. in any case I appreciate that they are trying to be more environmentally friendly. Pool side service is excellent and there is always plenty of people around to help you with anything you ned. Washer and dryer was free to use with detergent and dryer sheets. AWESOME. how did I only find out about this now. The only downside is that it looks like no one has EVER cleaned out the washers as there was a lot of crud in the rubber ring part. Yuck. I tried to clean it out but there was not even a trash can in the laundry room for lint removal. I guess now that our kids are getting older they are drifting away from the kids for all seasons and towards the game room. We have not really spent a lot of time at the game room before but it is pretty nice. It has lots of everything old fashioned games like paceman and space invaders as well as new xbox type games. Even table tennis and fosbal. My only complaint is there seems to be a lack of communication somewhere as the kids for all seasons told us that there were people in the game room to watch our kids but the game room people said they do not do that. I wish there was a way to check in your slightly younger kids like between 5 8 or 9 who you do not quite feel comfortable roaming around the resort by themselves so that parents could be contacted or could be assured the kids do not just leave. Our kids do not get video games at home so this was not really an issue for us but still an extra layer of peace of mind would have made this place even beter. We did the turtle release again our third time. and I do not know if there was just a ton of people this time or if they are just trying to make as much money as possible but previous years we had gotten 4 6 turtles each person and this year it was only 2 turtles to release per person. I also felt like it was more rushed and commercialized compared to the first time we did it. where we watched a video of what our donation paid for and why it was so important.", "offset": [516, 670], "date": "2020-01-14", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "44dee2e7-4c45-4515-81ef-48b98db8388a", "sentence": "If your reading the reviews pondering if you would like to visit this gem as quoted by another reviewer question yourself no further. My husband and I went last year for a family members 20th year anniversary. They visit the resort yearly and rave about it. As they should. Once you arrive it \u2019s like entering a foreign land filled with pure luxury breath taking architecture beautiful beaches and efficient yet relaxed and courteous staff. Bewildering astonishing captivating barely describe this resort. The rooms are well designed and very well kept. The beaches are refreshing and warm with a cool mist. The pools are laid out perfectly though out the property. The resort offers daily activities and houses some of the best food I \u2019ve ever partaken. The staff are friendly not pushy or overly observant. You can leave the resort to the small town right out side of the gates. It \u2019s a little weird at first with armed guards walking around but totally safe. It actually adds to the culture and style of the stay if your able to visit for a couple of hours. I \u2019ve traveled a great deal but can not glorify the beauty of this place well enough. If your looking for a hardcore party ster clear. It \u2019s not that type of environment. If your looking for a relaxed effortless flow of beautiful buildings walking paths beaches rooms spas romance self reflection and or seclusion it should be top of the list to visit. We plan on going back soon not soon enough. 10 stars if I could rate that high.", "offset": [755, 808], "date": "2020-02-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
