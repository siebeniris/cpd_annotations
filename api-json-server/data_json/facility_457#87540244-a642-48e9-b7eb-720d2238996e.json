The service at the hotel is excellent but I could not help to feel I was out of place as someone in the 30 age demographic. For example I passed over a dozen young groups of partygoers returning back to their hotel rooms while I was in route to the gym at 830am. While there were other older guests in the hotel I felt dowdy and sluggish when I retired to my room at midnight and others were just stepping out for dinner.

After 4 hours no phone call so went back to reception where they wanted passport details yet again for security reasons although I explained we had already signed in but were just waiting for a phone call which never came.

All sunbeds taken near bar so pretty fed up. Told a manager Daniel how fed up we were and he got on the case straight away. Next days had water leaks from ceiling probably due to air conditioning. Had shower in the wet room bathroom. Not great. Husband had to roll up his trousers to get to the loo to avoid getting wet. Key card did not work and you need that to get up the lift.

So I stayed in your hotel last March and it was anything but 5 star worthy. I am still mad about it. In all fairness me and my companion both work in gastronomy and work. have worked for the Stawod and Mariot chain in 5 Star superior hotels in Germany. I do not expect special treatment however given what 5 Star service means in my country and in your hotel worlds apart. Before arriving we had received written confirmation for an early check in. Arriving shortly after 1 pm we were told that our room was not ready yet. Upon asking whether we could store our luggage we gave that to the staff and each received a voucher to redeem at the bar on the ground floor. We left our phone number with the reception clerk who assured us to be called as soon as the room was available. We did redeem the vouchers had something to eat and waited and waited and waited. Once the clock passed 3 pm I went to the check in desk again to inquire as to the possibility to check in now since 3 pm is the official check in time. First surprise the room was indeed ready and had been for quite a while apparently. The staff just failed to inform us. Unfortunately we had to pick up our luggage and rolled up to our room 5Star superior service when waiting for the room the luggage will be brought up to it. But ok no big hassle as all luggage these days practically rolls up itself. Upon entering the room we sat down and then did a checking round as most guest do. We only had one bathrobe in a room for 2. The bed was not properly made meaning on one side the bed sheet was tucked in so deep. that on the other side there was nothing left to be tugged in. I could see the matres and the bed framing. Then I took away the decorative Dal\u00ed pillow only to discover that it had a dirty spot on its backside. probably the reason it was propped up that way and not with the dirty side up which states your hotel logo. Also both sleeping pillows on the left side of the bed were dirty. So we called the reception concierge and were assured somebody was going to come up and fix all stated problems. And they did all one by one. Every couple of five to ten minutes someone knocked at the door entered taking something out or bringing something up and then slamming the door on their way out. After the fifth time of slamming I had had enough. My friend and I intended to head out and explore the city despite the weather so I freshened up went to the bathroom only to notice that there was no toilet brush. By now it was past 5 pm. Hours had gone to waste. Downstairs we asked whether we could get a toilet brush for the room and were told that that was not possible because there were none to be had since housekeeping cleans the rooms daily. Are you kidding me. Even if you share a room with your spouse whom you have seen ill and sick. people go to the bathroom and sometimes the toilet simply dirties up and you want to tell me there is no toilet brush. There are also no toilet brushes in the toilet stalls in all the public areas. After returning later that night wanting to warm up I phoned the room service to asked for a teacup and 2 bags of green tea. I was told that things ought to be brought up very soon and sure enough things were brought up quickly. However I was brought a couple of tea bags of black tea which was already in the room with the simple commentary of Green tea is not complimentary. Now that was the last straw. Do not tell me when I am placing an order that things will be brought up only to not bring what was ordered let alone to tell me that 2 tea bags of green tea aren\u00b4t complimentary. You claim to be a 5 star superior hotel. Had I ordered a whole package I would have understood but please. Next up when something is not complimentary inform me while I am placing my order or call back with this information. I would have at this point even paid for 2 tea bags of green tea. To relieve my stress I headed to the gym only to head to the spa to let someone know that it was raining into the gym since apparently the window side was leaking. By that time I was not even surprised anymore. Breakfast the next day was alright. though the following two days the labels for juices always noted grapefruit juice even though none was available on both days after the first. If it is not there why put up the sign for it. Also the staff tends to be a little too quick in clearing tables. my friend and I had dishes taken away before eating them same with a cappuccino. Also for the kitchen staff how come when I order an omlete 3 days in a row it is significantly smaller on one day than the otherI am talking about half the size here. And as for the rooftop bar. I had made a reservation via email months ahead and checked a week before our arrival. I also send a mail wanting to postpone the reservation to an hour later that same day that was reserved but I never got a response back in 2 days. Then we went we were on the list went up and no table available. I made a reservation for a VIP table with a bottle of Cava and we arrive and there is no table available. Luckily a couple just left and we got a place on the sofa side looking out the window onto the beach. Seriously that was the worst stay with the most mistakes and failures I ever had as a guest. My friend let all those points I wrote be known to a senior receptionist staffer and I struggled with letting a bad review be posted. However even though months have past since March I am still very upset and angry about our stay and your service since my friend and I simply treat our guests very differently. I seriously hope this is going to be taking as constuctive criticism since you will have to do better and given all the bad reviews already on here and other websites the bad comments in per cent are way above average for other hotels in the same or even 4 star categories. I can not recommend a stay in your hotel which is a very sad thing to say. I get that things can go wrong and if it were just one or two things but I have not even mentioned the little things.", "offset": [680, 792], "date": "2018-02-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "f0cf8458-8883-4359-84da-5638bd2f636c", "sentence": "NOT a luxury resort.

After not hearing from them for hours I went to check if it was ready and lo and behold it was ready for possibly quite some time as our luggage was already in the room. Lunch at the outside pool had terrible service. Ordered a drink and two fish tacos. Took probably 45min hour for the food to come out and we had to keep asking about the drink. The server kept apologizing not sure if he forgot or the bar kitchen was slow. The fish tacos were two little strips of fish per taco with barely any toppings and overwhelmed with sauces. Not worth the 16\u20ac And the worst part of all. It is SO LOUD at night. We book a \u201c wonderful room \u201d but were told we were upgraded at check in. Turns out this room was right above where people line up to take the elevator to the club at night. All of the rooms face the middle and all the floors are opened up to the main lobby so the noise just travels up. When we first asked to be moved we were told the whole hotel was booked and everyone already checked in. We were offered earplugs and a \u201c call down when it \u2019s loud and we \u2019l tell them to be quiet \u201d. How is this considered a luxury stay when you ca n\u2019t even sleep. There was n\u2019t even a warning that there was a club there and that it gets noisy at night. After 20 mins of trying to suck it up it just kept getting louder and louder as more people started showing up for the club. I went down again to complain at this point I was ready to find another hotel and get out of there. Magically a room down the hall in the corner was open. Still could hear noise but much better. Checkout was terrible. Did n\u2019t even checkout was first in line but one of the reception people walked up to the men behind me and asked if he could help them with something. I guess it did n\u2019t matter I was waiting in line as welIn all honesty I do n\u2019t even write hotel reviews but spending 500 for a luxury hotel and having the experience I did I wish I never booked this place.

After staying in the Miramar Hotel last year we decided to crank it up another notch for our short escape this year and booked the Cool Corner Suite at the W Hotel in Barcelona. The people at the entrance and reception were very helpful and it took us less than 10 minutes before we got access to our room even though it was only 1 PM when we arrived officially the room is ready at 3 PM. I have to say the reception area was less impressive than you would expect from one of the top hotels in a major city like Barcelona and certainly less impressive than some people have told me. As long as you kept your vision horizontally things looked very luxurious but if you looked up the high rust colored walls going up 6 floors with uninspiring graffiti like decorations and glass barriers reminded me of outdated senior citizen hotels on Gran Canaria. Yes I have stayed there too. The room was located at the very back of the long red hallway on the 19th floor. Our luggage was delivered to the room 2 minutes after we arrived great service. The first thing you see upon entering is the spatious living room with large windows that provide you with an amazing panorama view on the sea and Barcelona Port with its superyachts and cruise ships. The suite has a has futuristic yet very comfortable carpet in the rooms and a high quality dark tile floor in the bathroom. The living room has 3 nice couches a large tv and modern lighting with a copper look. However when you enter the bedroom with its huge sized comfortable bed stand alone bathtub and another 2 comfortable couches you start to wonder what good the living room is for especially since you have got the same large tv available here as well. I guess some types of people tend to bring extra guests into their room in which case there is surely enough furniture for them to pass out on. The tilted ocean view through the panoramic windows is absolutely amazing and gives you the feeling of being inside a huge cruise ship in the middle of the ocean without the boat sounds and moving up and down on the waves luckily. Sailboats and yachts continually pass your view only adding to the unique experience. The bath comfortably fits 2 regular non american sized people and the rainshower is from a superb quality which is located in a space the size of entire bathrooms in some hotels. For couples the suite provides you with everything you need for your luxurious romantic getaway. Waking up and opening the blinds with the push of a button providing you once more with the best ocean view you can get kind of makes you feel as if you are staying in Iron Mans house. The breakfast buffet was very complete with everything a normal person can think of and in case you consider yourself more than that you can always order specials at will. A very nice touch from the romkeping was that they actually washed out my wine glass from the previous night and put it next to the half empty bottle of reserve Rioja that we bought in the city instead of sticking to procedure and putting it back with the other glass in the living room liquor cabinet. Lovely personal touch how they already identified that only one of us has a drinking problem. All but the most excentric sorrow drowning millionaires those however usually get the even more lavish extreme wow suite will be happy to hear that you can find enough alcoholic beverages in both the living and bedroom fridges at priced high enough to feel properly ripped off even if you usually pretend that money is not an issue. By the second night however even the highest standard of luxury seems to somewhat normalize to a person and you start looking more at the little details. Unfortunately I have to say that those details are not up to standards with what you would expect from a room that goes at a rate of around 80 euros per night. Some exampes the painters somehow managed to smudge half a bucket of paint on the airconditioning vent just under the ceiling the very designy looking piece of furniture next to the bathtub which by the way is a perfect fit for a laptop to watch Game of Thrones on while having a bath with your not american sized partner in crime unfortunately showed massive signs of wear on the coppery top platform and two of the ceiling lights seemed to have attempted multiple escape attempts with heavy cracks in the paint as a consequence. On top of that the wall between the shower room and the bedroom showed clear signs of water damage. Nothing that would ever bother you in a regular hotel room but at this price level you expect close to perfection. The architect who designed the hotel got a ton of praise but I am kind of confused as to why someone so skilled would not think of the fact that if you can not open the panoramic windows you also can not clean the 1 m wide concrete platform outside of it either. Our friend Mr Seagull owner of that particular platform decided to punish this design flaw in the form dozens of brownish art pieces. Takes away a bit from the experience when you are looking at an actual pirate ship arriving from the endless blue. The architects second mistake is the location of the so called sundeck with mandatory infinity pool never quite understood the point of those. A more appropriate name would be deck of the eternal shadow as with the exception of perhaps mid July when the sun is all the way up in the sky the hotel blocks the sun from shining on this deck the entire afternoon. Also Mr Bofil when you design a near 100 m tall hotel it might be smarter and classier to put the pool somewhere else than on the first floor. I know clubers demand their top floor vulgarities but with 25 more stories to spare there was ample opportunity for a Marina Bay Sands style pool which would then have actually been a true sun deck as well. Two birds with one stone. A last thing to mention is that the room itself is perfectly wheelchair accessible but the designer somehow forgot to put a wide door in the 4 square meter shower room which I can imagine would take away some of the luxury feeling if you have to crawl your way into the bathroom to enjoy your lovely rainshower. The staff however is so helpful that I can imagine that they would be fine with carrying you in and out so maybe that softens the issue. We tried the Spa which has all the amenities you would expect but again some design flaws are made by the designer. There are no loungers next to the very small indoor pool and I mean so small that 2 people can not comfortably swim next to eachother only a long bench to sit uncomfortably on. The sauna and steambath are ok but again this area only has 6 loungers and another one of those ugly benches. but I can imagine how busy this place must be during high season. The website marketed this place as huge but I have honestly seen larger pools and saunas in boutique hotels with 10 rooms. The Koh I Nor in Val Thorens for example proves how you can still make a smaller Spa area look classy and comfortable while a space shortage is hardly an excuse to begin with in this W hotel. Not really what you would expect. Conclusion. The W Hotel provides you with extravagant luxury and most amazing views over Barcelona and the breakfast is great. The staff is extremely helpful and brings a personal touch to make you feel 100 comfortable. The Reception area looks unfinished and the Pool and Spa zone for hotel guests is way too small and lacks the touch of a proper interior designer. The architect also made some clear errors designing the building. Still the overall experience and one of the best views to wake up to that you will ever get more than make up for these mistakes.", "offset": [211, 421], "date": "2019-05-01", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "fbbd9f64-e400-4003-8bf7-720f74d018b0", "sentence": "Great Views.
