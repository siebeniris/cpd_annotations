There was a Lightning hockey game on Friday night and a Rush concert on Sunday night so the hotel was VERY busy. With all of that going on we were still able to have a beautiful wedding evening from 530 11 pm. We were on the 2nd floor for the wedding ceremony and reception so it was not down in the lobby where it was very busy. This hotel is located in a fabulous location in downtown Tampa. Riverwalk is right across the street. The trolley to Chanelside and Ybor City is right out the front door. There are bars and restaurants within easy walking distance.

I have been trying to make a reservation with him for the next afternoon thinking I would have to sleep in our van with our five children all night. when explaining this to Mr Steve he put me on hold me and came back and told me to just come on in. he explain to me that although overboked he was going to try to do everything possible for us to have a place to stay. we rode in around 530 6 of the clock in the morning and Steve was waiting at the front of the hotel to greet us. he had already advised the entire staff from Valley all the way through the breakfast staff that we were coming. at this point had nothing gone wrong My name is Vanessa and I want to share my review. I had booked a reservation at a Hilton family hotel for Memorial Day Weekend. When arriving at check in we went in to our room to settle in when about an hour later we realize that the A C was not working. We have a daughter with serious asthma and she was starting to have coughing fits. This hotel had no one to fix the A C and no where to acomidate us. So to prevent our daughter from going into a full out emergency asthma attack we had no choice but to stick all 5 children into our vehicle at 345 in the morning. With no where to go I started calling around to see where we could seek shelter for the night. We were livid. I suddenly remembered to call the Embassy Suites Tampa Convention Center which we have stayed at numerous times in the past. A gentlemen by the name of Steve answered the phone and told me they were full to capacity. I asked to make a reservation for the next day to ensure somewhere to go after thinking we were going to sleep in our van over night. I explain to hin what was going on when he suddenly says just come on in. We arrived at the valet around 5 am. Mr Steve front desk rep had already advised the entire staff from valet to breakfast of our arrival. At the other Hilton Hotel we would have been headed to the beach for Memorial Day at this hour. instead all of us were headed to our room to try to get some sleep. Due to the circumstances Mr Steve apparently thought we should be accommodated to the best of their ability because when we got into our room he had accommodated us with an amazing suite. Although our plans of hitting the beach with our family were ruined we were able to spend a good 3 days at this Embassy Suite Hotel which was an exceptional and beautiful place to stay regardless. I had my words with a woman at the Hilton Corporation office because after ruining our vacation she only wanted to give us one free night stay. As you can imagine had that been the case I would have made a grand affair to warn the public of. how Hilton Corporation does not take care of their Honor members. Instead I was able to meet a front desk manager by the name of Jason at the Embassy Suites where we were staying that after telling him our story refused to let that be the case. He was so gracious to not only listen to my story but to make sure that he accommodated our three night stay and took responsibility of the other two nights that the Hilton corporation would not. He even gave our entire 8 member family complementary tickets to the Tampa Aquarium before we headed back home. This hotel is beautiful professional and full of wonderful and amazing staff. From the Reid family to the Embassy Suites Tampa Convention Center Hotel we want to thank you for all you did for our family. There is not one area in which this hotel did not earn a full 5 stars. And I am one of the pickiest guests that could ever enter any establishment. We are already planning our next vacation right back to the Embassy Suites Tampa Convention Center to finish where we left off. Thank you so much again the Hilton corporation should be extremely proud of your work and decisions as we have been members over 10 years can not wait to see you all soon.

Mold broken locks and clueless employees. I do n\u2019t know where to start but I \u2019l try my best. My wife who is 75 months pregnant arrived at this hotel at 1230 and noticed a very long line to valet her car. It turns out there was only valet attendant at a valet only hotel. She waited for a good 15 minutes to finally get her car to the valet. She was using her mobile key on the Hilton ap and it said it was n\u2019t working so she went to the front desk. The front desk agent said she did n\u2019t know how to make a key and would have to call her manager but in the meantime she would have security escort her to the room. Upon arriving in the room she sees a half drunk beer bottle the sheets and pillows are thrown around the tv is on and the bathroom is a mess. Someone was clearly staying there. She asked to be escorted to another room. Not an unreasonable request. Upon arriving back down at the front desk the agent still does n\u2019t know how to make keys tells her that she also does n\u2019t know to assign her to another room but that she will just pick a room at random and have the guard let her in. She said her manager would bring keys in the morning. My wife is exhausted and just wanted a room agreed and let the security guard escort her. Upon arriving in the room it appeared okay until further investigation. The bed was propped up on cinder blocks see photo below the adjoining door lock was broken and could be accessed from another room and to top it off the lock on the main door was wobbly and not secure. My wife called down to the front desk to ask if she could be moved again. 9 minutes later and no answer. I finally called Hilton Corporate and had a very \u201c nice \u201d chat with a \u201c super pleasant \u201d agent there. The hotel then sent the security guard to her room with keys to her room which solved nothing. I called back to Hilton and explained that the keys were n\u2019t an issue if the room does n\u2019t lock. The agent this time said they would move her to a corner King that was n\u2019t adjoining. Upon arriving in the corner king it was a handicap accessible room that was adjoining. This room also had a broken lock. Their was mold literally piled up on the floor see photo below. At this point my 75 month pregnant wife moved something to the door so nobody could enter and fell asleep. I finally called Hilton again and had the room moved over to another hotel for the duration of her stay. Upon trying to leave this morning there was again only 1 valet attendant and it took 25 minutes to get her car. She asked for a to go box for her breakfast and the attendant told her they do n\u2019t do that. In what world do you tell a very pregnant lady she ca n\u2019t get a to go box. Upon telling the hotel she was leaving they told her she should \u2019ve called down and their desk agent would \u2019ve solved all the issues last night. Needless to say this hotel is an absolute disaster. Please avoid. I ca n\u2019t imagine what their management team is doing to have all of these issues going on.

I have stayed at hotels that have been doing renovations but this has been one of the worst hotel stays I have ever had. Check in was probably the smoothest experience during my stay. When I got to my room it appeared everything was great. I went to fresh up before heading to the convention center and low and behold the bathroom sink would not drain. I look on the floor and there are towels still under the sink likely from the previous guest. I still did not get upset. I went to use the other sink and it was stopped up as well. My biggest issue was approaching the Front Desk staff and letting them know about the sinks and the used towels. The reaction from the 2 young ladies and a gentleman who may have been the front desk manager was astonishing and unprofessional. As I am telling one of the young ladies about my situation he blurts out well we are sold out and there is no other rooms available. I was not asking to be moved I just wanted fresh towels and for my sinks to be unclogged. I went to my conference and returned to my room the dirty towels were still on the floor and although the water had gone down in the sink they were still clogged. Called down to the front desk and of course no one answers. Breakfast was a complete joke as it took them 30 mins to prepare eggs. How are you operating a hotel adjacent to the Convention Center and can not prepare for large crowds staying in your hotel. No Customer service skills and very unprofessional.

This is our go to hotel when attending the Amalie and because I am a Hilton member. This hotel is undergoing a major renovation as is the whole riverwalk area. So there is going to be some major hotel competition. do not believe their time completion schedule of December 2018. They are in the early stages of a huge mess. All the more important then to do what you can do well. This is where they fall very short. The doormen and valet immediately tell you how to get to the now second floor lobby which is very important as the first floor is torn apart. However they are still charging 28 valet only parking a night. Event parking is only 16. So why not give your guests that parking break at least. Start the compensation for the mess right away. Upon check in they need to immediately apologize and compensate. I am a gold member and had to ASK for the welcome water. However a letter showing all the expected renovations along with water treats for EVERYONE would show some good will and appreciation. Also since the hotel restaurant in closed some coupons for local food and beverage would not be outside the norm. The rooms are all 2 room suites which I have always be pleased with. But if you are not on a remodeled florthose are in very limited availability currently. the cleaning and maintenance falls very short. There were no vanity curtains only broken black out shades that did not close. And a shower faucet that we could not turn off. Daytime construction noise precludes a nap. If you made reservations a while ago you may not have even been aware of all of this. And then the evening reception and breakfast Both should be elevated to a much higher level to incur some level of guest patience. There were limited seating and snack options for the receptionand tortilla chips that all looked like they were the bottom of the bag. Breakfast was decidedly ordinary. And NOT warm.

We were on the 19th floor so the view was amazing. I also could not hear the noise from the main floor construction. We used the pool that was heated but my children said it was not that warm. Still we hung out there because it was nice and relaxing. We went down to the free cocktails and appetizers both nights. Having the free drinks was a nice treat but the appetizers were not appetizers. It was just pretzels nacho chips and dip. I loved the nacho chips and dip but wish they had a little more for the kids.

We arrived at 130PM which is before check in time and were told to wait for a text message telling us our room was ready. At 545PM we still had not received a message so we called and were told the hotel is overboked. We had all of our stuff stored with the hotel staff and had a concert to get to 630PM. So we visited the hotel again to investigate in person to find a COMPLETELY PACKED lobby \u2013 everyone in line waiting for a room. Mind you. we as well as everyone else had a confirmed reservation. Also keep in mind we were in town for a concert and had to change clothes and freshen up for concert. While waiting in line. 60 PM trying to get our room along with everyone else we noticed on the Hilton website they are STILL SELLING ROOMS for that night. So \u2013 not only is the hotel overboked and is turning away people who has already paid they are still taking ADDITIONAL RESERVATIONS. Stunning. Luckily we were given a room. We spoke to others who had to wait until 1PM the previous night to get a room. And even these people were not the least fortunate. Some were told not until 1PM. no rooms existed and they would be bused to another Hilton property. So \u2013 after waiting for 9 hours they were finally told they would not receive the room they had paid for. Imagine the frustration. The managers reception Hilton advertises free drinks for happy hour is absolute chaos. One bartender is handling a line of over 100 people trying to get their promised free drink. Breakfast is a similar catastrophe long lines and no seats are there anyway. People are in the elevators carrying their food upstairs. Some elevators are out of order further adding to the confusion. The hotel literally needs double the elevators which there is not room for anyway. The hotel is 18 stories high and simply does n\u2019t have the foot print to handle all the people. The hotel is terribly designed and can not handle as many rooms as it holds. Not to mention they sell double the rooms the hotel has. It \u2019s sad because the hotel has just gone on a renovation and cosmetically looks great. The hotel simply lacks any kind of management. It \u2019s not bad management this would be a compliment. There is NO MANAGEMENT. If you value your time at all book elsewhere.
