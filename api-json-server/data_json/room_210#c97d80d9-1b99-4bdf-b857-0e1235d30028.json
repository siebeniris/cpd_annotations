I had never been to Sweden before but my parents wanted to go to the Elitlopet after I went to Roland Garos in Paris so I needed to find a hotel in Stockholm. The reason I chose this hotel was primarily based on their location. it is right across the street from Central Station and steps from Ctyterminalen. The hotel is large and beautiful the staff is very pleasant and helpful. When it was time for me to check into my flight home I was having an issue with their computer at the business center so they helped me at one of their check in computers. The room we had was large and clean. The bathroom has a tub shower and is spacious which was very nice after staying in Paris where the hotel rooms are very small. The beds were very comfortable and the wifi was quite fast. The restaurant has excellent food. I had the clubhouse meatballs for lunches and the burger on my last night there. You are within walking distance of the hop on hop off bus tours and a large pedestrian shopping area. The only knock on the hotel and I am being very very picky is that one of the elevators broke down for a few hours but it is not a problem since they have 4 more. When I go back to Stockholm I would not consider staying at another hotel.", "offset": [637, 763], "date": "2015-06-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b5c578e3-77c8-4f8e-943b-56d55c087fd2", "sentence": "Great short stay despite hot room.

Breakfast is the usual buffet but with a great choice. While the breakfast room can be very busy it works well. We did not eat in the restaurant which seems to be a speciality fish restaurant.

When checking in and out we did find that this was slightly on the slow side and queues built up but they offer an Express checkout service for anyone in a hurry. Whilst checking in we also saw one of the staff being very friendly with a family who had a young little girl with them. She gave the little girl a teddy bear free from behind the counter.

We ended up staying at the Radison Blu Royal Viking Hotel after checking for some last minute deals before our planned family trip to Stockholm. We had originally booked a stay at Clarion Hotel Sign but after looking at the last minute deals we chose the Radison Blu Royal Viking instead both due to the price of a Last Minute deal. Premium Room including breakfast and the location of the hotel. We were 3 people traveling 2 adults and one 1year old child. Based on prior experience extra beds in a double room can be anything from a sofa bed to a proper bed so I also contacted Radison Blus customer service to make sure that we would get a proper bed for our 1year old. They confirmed that they would place a proper extra bed in the room for us. When checking in the receptionist asked me whether I was aware of the fact that I had booked a room without breakfast. At this point I was 100 certain that we had indeed booked a room with breakfast and fortunately the receptionist took my word for it also mentioning that the hotel was in the process of changing room categories so these things could indeed be subject for some errors. Little did I know that this was not the only error we would be encountering. We got the key cards for room 21 and we got in the elevator. When we got into the room we immediately noticed the high temperature in the room probably somewhere close to 30 degrees celsius. The fan was set to maximum cooling but there was no cold air at all. it is worth noting that on this particular day Monday July 16th 2018 it was incredibly hot in Stockholm more than 30 degrees outsideHowever something else was not right. This room did not look anything close to the room we had booked on the Radison Blu website. It seemed quite much smaller than on the pictures there was no view Premium Rooms were supposed to have city view and there was no Nespreso coffee machine. My gut feeling was telling me that this is not the Premium Room we had booked. I went back to the reception and asked another receptionist the following questions Can you please tell what the room category of room 21 is. And are not you supposed to have air conditioning at this hotel. The receptionist looked into our booking and basically confirmed what I had been afraid of. You have been given a Superior Room which is one of our better room types. Then I showed him my reservation details which clearly stated Premium Room and Buffet breakfast included. Fortunately this receptionist was being very service minded. He repeated what his colegue had told me earlier that the hotel was in the process of changing room categories and the booking system on the Radison Blu website was not yet 100 aligned with the new room categories. He then told me that the reason why we had been given a Superior Room instead of a Premium Room was actually the fact that the layout of the Premium Rooms will not allow for any extra beds there is simply not enough space. The Premium Rooms are basically business class rooms for two people. The booking system did however not prevent me from adding 1 or 2 children to the booking. The receptionist told me that he could show me two of the Premium Rooms and if this would work for us having space for an extra bed we would of course be getting the room we wanted. Fortunately one of the Premium Rooms 601 were a little bit larger than the others so that room actually would work for us. Most importantly on this hot day week the Premium Room had a working air condition which left us with no doubts about the room. We installed ourselves in room 601 for the next 3 nights. So how was our stay. Room 601 was good except for the fact that it was a bit dark. Limited number of windows dark colours on the walls and limited lights which also were malfunctioning turning themselves on and off randomly. This specific room was big enough for 3 people but I would not really call it big aprox 20 25m2. The style of the room retro style was not my cup of tea but might appeal to others. The bathroom shower no bathtub was clean and it worked OK with the exception of a having a simple door that never will become really closed the door turns both ways and there is a gap between the door and the wall that actually makes it possible to see what is going on inside the bathroom from the outside. There is no lock on the door either. This is probably not a problem when traveling with family or close friends but still worth mentioning. The air conditioning of the room was very efficient and did not make a lot of noise. The service of the hotel staff was great they sorted out the problem with our booking and generally they were service minded and fast. The breakfast was standard for hotels in the Nordics. Not great not bad. A lot of people was staying at this hotel but we had no problems finding a table. We also tried the pool in the basement. It was OK although quite dark it has a cave theme so it makes sense I guess. The jacuzi was great. The location of the hotel is really one of its best attributes. it is literally located next door to the Central Station and the Centralen subway hub is also next door. If you intend to move around in Stockholm you can not stay at a better location than this. Also the Drotningsgatan shopping area is also within a short walking distance.

Internet is fast and reliable which means a lot to me. Great gym with nice variety of equipment. This hotel feels too crowded and a bit pricey when compared to options nearby. Long line to check in and the check in process took too long. Though the breakfast has good food the overall breakfast experience was not good at all. Unles you go to breakfast right at the time they open at 630 you will be fighting for a table. Not enough staff to bring you coffee. Basically the facility is under staffed and too small for the size of the breakfast crowd. Often I would leave the table for seconds just to find that someone else took my table. I attempted to get a drink at the lobby bar and left without a drink after 15 minutes wait. Again too many people. The TV in the room is a joke. I love it that it has built in Chromecast so I could stream my own shows but the TV often had issues and would not broadcast regular shows. Honestly I experienced issues every single day of my stay. The gym was nice but again it was overcrowded on peak hours.", "offset": [0, 35], "date": "2020-02-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}]}
