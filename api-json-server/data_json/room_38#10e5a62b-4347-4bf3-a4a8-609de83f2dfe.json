We stayed here for Memorial Weekend 2016 so this should be taken into account when reading the review. Upon booking we had a free upgrade available subject to availability the weekend we arrived must be one of the busiest of the year so the hotel were not able accommodate our upgrade but they certainly went out of their way to try and get us the best possible room. The staff here are amazing and certainly go over and above everytimeThe Hotel is vast and I do not think we managed to explore it all the downside of this is that depending on what building you stay in it can take ages to get around the hotel. The hotel itself is very grand and we loved all of the features. The rooms are lovely and clean with all the amenities. There are a few upgrades required but they certainly do not take away from the initial charm. We stayed in the Chateau Building and loved this building for the best views and most central location. I would recommend Oceanfront Rooms floors 9 and above 11 and above have Balconies. Downsides of the rooms No tea coffee making facilities and non available when you call guest services old style Apple Docking stations which do not work with iPhone 5 models and above. The Pool area was great with lots of different seating areas. Given it was a holiday weekend it was extremely busy and sometimes difficult to get seating around the pool however we came specifically for the weekend and so this did not bother us too much as we had expected it. Another feature of this holiday weekend were pool parties each day Thursday Monday again this was ideal for us but I can imagine if you are not into partying too much this would not have been to your liking and I did hear a few people complaining. Other Hotel features including restaurants and the BleauBar were lovely everything was good quality but as you can imagine extremely expensive.

I spend here 10 days so I had enough time to get a picture of this hotel. Of course almost everywhere in the world you pay the double price during the holiday season which is fine. The Hotel was ok but they are still room to improve. On arrival the luggage person told me that he can take my luggage but it will be a while until it gets to my room so I decided to keep it with me I am a single mom with a 3 y o traveling then we waited in line for about 15 20 minutes to check in. The room had a good size nice balcony and a great view left the ocean right the city. It was clean. Room Service has been there every day. For a Cabana for one day you have to spend 500 plus Tax and Gratuity so basically almost 100 for putting towels on the cabana and that was it but no other service. If you want a chair you need to be there around 9 am or you will be waiting for a while for one if you are lucky to get one after. it is a little bit mass tourism at least this is how it feels like. The enterprise car rental should be there to make life easier for customers. I pre ordered a car for a certain day at 930 am I did not have it by 1030 am and they told me that I have to wait at least another half hour. so I decided to cancel the reservation and take a taxi to Key Largo. where I had a reservation made and needed to get there on time. This has been the worst experience. it is not the hotel though it is the rental car service I know but still part of the service the hotel wants to provide so they need to make sure it does function. Most of the Staff is really friendly and helpful. Wlan is really bad you should try work on that. These day it is important to most people. So overall I would say it was a good stay with a little lack of service. The hotel is nice and it is beutiful inside. The kidspol is great for small kids and getting a chair there is not too bad.

During the day the lobby was JAMMED with people attending a DJ paloza type party on the property that a local radio station gave tickets for and at night the lobby was JAMMED with all kinds of people preparing to party the night away at their nightclub.

Altogether my stay at Fontainebleau Hotel was very nice. It \u2019s very well localized. Being a beachfront hotel it also has really easy beach and boardwalk access. The hotel is a short drive away from Lincoln Road and Ocean Drive. The room I stayed in was fantastic. It was spacious had an oceanfront view outdoor sitting area and two complete bathrooms. The rooms were clean when we arrived and thanks to the housekeeping service its cleanliness was maintained throughout the stay. The room was well equipped with air conditioner a coffee machine computer TV kitchen appliances and a washing machine for clothes. My family and I were accommodated in adjoining rooms which turned out to be very suitable for us. A small feature we enjoyed was that to enter the rooms there was a door that would only open with the hotel key card. and it would lead to a smaller room with two other doors leading to the separate adjoining suites. This gave us more privacy as we could keep the doors open and transit from one apartment to the other without going out into the hallway. There was also security in the hotel constantly asking for our room keys to prove we were guests there. This was good considering some areas of the hotel were open to the public and others closed off to guests. I stayed at this hotel during thanksgiving so it was probably an unusually busy and crowded week but there was a 15 30 min waiting time for nearly everything. Despite the number of restaurants in the hotel meals were complicated because no matter where you went even food to go places there was a waiting time that ranged from a few minutes to half an hour. Eventually we began to make reservations for dinner and lunch. The valet parking service was slow it never took less than 15 minutes for our car to be retrieved from the garage. The beach service however was very fast and efficient having little to no waiting time. The only aspect I did n\u2019t really enjoy was that the hotel \u2019s beach space was very limited so guests were packed into the small area that offered beach service. I was also disappointed to see the amount of plastic and glass at the beach as well as the cigarette buds.
