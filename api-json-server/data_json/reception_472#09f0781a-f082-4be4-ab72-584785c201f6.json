We recently had a four night stay at the W Our room was ready early and we were given a room on a high floor with a spectacular view. Room was large enough for a family and beds were clean and comfortable. The staff is amazing. From check in to check out everyone had a friendly greeting and a smile on their face. We were celebrating a birthday and Dervin arranged for balloons and a cake in our room. Exactly at midnite room service knocked on the door with cake and the pot of tea we had ordered. We were able to relax at the pool where the staff was also very accommodating. We ate breakfast at the hotel and lunch polside. Food is very good and pricing typical for a hotel. Food service staff was very attentive and even remembered us by name the following day. Location is great as you can walk to many restaurants along A1A Our last full day we had massages at the Bliss Spa. What a perfect way to end a perfect stayThis was our first stay at a W.

Calling ahead began our Insider experience with a gentleman named Brian as he approached our last minute dilemma and event with a Whatever Whenever mentality. He placed us in a great room within our category and offered options for upgrading without seaming sales y.

It took everything in me not ever so gracefully place one of the two refreshing cold water on the desk of the man in the lobby that chris retrieved in about 30 seconds flat.

We stayed at the W for part of a spring break week getaway. The hotel is well located and the staff is friendly and service oriented. The decor is somewhat dark and edgy but there are several pools including one that is across the street from the beach. Our hotel room had a bizarre bath arrangement however that included a shower tub that has a clear glass wall that adjoins the sleeping area and is also visible to the outside when the rooms curtains are open. We requested a privacy curtain but it took an hour for the staff person to bring one up and then the one he brought did not fit so he had to leave and get another one. They also do not provide coffee in the room they have a living room on a lower floor where you can get it. At the price level of their rooms they need to provide a coffee service in the room you should not have to special request it. The hotel room is not overly large but it is well equipped with nice toiletries and some robes. We ate in the hotel restaurant steak house one morning and had a very good breakfast there.

W Fort Lauderdale is on the overall a good hotel but with some faults. Considering the level of the hotel and the price of the rooms it is unacceptable that during my 5 nights stay wifi never worked properly. I had to speak to the technicians three times and they were not able to fix it. This service is not even free and after my complaint at least I did not have to pay for it but still it is a very poor service as I was travelling for business and I really needed to connect my devices. So this problem totally spoiled my stay and my work. The room was nice and spacious and with all the comforts that I needed large bed a table to work sofas a spacious wardrobe. Bathroom was big and good even if the bath was a bit old and with the curtain I do not find it nice for such a stylish hotel. Common spaces are modern and the location by the beach is perfect. Breakfast area Steak 954 is pretty with a space outside with beach view. It was very pleasant to have breakfast in the open air. I enjoyed the quality of the breakfast food very much while I did not like my dinner at Steak 954. I had salmon but it was not tasty at all. I also asked myself if it was salmon or not. There is also another cafe which is perfect for a quick breakfast. I was there on the last day and the food was good and service very fast.

My husband and I along with my brother stayed at the W Fort Lauderdale this past weekend 47 410 and I have to say that this was definitely one of the more enjoyable stays I have had in recent memory. To start with check in was not only a breeze but also quite enjoyable. Justine I believe that was her name was so polite funny and jovial with us during check in. The smile on her face was contagious and made my whole group smile in return. She explained all about the hotel offered us the option of going green which basically meant that we would forgo housekeeping services in exchange for extra Starpoints. We could always call the Whatever. Whenever line if we needed something and was kind enough to move us to a higher room with a better view. We stayed in a Spectacular Room which was nice sized and because of the aforementioned upgrade had a stellar view on the 21st floor. Other reviewers are correct about the bathroom which does indeed feature a full clear window separating the shower tub from the rest of the room. A couple likely would not have an issue with that and there were shutters that could be closed blocking any unintended exposure which was helpful since my brother was in the same room. The door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom was frosted glass so you can make out an outline but can not actually see in. Our room had a balcony with a lounge chair as well as a regular chair that were comfortable and fun to lay back in while enjoying the views of the ocean. The usual mini bar was there with alcohol water sodas and snacks. Overall we felt the room was very comfortable and had no issues whatsoever. As a quick aside Bruna from the hotel emailed me before our trip to ask about the reason for our stay. I mentioned going down to help my brother look for an apartment since he will be starting med school at NOVA in the fall. After check in we ventured out for lunch and upon our return we saw a bottle of sparkling wine on ice with strawberries and a lovely note congratulating my brother. That was extremely thoughtful and deliciousThe grounds of the hotel are very nice well kept and very modern. We did not dine in any of the restaurants however we did have drinks and some light bites Friday evening at The Living Room which is their main bar area. We sat outside and were taken care of by Tatiana. She was such a gem making us laugh the whole night. She was polite efficient and cracking jokes while never being intrusive. We had such a great time out there in the dark apparently the lights along the beach are dimmed turned off at night to protect the turtle hatchlings from crawling the wrong way at nightThe pool area is fantastic large with ample seating. Wait staff were constantly buzzing around taking orders for the guests. This is something that really impressed me the staff at the hotel in general. Everyone we met from the valet attendants to the housekeeping staff in the halls were so nice and polite always greeting us as we passed. It irks me to see staff that are indifferent or acting like they wished they were someplace else but everyone at the W just seemed to be in great modsFinaly at check out we had the pleasure of being assisted by Cesar so was so polite and was genuinely interested in our stay. He congratulated my brother on his acceptance to NOVA and when he found out we were from DC he talked to us about the W back home which we are very familiar with. As the last point of contact with the hotel he left a very good impression. All in all this trip was fantastic from start to finish.

We called for clean glasses housekeeping took the dirty ones away and never replaced them. Same as ice not delivered until we called several times.

The bathroom sink had yellowish stains that came up with a simple wipe and a little crud in one of the corners. The bathtub had hair in it. The bathtub stopper was taken apart and put on the corner of the bathtub it was not a stopper that should have been removed save for unclogging or something but should have been replaced once that was resolved. I planned on doing some reading and eating on the balcony so I also wiped down the side table which was filthy. It obviously had not been cleaned as there were visible dirt smudges and spots. For the money I paid I expect a clean room. The first couple nights we kept hearing a whistling sound from the sliding doors. As the wind was not that bad it was slightly annoying but not unbearable. As the week went on it became much windier and the whistling became more constant and unbearable. We called the front desk who dispatched maintenance. Maintenance duct taped the sliding door to stop the whistling rendering us unable to open the sliding doors on the side facing the ocean. When I say duct tape I mean black heavy duty duct tape. Why they thought this was acceptable is beyond me One night we ordered extra washcloths and towels they just brought up the washcloths. When my husband asked about the towels he was told they were still being laundered. How does a hotel of that size not keep up with laundry so a guest can have a clean towel on demand. Again beyond me Room service was inconsistent the first time my husband ordered an 18 cheeseburger it came with lettuce tomato and pickles. I also ordered something and we received 2 glasses of water standard with room service anywhere. It was really good food and service. It was so good we decided to order again the next day this time the same 18 cheeseburger came with no fixings just a bun burger and cheese. There was no water to go with either of our meals. Same thing happened with our breakfast orders. First order was great second the exact opposite. To be fair one of the managers did refund the second cheeseburger meal that was not sent to the room properly The hotel had advertised at the front desk upon check in Mariots Bonvoy credit card and the offer of 75k bonus points. The ap also advertised the card. I applied my second night there after researching which card fit my travel style. Upon approval I was given my credit card number to use until my physical card came. I went to the front desk with the email from the credit card with the credit card number that the hotel advertised. I was told the property only accepted physical cards and to try to call Mariot. I told them how could I have a physical card when I just applied AFTER seeing the advertisement at the front desk upon checking in. I called Mariot and the help line said to call American Express while at the front desk and try to work something out. Long story short in 2019 with the technology available to all of us Mariot and this property could not figure out how to pay for my stay on a credit card they advertised at check in. Some may say what is the big deal the big deal to me was not necessarily the form of payment but rather the points I would get from spending over 510 on the stay at a Mariot property on top of the 75k bonus points. The mattress was too firm for my liking. I thought it was just me until my husband woke up complaining his back hurt from the bed. The mattresses could use some serious upgrades I had a spa service 4 of my 5 days there. The facial left much to be desired. The last day the massage was great but when I went to check out the price was much more than listed. When I questioned it I was told there were two add ons some puffy eye mask and paraffin on my feet. When I told her that I was never asked if I wanted those things and because the massage alone was 25 I just assumed they were included because of course someone would not add on about 100 in services without asking you. I explained that I already had both of those done with my facial and pedicure plus I did not ask for them. After verifying with the masseuse that I indeed did not request any extras during this service they were removed but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I was given some samples and the woman apologized I thought the spa extra charge was a one off until I got my final bill the day after we checked out and there was a 12002 charge for a Munchie Box on my bill. I called immediately and informed the person helping me that we did not touch one snack in the box as we went two blocks down to CVS and got everything we needed for 110 of the price they were charging at the hotel. After telling me he had to check with the Munchie Team he came back and said it was alcohol. The alcohol was not in the munchie box so the Munchie Box charge was ridiculous but nevertheless we did not even drink the alcohol there either. After I explained to him that he sounded better accusing us of eating the food than a bottle of alcohol because we had 45 oz margaritas everyday buy 1 get 1 12 off at Rock Bar down the street they are amazing. Anyway back on topic we did not drink or take any alcohol with us. The person immediately said yes it looks like a mistake you will see a credit in a few days. This was fishy to me. Over charging once ok a mistake but twice seems really suspect to me. I would definitely come back to Fort Lauderdale I would definitely visit Fi at the spa and eat at Steak 954 BUT I would never actually stay here again. I just did not have a great experience.", "offset": [6191, 6283], "date": "2019-12-30", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}]}
