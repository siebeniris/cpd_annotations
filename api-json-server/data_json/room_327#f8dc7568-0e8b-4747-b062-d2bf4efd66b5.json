Maybe not. This was my third time staying at this hotel because for the location and price it can not be beat. Staff was friendly as always and I realize that this is NOT a resort or classy establishment. I am only there at night to sleep and am out the rest of the day. However this stay seemed a little less nice than previous encounters. My room was clean yet felt outdated and dingy. It just felt like it needed a remodel or some updating. The other issue I had was with the a c unit. it was unusually humid in my hotel room some to be expected it is the beach after all but no matter how I adjusted the unit it always felt stuffy and uncomfortable. My only other complaint was that I rented a nonsmoking unit and both neighbors on either side of me were also labeled nonsmoking. However there was an ashtray placed in between my room and my neighbors. Well since the a c units are indoor outdoor units someone came out to smoke every half an hour and my a c unit sucked all the smoke directly into my room. I had to deal with this for my entire stay. Tobacco smell smoke every half an hour to an hour. should not there be designated smoking areas AWAY from the NON smoking rooms. At least at the bottom of the stairs or something. I will be back yes but next time I am going to request a room farther away from the ashtray.

We were 4 ladies escaping the Michigan weather not expecting much for the great price. we were pleasantly surprised. Very clean suites with separate sleeping area mini fridge micro area and a spacious living room with flat screen. Flat screen also in the bedroom. Bath room is small but functional with the old time pink tile. All rooms clean and daily maid service kept it that way. Folgers coffee greeted us each day in our room followed by continental breakfast at 7 am in the lobby. We were able to get our ocean walk only 3 blocks away and it was an amazing way to start the day. One day we wanted a hot breakfast and used the next door restaurant with a 60 3 eggs 3 bacon and toast. This motel reminds me of the old but delivers a more modern approach. We were busy travelling and seeing the local sights regrouping here in the evening. It was quiet and pleasant. Kudos to the staff who are more than happy to accommodate special requests. My roomie is diabetic and we needed to pack a snack for the road No Problem. Bagies for the bagel. I needed a rag to wipe my sons car out from the sand No Problem. Heres a rag and a smile.

We loved how close the property was to the ocean. It took just couple of minutes to walk to the beautiful Windansea Beach. The beds were very comfortable in the overall cleanliness of the room was very good. Based on other properties in the area this one was well priced. The staff was friendly and welcoming. They offered a complimentary continental breakfast consisting of cold cereal and other baked goods with juice and milk available as well. The Su Casa Restaurant next door served awesome Mexican food. The Cafe Vahick next door served a very good breakfast meal. We got in late and after having dinner at the restaurant next door we came back to room and thought we smelled cigarettes. It was clearly marked on all the doors outside that they were all non smoking rooms. We called the front desk and told them about it and he said the person next door was staying for three weeks and that she was a smoker. He offered to move us to another room but by that time was 10 o\u2019clock at night and we are too tired to do so. He told us that they talked to her and told her to stop it. Well the following morning we woke up and there was a strong cigarette smell in our room again. After we got back from breakfast we had trouble getting into our room and contacted the front desk. They came out a few minutes later and helped us into our room. But while were waiting for them the lady next door came out and was very aggressive and saying that she was n\u2019t smoking. But you clearly smell the cigarettes while she had the door open. We complained to the manager and told her we would never stay there again. If it \u2019s a non smoking hotel why were they allowing her to do so. Just because she was staying there for three weeks was no reason for them to allow her to do so.", "offset": [593, 715], "date": "2017-05-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "14068229-2d80-4ff6-80d4-0dfbafd9639d", "sentence": "Exceptional.
