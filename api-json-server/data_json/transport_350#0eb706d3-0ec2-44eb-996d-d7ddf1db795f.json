So you can be in that craziness in minutes but your hotel is nice and quiet a street away. The hotel is a little dated and could use a refresh in the rooms.

The room was a decent size and beds were comfortable. I also have to give a huge thanks to Andrew at concierge for assisting me with a billing issue. The downside to my experience is that at 8 am the first morning some sort of drilling started directly above our heads as we tried to sleep. After 2 phone calls to the front desk the drilling stopped 15 min later. An hour later it started again. The front desk said it would go on until 3 pm that day so we gave up on sleep.

One of the most disappointing experiences I have ever had in a supposed luxury hotel of this price. And my husband and I travel quite a bit and we stay at hotels that are at least 4 5 stars minimum whenever we go to metropolitan cities. First there was NO where on the website for JW Mariot New Orleans that stated that the hotel has construction going on. I think it is only fair and honest to warn your customers about that. We arrived into our hotel with package of EAR PLUGS on the bed. I was wondering why we needed ear plugs cause were on the 28th floor and book the Executive Floor Lounge package. Then I noticed a typed note on the night stand from the hotel apologizing because there will be construction noise daily between 9 5 and the ear plugs were provided for our comfort. Really I am paying almost 300 a night and you expect me to use ear plugs to make my stay comfortable. do not you think you should notify me first before I bokedThen the next morning I was woken up by loud ping sounds from the elevator. They put us in a room close to the elevator and the elevator chime was the loudest most obnoxious I have ever heard from any hotels. I called down to the front desk and requested a room change and they told me they were fully booked and to check back later. No apologies just matter of fact response mono tone voice like too bad so sad you got stuck in a crappy location of a room. Later that morning I walked downstairs to the lobby and spoke to the front desk and this time got another person who was more helpful. He told me he had another room further from the elevator and would be willing to give us that room and switch out with other guests who have not yet arrived. We rushed back to the room and quickly packed up our stuff to transfer since it sounded like an opportunity of a lifetime to get a better room with no elevator chime. No kidding it was like a mad rush so we get out of the previous room before the maid needed to clean it for the other arriving guests. Trying to forget the unpleasantness of our first 24 hours we went about the next day or two immersed in the fun of New Orleans. On our last evening before leaving after we returned from a very late night a note was slipped into our room and I thought it was the final bill. But NO there was MORE bad news. Now we are told that there will be NO HOT WATER in the room tomorrow morning from 10 am till 3 pm. Really. Construction noise ear plugs no hot water. So I am suppose to wake up early so I can catch a shower. is not New Orleans suppose to party till dawn and sleep till noon. I understand that hotels need to renovate but please warn your customers on the website or a note when they book so they know what to expect. We are on vacation we do not appreciate paying top dollar for terrible experiences. Also like to mention that the Executive Lounge is not on a special floor like some of the other high end hotels. it is a lounge in the lobby by the door with lots of people in and out. It is also not open most of Saturday after noon. So you can not go in and out as much to relax or get soda or water like some other high end hotels.
