I was diverted to Dallas due to Hurricane Harvey. At 2 AM I booked this hotel via Priceline Express Deal non refundable rate of 73 night since I was counting on the upscale 35star rating. Front desk. Arriving at 230 AM I could n\u2019t expect too much from the night auditor but he was a bit flummoxed at finding my reservation. Eventually he did and issued me a key to Room 70Rom. Opening the room I heard the A C running. Being from Texas this is one of the mandatory things to be working. The panel read \u201c 64 degrees \u201d but being from here I knew that there was no way this was accurate. Given that it was almost 3 AM I decided I would report it in the morning since I would n\u2019t burn up in the meantime. Needless to say this lack of maintenance would become a theme. The room is average with nothing distinctive but showing its age. The view from the window is over the freeway and nothing of note is within walking distance. Bathroom. Waking up 8 hours later I wanted to shower and get ready for a return to the airport to see if I could get reboked on my flight home. That is when I noticed that the sheetrock above the shower was blistered from a prior repair but never cosmetically fixed. I soldiered on by taking a shower and then discovered that the wall dryer unit did not work \u2013 despite pushing all of the circuit breaker reset buttons it never worked and I had to call the front desk to have someone bring me a handheld one. If you want to hold yourself out as an upscale property these large and small items does n\u2019t help your reputation. Housekeeping Since my stay was an overnight one I can only comment on how I found the room. It was nicely cleaned so no complaints there. Upon checkout I reported all three issues to Juan at the front desk. He was genuinely interested noted them on a pad and apologized. He offered me a voucher for a free breakfast which was appreciated. Overall this property suffers from over promising and under delivering. Crowne Plazas should be the jewel brand of the IHG group but this one is an imposter. Management should seriously put some energy and money into fixing this \u2013 or forfeit the brand name. Its star rating is really more a 2star since some 25 star properties put this one to shame. Priceline asked if I wanted to rebok this property for another night \u2013 and my thought was. \u201c No way\u201dNOTE If you found this review useful could you click on the \u201c thank you \u201d button below.
