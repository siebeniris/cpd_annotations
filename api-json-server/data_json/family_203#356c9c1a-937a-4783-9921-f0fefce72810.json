Our room is 80 degrees and we have a maintenance guy here now looking at the AC. There are no other rooms available so we either have him fix it in the middle of the night or we sweat. In addition to this the ice machine on our floor has never worked. They will charge you 75 per night of your stay for incidentals even though they already have your card number on file but no worries you will get that money back 5 business days after you checkout. After charging you 300 per night plus 75 for incidentals you will not get WiFi. That will cost an additional 10 per day.
