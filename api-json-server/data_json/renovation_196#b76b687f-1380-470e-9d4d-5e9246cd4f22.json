We spent 3 days in his hotel for Mother \u2019s day weekend and our experience was not a good one now continue to read why. Our usual hotel nearby was booked and I hesitated to book this Hotel because of all the bad reviews. We needed to stay on Wisconsin Ave because it \u2019s close to the action metro restaurants shopping so we had no choice but to book this hotel. I thought the renovation would win me over. Unfortunately after our first experience staying there we will never book this hotel again and here is why. I blame The Hyat Corporation who has not trained their hotel managers and staff properly. I also blame The Hyat Corporation for not caring about this particular hotel. I do n\u2019t blame the managers or staff because working in the hotel industry is hard enough and it would not be fair to hard working people who are doing their best. This hotel is not on par with other Hyat experiences we had in the past in other states. Managers and employees are trying their best but this is not enough because their best is poor. It feels that this hotel is run by amateurs and this is seriously disturbing. Shame on Hyat. Check in. Poor Experience. Front desk staff never looked at us mumbled her words was typing without saying a word until I asked what she was doing for a good 10 minutes. No welcome no smile no feeling of warmth and acknowledgment of our presence. She barely talked. Worse she forgot to give us our breakfast vouchers for our weekend stay which was clearly indicted on our booking. We got the vouchers a few hours later from a different front desk staff after I asked how does breakfast work. Our Room. I paid a little extra to have a big room with a terrace I thought would be big and comfortable price 175 per night. The terrace was big and had a big table and 4 chairs but we got a very very small corner room with a long and odd triangular shape. Everything was cramped into a very small area of this already small corner room which means that he king size bed 1 desk 2 chairs the TV stand and the TV were all concentrated in a 150 square foot area. Needless to say that this room had the worse \u201c feng shui \u201d possible and we were already turned off by it. Worse our toilet broke after its first use. That was it for me. I immediately asked to switch to another room and I was lucky enough to speak with one of the managers who apologized profusely and fixed the issue. We moved to a regular room on the same floor within 20 minutes. I need to mention that our new room key did not work the first time so I had to go see the manager again so he can fix this too. Again my wife and I were already furious about all of this. Our new room was big and looked like a great standard hotel room so at least we were sort of happy. Room Comfort. Poor. Pillows are so soft that they offer no neck support we slept with 3 pillows each to get some comfort. Our mattress was hard and we could feel the springs. Remember this hotel was renovated and the first thing you are looking for in a hotel is a comfortable bed ours was not. We had horrible 3 nights sleep. Worse we had no blankets on our bed just two layers of thick white sheets. It was a little cold and we asked for some extra blankets. We got a small thin disgusting and old looking blanket that was peeling. Just plain odd. Daily Grill service. Poor. Front Desk hostesses were missing because they were waitressing. During our dinner waiter seemed stressed and complained being understaffed. Our Breakfast server should work at a deli and not in a restaurent with customers. During our 3day stay I \u2019ve only seen the manager once and he was very slow. No energy. Overall experience. Poor. Although this hotel has been renovated and our room was clean you could see that the renovation was half baked and not cared for. We could see that the renovation seemed to have been rushed and not properly done. Our shower stall was transparent and the shower did not have any handles to hold on to or a small stool or even place to sit. This means that a family with kids ca n\u2019t share the bathroom and an elderly person could be in danger using the shower. Our floor hallway had a lot of small trash all the way from our room to the elevators such as q tips paper plastic empty glasses of wines near the elevators. Although one of the managers fixed our room issue immediately and apologized profusely and I praised him for that our overall experience was very unpleasant and uncomfortable for all the reasons I mentioned above. We think it might take years before Hyat cleans up its act with this hotel and makes it a true Hyat Hotel Experience. We can not recommend this hotel.

Starbucks at 930pm Morton\u00b4s at 100pm and Daily Grill 1030. Most but not all hotel associates are very nice and friendly but \u2026. We check in Thurs Jul 12 Check out Sun Jul 15. High Floor \u2026 I do. Yes floor 6. How many floors do you have. 12. RealyCheck in again Tues Jul 17. First room horrible. It is like a remodeled Housekeeping room so we get changed to room 1203. TV does not work. Try to call to get it fixed but phones do not work. Finally I get my call answered through In Room Dining. I explain and the person on phone explains he is from the Daily Grill but will report it to front desk. Five minutes later person waiter that took call actually calls back and tells me he has reported to front desk and that will be fixed. So we are waiting for maintenance and not unpacking until I am sure the TV will work. Nothing 10 20 30 minutes and nothing. I walk down and they say what. No we know nothing. And yes sorry our phones do not work. I think what would happen if there is an emergency. If true emergency maybe some lives lost. Anyway TV is fixed and we move on. I ask for more pillows. I just had surgery and need pillows to sit up in bed. I am asked \u201c Down or Foam \u201d. Foam four pls. I arrive to my room later that day and there are four more pillows \u2026. All Down. Again I request they change from Down to Foam they change the four pillows for four fresh ones \u2026 3 down 1 foam. I give up. Next afternoon I believe Wednesday we arrive to room and there is a portable A C equipment in room. We did not ask for anything so I take a photo and I ask at front desk they explain it is the portable A C equipment that we requested \u2026. We never called or requested anything. Again how well coordinated andor communicated are the different departments in this hotel operation. Next day we do leave the room late so when we leave I call housekeeping so they know and can service the room. When we get back the room is serviced but the usual two bottles of water we get every night were not delivered. I call phones are now working. explain and I am told they will be sent up in a few minutes. After five minutes a lady knocks on the door and has brought us four glasses. We question her and we are told and shows us in her smart phone ap that she was told we ordered them and told to bring them to our room. We explain we asked for two bottles of water. We finally get them. Again how did two bottles of water turn into four empty glasses. Next day I get a call from front desk that if they can come up to fix the shower. What. We never asked to get the shower fixed. A few minutes later maintenance calls for same thing. NO. we did not call anyone for anything. Finally I send dirty cloth to laundry and they return with 2 underpants missing. I know very well that they were 4 because of travel days but specifically a cloth boxer type which I need for surgery because it needs to be loose. I call and they explain they will have to call their laundry service. The response I get from housekeeping is that their laundry service said that is their count and period. I could care less for a pair or two of underpants but this specific pair I need because of my medical condition. They the laundry service are liarsFinaly in frustration I ask to talk with the Manager. I get a call from the manager on duty Kristen and I explain all of these problems and my frustration and specially my concern on what would happen in an emergency experiencing all the constant confusion every day between all their different departments. She is very nice like most or all staff in hotel they are very nice and friendly they just seem to have no idea how to operate manage a hotel. BTW this is a limited service middle level more like lower level hotel. Again she is very nice listens attentively or at least seems to. I tell her I am very disappointed and my life image of Hyat brand is quickly going down the drain. I tell her I do have a long list of all these occurrences I am not inventing and that I will post them in social media. Again she is really nice and asks me to please hold on posting unfortunately it is Friday night and to give her the opportunity to fix all and that she would be back to me Monday. It is now Monday night and have heard nothing \u2026. Monday night I am getting in bed and as I open up the cover right there next to my pillow very visible a blood stain. I have photos which I will post. I understand the environmental actions by reducing water and soap use by using same linens for two or more days but if you see a blood stain do you not change the linens. Is this hotel now also a health hazardIt is now Tuesday and will soon check out and still no news from Kristen.
