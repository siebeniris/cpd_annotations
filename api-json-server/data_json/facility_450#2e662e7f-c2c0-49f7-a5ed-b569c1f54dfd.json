The in room fridge was also very handy for keeping the bottle of wine cool we had brought with us.

Sunday night we had a great deal and it was not that busy when we arrived but what a brilliant welcome from Erin and Paige. had not bought swimming gear but pool and facilities looked good. There were only 2 swimming when we looked in. Room had two double beds which was perfect for the 3 of us. Had everything we needed. Free wifi worked fine. Some minor issues with the heating system but Erin was great and sorted everything out very quickly. Could nt fault the breakfast.

In passing I had mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday and an hour later there was a knock on the door with two complimentary drink tickets for us to have for his birthday.

We booked the hotel wanting a little bit of luxury. We usually stay in premier inns but wanted somewhere with a pool this time. First impressions were not great.

I do not mind using stairs but these were not what you had expect in a hotel. more like stairs in an office block with lights that were not on till you reached that floor and very heavy doors. I had booked a standard double room but after premier inn experiences was surprised the bed was not king size. The room also lacked sufficient lighting. On the plus side the staff were very helpful and friendly. The spa was lovely as were the bar and lounge on the first floor.

The female changing rooms have no changing cubicles so you disrobe in front of everyone right where people enter the changing room. The changing room is dirty shabby in a poor state of repair and in need of a good clean. They are worse than an old council pool changing rooms. The pool area is tiny you can not swim lengths properly. The jacuzi is filthy with ground in dirt and grime covering the outside. The steam room is also filthy in a poor state of repair and covered in grime it also stank of drains we could not sit in there for longer than 5 mins and in that time another pool user complained to us about the state of the steam room to which we agreed. The whole pool area is run down and grubby I have seen much better council pools. Restaurant We sat for lunch and were rudely moved off of pre set tables as these were kept set for later on. The food was actually nice but expensive. The staff were useless our waitress forgot things we asked for and we had a cleaner sweeping around our table then another member of staff mopping around us which smelt of floor cleaner and I commented that this was rude as we were eating. I got a dirty look for that comment. The bill arrived and was incorrect for each of us for some reason the waitress could not work out our bill and we had to help her. After her attempting a few more times the manager finally got involved and refunded half of our bill for the errors. Due to the time taken to sort out the error we were called from the SPA reception saying we were late and 10 minutes would be knocked off our treatments We explained it was the fault of the bar bill error and luckily no time was deducted. the birthday girl was nearly crying at the point. The SPA There is no room to relax in whilst you wait for your treatment you just sit in the SPA reception whilst people walk past you. The treatments were nice and the masseuse was a lovely chatty girl who listened to our complaints and raised them with the duty manager.
