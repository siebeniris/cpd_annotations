Myself my husband our 25 year old daughter stayed in a beach front suite and had a brilliant stay. I could write so many positive things about this hotel but will try to keep it reasonably briefIt was relaxing convenient to have the beach outside of our back door especially with a toddler. Both the view out to the ocean the direct beach access the space in the suite was I feel well worth the extra you pay compared with standard rooms however all benefit from the sea view. The bed was great both large comfortable. The cot for our daughter was fantastic and definitely the best we have ever been given in a 45 hotel. This attention to detail importance of making sure our daughter was well looked after continued throughout our stay and we very much appreciated it. The location of the hotel is great the sea is perfectly calm for swimming again especially great for our daughter. We loved taking advantage of the complimentary non motorised water sports the daily snorkel with the turtles. Ryan was so helpful gave us a life jacket for our daughter at the beginning of our stay told us just to hand it back in at the end. He was very caring conscious of her safety. And like all the staff was so warm welcoming genuinely wanted us to have the best time. The buffet breakfast was absolutely fantastic with lots of choice. The afternoon tea was lovely.

My wife and I have just returned from a fantastic 12 day stay at this excellent hotel. It enjoys a perfect location on a beautiful beach. It is cleverly designed so that all the rooms have a breathtaking sea view and easy access to the beach reception pool bar and restaurants. The rooms are spacious and well furnished and decorated. The bathroom was modern and worked well. The rooms were kept clean and tidy as were the common areas. The hotel also has a superb garden beautifully maintained and an adequate gym. The standard of the lunch and evening meals was also top notch. It is obviously pricey but it delivers a very pleasant relaxing location for a holiday. What is there not to like. Not a lot but one or two points to note 1. The hotel provides a large number of sun beds and sun shades on the beach on a first come basis and we never had a problem getting one however we did notice that the beds in prime position in front of the north and south wings and the Taboras restaurant were increasingly reserved by arrangement with the Pool Staff. We found this confusing to say the least. Could Management look into this and clarify the position2. We found the standard of food very good especially the fish and. the weklySeafod Buffet was outstanding. Occasionally we could have done with a lighter snacky option but hardly cause for a moan3. The Taboras restaurant where Breakfast is served is on an open verandha and birds frequently zoom in and out looking for food. Nothing the staff or management can do about it but some people might get irritated. Three points which are small and which should not deflect from the fact that this is a truly fine hotel well managed and staffed and which provides for a great holiday experience.", "offset": [591, 678], "date": "2016-01-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "18ddf9cb-763b-4de6-8dd6-5a856d56fa47", "sentence": "The beach is their saving grace. The hotel is pretty and the rooms are nice large and ocean front with a large balcony. I loved that about this hotel. Front desk staff were nice and the beach staff were great. I had a few good drinks on the beach as well rum punch was strong and delicious. The hotel is filled with older couples and lots of Brits and they offer complimentary 4 pm tea with sandwiches and the most delicious small desserts such as cookies scones and little cakes with strawberry jelly and whipped butter. Shockingly for the price and star quality of the hot the breakfast at the hotel was appalling. The only bread option was either stale sliced bread or stale sliced bagels. They also offered other stale baked goods. Luckily I did not have breakfast included in the price of my room rate otherwise I would have asked for a refund but at 37 USD a person I expected more. There were not any fresh squeezed juices fruits of the island nor water available at your leisure. Lunch at the restaurant where breakfast was served was also the same bad quality food. Yet the beach bar which is located next to the hotels Palm restaurant was incredible. Breakfast should be served at the Palm restaurant and the chef from the beach bar should be cooking the breakfast as well. Upon check in I was asked if I will like a paper delivered to my room daily. not once was I given the paper in the morning. It did arrive twice during my stay though at 330 pm. Luckily the breakfast spot had a few remaining for me to read on the beach. The staff at the hotel vary. Some are great. Others were not so great. Example 1 I was departing the beach with my gear in hand and I asked if I can have ice and utensils for my room. I was told to hold on so she can grab them for me and I can take them upstairs myself with all my beach gear on hand. is not this a five star establishment. The staff at the front desk and concierge were great and would take nightly pictures of my husband and I and were always so sweet and hospitable. Each night between 630 pm 80 pm. I was asked if i wanted turn down service however I was always in the room and who wants turn down service so early in the evening. I truly think this was done on purpose. The beach at the hotel was amazing. The water in Barbados is quite incredible and crystal clear. My husband and I loved swimming in it. The beach chairs were fine but were not as fancy as the pool chairs. They offer complimentary reading materials. Suntan spray and lotion. Overall the hotel charges so much because of the great beach location next to Lonestar quiet and on the prestigious west coast of Barbados. they are next to all of the top restaurants and hotels furtherest top restaurant being a quick 15 minute drive.

The hotel is beautiful the setting is perfect the beach is splendid despite no private beaches in Barbados it felt private the rooms are oversized the service is perfect the amenities are great. You may expect top notch service all of the Team is great. There are though for me some cons The breakfast is medicore the best thing is the view. The service is good but the choice is limited it was my second time in caribean so maybe shal got used to. It is surely not worth 50usd head. The lunch dinner are just OK. I know I am not upper class customer but I have no problem with paying much for a meal provided I get something exceptional. The lunch or dinner menus are nothing special. The food presentation is ok the quality is perfect but there is nothing imaginative that shal explain the prices. Take 10usd per person for the lunch and 150usd for the dinner and expect nothing special. I know a lot of places that make me feel superb when spending such money and that is not Fairmont not this one for sure. The hotel is 2 km off the town so if you consider eating out of the hotel take the taxi. We did not so I am not sure if it is good recommendation. Anyway we handled that and the prices was not the problem. I just wonder how bizarre some people must be to pay so much to eat something that is so overpriced and though nothing really special. OK it is Barbdos I think it is all about the sentiment of the British people. Just wondering if Sandy Lane would disapoint me more when it comes to the value for money. I wish I was reach and do not care.

We were strongly advised that this was one of the best hotels on the West Coast of Barbados and we would agree with that statement albeit with a one major reservation but let us be positive first The location is excellent a great beach one very good outside restaurant in walking distance Lone Star as well as a beach bar. All facilities in the hotel are easily accessible beach restaurant pool and rooms are all close by but to get into Holetown or Speightown you do need to get a taxi and these are NOT cheap eg \u00a3 12 for a two minute drive into HoletownThe rooms are great sizeable well furnished with all overlooking the beach and sea with fabulous sunsets. Bathrooms are good with shower and bath. Daily cleaning service is also good and the staff very helpful. Restaurant we only had access to one restaurant Caf\u00e9 Taboras although I think another is available in high season. Buffet breakfast is good and typical of most good standard buffets nothing exceptional but satisfactory. Dinner is a real let down and this is where the hotel suffers. There is a standard menu that does not change. Each day there is a specials menu that consists of two starters and two main course choices. Frankly it is hard to say anything positive about the food we were served other than it was hot and pleasantly served. Bland is a good description in the case of the lobster evening tough and overcooked more appropriate. This is such a shame if the chef could sort the food offering out then there would be a huge uplift in the numbers who eat in the restaurant rather than eat out every night The Cliff Beach Club is almost like the Fairmont Restaurant Number One each evening with so many of the Fairmont regulars eating there and paying roughly the same sort of prices. We spoke to many regulars during our stay and all agreed that the food is the one negative about the hotel. Facilities and entertainment there are plenty free water sport activities offered at the watersports club. Water Skiing is extra and relatively expensive. There are also plenty of sun loungers on the beach and round the pool though we hear these get taken very quickly in high season. You can swim out to the turtles from the beach. There is occasional evening entertainment from a singer and steel band etc These are low key and can easily be missed. The main bar is good and well stocked cocktail prices are high but this not unexpected I do wish someone had told us there was a happy hour each day between 5 and 6 pm thoughConcierge services often overlooked but the staff at this desk were superb and arranged an excellent catamaran trip for us when we were picked up from our hotel beach. Smokers are banished to a lone table well away from the pool whilst smoking is not allowed on your room balcony albeit smoking is allowed on the beach.

We stayed at The Fairmont two years ago and thought that it was close to perfection but were not quite so impressed on our second visit. The hotel has recently renovated its rooms and they are if anything more impressive than before.

As we had booked long before the introduction of this new class of room the hotel were kind enough to honour our request for a top floor room one thing that has not altered at the Fairmont is their highest standard customer service. However while we appreciated this gesture we did not feel that butler service etc was enough to justify the substantial increase on the price normally charged for identical rooms on the second floor. Breakfast is now served in the Palm Restaurant which we felt was an improvement on the smaller Taboras restaurant and featured a good variety of hot and cold dishes plus an egg station that although busy was never overrun. One hick up occurred on the Sunday we were there when there were a couple of large parties from outside for breakfast. Their long tables were made up of individual tables usually available for residents which led to a shortage of tables and queues to be seated. by residents. This was a one off while we were there but should not have happened in a hotel of this standard. Food at the Taboras restaurant was overpriced for the quality we had lunch once and that was OK but no more but the evening Texas BQ was greatly over priced and not very good.
