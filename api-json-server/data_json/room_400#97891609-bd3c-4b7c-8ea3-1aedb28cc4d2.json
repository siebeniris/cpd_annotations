When we went complain to the front desk we were told they were doing everything they could but it would be bad for them to talk to their parents. That they had to stay within their parameters. Last night at 130 am and again at 2 am they were running and yelling in the hallway outside of our room. When we stated that when they do it again tonight and we have to leave they will give us our money back we were told that they would normally move us to a different floor but the hotel is completely booked and could do nothing for us. When we returned to our floor to go back to the room the seating area had kids lounging on all the furniture with one standing on the coffee table.

And more issues fiasco. During our stay we had the following issues. Issue 1. reservation missing At first they could not find the reservation. I had everything printed so they finally figured it out. Keys were assigned. Issue 2 Walking into a room that was already assigned to somebody else. How embarrassing the stranger was nice about it but that is a careless error. The other lady had just checked in about an hour before us. This happened to another stranger down the hallway too. she was very embarrassed to check in go to her room and find people inside. This is NOT an isolated incident was the point. Issue 3 The door of death. The revolving door in the back of the hotel. One door was swinging wildly and almost crushed my child. Thank goodness we were not inside of it as it violently swung shut. I went to the front desk so they could put up a sign but there was no sense of urgency to fix that issue. Eventually a sign was posted. The door was never fixed during the remainder of our stay. Issue 4 In the middle of my sleep somebody hotel guest pulled the fire alarm. There is nothing like running out of the hotel in PJs half asleep because of this. Not the hotels fault. but there was NO emergency management to explain the situation and we just left the hotel and waited for a local breakfast place to open. Issue 5 BED BUGS. My husband has been getting welts for the past few weeks every night. We should have figured it out earlier but my suitcase that I used for the trip was small enough to fit under the bed so I returned home and put it under my bed not thinking anything of it. Suddenly my bed is infested with bed bugs. This could be due to the fact that they do NOT wash sheets and bedding and towels nightly to save the environment. Our trip was 3 weeks ago. We did visually see bed bugs in the bed at home and I am desperately wishing that I tore the bed apart when we were in Chicago because that room must have been disgustingly dirty. Regret trip regret staying there the atrium area was nice the access to local attractions was nice. but I will never stay there again. If you stayed there recently please check your bed and luggage and research how to get rid of bed bugs spoiler alert it is a massive amount of work and a pain.", "offset": [231, 302], "date": "2018-04-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "1e982598-8dec-4c21-a70f-c6efe4de74c9", "sentence": "Not as good as the HR reputation. The overall experience we had at this hotel was one that indicated that management needed to invest more time and effort into training and making sure their staff were doing a good job. Staff Everyone was friendly and tried to be helpful. There are several immigrants working here primarily from Europe most on the cleaning staff. Cleanliness When I arrived in the hall outside our rooms there were glasses outside some rooms which stayed there for at least 24 hours. Although I always saw room attendees here and there I noticed that small pieces of litter in the hallway went untouched. The rooms themselves were clean enough although I did not inspect with a black light. The rest of the hotel was sufficiently clean. Parking. There is a huge amount of parking around the hotel because it also has many meeting rooms. Buildings. It is split into two buildings connected by a sky bridge on the 2nd floor. You can go from the lobby to the floors above it via stairs off the lobby near the front desk or you can take the elevator to the 3rd floor of the other building accessible behind the lobby walk down a couple of halls and get on another elevator to the floor you want in the lobby building. Yes it can be inconvenient walk a fair distance and use two elevators or go up stairs with your luggage. Rooms. No breakfast is included although you can make coffee and tea in the room with what is provided. If you opt to not have your room cleaned daily certainly not a necessity for all but Pigpen guests and indicate such ASAP there is a time limit. you can choose from a list of modest rewards look for the door hanger with the info. The Hyat Regency uses magnetic cards for door keys so keep them away from mobile phones and the like or they will be wiped and you will have to go to the front desk to recode them. I saw three different room types which were almost the same except for the bed types and size and all only had a shower. The rooms had a desk some had iPad iPhone charging stations there was an alarm clock 1 2 phones a basic wardrobe and a table with a safe. We had a major problem getting our rooms in accordance with what had been booked and it took me hours to sort it out because all the front desk staff were nice and accommodating they made mistake after mistake. Before leaving I talked to a manager about it as well as service issues. I had have to write a lot to explain it all. and she said she had give us a night free not sure if she meant one room or all 4 but my boss said she has not seen any sort of discount applied to our bill and it is been almost a month. I would provide an update about this if it is ever resolved but TripAdvisor is not edit friendly. You can request amenities like a fridge or a rolaway bed and I do not think they are charged for but do ask. There is supposed to be a microwave on each floor as well as an ice machine but I checked both our floor and the one below it and could not find any microwaves a maid said someone had stolen the one on our floor. There are small vending alcoves on each floor but they are emptyLoby. It is very spacious and modern in decor with the bar restaurant AND cafe off to the right as well as one hall of meeting rooms and the front desk on the left. There is some seating in the middle too and we often saw JLA pilots and stewardesses there and on the elevators as they stay there. Unfortunately on the first day we were there a bunch of prom attendees mobbed the lobby for several hours blocking the front part of it and making it very difficult for people to get in and out. The staff made no effort that I am aware of to keep them from blocking the walkways and it was pretty hard to get the kids to move when coming through with luggage. There was also a large convention running at the time but it did not have much impact on things. Another thing that was bothersome was that all day Saturday the hotel lobby and adjoining hallways were cold a lot of people complained about it. I had to wear a jacket and many others did too. Part of the problem is that one of the side entrances revolving doors panels was swinging loosely allowing the chilly outside air to fill the hotel but it was not always open. The temperature was back to normal on Sunday although there were further problems with that panel. Swimming pool gym. The outdoor pool and connected pool that extended into the building were closed due to the season but the indoor pool was open and the water was somewhat warmed which was a must given how cold the rooms for the pools were. There was a tall shelving unit filled with towels in the entry hall and smallish changing rooms bathrooms. On the far end of the indoor pool was a small gym equipped with perhaps 4 treadmills dead weights and a small number of weight machines as well as a small fridge with moist rolled up towels and plenty of dry towels. The gym is accessible either through the pool room or via its own entrance. In order to access all of this you must go to the back of the lobby past the offshoot for the elevators to the warren of meeting rooms and go down the staircase to get to the doors for these rooms. I did not see a way for handicapped to access it but I may have missed it. On Saturday when we went the towel rack was completely empty and stayed that way until another guest went to the front desk and complained. Meeting Rooms There are several meeting rooms of different dimensions available. The ones with tall ceilings have lamps similar to those found in the lobby. Dining room Bar Cafe Fresh MarketThe entirety of these facilities are on the right of the lobby with no barrier between them and the lobby so if you are hoping for quiet dining and the lobby is busy and noisy forget it. It is arranged with the bar running the length of the wall that is the meeting hall spur and the dining room runs the length of that while the kitchen is after with the cafe in front right next to the walkway. As with most hotels the food is over priced. We did not eat at the dining room because of the prices or drink at the bar but we did try the cafe. Most of the food sandwiches salads at the cafe is in an open front cooler next to the serving counter although certain food has to be prepared along with a stingy selection of salad dressing packets. My son had the Italian beef which was served on bread so hard that neither he nor I wanted to eat it. We were told there was a 10minute wait to prepare it but it was more like 15 at a time when there were almost no customers in sight for the dining room and cafe. My daughters turkey sandwich was basic and forgetably bland but her chicken salad was nice. I had a salad and a wrap too and we all drank water. For just this simple meal I paid over 50 which I found unacceptable and did not return to the cafe again. Overall Although I had no trouble with anyone on the staff in terms of behavior there were lots of competence issues and it was clear that the management was not doing a good job of training and supervising the staff. The issues with cleanliness were minor. I suppose I might stay here again if the price were lower but the hassles I experienced and the issues I observed make me wary of returning.", "offset": [6021, 6121], "date": "2018-05-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "89c9be27-2e63-476f-8a9c-66212d9a864a", "sentence": "Avoid.

Went to the bar until room was ready. Would have been better to offer to pick up a drink for us when we told them that is where we would be waiting. Front desk staff was great it was not their fault room was not ready but room should be ready when checking in after 40. Had paid for an upgrade to a corner suite do not waste your money on this. The room was only about as big as a regular room with just an extra window on one wall. The bathroom was the smallest I can ever remember seeing in a hotel room. Opening the door into the bathroom and it just clears the toilet. Shower pressure was terrible and the tile really needed to be replaced. Definitely if staying here do not go with the corner suite which I do not really feel is a suite. Nothing better in it than a regular room as far as I could tell.
