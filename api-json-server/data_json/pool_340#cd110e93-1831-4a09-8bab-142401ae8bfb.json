It has been a long held dream to stay at the historic Raffles Hotel Singapore. I had been for High Tea about fifteen years ago and remember being impressed with the beautiful building and elegant furnishings. From the moment our taxi pulled up outside the magnificent facade we were transported to a time of impeccable service. After a civilised check in our helpful butler showed us our gorgeous suite. On our first night we dined at the Long Bar Steakhouse. A tad too expensive or maybe it was work noise coming from nearby that got on my already tired nerves. All was forgiven at breakfast in the Tiffin Room. The hotel buffet can only be described as a bounty of the freshest finest ingredients and anything from the menu was faultless. For lunch we got room service try the satays. Prompt friendly service started a love affair with the beef satays in particular with the amazingly good peanut sauce served in a silver gravy boat.

We booked into Raffles in March this year to celebrate my wifes 60th birthday and what a treat it turned out to be. We started with the history tour led by Mr Leslie Danker what an incredible memory he has through the closely guarded residents only entrance to the hotel past the gallery of famous guests including Somerset Maughan Noel Coward Jim Thompson James Michener etc. the list goes on. Suitably imbued with the history of Raffles we had in the past paid numerous visits to the now closed raffles museum when we visited for High Tea in the Tiffin Room. we waited in the foyer sipping on Singapore Slings for our room to be allocated. Not only we were given a fantastic upgrade but we were allowed to check in early to our Hotel Suite in the Main Building. We knew prior to booking that the hotel was undergoing phase one of their renovations but our stay was not in the least affected by any disruption from noise or builders being only deprived of the arcade shops Raffles shop and Jim Thompsons shop were still open and the courtyard bar cafe. Our suite was larger than our apartment in Sydney and staffed by our three private butlers Yujun Miyuki John. Yujun deserves an award as the most professional warm hearted friendly host that we are sure to ever have in all our travels for years to come. it is amazing that one so young can have developed such skills guests are sure to be rewarded if Yujun is one of your butlers. On my wifes birthday we not only received a personal greeting card from Simon the general manager but also a hand delivered sumptuous Raffles chocolate mouse birthday cake with candle and balloons to boot. What a stay. what a hotel from our Sikh doorman to lounging in the Writers Bar to breakfast in the Tiffin Room. relaxing by the rooftop pool nothing will ever surpass a stay at Raffles in Singapore.

There are plenty of other hotels and hotel rooms can be a bit of a muchness. Raffles is not. With the refurbishment I really do hope they keep the essence of the hotel as it is. The rooms are large and comfortable the bed I had was enormous. The bath was also huge and although I did not take up on the offer for the butler to run a spa bath for me perhaps I should have. The old fashioned baths need time to warm up so do not hop straight in. You need to adjust to calmer times. Raffles is a great hotel for doing nothing. Which was perfect for my trip I wanted 3 days doing nothing. I had a leisurely breakfast and the eggs Benedict are great there is fruit and heaps of pastries all fabulous. Then I stretched out by the pool which is wonderful and although you can hear the refurbishment works it is not vastly different to the sounds of the city it did not bother me. I did wander across to the Marina for the light show and had a quick look in the shops but nothing too strenuous. Supper in the grill was fine and the curry buffet was great.

Of course the floor is littered with peanut shells. It makes me wonder about the larikin ruffian travellers of years gone by that had a laugh when they stayed at Raffles. It also reminds me of a cowboy bar in San Antonio Texas which was the first place that I experienced a bar floor littered with peanut shells.

Ladies may be dressed in their casual best dresses skirts or trousers with appropriate footwear toes covered shoes or heels. No shorts open toes shoes or sandals pool attire is not permitted. As we were there on holiday and my son only had smart shorts with him I called to check that this would be OK. I was told its OK for children but a 15 year old risked being turned away. We therefore went out and bought smart chinos for the occasion at not an inconsiderable cost. I was then horrified to see the standard of dress allowed in the Grand Lobby. At least 4 adult men were wearing shorts. Many were in jeans and trainers. A few also in Birkenstock type sandals and t shirts. No one was turned away as I had been told. When I complained we were offered an apology and given extra desserts to take home. Half of these contained nuts which we could not eat due to allergies.

When you are arriving for a 1 night special occasion and have a nice plan of how you will spend your afternoon and evening being made to wait in the courtyard and effectively lose the afternoon by the pool made it a stressful and very disappointing start.

This was not the Raffles experience I was expecting and a free glass of champagne hardly softened the blow. The staff were all very courteous and considerate but it felt like they lacked depth of knowledge about the hotel and the operating procedures.

We were returning from Europe following a 3 month vacation and wanted to stop over in Singapore a few days to re adjust our body clocks closer to Australian time. Having previously stayed at Raffles Singapore and Dubai we expected nothing but the best. The extensive and recently completed renovations have been done thoughtfully and to be honest at least to our eyes have not changed the ambience of character of the hotel. Our room a State Room King Suite was opulent large and perfect for our stay. The smoke pollution from the Indonesian fires were at dangerous levels over the period of our stay providing even more reason to utilise all the facilities at the hotel. Room service was great with a wide choice of meals and the breakfast included in our tariff was world class standard. Our only negative comment would be the 10 service fee charged to anything everything at the hotel. An example would be the room charge at SD973 had an 10 service fee of SD9730 and then the Government tax of 7. If you ordered a coffee by the pool from the Nespreso machine. the cost was SD16 including service charges and tax making it the equal most expensive Capri Italy coffee on on trip. To be fair the booking information does state clearly plus service fees and Government charges. but as these are known and fixed there is a reasonable argument for the Hotel to state the full cost for example the State Room SD113841 per night including all charges. Over a four days the extras start to add up and if you are budgeting that extra SD16541 a day starts to count. We also stayed the week leading into the Singapore F1 event so other prices were likely inflated. The chafeur pick up was included in our tariff SD75 but to book a return trip it was SD210 we chose a taxi for SD40 which was just as fine to be honest. The Spa previously located near the pool is now situated downstairs in the Raffles Arcade. We did not use it this time and our only comment would be that he location is not as convenient as polside and within the hotel. Pros. Luxury accommodation great food great facilities central location attentive helpful staff. great stop over for a few days on the way to or returning from Europe.

Apart from that the hotel has issues and maybe it \u2019s due to the short re opening and the staff need more training. Overall the staff lack 5 star service. There are other hotels in Singapore that offer better more knowledgeable service. The concierge only knew about 5 restaurants between the 4 of them and they were all big hotel restaurants. The pool staff were completely inattentive. No real service and if you want a pool hotel this is not it. Very small for a 150 room hotel. During the 2 nights we had 2 fire alarms go off. One at 11 pm and another at 530am. We were told at checkin we would have an amazing turndown service with classical music and room prep. The music never happened and the second night we never got a turn down at all. I had to call at 10 pm to have them refresh the room while we waited outside. Overall the food was not bad.

Booking was simple and straight forward and due to unforeseen circumstances we had to make a very last minute change in the date of our booking the hotel handled this exceptionally well and without any issues. On arriving at the hotel we were greeted at the entrance by a member of staff to check us in a nice touch but they had the details of the wrong guest at hand. This was dealt with well and quickly and we were checked into our room quickly. The room was stunning. One of the nicest hotel rooms i have ever been fortunate enough to stay in. Simply can not fault the room. We were advised that our butler was going to come to our room to orientate us not necessarily needed but we agreed unfortunately the butler did not show up within 1520 mins and we had a lunch booking so left the room without the butler arriving. We were also only told about filming that was occurring at the hotel by reading a letter on the desk of the room this meant we could not access the lobby on the Friday or use the pool for the entire day on the Saturday something I feel we should have been advised of in advance. Overall the stay was wonderful i will review the food separately. but I felt as if half of the staff we being trained and most things had to be asked for twice on second request the ask would be handled by clearly a more seasoned employee and would be dealt with perfectly but having to ask twice was not ideal happened 45 times in two days. Other small items doors were not opened for my wife on entering leaving the hotel butlers were not prompt butter was not provided at breakfast check out was a 20 minute process as three members of staff left me to wait for the one person already occupied with another guest. all very minor details but when you are paying for the Raffles experience these small things make a difference in how you feel about staying in a place like Raffles.
