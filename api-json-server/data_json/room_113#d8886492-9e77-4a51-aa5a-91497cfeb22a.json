Our room was on the other side and faced the Chateau sunset which were incredible view of the city looked like we were at the top of Runyon. our room was beautiful we had beautiful complimentary products etc. etc. The only fault with our stay was. When we checked out. We checked out on a Monday morning and we almost checked out automatically they process everything on your credit card and send you the receipt but we decided to hang around and clear the bill ourselves before jumping in our \u00fcberx. Firstly on a Monday morning when you have a plane to catch it can be a little frustrating standing at a hotel reception with 3 other parties waiting to check out and there being one staff member working.

Whilst I really liked certain aspects of this place as a frequent traveller I want to try to give a balanced and truthful view of this place for those thinking of coming here as it does have some lovely features but there are a few things you need to be aware of to ensure this is the right place for your trip. I booked a 4 day stay here in May June 15. whilst I was visiting on business. I d heard so much about it and the pictures looked great so i was really looking forward to it. The location is great as you are right on the strip and there is quite a bit you can walk to like the Standard The Chateau M and shops various lovely little places to eat. But prepare yourself for staying in a hotel that is very much a big part of the LA scene and which at times becomes more of a club than a place to stay and def think twice about how much sleep you need to get if you are working out here as from Saturday to Wednesday I was able to sleep without being bothered by a neighbouring party just one night out of the 4 with noise one party next to me going from 2 530am. So that is the only downside of staying here. What was nice was the food and the staff who were both fantastic. Breakfasts were really good and the staff fast and helpful. They also kindly upgraded me to a suite. Thankyou whoever did that In terms of the rooms themselves they had some nice features but to be honest they were just OK. Carpet might help with the noise to be honest as the tiles amplified every sound between the floors. Some things like the bed are lovely and comfy and the linen was nice too but the bathrooms a little strangely set out had poor lighting and probably need a bit of a facelift in the next couple of years. one feature I just had to comment on was the huge rotating Baroque style mirror in the middle of the room which doubles as a TV. A little bizare to be honest art is a subjective thing but it became hard to navigate around at times with cases etc so if this place were to get a facelift I had do away or rethink the mirror.", "offset": [1327, 1449], "date": "2015-06-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "b4f34023-4729-4997-9190-fa7e634d69a2", "sentence": "A lot extra charges for basic necessities. The Mondrian looks good with quirky fixtures and fittings and is in a good location. However the staff apart from the concierge were largely disinterested in providing adequate service. For a hotel in this price range the service was at best perfunctory if not somewhat rude. There seemed to be little interest in providing guests with a positive experience. The earmarking of 200 a day for incidentals was somewhat presumptuous especially as this was not reiterated at check in but automatically included in the authorisation of the credit card. To add injury to insult the hotel charges 100 a day for wifi and 250 for each small tube of shampoo conditioner and body wash. This is not what I would expect of hotel in this price bracket I would expect that to be factored into the room price and not expect to pay extra. A truly good hotel that was genuinely interested in providing comfort to guests would provide such basic necessities free of charge indeed I have never in over 40 years of travel had to pay for using bath products no matter what luxury brand. While the food in the restaurant was of good quality this was marred by a poor breakfast menu and a seeming lack of any fresh fruit. Overall the hotel seemed to present itself as a place to be seen and pose rather than comfort and service. Had it not been for the concierge who was the only truly welcoming member of staff and who went the extra mile to organise a rental car have it delivered to the hotel negotiate a better price and print out directions I would have given an even lower rating of two stars.

I had a fabulous time staying at the Mondrian Hotel for my birthday weekend. The room was ready once I arrived and the valet bell boys and front desk were very helpful and friendly. It was the easiest check. in I have ever had by far. The only qualm I had with the hotel was actually at Sky Bar in the evening. I wanted to start the night off at Sky Bar because I had been there once before for a friends birthday and loved the atmosphere. So we got up to the bar and there was hardly anyone there at around 9 pm. So we decided to grab a table near the bar to order drinks and appetizers. However our server was VERY inattentive. We ended up ordering our drinks at the bar after waiting almost 20 minutes for her to take our order. Then after walking right by us and not acknowledging our table I literally had to flag her down to order appetizers. She then informed us from then on we were to order drinks from her and not the bar. However when we wanted to order another round again she was inattentive and we decided to just close out and order from the bar instead. It was not too horrible and I do understand servers are busy. But when there is barely anyone at the bar and you have a table full of girls trying to drink I think its more a disadvantage to you and the hotel. BUT the next day I laid out at the pool with my girlfriends and we HAD THE BEST SERVICE IMAGINABLE. I could not thank our server enough for her service. She was amazing to say the least. Even down to the towel boy. I mentioned to her what our service was like the night before and she apologized. I told her it was not her fault and she was doing a great job however she said they do work for the same hotel and their service reputation matters. I appreciated it and I felt like all around our service during our pool day Sunday made up for the poor service the previous evening. I will definitely be back again to layout by the pool and enjoy the wonderful LA weather and not the mention beautiful people at the Mondrian Hotel.

I am not one to only write negative reviews but I struggle to find a single thing that this hotel does well. 1. I checked in at 1 PM and my king bed studio suite was not ready so I accepted a two double room instead2. The rooms basic functions were horrible. Neither phone was functional. The shower did not work properly. The sink did not get hot water. The TV had several channels that would not work3. I realized that I could not order room service the morning after my first night so I tried to call the front desk. Neither phone would work so I called from my cell phone. I was redirected 5 times and every time someone new answered and had no idea that I had been waiting. I finally gave up got dressed and walked downstairs4. To their credit the lady at the front desk immediately offered another room of the same type. Unfortunately it is on a low floor meaning that tonight will probably be filled with club music the last room was on a high floor so there was not noise. 5. The new room has a functional phone. Unfortunately the TV in the bedroom does not work. LOL. 6. I utilized the hotel restaurant for dinner last night and breakfast this morning. Dinner food was pretty good the breakfast food was poor. LA is experiencing Torrential rain right now so the deck which is enclosed with some sort of tent had many leaks which caused many of the others dining to quickly have to change seats lest they be soaked. The outdoor dining space is cool but I guess they were not ready for rain. In the end this hotel like many in the SBE group tries to act and bill like a luxury hotel and it is not. There is no commitment to service. The accommodations are cool but they do not maintain them in any meticulous way. I made a mistake by booking this hotel when I should have just spent an extra 100 200 a night and booked the Four Seasons or Waldorf or Montage those hotels are committed to excellence. This one is not.

Most unpleasant stay I \u2019ve had. Where should I start. Overall the hotel was decent location is great. Breakfast was really good but that \u2019s about it. We paid cash for our room and used a credit card for the 200 a night hold required by the hotel. The credit card authorization machine apparently went down and we were told our credit card was not on file. Went downstairs the next morning to present my credit card statement that clearly showed the pending 400 charge for 2 nights. They insisted they needed to authorize our credit card AGAIN for 400 because they \u201c did n\u2019t have the card \u201d. After debating back and forth and basically telling them we are not authorizing our card for a second time the manager insisted we pay 200 additional cash for a hold for incidentals. Remember we already paid for 2 nights room in CASH up front and the hotel insisted we pay 200 additional all while there was clearly a 400 pending charge on our credit card. We finally check out the pending charge is still there so we ask the manager to speak to our credit card company so they can manually remove the hold. Done. Great. oh but then 2 days later I get a billing statement for 4817 charged to my credit card for mini bar items we did NOT use at all. How is this possible when The Mondrian \u201c supposedly \u201d did not have our credit card on file. Hands down the worse billing situation I \u2019ve had at a hotel and I work in the event planning industry and deal with hotels all the time. Other things Air does not get cold Light above headboard would not go off. Engineering had to come and check the wiring and it took 10 15 mins to fix. He did not even know why the light would n\u2019t go off at first Tried to charge us for bottled water when the bellman told us it was complimentary. Then asked if we used anything else in the mini bar as if they had no idea how the charges were put on our room bill.

I stayed at the Mondrian 630 74. In the past few years I have spent many days and nights at the Mondrian and it became my go to hotel in West Hollywood. However this most recent stay was disappointing from check in to check out. At check in I had a complimentary upgrade through amex and was told the room would be larger than the one I had booked which was the same level room I have stayed in many times in the past but it looked smaller and when I checked online I saw it was not in fact any bigger nor did it have any benefits over the level room I had booked. I am not sure if it was actually smaller or if it was the same size as the last room I had stayed in the renovation included replacing the previous set up which I loved with a lot of oversized furniture that made it feel cramped. The TV did not work and I was exhausted but they did at least send someone up with batteries for the remote which solved the problem. Also the view was certainly not superior as I was staring at a construction site which a few days later I feared was going to come crashing through my window during the earthquakeI decided not to complain about the room and to try to make the most of my time there. My friend joined me at the pool shortly after and the excessive volume of the music gave her a headache to the point we had to leave. The next two days were generally fine although it was annoying that a TV show was being filmed one of the days and also that unlike my previous stays the drinks at the pool bar were terrible. I was also not allowed to tilt my chair to face the sun. So overall I was not particularly pleased with the room or the service but I did not feel like hauling my luggage to a new hotel so I stayed. But my last day there 74 was a nightmare. After checking out I checked my suitcase and went to the pool and was told I could not bring my bag in so I removed some items no outside food or alcohol permitted and they prefer if you have only a very small bag which is not exactly practical if you are catching another flight that day and just threw the prohibited items in the garbage and then was told I needed to show my ID even though I had been there the previous 4 days and had my room key and the concierge kindly walked over and confirmed this. For whatever reason that was not sufficient and I was forced to go back in and get my luggage from the bellhop who was very nice and open it up on the lobby floor to find my license and then had to check my suitcase again and go back out to the pool and show security my license. We finally made it in but all of the tables and beds were marked reserved. We were told we could use one until someone with a reservation arrived so I thought ok great. I made about ten separate unsuccessful attempts to order food and by 30 my stomach was grumbling. It was difficult to find anyone to order from so I eventually tried the bar and was told by the bartender that she would send someone right over. No one came. We tried again and were told by another employee that there was a big staff meeting so everyone had been tied up but someone would be right over. No one came again. We tried to get food from the bordering restaurant and was told we would not be allowed to bring food from the hotel restaurant into the pool area and if we ate at the restaurant we would lose our seats by the pool. We tried again and were told to ask someone else. Finally after skipping breakfast and spending hours trying to get a sandwich I attempted to place an order again and after an ungodly number of attempts I was told that they would not serve any food or allow any food to be brought in or purchased from the adjoining restaurant for any hotel guests not getting bottle service which ranged from about 20 to 250. The energy was terrible from the start when I had to jump through hoops just to enter on my 5th day there and I was hangry after getting the run around during the hours I spent attempting to order food so I was not interested in ordering a bottle and prolonging my time there that day. I finally left hungry and drained and checked into another nearby hotel which was much more pleasant. I think the practice of not allowing guests who are not getting bottle service is dangerous or at least unhealthy and likely in violation of law. Even if it were ok to do that it was completely unacceptable that I spent hours trying to order food before someone finally informed me of this policy. The experience was unpleasant from the beginning and if I had been told that I could have left earlier and changed venues.

I wrote into the main website about my problem and no one has contacted me back. It seems like this hotel is not interested in service something you would expect from a 45 star hotel. Very disappointing. I will never book here again. The restaurant was another let down. The food was good but not prepared the way that i requested.

The front desk manager while apologetic claimed to know nothing about the incident the night before and again apologized that they had no other rooms available to move us to. 10 pm they finally had people come clean our room our kids fell asleep fully clothed given the nature of the bathroom. Upon check out the following day for the third time I had rehash my story as the morning front desk manager was unaware of any adjustments to be made to the invoice for our inconvenience of having to sleep in a dirty room for two nights. In summary dealing with three various managers across three dates there is zero accountability as to who is in charge of this hotel with zero concerns regarding guests \u2019 experience. I believe a basic expectation of any hotel is that you have a clean room and at this price point you also expect to have superior customer service Mondrian fails at both. I have contacted American Express Platinum and have encouraged them to take this property off their recommended signature properties. I even had American Express Travel call the front desk during my stay to resolve this issue and asked if they could assist us with procuring us a new clean room and like me they were unsuccessful in doing so. I travel extensively for work spending nearly 50 nights at hotels and have never encountered such dysfunction at what is supposed to be a luxury hotel.
