We used the Expedia service where you select the level of hotel and they assign the hotel after booking. Although the Crowne Plaza has had some negative reviews recently we were thoroughly pleased with our stay. The room was large and comfortable and well appointed as was the bathroom. The staff was unfailingly friendly and helpful. We did not use other facilities and so can not comment on them. The hotel is situated about 2 blocks from the Power and Light District and so it was very easy to walk over for dinner and entertainment. There is construction on the exterior going on but it was not intrusive and started only after 9 am and ended before 5 pm. Additionally we were pleased to see that Wifi was free. Valet parking was 17 and included multiple uses during the day.

Just stayed 4 nights at the Crowne Plaza in KC Downtown. It is overpriced for the quality of this location. It is conveniently located downtown and we chose it as it is close to our sons apartment. However it is in need of a deep cleaning and a freshening. Our room rate fluctuated from 239 the first night to 29 our fourth night. Our experience did not improve by 60. The lobby area is noisy with background music as well as conversation so although the staff is helpful communication is challenging when staff does not speak up. Our room number was written so illegibly by the desk clerk we had to call downstairs after check in to ask what room we were in. Carpeting in the hallway is filthy with large stains and in need of replacement. Several times trash bags of trash or dirty linens were just sitting in the hallway. Our room was small as was the bathroom. Functional but not luxury or worth 29. The bathroom floor was in need of a scrubbing and the same eyelash was on our toilet tank our entire stay. There is a fridge but no mini bar. The air conditioner was very noisey and during the night you could hear the whir of the elevator. The staff is polite and tries to be helpful although they could not explain the procedure for the Super Shuttle I reserved. As they recommended it they should familiarize themselves with the procedure. Overall it was an average hotel stay. Cable went out twice during a rainstorm.

My wife and I decided to stay downtown for an event at Municipal and since it was going to be 12 degrees out we went with this hotel. We showed up early to check in before going to dinner with friends. The parking garage was almost full but we found a spot and waited about 10 minutes for the garage elevator. We made it to the front desk before dinner and were given the keys to our carnival ride for the evening. Room 1916One of the keys worked and one did not. Score. We walked into the room and the heater in the bedroom of our king suite was screeching like a rail car with a bad bearing we could not talk over it. My guess is that it is intermittent and the room attendants do not hear it when they come in during the mid day hours. We were pressed for time so I shut it down instead of asking for another room. After dinner we came back to a packed parking garage and a line of folks waiting for the valets. They were shuttling back and forth down the block to a lot and did a good job of managing the volume for just two guys. The show finished up and we headed back to the room. The seals around the perimeter of the heating units leaks like a sieve. Half of the room was 70 and the other half was not really close to that. Getting the heater going again revealed that rest did not fix the screech. Joy. The interesting part about it was that the screeching did cover the Curly 3 Stooges style whopwhopwhop that the old Otis elevator made with every move. The lobby and entrance were nice.

Even the womans blouse who checked us in looked filthy. Unbelievable wash your clothes before you show up to work. The room had a smell of feet. Overall the customer service was the worst I have ever experienced and I travel often for work. Staff flat out ignored us. we were the only people at the counter and they looked past us. When I asked for they are assistance they seemed bothered were rude and raised they voice questioning me as if I had done something wrong. I had to raise my voice to snap them out of it. When I tried to check out there was a different man at the counter and he also flat out ignored me even though I was the only person there saying excuse me.
