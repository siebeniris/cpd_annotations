Only had a couple of negative experiences which is why I did not give it a 5 star. The room was great and quite comfortable. The front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful. The negatives are that on my first night I ordered room service and it never came. After a hour and half I called down and it appeared that my order was never entered into the system or that it got lost. The next night around 9 pm I was contacted bu room service to see if I was interested in dinner on themWas a little to late to be offered a free dinner. The only other negative I had was that my shower on the first morning there was barely luke warm. I realize the hotel was busy but it there is nothing more than I hate than a not hot shower in the morning. I hold nothing against this property and would definitely stay there again and I recommend this hotel.", "offset": [44, 126], "date": "2015-03-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a7bfe134-d753-4305-806c-4365d9cee474", "sentence": "4 Star Hotel 25 Star Amenities. The lobby is gorgeous I will admit. My husband and I booked on Hotwire. perhaps that was our mistake. The furniture in the room was well worn and the walls were THIN. We were woken up by people on both sides of us. The beds were not the comfiest but the pillows were nice. The shower had two settings warm and trickling or hot and blasting. The staff was friendly no problem. Again we booked on Hotwire so perhaps that was why our room was not that great. But I would not stay here again.

Hyat is a good brand. Lots of money invested in it. Therefore I am puzzled as to why would they drop the ball on the product quality in this location. The public spaces are well done. Fairly typical Hyat d\u00e9cor. Front desk service was efficient no complaints. The room however was a different story. The physical layout and original construction simply do not support an upscale property. Walls are paper thin and you can hear conversations in the adjoining rooms and even across the hall without straining. After arrival I got to listen to a detailed sales report from a gentleman across the hall. It was mildly amusing for about 5 minutes. The furnishings were ok but the bathroom was small with the shower in tub set up and cheap fixtures. The television was an old version poor resolution flat screen. All of this would be acceptable for a Holiday Inn market segment. As a Hyat it simply does not fly. wifi was free with an attempt at premium upsel and the sheets are changed every 2 days because of the overwhelming concern for the environment by the management. these little cards with environmental concerns which save money for the hotel but do nothing for the traveller always amuse me. This hotel clearly caters to school groups. I counted at least 6. The use of the lobby and the elevators can get pretty challenging. The noise levels generated by school groups gets to be particularly challenging in a hotel with poor sound insulation. Food at the bar was decent and prices were reasonable. Breakfast buffet was a low quality affair designed to satisfy the student groups. Again not exactly up to the Hyat level. Service staff at breakfast ran the place as a busy packed diner. Lots of noise and instructions. There was nothing terrible about the property and everything was reasonably efficient but this is not what one expects when one stays at the Hyat.", "offset": [944, 1105], "date": "2015-05-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "1ecf42f2-3947-4a72-806c-6dff92be2e34", "sentence": "Worst Hotel Stay.

We had not been to the DC area before and put some level of trust in that staff to provide us with needed information to make our stay enjoyable and hassle free. Instead we received numerous disinterested or wrong answers from staff who acted as if we were bothering them. This hotel was chosen because of the shuttle service as well as the Hyat name. While the facility and housekeeping staff were excellent the front desk staff was not a good representation of the Hyat brand. Individuals acted distracted. Even when there were no other guests waiting at the desk employees seemed annoyed that we were inquiring about the hotel shuttle. When we were told the shuttle was not available for various reasons on several days we were never given alternative means of transportation which we found out later would have rather easy to provide to us. Our impression was that the desk was short staffed and labeling the shuttle as unavailable was their way to compensate. These issues created a poor and stressful week. We are not the kind of people that typically complain formally or post reviews and create a public issue of our experience but this experience was awful. housekeeping was great it is a 20minute 25 dollar cab ride to the nearest subway station.

It was a Hotwire deal for a supposedly 4 star hotel. The staff was nice but short handed. The lobby and patio are gorgeous. I got an appetizer and a salad in the bar. Dip was ok the salad was one of the best dishes I have ever had. But then you go upstairs and it is like you walked into a 1980s Motel 6. Hallways are old and shabby. My room was clean but old and worn. And big but a really bizarre lay out. Double beds on opposite sides of the room. Only one side can see the TV not an issue since I was by myself but I can imagine families would not like it. Doors not very secure or safe speaking of being by myself. The bathroom had been updated but there is no fan so what was the point because it is getin moldy already on the ceiling. The fixtures were clean. Business center and WiFi not great. It was convenient to many things in Fairfax. It was fine for the Hotwire price I paid. I would stay here again if I absolutely had to or got the same rate as this time.
