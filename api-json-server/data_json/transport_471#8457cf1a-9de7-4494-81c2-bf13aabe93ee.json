We stayed for 5x nights in July and booked two extras rooms for clients during this time as well. We have stayed at this hotel previously because of its great location and good service. However on this occasion we were left disappointed as the service has diminished and we encountered a number of issues. The hotel still has a great location lovely lobby pool and garden area but we will think twice before staying again. Issues encountered1. After check in and trying to enter room the key card system would not work. After having to go back to the reception to report it we had to wait 90 minutes for someone to attend and fix it battery problem with the device2. Each time we went to the pool area there was a lack of seating and if you could find a deck chair there were no umbrellas. It was too hot to sit in the direct sun with no umbrella. Further there were a lack of staff to take meal and drink orders and you had to hunt them down to achieve this. On another occasion when we found unoccupied seats we had to find someone to clear the leftover food and drinkware so we could sit down3. We went to the business centre as we needed to print some paperwork. It was 10x pages of colour and a few of black white. Imagine our shock when we were told 48. This is complete overcharging. You do not mind paying something but that charge was excessive and unacceptable. We complained and asked to see the manager and were told they were not back until Monday. We were checking out Sunday. The bill was marginally reduced but 330 per colour page is a disgrace and profiteering at its best4. Upon checkout we settled the incidentals and went to farewell a friend in the restaurant who was having breakfast. Imagine my surprise when a woman approaches and asks me if she gave me too much change back. Firstly I did not know who she was and then she proceeded to inform me that they had given me too much change back and needed 50 back. This was very unprofessional and embarrassing in the restaurant. I was focused on checking out saying bye to our friend and getting to the airport. I did not count the change and still do not know if she was corect5. When we enquired about our Golden Circle points we were appalled to find as we booked our 5x nights and other rooms via our travel agent that they would not count for points. This is not good enough. We are currently staying 10x nights at the shangri la in Penang and expected to get points for both stays. Regardless of where you book agent or via hotel you are still patronising that hotel chain. We will be having a big rethink about whether we stay at shangri la Singapore again or elsewhere based on our recent experiences.", "offset": [121, 208], "date": "2015-07-17", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "25bef0b3-e041-4a12-b89b-ef763c06efe1", "sentence": "Awesome Stay at Shangri La. Our experience at Shangri La was fabulous from start to finish. It began with a very late check in after more than 20 grueling hours of travel from the US The front desk employee was welcoming and excited to tell us that we had been upgraded to a larger room to better accommodate the 3 of us. My husband adult daughter and me. The room was awesome cool and clean with a very comfy bed. The bathroom was huge and had all of the necessary supplies and equipment for hair drying. We had a fantastic breakfast each morning included in price at the restaurant buffet. The were many options and each tasted delicious. We spent time at the pool and found the area clean and relaxing with decent drink service and a snack lunch menu that was the same caliber as the breakfast buffet. We were always able to get a cab quickly out front and found transportation around the city simple and safe. Every staff member that we encountered greeted us with a warm smile.

A recognition of what is important to you as an individual from wherever you come from so take the time to ensure you tell the hotel what matters to youWe stayed in the Valley wing which is a more traditional style which we liked very much. The Tower wing is more business orientated undergoing renovation until Chinese New Year. If you are easily disturbed ensure you take this into account because the access to the works is across the ballroom and down the back of the Valley Wing. While every effort is made not all of the Elves constructing the transit deck were silent particularly if you in a different time zoneI loved the ambience of this hotel but was disappointed to see the Blu deck and bar so quiet. it is a good location and views but needs reinvention. Why not look at how business guests could use it as the Horizon club gets quite crowded and perhaps consider how time limitations could be eased to provide an ambient customer levelHowever this still remains a favourite of mine and although we did not use a rickshaw from Boat Quay up the ramp this time very much look forward to a return visit.", "offset": [983, 1037], "date": "2016-09-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "f7d6456d-18e0-46a3-b925-5efb2e6559ea", "sentence": "Beautiful.

For the business traveler there needs to be a more convenient way to get to the MRT station. I asked the Concierge and was told that there were two early morning buses that went to the MRT station but nothing mid morning like 8 to 9 AMHowever during the hours of 10 to 6 pm there was an hourly shuttle bus for shopping. I understand the establishment is regarded as a luxury hotel but it is clear that the shuttle service is meant to cater to the vacationing family and not necessarily the business traveler that is working off campus. Also there was only one morning where there was no hot water for the shower in room 1730. So I showered in the Fitness Center. The food was great but expensive. My company allows US 30 meal. The only way I could meet this was either at the Shop House or at The Line by ordering from the A la Carte menu. The dinner buffet is US 90One thing that I never asked about but would be nice to know is if the Shangri La offers an airport shuttle. Or is it suggested to just call a taxiThe in room phone was frustrating to use. Can you add a simple booklet with a set of instructions. I could not activate the handset to make a call. The only thing that seemed to work was to use the speaker phone I have a Degree in Chemical Engineering so I am usually pretty good at thisThe cleanliness of the establishment the politeness of the staff and the room layout decorations are all top notch 10 out of 10The free in room WiFi while easy to connect to was dismally slow at 17 mbps according to Ooklacom. A quick internet search suggests that Singapore as a whole has some of the fastest internet speeds on the planet. Why then is the Shangri La so slow. As a mobile business traveler I rely on fast internet speeds the way one relies on electricity. I never asked if there was a business center that might have had faster internet access. An odd occurrence did happen while there. I opened one of the over priced mini white wine bottles from the mini bar. It was filled with water. I complained got a free replacement bottle and received a free full size bottle as an apology. I was very impressed with the attempt to apologize and make the situation right. However the bottle did have the snap steel ring still intact. As an engineer I wonder how someone was able to open the bottle consume the contents refill it with water and replace the cap without breaking the tamper evident seal. And No it was not me. Also my birthday happened to occur while on my trip. I received a phone call that they would like to bring me a free cake. I was surprised that they knew and bothered to offer anything. The gesture was appreciated and the chocolate cake was truly decadent if you happen to like chocolateI forgot my toothbrush but there were free ones available in the vanity draw a plusThe walls were well insulated and I did not hear much neighbor noise. Fresh fruit in the room everyday was also greatly appreciated. The cost of laundry also needs to be addressed. During a 3wek stay I needed to do a little laundry. Seven 7. garments cost over US 100. This is excessive. The following week I washed my garments myself in the bathroom sinkit is a very nice hotel overall but I wonder why it is on my companys Approved Hotel list as it did not allow me to be highly productive while in the room running Skype meetings at 6 AM with a slow internet connection. PS. Neither myself nor my company are cheap. I work for a Fortune 50 electronics company.

The Shangri La is a great hotel which allows you to escape the busyness of Singapore but still be fairly central. As soon as you walk in you sense the quality with a huge foyer and very attentive staff. We went for a Horizon Club tower twin which was a decent size 38sqm which is located in the same building as reception the garden wing has bigger rooms but is more expensive. The room looks to have been newly refurbished and was modern with large LCD TV Nespreso machine fridge etc. The bathroom has all the amenities and includes a bath and shower again nicely modernised. The beds were large and very comfortable and the room has black out curtains allowing you to sleep as much as possible. One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was the pool it is huge with a hot tub there are plenty of sun beds around it is as good as the photos. You really get the sense you are on a staycation yet can walk to orchard road in 5mins. There is a separate kids area with water spouts and playground. The hotel is very good for kids with a huge kids play area. The gym is well kited out and includes a sauna steam room and hot tub to unwind. The horizon club is worth the extra cost if you are planning to be at the hotel in the day. The breakfast is amazing in the Line restaurant normally SGD42 one of the best breakfast buffets I have been to ever with a huge selection 24 types of pastries as an example and it included proseco on the weekend. We chose to use the club lounge most of the time as it has most of the good food and is less busy. Afternoon tea 2 4pm includes scones sandwiches and a selection of cakes and desserts. The Cocktails and snacks 5 8pm included 5 cheeses a good selection of wines hot dishes salad bar cold cuts and more cakes. The alcohol selection is good and there is a member of staff to make fresh cocktails to your order as well. You can get your moneys worth in alcohol alone given Singapore prices. 24 hours a day you have tea and coffee and a selection of soft drinks and is a nice place to unwind. The staff were amazing the whole time and could not do enough for us. The only down side is the location especially if you want to use the MRT which is 15mins walk away however you can get a cab from outside anytime. I would wholeheartedly stay here again as it is at the cheaper end of the 5 star hotel prices but offers excellent value and quality. The pool and staff were the stand outs. We will be back.
