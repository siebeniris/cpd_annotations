This hotel has a very modern feel the rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff are courteous and attentive. The location is quiet and central to many of the tech companies in Silicon Valley but is otherwise a little bland. Fortunately they have ample free parking so you can easily use a car to get around. Overall this is a great hotel for the price. My only complaint is that the breakfast buffet is expensive at 17. There are two Starbucks within walking distance of the hotel so if breakfast is not included with your room I recommend going to one of those.

The bed was comfortable and adjustable. The room was large and you had plenty of space and also it was pretty clean1. The main problem was the temperature in the room. It was pretty cold outside and I had to use the heater. However the system is very noisy you can not even hear the other person on the phone when the heater is turned on. As such I could not use it during the night and in the morning it was very cold in the room around 60F. 2. Another problem was the location of the room next to the restaurant and every morning starting with 60 AM. it was very noisy and it smelled like greasy food. 3. The water pressure in the bathroom was very low you could barely use the sink faucet. 4. The internet connection was not working at all and the reception staff could not help. I had to spend almost half an hour on the phone with a rude person from IT to get it to work. 5. The walls seem pretty thin. One evening my neighbor was watching a movie and I could not sleep because of the noise coming from his room. 6. Are all hotels in Silicon Valley this pricey.

The internet there really sucks disconnection occurred very frequently what is more the speed is very slow as well.
