Will Not Stay Again. Our previous overnight stays at or near YZ have included the Sheraton Gateway Alt Holiday Inn and Delta now Airport West. This time we chose the Hilton because I had a corporate rate for the 15 day park and fly package that was 13 the cost of the Sheraton Gateway our usual preferred choiceI figured we could put up with having to contend with a shuttle for such a significant savings. The parking is very convenient very professional and friendly valet and check in with the enthusiastic and personable front desk clerk was fast and efficient. It appears the entire hotel has been recently renovated everything was new clean and modern. We were assigned a room with one king bed on the third floor of the south tower. The room was a decent size for a one night stay but the bathroom was tiny. The bed was comfortable feather pillows and the sheets were of good quality. The velvet chaise had some disturbing stains and an obvious mark from someone placing a warm iron on it see photo. Otherwise everything was clean and in good repair. The fitness centre is surprisingly well appointed for an airport hotel and the pool with its roof retracted is appealing just needs more seating around the perimeterAfter a 30 am wake up call we caught the punctual 330 am shuttle. It made a stop at the Hampton Inn so it took about 15 minutes to get to the terminal a little longer than I would have anticipated given that the hotel is the closest off site property to the airportWe were pleased with our stay and thought it offered incredible value with the included parking. The facilities and room are nicer than those at the Sheraton Gateway and the Alt. We planned to stay there again after our late night return flight but I did not want to make advance reservations in case there was a problem with our connecting flight or we got significantly delayed due to weather. I called the hotel upon our return and the agent said he would hold a room for us. The shuttle took half an hour to reach the airport then another 15 minutes to reach the hotel much too long at 10 am. When we arrived at the hotel the clerk said he had to check with the night manager about the rate because the hotel was officially sold out he did not have a rate for our room. The rate he offered us was 75 more than what we had paid two weeks earlier including 15 days of parking at the time my corporate rate without parking would have been less than half what they wanted to extort from us on our return. When I balked at this his response was that the rate was high because it was the last room available. We chose to drive home instead which worked out fine because the weather was good and there was no traffic. Hiltons loss not ours. it is not as if they were likely to fill that room with another random walk in at that time of the night. If Hilton had chosen to extend a little good will and offer us a rate that was at least equivalent to what we had paid on our departure night stay they would have earned our return business at the end of the month when we are off on another trip.

For Real. WOW. My experience at the Hilton Toronto Airport Hotel Suites is simply WONDERFUL. It is imperative to state as a Caveat caveat emptor. This hotel edifice although presently undergoing some major renovations notwithstanding proves to offer exceptional service to make you feel comfortable at home. Never since I started travelling globally and internationally in 1975 have I ever received such a lovely heartfelt and sincere appreciation of my business as a paying customer in a hotel. Mr VIJAY AKULASINGAM who was the evening duty manager during our 2 3 night stay deserves the biggest credit for such an EXCELLENT CUSTOMER CARE SERVICEI reserved two 2 rooms one 1 for my USA visitor and the other for myself. I was a guest at this hotel which is conveniently located very close to YZ Toronto Pearson Airport between July 6 8 and my USA associate from July 6 9Besides its ideal location for its proximity to the airport the STAFF was very accommodating. It is understood that this Hilton location is undergoing some extensive upgrade and MODERNIZATION. I can not say enough to highly commend and extol VIJAY for taking my concerns very seriously. Needless to say it was becoming an embarrassment to me for booking my American friend at this location in the rooms we were initially placedHiltons promise and commitment to make every stay pleasant was made REAL by Mr Akulasingam. This duty managers judgement is beyond reproach. Below is my story After several hours upon arrival in my original room on July 6 2019 I noticed the air conditioning unit was not working effectively. I then called the hotel telephone operator all the operators at this hotel proved to be quite polite and helpful and requested to have the hotel manager come and see me. To my surprise in less than five 5 minutes the duty manager was standing at my door. Naturally I was impressed right from the onset outset. This manager arrived in my room calm cool and collected. He introduced himself listened carefully and attentively to my complaint then politely asked if he could send in one of his maintenance crew to verify whether or not the AC problem could be easily rectified. The EFFICACY of the staff members at this hotel is fantastically brilliant. The nice young man from the maintenance department showed up in less than five minutes did his inspection and recommended to the manager to change our rooms. We my USA visitor and I were taken to view two 2 new rooms and asked if they were acceptable. Yes indeed they were. Vijay immediately sent Mr Karl Carlos the duty Bellhop to assist in the relocation of our luggage and belongings. I am quite impressed with all those who attended to us at this hotel including but not limited to Ms Desire the cheerful young kitchen staff member who brought the requested glassware and utensils to my room Mr Carlos the bellhop who help moved our appurtenances and Mr Neale Fernandez at the front desk who checked me out and made sure my American guest was well taken after my departure. Not to forget the housekeeper a lovely lady originally from Jamaica who was eagerly pleased to provide was with fresh clean toiletries. Please forgive me not to have asked for her nameCongratulations to the Hilton group for having such a team of dedicated and devoted employees as this speaks volume to me. I would like to once again extend my sincere and utmost appreciation respect and gratitude to Mr. Visanthan Vijay Akulasingam for showing and proving that he cares about paying customers. In todays world where quality service is becoming more of a rarity than a norm and expectation this hotel still offers and upholds such a valuable feature. I will surely rate this Hilton hotel based on the service received as 1 ranked in all the worldly hotels I have ever visited. Kudos to Vijay and others who made our stay worthwhile. It is the people who make it happen cherish the employees who hold Hilton a higher standard to Be your Guest.", "offset": [1033, 1131], "date": "2019-07-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "af4a34c4-e8f7-4b9f-bb25-80e1e12a3f88", "sentence": "Okay.
