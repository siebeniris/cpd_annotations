The main advantage to this hotel is that it is attached to the airport. There are others that are connected as well but this is the closest to the airport proper. 45 second walk and you are in the terminal. you are also right above the regional and long distance train stations so getting into downtown Frankfurt or points beyond is very easyThe service of the staff is some of the best I have ever experienced and I have been in 5stars all over the world. I arrived early in the morning and was given the room I wanted right away. I had some perishables that needed to be refrigerated and the mini bar in the room was not functioning properly. One phone call to reception and 10 minutes later a functioning mini frdge is wheeled into room and the problem is solved. Upon check out the bell captain took my bags and walked with me all the way to the check in counter at the airport. He even managed to get me in the business check in line even though I was flying economy. The only reason I did not give 5stars overall is that the food options especially late night was not all that great and fairly high priced. Fortunately the mall beneath the airport had some late night options.

We had a meeting with a client near Frankfurt so we decided to stay at this hotel by the airport. We are glad we did as the place is very convenient near the terminals close to a train and subway station and with ready access to taxis. This is one of the nicest Sheratons I have been in lately clean and functional and with very good service. If you are a Starwod member you can be upgraded to a nicer room and you get free wifi. The business area is nice clean and functional with everything we needed. The best features are the two restaurants the taverne with traditional German food it was almost October so the theme was Oktoberfest and the main restaurant Flavors where breakfast is served which is very good. We had dinner at the main restaurant one night and enjoyed everything we ordered from the salads to the appetizers to the main dishes particularly the grill options that allow you to choose the amount of fish in our case yellow fin tuna and steak in our case sirloin featured. We were a large group so the service was a bit slow but with a smaller group its fine. The beer and wine selection is good and they have a very good selection of after dinner drinks.

The Sheraton and I go a long way back really. I lived in Frankfurt briefly 15 years ago and this used to be my hangout place. I lived in many countries and being in Germany for a year I missed the sense of freedom that comes with being around airports and hotels frequent flyers might agree. so I would go visit to watch planes and just sit and have coffee in the lobby meeting people from all over the world. Tuesday nights they used to have jazz night which was back where the sports bar is located now. I would come every week as it reminded me of my time in NY. These days I travel more than ever and I pretty much live in hotels. Still coming back to the Sheraton after all these years brings back so many memories. My husband comments on how everything is so clean and shiny there.
