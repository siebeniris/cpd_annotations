A lot of people are complaining about how expensive this place is and how it is not as pristinely maintained as they would expect for a Waldorf Astoria. But it is really not overpriced when you compare the rates to other similar properties in Key West which is not an inexpensive destination. And Key West is a very casual laid back location so you are not going to get the type of formality you had see at the Waldorf in New York for example. If you are traveling to Key West over Christmas New Years expect to pay top dollar. We paid 509 for a studio plus a 30 resort fee and 27 for valet parking and it was actually one of the better rates in town. The Mariot which is in a much less desirable location was 79 and even the Fairfield Inns neither in a good location and no beach were 459 59. I have diamond status with Hilton and got great service including a welcome gift of a bottle of good quality champagne and some key lime cookies along with some discount coupons and 2 free drinks in the bar. The room was great and the property has a nice pool courtyard restaurant and beach with a pier. We thought the room was outfitted very nicely with a Nescafe machine robes turndown service complementary bottled water a large balcony and a mini fridge. For Key West this is about as good a beach property as you can find and it is just steps from Duval Street and easy walking to Hemingway House and other top attractions. Keep in mind that the Keys are really not beach destinations so beaches are limited. And Key West is small quaint and compact. So it is not fair to compare this place to an expansive resort in the Caribbean. The restaurant on site is right on the beach and had wonderful service and fantastic seafood.

We had our golf clubs shipped via Shipsticks and when Dominick heard our name at check in he chimed in and said I have your clubs in the back and I \u2019l take them up to your room. He even drove us over to the Casa Marina for coffee early one morning in the golf cart. Kip the beach and pool attendant could not have been any more helpful or nicer. He was always right there with chairs towels and some good conversation. The lady from the Ukraine in the gift shop was also very nice and very chatty while making coffee or whatever we needed. The other lady that was in the gift shop a couple of mornings was a little gruff and not as friendly. Spencers by the Sea is a very good restaurant. We had lunch there once and breakfast twice. Jil at the polside bar also does a great job. She kept everyone happy and was constantly serving a guest or customer. You can also easily walk up Duval street or to Old Town and there are numerous restaurants sports rental places bars and coffee shops very close to the Reach. The Reach is a sister property to the Casa Marina which we did not realize until the second day we were there. They should mention that at check in. The Casa Marina held a Luau our last night in Key West and it was a lot of fun. Our entire group really enjoyed the food drink and fire dancers. They roasted a pig and had fresh Mahi Mahi it was all very good. You can walk to the Casa Marina from the Reach in about 4 5 minutes. I did think that the Reach was showing it \u2019s age a bit as the beach and pool chair cushions are all stretched out and torn and in need of replacement.

EJ informed me that there were 3 hotel rooms that had be renovated and they were demo rooms for the upcoming renovation starting in August. EJ went out of his way to make sure we got one of the renovated rooms and it did not disappoint. The interior was very modern nice couch area bed was very comfy and the bathroom was really wonderful. The staff at the hotel were amazing. Besides EJ shout out to Jese down at the beach cool dude always making sure we were setup at the beach or pool. The wait staff was also excellent. They have this great system that they have a pager for the wait staff. Works quite well and drinks were extremely good. We ate at the onsite restaurant for breakfast twice. They have a nice brunch menu on the weekend smaller plates really liked that option. The pool albeit small was clean and not overcrowded at all. The beach again not big but plenty of room was clean. However there was a TON of seaweed which the Reach tried to maintain by cleaning it daily. This is not a Reach problem Key West in general had this problem. To the point they closed certain public beaches. The smell was not good at all. However they groomed the beach daily but there was just so much seaweed. Was better to get out there in the afternoon was not as bad. Overall it was just a great stay. Highly recommend renting bikes from the hotel that is how we got around Key West given the lack of parking for cars. We also checked the sister hotel Casa Marina. Only the pool area.
