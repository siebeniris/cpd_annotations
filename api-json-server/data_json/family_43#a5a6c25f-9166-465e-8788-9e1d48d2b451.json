My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Toronto Airport Hotel Suites on April 10 2016 as our last stop on a three week vacation before flying home. We had a rental car. The weather was miserable so I appreciated being able to pull right up to the doors to unload. We had thought about returning the rental that night and just taking the shuttle in the morning. The parking at the hotel was 180 and was outside at the rear of the hotel. It was getting late and we were leaving early. After some discussion the person checking us in offered to reduce the parking fee to 100 as we were only going to be there for a short period of time. I was sold. Check in was very easy. I had purchased my room through Pricelines Name Your Own Price. My receipt shows I saved 22. I did not have to pay until we checked in. We have stayed at this hotel numerous times over the years. It is an older hotel but well maintained. There is a restaurant on the main floor. When we got to our room I noticed something I had not seen in a hotel previously. There was a sliding door to separate the entrance bathroom area and the rest of the room. It also helped to block the hall light which was visible under the door and illuminated the room. The view was nothing special as it looked over a parking lot. The room had a coffee maker iron ironing board safe hair dryer flat screen TV alarm clock desk and chair. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. The bathroom was clean and had everything we needed. Unfortunately our stay was short and we did not get to explore the rest of the hotel. In the morning I stopped at the Shell Station a minute away to fill up the rental car. Terminal 3 was only a five minute drive that early in the morning. We enjoyed our stay and definitely would return.", "offset": [23, 165], "date": "2016-04-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "2a1e733f-3e3a-4d9c-b5aa-eafe94a9f238", "sentence": "First Time to Canada. After many weeks of research between vacation rentals and hotels I finally found the perfect spot. Originally I had wanted to stay in Toronto and even booked a vacation rental. Then I forgot to consider the fact that it would be my first time in Canada and I was not too sure of what to expect. Thank goodness I ended up canceling the vacation rental reservation. The Hilton was literally less than 1 minute from the airport as I do not like to rush after check out and I was able to do an early check in. The staff was 110 on it and the customer service was excellent. The newly renovated pool and gym area was awesome and if you need a little relaxation their sauna is great too. The location itself is prime. Just 15 min from a huge shopping mall Niagara Falls is less than a hour half away and Toronto is about 30 min. If your traveling with children Canadas wonderland is just a mere 30 min drive too.
