I have been to the upscale hotel many times but never actually stayed there until recently. Finally the opportunity to experience their beds and room service has come. Is their room service just as good as their upscale restaurantWith it \u2019s flamboyant menu design and it \u2019s not so simple prices as you may expect I was curious to take a peek. The selection you see on the menu is not your typical continental breakfasts you see at most hotels. For breakfast you can feast from the Chef \u2019s collection of assorted pastries to Torijas Spanish Toast. But since I arrived in the evening and I was starving and exhausted from my LA commute I took the liberty to order dinner and went with a delicious Salmon Couscous dish. Now being that it was late I was expecting for my dinner to arrive at your typical 45 60 minute room service wait right. Nope. My dinner arrived within 30 minutes or less. I was very surprised and very pleased with the service. So how was the dinner. Exceptional. The Salmon was moist warm and grilled to perfection. It also came with a delicious creamy sauce which I need to find out what it is because it was delicious.", "offset": [782, 902], "date": "2015-07-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b9b3bfed-c1fc-43d2-8a79-87f4618bc1a0", "sentence": "Pros Excellent location. Walking distance to everything. Great valet service as well. Cons. Overpriced for the quality of the room. The whole place is really dark and looks like a nightclub 247. The design was very masculine. I did not feel relaxed at all when I was there as in I did not look forward to coming back to the hotel. I do not know if it was the color of the carpet they used for the room or something but it just gave the room a dirty grungy look. The dark light did not help it either. The lighting in our room was so bad that I could not properly apply make up. The only way I was able to do that was to open the blinds in the morning and use the tiny mirror on my tiny eyeshadow compact. There are big mirrors in the room but they are faced in a way that you can not really see any light hitting your face. The bathtub and shower stalls were weirdly designed. Water splashed everywhere when you shower and if you are not careful the whole bathroom can be soaking wet afterwards. At night time our room was literally infused with cigarette smoke. It smelled like someone was smoking right outside our door. They sent someone up but the guy said they can not do anything about it because the smell came from the vent. I get it but could not they have designed the vent better. For 500 per night it was definitely not worth the money.

Rooms are decent in size. interesting design mirrored throughout. Dark hallways and rooms. The room service was NOT attentive. Our room was not attended and the last day we had no clean towels after we took shower the water was refilled in the room which was indicating room service was in the room while we were gone I guess they did not bother to clean up and replace towels as we were scheduled to check out that day. The room was never straighten up during our stay and when I think about it I never even saw the cart or the cleaning crew. The concierge was helpful made suggestions for lunch Urth cafe in Santa Monica Main Street and assisted us with reservations for dinner Katana in Sunset Plaza both great restaurants. Front desk staff was friendly. Gym was very nice for morning cardio workout. Spa is overpriced and very basic nothing to write home about. The spa staff including my pedicurist was kind very friendly and nice. I had a pedicure and it was a great color application and pampering but my callus was not removed and I had to do another pedicure when I got home right after paying 125 at The Ciel spa. Valet crew was great and the hotel provided us with the complimentary car service to Rodeo Drive. Continental Breakfast was more than basic with very few selections and non gourmet. Chic cozy seating in the lobby breakfast area also seating in the front of the hotel. The Hotel really needs some cleaning up our shower cabin had mold and mildew. Beware of 65 daily CA tourist fee 40 valet parking for rental adds 100 to your daily rate brings the bill to 60 in our case. Price quality evaluation trendy place to stay if that is your priority. place to be seen. Good customer service but not wow or going out of their way. This hotel is really a controversy it will truly depend on your preference and priorities. I think they attempted to meet the cool style with quality substance but they failed to execute on the quality part. Cleanliness remains my top priority when evaluating the hotel and second importance is the quality of breakfast which was less then average. The stay was overall enjoyable and I truly appreciated the vibe and design bordel atmosphere meets rock n roll style.

I only stayed 1 night at the SLS due to time constraints but my stay was definitely worth it. I will not choose another hotel for my future stays in LA. I had originally booked this hotel because I fell in love with the overall aesthetic of the rooms while browsing through photos. Philipe Starck designed the rooms need I say more. The hotel is very trendy starting from the lobby. I do not even know how to describe it. Edgy modern meets avant garde meets art deco sheik. I loved it. Although there were a few minor hiccups during check in influx of people checking in and out so there was a bit of a frenzied vibe and the first room I checked into somehow the room smelled very strongly of pool chlorine the staffs attentiveness and willingness to help remedy all my concerns makes the SLS a top notch hotel. In particular Niko was incredible to me and made my stay go from great to excellent. After voicing my concerns about the lengthy check in time and the first room I was invited to go to the rooftop pool lounge area to enjoy a drink on the house while waiting for my new room to become available. Really nice touch. All rooftop pools in LA are small in size but I felt like this rooftop was actually quite spacious. Private cabanas chaises and a bar area made the space quite lovely. Every single staff member I met whether they were from housekeeping team or the rooftop lounge bar was friendly courteous and made me want to plan my next visit to the SLSI am thoroughly impressed with the dedicated staff and could not love the decor vibes more. I am not the most familiar with LA but I believe the location is pretty prime. Very grateful for Mario driver for the SLS hotel courtesy car. The 3 mile radius free drop off was super convenient given that I used the service to get to The Grove and The Farmers Market as well as Chipotle and a bunch of other places haha. Unique touches like the public play space on each floor was something I had not yet seen at another hotel. Upon exiting the elevator on each guest floor there was a lounge area with couches where you could hang out or play pool on the full sized pool table. I look forward to staying at the SLS again so I can discover other facets of the property such as the spa and dining SLS partners with Michelin starred chef Chef Jose Andres. If you book early and avoid peak travel time LA hotels skyrocket in price during vacation time I was surprised even though I come from NYC I believe that no other hotel can top the SLS in terms of value. I highly recommend giving the SLS a chance.", "offset": [311, 361], "date": "2017-08-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "042e6a90-2390-4e4b-a566-bd5cd98b8660", "sentence": "A bit of style over substance for me.

The room its self once again style verses substance. the bed was in the middle of the room.

Also when I was booking my room I was looking at pictures of all the rooms and the room I was thinking about choosing and some different pictures about them like in one picture it shows a shower and in another it shows a bath tube which is a key thing when coming to my decision because my Lady and I like hot tubs but sometimes are crowded so if the rooms have bath tubes and we enjoy just staying in the room for the night so with the confusion on the pictures that was another thing I called ahead about and was missed informed again. I was told that my room had both a stand up shower a bath tube in which it did n\u2019t so just a bit unhappy about that. I guess confusion happens but a 500 a night they should have a hot tube or jacuzi or something on the premises lord knows at the price they are charging for dinners in the restaurant and the for coffee from room service they can afford to put a hot tub in every room.
