I stayed at the Cincinatian a few years ago and found it rather stuffy. The vibe seemed elite and unwelcoming. But in this recent stay it was the exact opposite. The staff was friendly and accommodating helpful at every turn. The young man at check in was particularly efficient and welcoming. This is a small scale historic hotel with an interior atrium and touches of the grand about it including a central staircase with lovely old marble steps. But the hotel also feels contemporary. Nothing is fussy or overdone. The lobby has a fun friendly bar and the restaurant also in the lobby is upscale but not overly so. Breakfast was good with a small but interesting selection of choices with quality ingredients great coffee and a generous glass of freshly squeezed orange juice the real thing. But the service here was hit or miss. Waiters were nice but seemed rushed and distracted barely stopping at the table then disappearing. I had a dirty spoon and had to wait a long time to get someone \u2019s attention to change it. Watching my oatmeal get cold I finally flagged down a busboy to help. They brought the check well before we finished the meal. This was the one place where I felt the staff was inattentive and the service lacking. I ordered room service twice and the orders were correct each time and arrived quickly. The lasagna was excellent made in the traditional way with b\u00e9chamel a high quality touch. The side salad was nothing special typical mixed greens. I had the sweet potato cr\u00e8me brule for dessert and it was a bit of a strange dish \u2013 smoked vanilla ice cream. I did n\u2019t like it. Sometimes a restaurant tries too hard for novelty. I would have been happier with a well made classic cr\u00e8me brule. We were in a large king room with a private balcony overlooking the lobby. The balcony was an interesting feature. We sat at the table and had wine listening to the sounds of the hotel which on the weekend included live music in the lobby. It added a festive and expansive touch. Inside the room itself which was on a low floor the sounds of the lobby were still audible. It did n\u2019t bother us but if you \u2019re looking for quiet this would not be the room to choose. The room itself was huge with a sitting area a dining area and a four poster king bed. As in most historic hotels the outlet situation was n\u2019t ideal for charging phones and computers. It would be helpful if there were lamps with outlets and USB ports. The television was a weak spot in the room. It was small far away from the bed with only a marginal quality picture. Pretty good channel selection including HBO but the television was not up to today \u2019s standards. Another technology note the phone shortcut buttons for \u201c room service \u201d etc. did n\u2019t work. I ended up dialing O for everything. The book of information about the hotel and its services was sketchy. For example I could n\u2019t find a map of the hotel information about the fitness room where it was what it offered the hours of the bar and restaurant. Nothing about nearby services like drug stores hospitals transportation options etc. This is pretty standard fare in nice hotels. I would definitely recommend that the book be redone with more information and with the information presented more clearly. The bathroom was well outfitted with a wonderful deep oversized tub. The toiletries were Gilchrist Soames nice quality but there was no shower cap. The room had one closet which was very small. It had a small safe which locked with a key and unfortunately was not large enough to store a laptop. There was one bathrobe in the closet which seemed odd. There are generally two bathrobes in a king suite like this. There were no slippers which would have been welcome since the floors were hardwood. There is no refrigerator microwave and notably no coffee maker in the room. There was a small ice bucket. Ice was available two floors up. There was no minibar. On a side table in the dining area there was a modest selection of snacks and small bottles of Fuji water one could buy. The hotel bar was just one floor down so it was easy to get any kind of drink you wanted. There is no store in the hotel but there is a CVS and Walgrens less than a block away. The location of the hotel is perfect for downtown Cincinnati. Everything is just outside the door. We self parked in a garage next to the hotel the charge was 25 for the entire weekend arriving Friday around 4 pm leaving Sunday around 2 pm. The hotel gave us late check out on Sunday which was much appreciated. Overall we enjoyed the Cincinatian and thought it was a good value. The hotel had a very good feeling about it from beginning to end due largely to the first rate professional staff. As always there is room for improvement but none of the shortcomings outweighed the pleasure of the experience.

The front of the hotel is not accessible you have to go through some side entrance. The \u201c lobby \u201d is tight and walled in and it was clear when we arrived there was something going on. We checked in and were handed our vouchers for breakfast we had booked a bed and breakfast package. When we got to the room I looked for a room service menu and found nothing. When we went to leave for dinner I asked the front desk where the bar restaurant and gym were located.

First of all no mention of EXTENSIVE renovations anywhere on their website when we booked in January for a conference. it is now April the website STILL acts like there are no renovations happening and they will not be done with renovations until beginning of June at the earliest according to an employee. So we felt pretty misled by the website which promises many things including a shuttle restaurant room service and gym that the current hotel does not deliver. I am sure the lobby construction will look nice when it is finished. How do I know. Because the only window in my room looked directly out into the construction zone INSIDE THE HOTEL. This is not an outdoor renovation it is right outside your door and window. I had to keep my blinds shut 24 7 because there were seven floors of scaffolding literally right outside my interior window which means that every wrench piece of lumber and drill that was dropped echoed loudly through all seven open stories of the atrium. Oh not to mention there could be a worker outside the window at any time. I slept about 7 hours total in my three night stay. Additionally I was on a floor of the hotel where literally every room around mine was seemingly being renovated. So we are in an old room surrounded by rooms full of construction workers ripping up hardwood floors drilling new light fixtures in and installing new fittings. There was never a quiet moment at any point of the day or night. No cofemaker in the room. The TV cabinet was partially disassembled with wires poking through. No hairdryer. Come on. Our first night there was a loud party in the room next door. AKA one of the empty construction rooms. To their credit they did shut it down when we called to complain. but we should not have had to do that at a so called four star hotel. That they are currently charging 2913 per night 1950 base room rate plus three taxes is RIDICULOUS. I have stayed at airport hotels with better services and rooms. Again I am sure post renovation it will be great. But right now it is terrible. But what is really beyond the pale is the clear lengths they have gone to hide the current state of the hotel. They did not notify us of renovations until three days before our national conference in other words when it was too late for us to escape. If we had cancelled at that point we still would have been charged for the first nights stay per their cancellation policy. But we could not cancel because every conference hotel in the city was already booked as they knew it would be. They gamed us.

I felt bad for the front desk as they tried to juggle lots of phone calls luggage and guests standing there in person. They were understandably cranky as a result. Here were some other issues no particular order1. HE \u2019S GONE There is no longer a bellman inside to help with luggage to your room or to store luggage. I believe the overworked front desk staff are being asked to handle it2. NO BIGIE. The new pub restaurant offers decent bar food but no fine dining or dinner options any longer3. MAJOR ISSUE There was only one person working the entire Pub during a weekday lunch. The waitress was overwhelmed and frowning even with just a few tables. Entrees came out missing key ingredients and some special requests were forgotten. Nothing like the yesteryears of The Palace \u2019s huge and attentive staf4. BUMMER WAY TO END A DAY The bright lighting of the new pub and lack of experienced bartenders means it \u2019s no longer a magnet for the evening business crowd unlike the old Cricket Lounge. This will hurt high margin liquor sales5. NO FLOW. The room refresh is welcomed and still ongoing some furniture on order but the new low flow water restricted shower heads are a major step back for a luxury hotel. The all granite bathrooms are basically the same but now you ca n\u2019t get a proper and quick shower time to take baths6. CLEAN UP THE JOINT Housekeeping is not as thorough as before. perhaps they are overworked too. Hairs in the shower trash left in cans and too few hand towels wash clothes suplies7. JUST WENT MISSING. Turndown service with house made cookies and morning newspapers seem to be gone8. SHE \u2019S GONE TOO.

They need to bring back a good complimentary coffee and tea setup in the lobby. Some good the managers on duty were friendly and tried to make up for issues. The staff quickly sent more towels etc when alerted. Mistakes in the kitchen were fixed with manager help. But managers doing makeup work is not the same as proper staffing.

Called the diamond line and they were super apologetic and horrified about the room but everything was sold out at this hotel and others in town and nothing they could do. Told us to call when our stay was over and they \u2019d make it right which I appreciate but does n\u2019t solve our problem right now. As my husband and I have been loyal diamond members for 10 consecutive years I was beyond shocked that this hotel was so misrepresented online and that the staff did absolutely nothing to make it right. I have literally never written a bad review for Hilton. we are laid back travelers who understand setbacks but this is just not acceptable. Do not stay here whatever you do.", "offset": [472, 571], "date": "2019-08-09", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "43cf967b-7c53-4f7c-8b4b-cc07a1df0fd9", "sentence": "Great location comfortable room but some annoyances. The location was great for our purposes we could walk to many of the places we wanted to go. There was some confusion about our booking the desk implied it was a mixup between themselves and bokingcom but what it meant for us was being disturbed three times in one afternoon by housekeeping when we were trying to rest after sightseeing and before our evening plans. And then we were called down to the desk to sort it out. Once there she was able to find and solve the problem online which I believe could have been done without our being disturbed so many times. It would seem that communication between the reception and housekeeping was very poor.", "offset": [618, 704], "date": "2019-09-02", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "59f23363-fdff-4de4-8aba-dd33333a529c", "sentence": "Overrated. Staying here has probably been my worst Hilton experience. My wife and I spent just one night here and this hotel had a lukewarm reception staff dusty room terrible pillows and below average service. Keep in mind I write this from the expectations of this being a 4star hotel. In addition we were placed on the second floor facing the lobby where we could hear people screaming and making noise throughout the night. I am Hilton gold member so I found it surprising they did not have at least one room facing the city and not the lobby for us. Overall bad experience this hotel should be rated as 2 stars.

Needed to stay in Cincinnati during my cross country bicycle journey and this hotel is where I ended up for 3 nights while waiting out some weather. The lobby looks to be remodled and is very functional. Lots of places to quietly sit and read or whatever. My room was sized for wehat I would expect for a downtown hotel. I liked the setup with many light options and a big comfortable bed. I LOVED the rainfall shower and the soaking tub. My room was quiet for the most part but as others have said there is a large gap at bottom of door that lets in some noise. Not a issue for me though. I only had one quick beer at the bar so ca nt speak much to the food or beverage. My room was serviced properly during my stay and most of the staff went out of thier way to make me feel welcome. I would for sure stay here again.

As the result of a problem on my end my reservation was not made with my Gold number. When I arrived around midnight the desk attendant was not able to put it in. But he did give me some breakfast vouchers. I did not mind that I was given a relatively small room 71. When I got the room and asked for ice I was told that there was not ice on the seventh floor. The desk attend cheerfully offer to move me to room 81 which he said was right across the hall from an ice maker. Unfortunately the ice maker was out of order. So I had to go to the 6th floor for ice. The next morning the woman at the desk was fantastic. She recognized me as a Gold member and offered to move me to an upgraded room 628. That was great. That should have been the end of story but it was not. The side jets in the shower in 628 while not necessary did not work. They only had cold water connected. This one of few times I need to sent cleaning to the hotels laundry vendor but there was no laundry bag in the room 81. Again the desk attend cheerfully offered to pick up the laundry outside my room saving me from taking to the front desk before 80 the next morning. The shirt was not cleaned when it came back. There was a note that they could not get the spots out but it was not just one spot that was left it was everything that was on the shirt when I sent it. To my knowledge the spots were just food from my dinner. I could understand if one spot could not come out but every spot of various foods and just dirt did not come out. I have yet to launder it my self to see if they come out. Finally on Saturday I left the room at 80 am and returned at 230 pm. It had not been made up. Housekeeping did not come until after 50 pm and I had to vacate the room when I should have been getting ready for my evening activities. On other hand on Sunday when I requested a late check out I was given only to 10 pm and housekeeping was right there waiting for me to leave. That is the day they could have waited to 50 pm to clean the room.", "offset": [402, 515], "date": "2020-01-15", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}]}
