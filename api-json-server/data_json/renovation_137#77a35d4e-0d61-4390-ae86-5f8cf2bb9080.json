Attendants were walking around eager to assist and cash you out now too much has changed too fast. No more benefits for the everyday average person only benefits for the Elite spending thousands of dollars. When a business turns against their regular customers and starts labeling everything ELITE there is a huge problem that says we only care for the Elite members. Recently the 3rd floor south parking garage was converted for Elite VIP parking an empty VIP Elite room was built in the back that is always empty and now recently parking arms for VIP elite card swiping is being added to the parking garages and the member staff advises that parking will be free for Elite VIPS and regulars will pay when staying over a certain time frame valet parking use to be free with tips and now is charged. 30 for expedited valet lol. There are no more attendants unles you win big which is rare as the machine payouts are tighter than a monkeys behind. When you remove the somewhat equal balance and give all perks to only the elites spending crazy money you alienate the middle class who makes up 90 of your customers so why renovate your entire casino to label everything and now even parking for the Elites. You make more money off the middle class players combined than you do for the Elites. Every time a new area pops up or a gate goes up its labeled Elite You may as well put up a water fountain for different ethnicities as this is what you are portraying to your customers. I have a 70 yr old client who gambles 60 week between her and her husband they use to be Elite but was down graded. can you believe this. You can not continue to take in so much money and continue to allow for such an unequally balanced experience for gamblers. I have tons of clients that gamble here and they are angry with all the Elite changes and will stop coming. Why do not you fire your management team and revert back to the kind fun place you were 6 years ago where you could actually win some money have some fun and not be damned for not being an Elite member every corner you turn. Its beyond ridiculous. You need to remove your labels and create a balance casino for gamblers. This Tampa casino can not be the drain hole to support your other properties in Vegas a room costs 100 night to promote gambling you guys charge 50night. The greed keeps adding up with each new renovation you can not sustain continuing in this manner. I have personally witnessed these changes myself and you guys have some serious issues to say the least. I heard you hired a Manager from Vegas one would think he would have made your casino a pleasant place to gamble instead he is increasing your revenue at the cost of your customers. Making money is obvious but when you label people and thieve people its unbalanced and people will get tired of it quickly.", "offset": [1120, 1377], "date": "2016-06-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "9e283bbf-5728-41ab-8edf-64b1ed6ce9bd", "sentence": "Fun and Games.

I will not come to gamble at this place if everything is free. We gamble at Vegas and Reno once a month and we lose money most of the time but we get back money as well at least so that we have fun gambling. Not this place. We live in Jacksonville Beach FL and this place is 3 hour drive from us. We decided to check it out. My wife and I went there few weeks ago and spent 4 grand in 2 hours. We could not believe it. We always play same machines thay we play in Vegas and in Reno. The machines were turned down so much that they would not give anything in return not even cherries. We came back and decided to give it another try this week. We thought it was a fluke. This time they gave us a complimentary room for two nights. Guess what. The first night we got there we lost everything again on those same machines. We decided too leave and not even use their comp room yhey gave us because we were so upset and could not stand to stay there a minute longer. We are not new to gambling. We have been doing it for years. We lnow how these machines operate. This place is ripping people off big time. But they will never get a penny from me ever again.

Used to be my happy place seems like the long time players with the elite status are no longer being catered to. So many changes more garages more renovations. We were in North Carolina last year and went to Cherokee Harahs and now we are getting free airfare 3 weeks today and they seem to have a lot of the older machines and much less renovations. Biloxi or Cherokee. Lost a lot of benefits in Tampa and every drawing not been called in well over a year. Lots of people playing on their phones slot machines while they sit at that empty machine taking up space. Does anybody else have a six digit number instead of a 13 14 digits on their Players Club cards just saying. You asked for my opinion and you have about a hundred of our opinions.
