I had always dreamed of staying at Raffles in Singapore and realised this dream for my fiftieth birthday in August. If you like flashy modern this is not for you. It is beautifully colonial and you feel as though you walked back in time as soon as you walk into the lobby. The staff are perfectly lovely greeting you with a genuine smile at all junctures. As with everything in Singapore it is expensive \u00a3 150 for a Singapore Sling but it is worth it especially sitting by the pool on the upper floor a little oasis in built up Singapore and you do get nibbles with your cocktail. Shortly after check in you get to meet your Butler and they can not do enough for you. We were amazingly looked after by Alvaro and Francis fantastic Butlers. Our suite was a palm court suite with two double beds as there was three of us and it was perfectly adequate. I believe the TVs are a standing joke but it was nonetheless quite a shock to see a TV from the early 90s not a flat screen in sight. But we were not there to watch TVThe room was perfectly serviced day and evening and water is replenished complementary. Lovely fluffy towels and lots of toiletries. We went to the Brunch in the Bar and Grill on the Sunday and quite frankly I am not sure if I have ever eaten a better meal or had better service. We had the pink champagne brunch and your glass is never more than a mouthful empty until the end of the lunch stopped being served at 3 pm got there at oneNever have big portions as there is a HUGE choice of delicious food quite possibly the best foie gras I have ever tasted. We got back to our suite and there was a bottle of champagne from the management for my birthday and yes we were still able to drink it. The hop on hop off bus stop is right opposite the hotel entrance and to the back of the hotel is a fantastic area called Chjimes. Loads of bars and restaurants very livelyWe of course visited the world famous Long Bar and if you are a hotel resident you do not have to queue.

Since they pride themselves on attention to detail referring to us by our correct names seems a kind of low bar and something the Mariot Tang Plaza easily managed3. We had a package that included breakfast for two two nights and two rooms. So total of 6 breakfasts correct. They still tried to charge us for breakfast at checkout which was especially ridiculous since on the last day we were leaving the hotel too early for breakfast to be offered. We had consumed 3 adults and 2 kids on the first morning4. The much described Butler program was not useful. You are supposed to call your Butler to answer any questions room service etc. There is a special button to push. Pushed it. No answer. Again. No answer. Called operator. They would get butler to call. Never caled5. The online reservation process is cumbersome and I actually booked the wrong dates which they were kind enough to correct after the mistake was realized.

The room dedicated to the morning breakfast felt cold and unwelcoming and this feeling runs like a thread through the entire hotel the room and the hotel did not give me the impression that it is like a second home or to feel comfortable at any moment. The latch bolt of the bathroom door did not slide completely inside the door so that the door was really difficult to open if closed completely. The water was leaking out from the pipe of the bathtub so that half of the bathroom floor was wet flooded when the bathtub was used.

Hotel has been beautifully refurbished but service is severely lacking in areas. I stayed here for 1 night in a State Room Suite to celebrate my birthday with my husband and 2 year old son. I generally had a pleasant stay and my suite was beautifully decorated spacious and quiet. To start off with the positives we were picked up on time by the Raffles limousine and brought to the hotel where we were greeted by one of the iconic Raffles Hotel Sikh doormen who was warm and welcoming and we also had a pleasant chat with him about his grandchildren before we left. After checking in at the desk in the lobby area our friendly butler Stanley showed us around our suite. A bowl of fruits and chocolates were given to us in our suite together with welcome Singapore Slings. We ordered some room service lunch and the butlers were kind enough to let us have afternoon tea in our suite instead of the Grand Lobby as I did not think my 2 year old son would be able to sit for long down there. We also had room service dinner and then breakfast in the Tiffin Room the next day. We used the hotel pool and gym the pool staff were friendly and attentive and the gym had a decent amount of equipment. The hotel has been beautifully refurbished but has managed to keep it is traditional charm together with modern amenities. On checkout the lady that checked us out was wonderfully polite friendly and hospitable mannerisms that all the staff in Raffles Hotel should strive to achieve. Unfortunately for a hotel that is renowned for it is legendary service this area has been somewhat lacking since it reopened. Firstly before we were due to stay my husband emailed Raffles hotel with some enquiries. However after 3 days without a reply only after forwarding the email again and cing the manager did he finally receive a reply. On arrival in our suite we waited for almost an hour for our one small bag to be brought to our room and had to chase them up about it. My husband had arranged with the butlers for a small birthday cake to be placed in our suite on arrival however this was not the case and he also had to chase them up about this. We requested for a bed rail to be placed on one of the beds so that our toddler would not fall out however Stanley said that they had not attached the bed rail because it is height is level with the top of the mattress and therefore would not prevent falls so he said that during turn down service he would arrange for cushions to be placed on the floor around the bed. If a bed rail makes no difference then I can not understand why they agreed in advance to attach one in the first place. Also no cushions were placed on the floor during turn down service and yet again we had to chase up the butlers about this. When I spoke to the butler on the phone regarding the cushions I also requested for some body lotion as there was none in the room so they said they would bring some when they brought the cushions. After waiting for more than half an hour the cushions turned up but no body lotion. They did not even bother to inform me that they had run out until my toddler accidentally called for a butler to come to the suite using the ipad in the room. Also is not body lotion one of the basic amenities you expect to find in a 5 star hotel room. In regards to turn down service our amenities were restocked and plates from the tables were cleared but they did not even bother to wipe the tables or clear the crumbs which is the least you would expect. The breakfast in the Tiffin Room was nice with a good selection of fruits pastries cold cuts etc. and you get to choose 1 main dish from the menu. I ordered the Crab Cakes as stated on the menu but what I got was one measly little crab cake note the singular. For 75 per adult you would at least expect more than one crab cake and also I would not even touch the raspberries or blueberries in the buffet area as they are not washed and are covered in dirt. A few of the staff in the Tiffin Room were quite friendly and also interacted with our son but I have to say that Raffles Hotel does not seem to be very child friendly because not once were we offered child plates or cutlery to use in the restaurant or during in suite dining. it is the little things that should count in a world class hotel like Raffles. Speaking of in suite dining my husband was given mayonnaise that had already expired and the price of his club sandwich on the bill was more than stated on the menu.

Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Raffles particularly liking the high fit and finish of the newly renovated suites the unique feel of the rambling historic property and the understated luxury. Service however fell short and we were not impressed with the Butler service or the staff at the Grand Lobby. The Raffles has just come off a major renovation and is one of only a handful of true luxury properties in Singapore with just over 100 suites. The low slung 3 story property has been expanded multiple times throughout its history so the layout winds around multiple courtyards and wings. While smaller boutique properties have begun to pop up more in Singapore in recent years the Raffles \u2019 restrained size and historic nature remain unique in the city. We really wanted to love the Raffles however our expectations were high considering the price point of our Bras Basah wing \u201c State Suite \u201d \u2013 around USD10 night including taxes and 10 service fee \u2013 and found that the service just did not live up to the highest standards which we had experienced elsewhere. The service we received from the room butlers at the room orientation and in room check out was proficient but perfunctory. There was no grace or friendliness. For instance at check out the butler did n\u2019t smile once did n\u2019t inquire as to our stay or our onward journey and showed up 8 minutes late from our pre arranged check out time. She did the bare minimum I would expect from a 4star hotel let alone a 5star. The experience felt similar during the in room orientation when we first arrived. The most frustrating service experience though was at the front door. Due to the iconic history of the property the Raffles gets many curious tourists wishing to explore the lobby. As a result the staff is proactive at gently nudging them out of the property but this comes at the expense of providing a warm welcome to resident guests. The front doors to the grand lobby are kept locked and you need your guest key card to open the door. There are no doormen to consistently open the door for you a first for me at a luxury hotel. When you do enter the door staff members will challenge you with questions trying to ascertain whether you are a guest or not \u201c Sir how can I help you \u201d. \u201c Sir are you returning to your room \u201d. My wife literally was asked the impertinent question of \u201c Ma\u2019am where are you going \u201d. upon returning to her own hotel. Luxury hotels should make their guests feel warm and welcome upon their return not feel like they have to justify their presence. It got to the point where my wife and I would hold our key cards in our hands to signal the hotel staff we were guests and to leave us alone when we walked through the grand lobby. We should not have to do that. At the best luxury hotels staff will warmly welcome you back proactively open the door and even provide a welcome back cold beverage or towel. Not only did none of this happen at the Raffles but we felt actively dissuaded from coming through the front lobby. Between the challenges we would receive upon entering the hotel and the perfunctory check out we just did not feel welcome or like valued guests at the Raffles. That said the physical property is lovely and lives up to its reputation. Our suite was of a very high fit and finish and we loved the large size 750 sq feet which gave us ample room to stretch out including a good sized bedroom living room and large bath room with bathtub large shower room toilet and his hers sinks. Amenities were of high very quality and we thought the free non alcoholic mini bar snacks and daily fruit was a nice touch. Tech was also as good as you could get with ipad controls for lights temperature curtains and the ability to use one \u2019s own streaming service on the main TVs. The Bras Basah wing is the noisiest of the wings located above public areas including the Long Bar and shopping. However our suite was well sound proofed so we only heard the noise when walking to from our room on the outdoor walkways. Also while our wing was the least tranquil of the Raffles \u2019 wings my understanding is that the State Suites are about 100 150 sq feet larger than the other non named Suites so it \u2019s a bit of a trade off. If you want the space stay in a State Suite but if you value tranquility go for the smaller Courtyard or Palm Court Suites. In addition to the room we also loved the understated luxury of the public areas of the property. Singapore is a city of modern high rise blocks so to be able to experience a low rise historic property with tranquil courtyards and historic finishes felt special and luxurious. It definitely had some wow factor there. We did n\u2019t use the facilities but we did check out the new roof top pool and gym both of which seemed fine. I wanted to give the Raffles a 55 but our service experience on really important elements of a stay left us frustrated and with a sour memory. I e mailed the hotel and separately provided online feedback to express our dissatisfaction but the management did not respond to either which further compounded our frustration. A simple acknowledgement would have been appreciated.", "offset": [2362, 2448], "date": "2019-12-01 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "a0646760-6385-4adf-a28d-e308f458b4ce", "sentence": "Amazing historic hotel needs some fine tuning. We stayed here with my elderly mother in November and had booked 2 Personality suites requested John Wayne for my mother for 2 nights. We were warmly welcomed on arrival and shown to our suites by our Butler. The rooms have been recently renovated and were very luxurious. Unfortunately the air con in John Wayne was broken and could not be fixed. As there were no other Personality suites available we both chose to change rooms and downgrade to a lower room category the Front desk Manager offered us some small financial compensation each to cover the difference. The room sizes and design were identical however a glass must have been broken in our new suite and not properly cleared up as I stepped on broken glass and cut my foot. The rooms suites themselves are very well appointed and very quiet. We could not hear any external noise at all. However my elderly mother really struggled with the new iPad which controlled the lighting the curtains the air con and the TV. The lights etc had manual switches which helped but she could not manage the tv controls at all and it would have been nice to have a traditional remote control as well. We contacted our Butler to arrange to have our complimentary Singapore Slings at a table in the Long Bar but after an hour of calling him he never came back to us so we asked for them to be delivered to our suite. We also asked to have a table booked at the Bar and Billiard Room restaurant for that evening at 7 pm which he called back and confirmed. Our drinks arrived and were delicious. However when we arrived at the restaurant they had no record of our reservation and all the tables were fully booked. They could have sat us at the high bench surrounding the kitchen but we would have been sat on high stools which my mother could not manage. The Restaurant Manager was fantastic and after a short wait he managed to place us at a table that had just been vacated. We had an amazing meal. The breakfast was good quality and plenty of it. We had to leave at 6 am on our last day and a picnic breakfast was delivered to us. it was huge and really good. We chose to wheel our own cases to reception to check out but could not get into the main lobby as all the doors had been locked and no one heard us knock my husband managed to get around to the front door and the night porter helped us with our bags to our awaiting driver. We checked out without incident. I have yet to check my credit card to confirm we were paid the room change compensation. It was wonderful to stay here and it is a beautiful grand hotel. The staff issues need a little fine tuning but we would come back.", "offset": [2615, 2681], "date": "2019-12-11 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "71fd02ed-cbbd-4218-9a26-f984b01821b7", "sentence": "Expensive.

My husband and I stayed for the weekend. The room was delightful BUT we experienced challenges with actually being able to have dinner at the hotel. First of all we were told that it was fine to dine where ever we like as a reservation would be made for us. Three hours later we were informed we could not eat in one of the restaurants as it was full. So we tried another restaurant in the hotel only to be told that they had no table either. We made a third attempt at the courtyard restaurant and the waiter told us that they were shutting in five minutes so they could not serve us It was 9 pm. Lastly and most bizarely the bar staff refused to serve us anything edible in the Writers Bar apart from dried bananas. Then an hour and a half later we witnessed two men sharing a cheese platter in the very same place. So all in all we tried to have dinner four times at the hotel and were turned away each time. We can fully appreciate that the fine dining restaurant was booked. But the other three experiences were not acceptable.", "offset": [741, 840], "date": "2020-02-27 02:22:47", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
