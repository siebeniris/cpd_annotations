We just returned from a 10 days stay at the Gran Melia and we had a great time. The hotel grounds are beautiful especially the enormous pool that sits very close to the beach. The beach area itself is small and not very functional as there are a lot of rocks and seaweed in the water. It is beautiful to look at and the pool is so nice that it more than made up for it. The Junior Garden Suite is huge more than enough space for 2 adults. The restaurants are over priced and mediocre we ate most of our meals elsewhere and bought groceries for most breakfasts and lunches at the Amigos grocery store down the street and saved a lot of money. The resort is quite close to Fajardo Luquilo and El Yunque and we spent a lot of time hiking and exploring these areas. We took a walk most nights around the grounds of the Gran Melia and it is particularly beautiful and peaceful at night. The hotel staff was very friendly but you could get very different answers to simple questions like Can I have a refrigerator in my room. I actually received 3 answers to this questions yes for 25 a week we do not have or rent refrigerators and we can give you a square electric cooler but it does not keep food very cold.

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Gran Melia for 5 days June 22 27. The resort is beautiful. They have an awesome pool and a little beach to relax on. Our check in did take a while. And also we had to have a 500 hold put on our credit card for our stay. I was not aware that the hold would be so expensive. So before you arrive you should probably call and ask how much the hold will be for your stay. Also the resort does not take cash. Everything has to be paid for with a credit card or they will charge it to your room. We did find out however that at checkout if you would like to pay cash for all of your charges you will be allowed to do so. One restaurant at the resort did take cash. it is called Passion. They had Puerto Rican dishes. It was pretty good. Everything at the resort is really expensive. So if you can it would be a lot cheaper to eat off the resort. They only have 4 restaurants. One is solely for breakfast. The other 3 are for lunch and dinner. They also have a little cafe near the pool where you can eat. Overall we enjoyed our stay. The staff was extremely nice. And they also have golf carts that take you around the resort if you do not want to walk. it is available 24 hours. They also have a free shuttle to take you to 2 restaurants off the the resort. I would highly recommend Richies the view is amazing and the food is good. This resort is kind of secluded so if you do not have a car or transportation your activities are limited. The tours that they offer at the hotel are kind of expensive. To zip line or to take a boat ride is roughly 200 per person. We did go on a tour of Old San Juan which was nice. Our tour guide was Frankie he was very informative and full of energy and personality. he made the tour fun.

I would rather rate this place with no stars zero. We went for an international conference everyone is a business owner so we all know how to have customer service and what it means to run a business. The staff is nice however the management is extremely neglectful of the property and the guests. Most of the people we have spoken to found mold or have a damp musty smell in the room. We personally have found roaches in the bathroom and a hole underneath the tub where they hide. There is a tile missing in our bathroom next to the toilet one light was out in our bathroom. If you shower after 9 am there is no hot water due to the maids using the hot water in the bungalows to clean them. We have found that the staff is responsive and apologetic however the manager himself is rude and unresponsive. Obviously the state of the property is due to his neglectful nature. The food is not edible. The housekeeper told me in confidence that the management has ordered the employees to try to keep the guests on property so they eat at their restaurants. It is extremely hard to escape to the good restaurants that Puerto Rico has on the beach. If you stay here do not waste your time eating at the restaurants. Our first night we ate at the Italian restaurant one of the people in our party could not eat her fillet it was full of gristle typically fillets do not contain gristle. I had a pasta dish that was horrible it was their signature dish. For an Italian restaurant they never offered me Parmesan cheese. For their best and restaurant the food came out out of order they had no idea who ordered what they placed it on the table and left it up to us to move the plates around. We were ordered to wear green plastic bracelets we never figured out why and most of the people have removed them however we were told that it was for security reasons we still have not figured out why we all carry a room key as well as a paper charge card. And they also issue you a towel card per person and you are only allowed one towel per person. We have been attending this international conference for 15 years and this by far is the most disappointing location ever. I would not waste my time at this hotel.

Cold eggs and bacon from a buffet was 25. At every bar the drinks were hastily made and watered down. The entire resort closes down at midnight so do not expect a fun night of drinking and dancing. The pool bar played island salsa music the first day and then changed to some odd sounding pop music that I had to ask them to turn off. We went to the beach which was the size of a postage stamp and when we asked for a Pina colada we were told that was only available at the pool bar. The pool bar was 30 ft away. The staff was uninterested and distracted. I was there over Christmas but that is no excuse. I was there to escape and I was more stressed out by the fact that I had to rent a car and leave the resort to actually enjoy myself. Oh and if you want to park your car that l be an extra 17 a night for the privilegeof parking in an empty parking lot. They also charge and extra 65 a night for a resort fee for a coffee pot and I guess beach towels. We also walked into the room at 3 pm to find them cleaning when we were trying to get showered and changed for dinner. We were asked to not even use the bathroom while they were there.

I brought my family parents in laws and kids 6yrs 4yrs old to the Hyat Grand Reserve in February 2020. It was amazing the adults had a relaxing refreshing experience and our kids never once complained about being bored. The staff went above and beyond bringing a great attitude and level of service 100 of the time from breakfast at the Waters Edge restaurant to the pool beach area to family dinners at one of the great restaurants on the property. The staff at the kids club engaged our kids in numerous activities a treasure hunt water balloon fight hermit crab races on the beach movies in the beautiful conference center space with a legit popcorn machine when you include a massive pool and numerous water sports there is so much to do without leaving the property. In addition I took my son to play tennis on new tennis and pickle ball courts and we played golf at the PGA tour quality golf course. In fact the resort is hosting the PGA tour this weekend and so not only did we play a round but we were able to watch the pros practice for the tournament this wekendThe physical beauty of the property is also worth mentioning. Whether you sit in between the pool and the ocean or take a walk down the beach the property blends the feeling of a newly renovated beach resort with a sense of being in a remote location where you really feel away from the hustle of dense urbanization where many of us live and look to escape. This is not the typical Caribbean beach hotel where you are on a beach with a string of hotels up and down with a sea of beach chairs and people in every direction. This experience is the exact opposite. You feel like you are away but the resort has newly renovated infrastructure to provide everything you need. The GM mentioned that they are adding even more amenities in 2020 with Top Golf a new sports bar concept a new gym and spa etc. etc. So this place is going to be even better when I bring my family back next yearI have stayed at hotels in the Bahamas Mexico Costa Rica and have never experienced value like this. I felt like the experience was in line with hotels where I have paid 8010 per night and the room rate is a fraction of that. The rooms compare favorably to other hotels in Puerto Rico that are charging 80 per night over peak times. I found the food to be reasonably priced based on my previous experience. In summary I highly recommend you go and check it out. No need for a passport. Great weather in a beautiful setting with a staff that operates with a great attitude at a price point that I would put up against ANY resort in the Caribbean. You can not find better value than the Grand Reserve period.

If you want a luxury feel and a relax experience when visiting our beautiful Puerto Rico this hotel is highly recommended. You will receive great service from everyone in the hotel and is only minutes away from the Yunque rainforest beautiful beaches the bio bay at Fajardo and a short ride away from old San Juan and the national airport. Thanks to everyone who made a very special birthday celebration weekend for our family. Thank you Karen for all the planning.", "offset": [1156, 1358], "date": "2020-03-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "26e373f8-e2ab-4585-851d-5d2098b8c266", "sentence": "Best Resort Ever. I am a little hesitant to write such a glowing review because I selfishly want this place to remain a hidden gem. From the moment we got to the resort we were greeted by an extremely friendly staff which lasted until our departure. The rooms were big and clean. The pool was fantastic huge well thought out and the swim up bar and food truck were great touches. The best part of the resort though was the food. The dinner selections were amazing. They have five restaurants and they all have different cuisines. The steak place Prime 787 served my husband and I. the best steaks we have ever eaten. The waiters in every restaurant were very nice and professional. All in all we had a blast. We went on our honeymoon in French Polynesia last year and those so called nicer resorts paled in comparison to this one. We are Puerto Rico converts now.", "offset": [617, 681], "date": "2020-03-11", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "d1fd3b5e-6f06-4ae7-ac94-5407a7200d31", "sentence": "The property is beautiful from the decor to the pool the ocean you name it.
