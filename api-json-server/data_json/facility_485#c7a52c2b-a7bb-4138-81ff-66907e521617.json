Diamond member staying one night. Checked in on ap and secured my favorite type of room corner room at the end of the hall far away from the elevator.

Though I never had been in that hotel I knew that was wrong. And indeed it was. Right by the elevator. Did she think I would not notice that. The room was fine but nothing special. I had access to the club lounge which was on a different floor. You have to use your key to make the elevator go to that floor. I used my digital key but it would never take so each time I went to the lounge I ended riding up and down in the elevator until I could make it work. The lounge itself was odd tables placed in what is the hallway of the 7th floor. Not inviting. Being a Diamond I was offered the chance to eat breakfast in the restaurant. I jumped at that.

We have spent the last 5 years visiting Tucson at Christmas and have stayed in this hotel. It is very close to where my parents live. We had a tough stay last year with issues with noise no hot water and poor daily room cleaning. We did not run into the noise we had the year before and I am happy to say the hotel has a new boiler so no hot water issues either. They are renovating and it is behind schedule so the main restaurant is not open. There is a small area on the other side of the 2nd floor where you can get food. While we were there it was cold in the morning and this eating space was very chilly. Bring your jackets. One night we came in and our room was not made up. I had been telling the front desk that we were leaving for the day when we left each day and that the room was ready to be cleaned. This was disappointing. We had not left the Do not disturb on the door. Someone did quickly make up the room and we received 2 breakfast buffet coupons. So we had breakfast cold. The buffet was ok. Scrambled eggs were so terrible looking I could not eat them. The other food was ok. We did not try the food from breakfast menu but would have if we went back there for breakfast. The new front desk is nice but I feel sorry for the people working there as it also was VERY cold. The front desk personnel are very gracious and helpful. When we checked in we were told our room had been renovated and I was excited to see this but upon entering the room I could not see anything different. I think the matreses were new. There are very few places to plug in electronics and none near the beds. Bathroom is very small and the toilet rocked every time I sat on it. The tub was patched up. So I am not sure what the renovation is doing for the rooms. I will say the hallways look lighteri will probably stay here again next year it is very reasonably priced.

The GM also confirmed that there is no security personnel or any hotel personnel that regularly walk or monitor the exterior hotel property.

The GM gave me his cell phone number which I called several times that went directly to a message stating that the mailbox was not set up so I could not leave a message.
