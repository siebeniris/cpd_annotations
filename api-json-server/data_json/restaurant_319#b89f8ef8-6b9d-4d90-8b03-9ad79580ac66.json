We stayed at the Fairfax in December 2014. We arrived late at night and as soon as the car pulled up in front of the hotel I knew we were in for a treat. We were greeted by the most friendly doorman and this continued at the front desk although I was slightly distracted by the wonderful d\u00e9cor and Christmas decorations. We were lucky enough to have a suite. It was lovely clean spacious and comfortable. The bed was big with the most comfortable mattress and pillows. The bathroom was a bit pokey but always clean. We had a TV in each room and an iPod docking station in the bedroom. Lots of interesting reading material as well such as Vogue magazine and luxury hotel books. We had free Wi Fi as Starwod members but I am not sure of the standard Wi Fi facilities. My only complaint about the room was the noise of a water heater. a constant hum all night which disturbed my sleep slightly but nothing a pair of earplugs could not drown out. There was also a grumpy cleaner who scowled every time I saw her. Breakfast was delicious. As a Starwod member we were entitled to free Continental breakfast which included pastries fresh fruit and porridge. We paid extra for a hot breakfast a couple of times which was delicious. The breakfast staff were always friendly and the views of the embassy across the street always kept me entranced. We also ate at the restaurant one evening and enjoyed the room service. As lovely as the food was we did have a slight blip in that the wrong food was delivered to our room but this problem was quickly rectified. If eating here please please please have the crabcakes. words can not describe how gorgeous they are. And of course I will never forget the freshly made cookies in the lobby every evening. delicious. it is a bit of walk from the hotel to Pennsylvania Ave which was our base for the trip but it is a pleasant walk and DuPont circle is just around the corner with plenty of shops restaurants etc. Overall we had a very pleasant stay at the Fairfax. We met some amazing people from the bellboys to the bar staff and were treated like royalty. One of the bellboys in particular would always come and chat to us and ask us about our day and give recommendations on places to visit. I highly recommend this hotel and hope to be able to return in the future.", "offset": [2017, 2109], "date": "2015-01-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "0f1c0b92-142d-4014-8a74-d839f26b3f8d", "sentence": "Great location near Du Pont Circle lots of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.

POSITIVES \u2013. Good sized quality room not modern but more classic design. We managed to get free wifi which worked very well. Located in a very pleasant area with shops and restaurants. NEGATIVES \u2013. None really but obviously not cheap. SUMMARY \u2013. Overall we were very pleased with our 4 night stay at this hotel and we can recommend it without hesitation. DETAILSWe stayed for 4 nights in March 2016. I booked through Travel Republic for \u00a3 382 excluding breakfast. When you walk into the hotel you feel as if you are in a luxurious environment. John the receptionist was friendly and helpful. A real professional. You feel at home and will be well cared for. Our 4th floor room was a good size comfortable clean and well set out. It had two double seized beds a wardrobe dressing table and a bath shower room with decent fixtures. There was enough hot water and the shower worked well. A good range of luxury towels were was supplied as many toiletries plus extras like an emery board and cotton buds. There was a very good sized flat screen TV with which you could receive a variety of channels. There was a iron and ironing board plus hair dryer fridge and a room safe. Room service was good except for the fact that milk and sugar was not topped up so they gave us a free breakfast worth 48 great. The staff at the hotel were very pleasant professional and helpful \u2013 particularly those on reception. We slept well. The hotel is located about a 5 minute walk from Dupont circle on the red metro line. This area is attractive with shops and plenty of eating and drinking places. The wifi was free as we stayed 4 nights and became a \u2018 valued customer \u2019. It worked well on all of our devices. Free tea coffee is provided in the room. All in all we would give them 9 out of 10 and have no hesitation in recommending a stay with them. They were well worth the extra cost.", "offset": [1211, 1339], "date": "2016-04-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "ef50027a-b273-48ab-b2c1-99e8d54ff615", "sentence": "Nice room and big.
