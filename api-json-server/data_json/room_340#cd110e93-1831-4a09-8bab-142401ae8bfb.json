It certainly is when compared to Europe. Elegant period building and decor is the perfect setting to sit in the foyer and enjoy a Gin and Tonic. Quiet private pool area beautiful lawns and gardens. I recommend a room on the right side of the hotel entrance looking from the street. Nevertheless the rooms are all similar its just the surroundings as you walk to and from and you are on open balconies. Make sure include breakfast in your tariff as it is comprehensive and elegant. At lunch time the Tiffin room where you have breakfast converts to an Indian curry buffet lunch. This is a must even if you are like me and shy away from buffets. This is one buffet you need. The Grill for a dinner one night is also a great experience. it is a misnomer to call it a Grill as that is the historic name for this restaurant but it really is more of a fine dining restaurant.

The location is ideal for that. We stayed in a suite in the Bras Basah wing. Our suite was large around 75 sqm with entry lobby and sitting room. It was peaceful and very well appointed. Residents get a 20 discount on food in the hotel restaurants recommend the pizza at Ah Tengs bakery and of course the Singapore Slings are the best.

The Raffles Hotel is grand and my room was no exception. It felt like a furnished apartment with high ceilings that you lived in not a room that you stayed in. You stepped through the door into a small ante room. To the right was a round breakfast table with an orchid and welcome fruit bowl on it. There was enough space for two chairs and a standard lamp. Botanical prints hung above it. A Nespreso machine was on the counter opposite. To the left was a small couch. I did n\u2019t know what to try first. Giant tied back curtains partitioned the ante room from the huge bedroom with its two post bed chaise long suit stand writers table and giant armoire wardrobe. And beyond there was the timeless green marbled bathroom with two rooms one with basin and Raffles amenities the other with toilet shower giant bath tub and ceramic elephant pot holders. I felt as if I could live in this room aloneYou truly got the impression that time has stood still. The colonial furnishings and nuances unblemished. Egyptian cotton sheets. Tapestry bed seat. Even the wicker table under the colonnade outside my bedroom door was in keeping with the \u201c old world \u201d charm. I would have my coffee there each morning. So peaceful.

Enjoy those moments of being electronic free as you ca n\u2019t fight the condensation until all temperatures equalise. I loved my room and really for a single traveller it was overkill. The king sized bed was enormous soft and all mine. I would never trade it for anything else. The Raffles is much more than a place to have a Singapore Sling it was created in the Long Bar in 1915. It is as one print in the Hall of Fame noted a place patronised by Royalty and Nobility. If you love history and want to follow in the footsteps of great actors writers and leaders this is the place to go. May be that is why it was made a National Monument.

Just came back from a week stay in the new remodeled Raffles and I LOVE IT. Yes it is a much more modern look for the interiors but the basic atmosphere of the hotel is very much intact and it is still as special a place as ever.

The systems of the room including AC curtains TV butler service are run on an ipad system now that was very easy and intuitive. Wish all hotels would go this route. I would say that there were a few minor service issues that were not totally up to snuff but they were not too consequential and I assume they will be dealt with in short order. After all the hotel was in its first two weeks of opening. All I can say is that a historic hotel like Raffles will go through changes in its life. If you look at old photos of the hotel it is not identical to modern day Raffles.

A four night stay in a State Suite in what is lauded as Singapores iconic luxury historic colonial hotel with a price to match was unfortunately far from what the marketing hype would have one believe. A very mixed experience in terms of ambiance and service was experienced leaving one feeling somewhat abused and neglected by the experience. It all felt like the luxury Raffles name has been cheapened by Acor down to something akin to an MGalery Collection hotel. Service experienced was very mixed starting with my travel agent Virtuoso and myself sending independent email inquiries regarding my confirmed reservation only to receive the automatic acknowledgement email but no following email answer. I was greeted on arrival by the resplendent Sikh doorman and ushered into the main lobby. Rather than shown directly to my suite for in suite check in as expected I had phoned ahead and told my suite was ready I was sat at reception where I waited and waited with no refresher towel or welcome drink offered. After some time waiting with nothing happening I got up and wandered about the lobby until a butler finally came up to check me in only to be rudely interrupted by a hotel visitor with the result the butler switched her complete attention to the rude hotel visitor and wandered off with them showing directions leaving me abandoned on the lobby floor. Welcome to Raffles. I walked back to the reception area where another staff member completed check in. Arrangements were made for a butler to arrange a viewing of a Studio Suite the next day but this never happened. A couple of days later I requested at reception for an inspection but was told all were occupied a lie to fob me off as it turned out. and that the hotel was no longer selling Studio Suites and I would not be able to inspect one. Why then are they still being advertised on the Raffles Hotel website. Later that morning my butler showed me a serviced unoccupied Studio Suite. Do not train your reception staff to lie to in resident guests to fob them off it leaves a very sour impresionCheck out experience was worse than check in. Despite all confirmed for a butler to attend my suite from 130pm to check out for an arranged limousine transfer at 145pm I waited until 140pm with no contact from any staff. I phoned to ascertain what is going on and a butler said he had come to my suite. Sick of waiting yet again I commenced carrying my luggage to reception only to meet a butler half way who ushered me down only to be sat down in the public part of the main lobby and wait and wait again for a sheet of paper to be printed. Check out was finally completed a bit before 20pm. Fortunately the limousine was on standby and I was not in a mad rush to catch my flightSuch a shame as excellent service was also experienced. Special mention must be made of butler Claren who was very polished and professional with service provided. Ryan at the Tiffin Room could have been in any number of three star restaurants perfect professional service to be highly commended. I used room service once which was promptly and professionally delivered. Butler Jeremy was efficient at delivering fresh milk for coffee in suite it must be the first hotel I have stayed in where no milk or creamer is provided in room of course preferable would be on call tea or coffee served by butler as used to be the case in Raffles and is still done at The Strand Hotel Rangoon for example. The restoration architects are to be applauded and commended for the magnificent restoration of the Raffles Hotel building beautifully accomplished. Modern technology airconditioning and lighting have been cleverly and seamlesly integrated into the historic suites and bathrooms pleasingly remodeled. Double glazing and soundproofing provide for a generally quiet retreat although the traffic noise can still be heard in the State Suites overlooking Bras Basah Road and thudding footsteps of those in the suite above can still be heard below. Marble and teak walkways gardens and courtyards have all been beautifully restored. However those in charge of interior decoration ought be sentenced to several dozen strokes for the unforgivable destruction of the grande dames elegant colonial soul. Colonial cane furniture on the front portico replaced with dull modern furniture of a style one would expect to find in an Ibis a somewhat gaudy platinum coloured main lobby chandelier clashes badly with the elegant colonial styled brass coloured chandeliers elsewhere in the lobby the beautiful antique persian carpet in the main lobby replaced with a bland modern abstract patterned rug the same completely out of character mass produced contemporary artworks hang in every suite and abstract patterned carpets in the suites instead of persian carpets etcThe elegant colonial Raffles Grill has been replaced with a modern bistro at fine dining prices complete with gaudy laser cut light fitting and with some tables so close you could bump elbows with neigbouring diners. The Tiffin Room has been guted and replaced with an ambiance more akin to an upmarket food court stripped of crisp white table clothes and with tables so small the waiters have difficulty juggling tableware around to fit plates on the table. The elegant haven of the Writers Bar is now a darkly decorated room which feels like ones in some modern Italian basement bar. The final straw would have to be the graffiti street art murals on the gleaming colonial white interior walls of the first and second floors of the main building completely and utterly absurdThe elegant Raffles Hotel monogram cutlery and silverware is retained however a big tick for getting that right. Elegant bedside lamps remain in the suites and there is a comfortable leather upholstered chair. but then a modern styled table and bland gray sofa with thin armrests which looks like it is from a cheap Novotel hotel. Acor are misleading guests by claiming the hotel fully reopened on 1 August. The Bar Billiard Room was still not open and scraping down and repainting of the front wall of the hotel was still taking place at the time of my stay. Scraping painting and use of strong smelling epoxy glue was evident in various locales about the hotel. It all felt like the hotel was very much still in pre opening soft opening mode. The in suite iPad management system is an excellent idea and worked well for operating lights curtains etc except that the night and day curtain buttons are the wrong way round as are the high to low fan speeds for the airconditioning check for yourself Mr Westbeld State Suite 265. The latter resulted in me having a somewhat noisy uncomfortable suite with roaring fan noise and blasting air in the parlour on what was supposedly low fan speed until I discovered the fan speeds had been incorrectly programmed. I used the iPad command to have a butler call me or attend to my suite a couple of times but gave up waiting only to discover it is much quicker to dial 2 on the telephone and speak to a butler directly. if the call does not ring out with no answer as it did on a couple of ocasionsThe Raffles Spa facilities are excellent with helpful staff the sento provides a wonderfully relaxing soak and there are saunas and steam rooms. Pity the ice machine never worked for the whole five days of my stay. Breakfast was excellent in the Tiffin Room apart from the lost colonial ambiance with what may well be the best pastries in all of Asia. Service in the Tiffin Room was excellent particularly from Ryan as previously mentioned. If you are merely seeking a plush modern hotel experience in the shell of an historic building then you might give Raffles a pass subject to service levels experienced.

Prices aside well worth the visit.", "offset": [235, 345], "date": "2019-09-18 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "67415483-982f-4840-ab71-7caeb02e0d4e", "sentence": "Exceptional experience. The service was excellent food was elevated and exceeded expectations the accommodations were beautiful maintaining the traditional feel of the hotel with a modern feel. The iPad in the room was a great tool. The butler service was on point. We also visited the spa which was beautiful and in top shape. The arcade is great just needs some more exciting shops to feel like a destination and the courtyard was n\u2019t open so I \u2019m sure that will make things feel more lively. The pool was well run and the service up there was excellent.", "offset": [328, 494], "date": "2019-09-23 13:40:43", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "51628682-c15c-4a45-9b3d-f28b333e7a4b", "sentence": "Wonderful.

Had three day residence in late November. No dinner available on first night in the Tiffin room. a conference of some type had taken it over for the evening. Too difficult to get a complimentary Singapore Sling in the Long Bar. gave up after waiting too long in a big queue that snake\u00a3 all the way down the stair. No access to the hotel bar off the foyer. asked if we had made a reservation and told bar was full up so no access available. Next day early morning asked for dinner reservation in the Tiffin Room for that evening. Told it was fully booked that night. Tried the BB restaurant but ultra loud piped music scared us off. We gave up trying to dine in the hotel. Found a decent Italian restaurant across the road in the shopping mall and also a good Chinese restaurant there.
