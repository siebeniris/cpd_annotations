My wife and I were really looking forward to our first W experience at a large conference that just ended. Although the facility is very modern and has a high energy feel we did not enjoy our stay. Upon check in we were told that our reservation was not only lost but that our pre approved method of payment would not work. The front desk staff were nice but completely unwilling to fix the problem. In addition there was no manager able to be contacted. It took the front desk staff 2 12 hours to fix our reservation so that we could get in the room. all the while my wife was extremely ill in the lobby. The only apology we ever heard was from the Bellboy who kindly provided some ginger ale for her. It seemed the front desk person was not concerned with us as much as she was concerned about getting in trouble and repeatedly saying I am just trying to cover my own behind. After finally getting into our room we enjoyed the high end touches and the view was great. It took two days to finally speak with a manager after 7 unanswered calls and unanswered messages. The manager never apologized for the inconvenience or took any responsibility what so ever. After a three night stay nearly every interaction we had with the staff seemed like they were put out by our requests and we were a nuisance. This is ironic since their slogan is whatever whenever. I feel like the majority of a hotel stay is more about the service than the facility. After staying in countless hotels over the years the service and staff are what counts. The service we received was mostly unprofessional and unsympathetic.

I will start by saying that this hotel is in an excellent location and has alot of potential be one of Atlantas best properties. They also have a nice bar area on the ground level with wonderful servers bartenders. However that is where the positive remarks concerning my experience this past weekend end. First this hotel has arguably one of the most poorly laid out check in areas I have ever seen. Me nor any of the other guest checking in knew where to wait and had to hear through a poorly placed pillar for the attendant to call us up to check in. Concierge stood across from check in having casual conversation with valet until a front desk agent went over there to break it up and have concierge help with check in as the line was very long I waited almost 45 mins to check in as other guests in front of me had billing issues which i will get to laterNext as I checked in I made sure to note that I would be checking out at 12 noon the following day. Apparently this was not communicated to housekeeping either that or this checkout time was not soon enough for them. At 930 am I was awaken to the sound of my door opening and housekeeping walking in my room to find me in the bed to which she apologized and left without me saying a word. About 30 mins later I received a knock on the door to which I got out of bed to tell the person that I would be checking out at 12 noon I also manually locked the door at this point. Maybe 30 mins later I heard a knock on the door while I was in the restroom coupled with an attempt to open the door which thankfully I had locked at this point. I immediately called the front desk to inform them of housekeepings relentlessly rude behavior and they assured me that it would cease which it did. However upon exiting the room at noon to check out I was momentarily trapped in as housekeeping decided to sit their cart directly in front of my door. I truly do not get what their problem was is that morning. Last I was staying at this property for a job interview. The room was fully paid for my the interviewing company. I was told at check in to provide my card for incidentals only. Sure enough I wake up this morning and see that my personal card was charged for the entire stay. The levels of carelessness and poor customer service at this property was is great. Great enough for me to write my first ever tripadvisor review recommending that no one stay at this property as a first option until they improve their customer service.", "offset": [587, 992], "date": "2016-04-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "5192b4f9-3cdc-4878-a480-f898bae95f11", "sentence": "Worse than terrible.

We had to call at 50 in the afternoon to request housekeeping to show up and refresh the room. Once again front desk had attitude and made this my problem.
