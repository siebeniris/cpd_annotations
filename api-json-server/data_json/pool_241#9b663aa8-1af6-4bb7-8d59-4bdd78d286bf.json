We love the sound of the ocean off the beach and do not care if we can sit near it. so for us it was ok that their beach in front of the hotel was crowded and narrow. There is a sandy area around the pool that sits up on the cliffs so we can feel the breeze and walk on sand and hear the ocean w the option for a salt free splash at the pool perfect. However the layout of the pool is ridiculous. If you are in the sandy non beach front you really can not get to the pool unles you go back to the beach bar. And while the pool is fairly large w multiple levels an infinity ending you can not walk around the pool there are 2 access points in my opinion plus one off the small path from the fitness area. Plus the end of the infinity pool is leaking ALOT which made it easy to use this overflow for washing off your feet. Based on the menu and prices we knew better than to dine here plus the reviews helped sway our decisions but we did grab a few cocktails at the main beach bar mixed experiences here. First time we had very quick attentive service next time I had to ask for the menu and after handing it to me she walked away from the bar. literally. no one there to take my order for 5 minutes. we walked to the second bar by the lobby no one there either. This is at around 130 in the am Needless to say we started bringing our own cocktails to the pool. The manager reception for Honors members was nice and they mgt genuinely cares and takes pride in their property. Karen at the executive floor greeted us by name after one visit always with a smile and compliment and so much happiness she was just awesome. We did receive an upgrade at check. in once I inquired about access to the Honors floor which was a very nice pleasant surprise. Other than the beach bar snafu I did not experience any poor service by reception or hospitality. The grounds are really spread out which would be fine if they had a nicely groomed accessible path but to go between the beaches you view the VERY neglected mini golf and what appeared to be dormitory housing. Paths are not maintained and had weeds as well. Resort was not at all crowded few children so it was nice for relaxing around the pool. Easy drive to the airport we rented a car to avoid the shuttle hassle and taxi cost. See my review of Prins for more on that. Excellent choice We walked to Pirate Bay and Tomatoes for dinner a few times. Great pizza at Tomatoes. The casino at the Hilton is super small and run down also but seemed to stay very busy w the local folks. Tip you will need to goto the fitness room to get your beach towel. Cocktails in the executive lounge are very reasonable. Snacks are limited and some people seem to treat this as their dinner so go early. If you face the ocean the bar below and any bands will be heard in your room. which is nice when you are sitting on your deck but not nice when the bass is thumping at 1 am.", "offset": [1340, 1438], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a2ce8d47-6573-4938-84e8-582406c6ee39", "sentence": "Great place to stay on the beach. We were here during Christmas week. The weather was great but it did rain off and on but it came and went so quickly every time. We had a room on the 5th room close to the executive room. I am not sure if we had a refurbished room because the carpet was dirty and the furniture did not look new but the bed was very comfortable. Close access to the Exec room was nice but it seemed as if there was never enough food for all the people that hang out there. They did give us water each time we requested it. We met Karen who is the best customer service person in any Exec room we ever met. She was the Customer Service with a Smile person you think of when you think Customer Service. She was awesome. Although she was already wearing a TA CS Excellence pin I would have given her another if I had one. About the beach The beach area is small but big enough for all the people that were there. We did get up early to get the chair we wanted. They do go fast so it is a must to go early and place your towel to hold it. I do not think you should place your towel on a chair if you are not going to use it until the afternoon. I have been to many beach hotels and this is actually the first hotel that did not have any beach service. I would have liked to have a bar waiter bring us drinks. it is nice to sit at the beach with a margarita or pina colada. Nope. not here. About the grounds There are three pools. One large pool that has many chairs around it and the infinity pool. the infinity pool did nt have any chairs and is smaller. there is a kidie pool too but we did nt hang out there at all. They have a small boutique if you forget something. there is a coffee and fruit juice bar. Two bars and two restaurants. On Christmas day we had a lovely dinner at AQUA. The service was slow but that is because they have one person serving each table and one person waiting tables. there is not a lot to do at night but there are two restaurants just one block over. Tomatoes and Pirates. Tomatoes is a pizza place and Pirates serves variety. Both places are very good and very affordable. You must wear mosquito repellent if you go. We never got bit until we sat around over there. Overall the hotel is great if you want to lay out and relax somewhere.

The hotel is well located near the city centre. It has two lovely pools and a child pool access to a private beach beach bars and a restaurant. This all you see when you arrive at the lobby. The weather is always good in Cura\u00e7ao so the lobby is in open air between the arrival and the pool area. The room was good a bit obsolete but very clean. We had access to the executive lounge which has a terrace. The lounge is rather small but open from 7 AM till 10 PM and all day soft drinks are available. In the evening snacks are served. The breakfast is served in the restaurant downstairs. It is also open and there are lots of visitors from the outside the local birds. A good advice if you take a table near the polside do not leave your plate unattended or when you come back it is empty. Sometimes it is irritating but on the other side the birds are so beautiful that you do not blame them. The staff is always on the lookout to keep them out the restaurant but it is impossible. So the buffet is well protected. No food is left uncovered. There is also a cook who made you eggs the way you want. So you have always fresh omelettes or cooked eggs. There is also a fitness centre mini golf and the possibility to do water sports. In general the hotel is a bit obsolete and I told the general manager. He knows about it and does everything he can to renovate the hotel. But the most exceptional is the staff. Never I met such a dedicated and entertaining staff. First there is Karen. I call her the \u201c unsatisfied customer manager \u201d. Whenever a problem occurs Karen finds a solution. The room is not what you expected Karen find you one you like. Something is missing in the room Karen made you bring towels soap \u2026. And so on. And the there is a guy called Harol \u201c without a D senor \u201d. He and his team manage the Captain Bligh \u2019s Bar. The first night he talks to you as if you were his best customer. The second night you become his best friend and the day you leave he comes running towards you before you got in the taxi \u201c You will not leave Cura\u00e7ao without my handshake \u201d. We could not go to the room without heaving a drink at the bar and enjoy the company of Harol \u201c without a D senor \u201d and his team such as Anton Rick Lauren and so much more. Cheers mates.

Let me start by saying this review and rating is for the hotel and not a reflection on the beautiful island of Curacao. I \u2019l start with the positives as I always believe this is the best way. The hotel location is good with a nice little cove and only about a 7 \u2013 10 minute ride to downtown Wilemstad which the hotel provides daily free shuttles to the city one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Most of the people at the hotel we interacted with and encountered were very nice and helpful not all but most but I \u2019l get into that later. The ladies in the executive lounge were very nice as well as the people at the front desk. The little beach cove is nice and we snorkeled there almost daily and saw sea turtles eels a squid and about any colored fish you can think of there really is no need take a tour to see cool things. The beds and pillows in our room 425 were comfortable and the A C worked very well. Okay now for the negative comments. The hotel is very old outdated and dirty. ROOMS. The room carpet was so old and dirty that after walking on it for a minute or two your feet were completely black from the soiled carpet. The bathroom had caulk all around the tub and there was mold in the corners and the doors were covered with dirt. All in all it was quite disgusting and the dirtiest hotel that I or my family have ever stayed in. THE BAR STAFF. When we stayed there was only one bar the one off the lobby. There was a tent set up about 25 feet away that they were calling a bar but they could not make mixed drinks because there machine never worked and could only hand out a beer. I would hardly call this tent a bar. The service was poor at best and I want to mention by name specifically Jose who rude on several occasions and we watched him during the week actually kick a chair and make faces at other guest absolutely terrible. This kid should not be working with customers. Another staffer I believe her name was Caralina. Also had no personality seemed to always have an attitude slow service if you could even get her attention. The other staffers at the bar were not as bad but the service was always slow and not very attentive. FOOD \u2013 Not much to say here accept it \u2019s very very overpriced and not good at all. Only one place for breakfast the Aqua restaurant and it \u2019s a terrible little buffet with no options and 25 per person price or 20 per person for some cereal and other cold food. The Cielo restaurant that was the only option for dinner food was also terrible and overpriced. Needless to say we only ate as these places the one time. Your best bet for food is too go next door to either Tomatos 15 buys a pizza big enough for two and Pirate Bay Dutch inspired menu with fun cocktails. Both are much better than anything at the hotel or you can always go into Wilemstad for really good food at reasonable prices if you shop around. POOL \u2013. The pool is also really old and is in need of a face lift as it looks very ugly and pretty much stays dirty all day long. This is due to a poor filtration system and bad landscaping decision to put trees and plants next to the pool that drop things in it all day long. By noon each day the pool is pretty disgusting looking and not very inviting. THE GROUNDS Not much to say here other it also needs a lot of work if its ever going to look nice. All in all I would never stay at this hotel again and I \u2019m a H member with high status. All I can say is that the people that have stayed here and have written good reviews have no idea was a real resort looks like and what good food is. I travel globally for work and my family and I have been traveling to the Caribbean for more than 20 years and this is by FAR the worst hotel we have ever stayed at.

First off. I want to say that this review will include multiple layers of information. We stayed in both Aruba and Curacao. I also will compare this hotel with the Mariot next door as well as give you some info about the beach directly to the other side of the Hilton. And finally a few details about the flights. Also I want to inform you we booked this trip totally last minute at the airport in Aruba. We paid for our ticket in the outdoor kiosk just outside the airport check in at the Aruba airport for a flight leaving an hour and a half later on that same day. Our tickets were only 250 each round trip and there were many flights each day going back and forth between the islands. The main airline for island hopping is called Insel Air. The time in the air was about 20 minutes or less. We got in late at night to Curacao and it was already dark. We did not have a reservation made prior but had found online earlier in the day that the Mariot website showed it had rooms. The Mariot looked like the best choice and since we were Mariot Rewards members we figured it would be easy to walk in to get a room. OopsUnfortunately once we got there a 10 minute taxi ride 30. we found that the hotel was completely booked. So we took at taxi ride next door 15 minimum. we could have walked but it was dark and we did not really know where we were going. Anyway we went next door to the Hilton. The price between the Hilton and the Mariot was not much. Maybe 100 per night. The Hilton is less expensive but by far the Mariot is more updated. That being said the best beach is actually on the opposite side of the Hilton. There are two public beaches flanking the Hilton. The one farther from the Mariot is the best in my opinion. It has a bar and restaurant not affiliated with the Hilton. This beach is much better than the tiny one at the Hilton and the crowded one at the Mariot. So if you are all about the beach like we are then Hilton might be your best choice. Look up Pirate Beach in Curacao. The staff at the Hilton was super friendly. We had scoped out the beaches at the Hilton and noticed that the beach next door looked the best The Pirate Beach. We asked one of the employees how we could get there the easiest route. Swen told us we could walk out the front door of the Hilton and walk about 5 minutes and offered us towels to take with us. He also pointed to the pier in front of the Hilton and said Or you could just jump off that pier and be there in one minuteWe loved that idea since we already were going to go swimming. When Swen saw how serious were were he said Come here I will show you a secret way. He led us a few steps past the bar behind the pool area and to a ledge. He showed if we jumped in here we would only need to swim a few yards to get to the shore of the other beach. He stood at the rocky ledge to make sure we made it in safe. It was one of the most fun parts of our vacation. We jumped right in onto the slimy seaweed covered rocks below into the cool water and swam up to the beach and to a darling authentic looking old bar and grill called Pirate Bay Beach Club. We felt like we found a secret spot. It was so awesome. Later we went over to the Mariot and swam in the beach in front of their hotel all public anyone can go there. We liked the beach at Pirates Bay better. It was more authentic less crowded and bigger. Either way you look at it all these were nice. You could walk 2 minutes on a path in front of the Hilton and Mariot to get to the beach in front of the Mariot. Also the beach area between the two was very private but rocky. My husband and I found a neat little cove where nobody else was near. It was fun but again pretty rocky so you would need to be careful or where swim shoes to walk on the sharp rocks. Anyway in a nutshell the Hilton is a bit run down the carpets were badly stained the building was dated eyesore light blue paint. BUT the staff was great all around from check in to help with dinner reservations in town the bell men were awesome. The restaurant and bar servers were all so smiley and fun. They seemed happy and ready to help with anything you needed. The waitress at the breakfast buffet included in our room rate even made an iced mocha for me. The pools were nice at both hotels. Again Hilton a bit more dated but still lovely and with an amazing view. I would say the biggest difference between the Hilton and The Mariot is the Mariot has more upscale grounds etc. If you want nice dining you would not want either you would want to go into town where there are tons of nice restaurants. We ate dinner at De Gouverneur and it was lovely with a view and delicious food and excellent service. More on that in other reviews. OK. more about Aruba vs Curacao Aruba by far had nicer beaches. Fine sand long wide beaches and no slimy rocks. The best beach we found was at where we stayed in Aruba at the Bucuti Tara on Eagle Beach. AMAZINGHowever the downtown in Aruba really left something to be desired and Curacao had a darling downtown. So Curacao wins for downtown and charm and Aruba wins for beaches if you like to swim or float in the water. If you just want the view and the island relaxed feeling. both are winners. I will post more reviews soon about the 2 islands. The reason I gave this hotel a very good rating was because for the price it was a bargain. And it is located in one of the best spots. If you do not really care about fancy furniture and bathtubs and you do not mind a few stains on the carpet a very slight musty smell in the room probably due to sea salt water the ocean water is very very salty on this island and a little dated paint. this is a great deal. Most hotels on the island appeared that they were in this shape with the exception of a tiny bit nicer the Mariot and we were also told that the Santa Barbara Resort was nice but farther away from town etc. In my opinion it was a bit charming that it was 60s dated and worn out a bit because it just was laid back and casual. The room was clean towels and linens all comfortable and clean mainly just a bit worn out and dated and carpet needs to be replaced. But it did not bother me and I am really picky. I felt it was just part of the island charm. A little funky but happy and funIf you thought this review was helpful please check the button that says so.

We had originally booked a week at this hotel but due to so many negative comments by fellow trip advisors we opted to stay at the nearby Mariot. Being so close we walked to the Hilton grounds to see for ourselves and we were so glad we changed hotels. All the swimming pools were empty except for the kidie pool which was dirty and debris laden. The outdoor spa was simply a hole in the ground. Visually the outside of the hotel needs a facelift but we can not comment on the rooms as we did not go in. When booking our initial reservations nothing was mentioned about the pool closures which to us would have been significant enough to warrant a hotel change. We were planning a second honeymoon and ceremony but our emails were ignored. After several attempts to reach them plus an irate phone call to the Hilton Corporate office we finally got a response but not to our specific questions.

The hotel looks straight out of the 60s with the teal color and dated balconys. We always stay at Hiltons and this was by far the least nice of them all. We get changed in our room and head down to the pool just to find that it is closed. There is a sign that has the dates it will be closed for construction and it is the exact week of our trip. A little heads up would have been nice. Anyway the Hilton had arrangements with the Mariot that we could use their pool so we headed off down the beach for the half mile trek. Wifey was not happy. The bright side of the trip was the executive lounge was right next to our room and Karen and Dawn went above and beyond to make sure that all the guests were happy and taken care of. They are amazing. Hilton is so lucky to have these two. So Curacao is a beautiful place. The people are awesome and it is so easy to get around.

For a special night out try the restaurant at the Mariot next door. Just a short walk but a nice romantic spot for dinner. The beach is great and the snorkeling around the dock is pretty good. The free form pool is great too with an easy walk in entrance for children or older adults. I recommend renting a car when in Curacao but they are sometimes scarce so I would suggest reserving one when you make your travel plans. You do not have to rent for an entire week but three days to tour the island is a must. Try Je Je Car Rental. They dropped off and picked up right at the Hilton. Dive up to West Punt where you can snorkel with turtles right off the beach.

We are Hilton Diamond so we frequently stay at Hilton properties especially when traveling outside the States. We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Curacao. We were on the 5th floor with an ocean view. We stayed at the property for 6 days. This is a smaller hotel that was built in the 1960s and is showing its age in some areas. I am not sure if the local economy is hurting or if tourism is down. The Mariot next door was closed and the general feel of the area outside the hotel property felt run down. The Hilton property itself did not have this same feel. We were impressed with the attentiveness of the staff at the reception desk the cleaning staff and especially the Executive lounge. We were invited to a Hilton Diamond and Gold member reception on the beach where we met many of the managers and staff. They were all super nice and wanted to make sure we were happy with our stay. The food quality at the hotel was good but there seemed to be too few servers for the number of people who were eating in the 2 restaurants both outdoors one is more of a bar and the other is an Italian style. Price for food was typical for hotel. There are not many food choices around the hotel. If you do not have a car the hotel has a shuttle that goes to town twice a day or you can get a cab. Cab ride is 15 one way to town if you walk across the pontoon bridge or 25 if you go all the way into town. We did not eat in town but we talked to several guest who did and they enjoyed the food. The hotel offers a shuttle into town twice a day. We went on the 815am shuttle but the majority of shops do not open until 100am so it was a lot of time wasted waiting waling around the town of Wilemstad.

The hotel is located in the best area of the Island only 10 min drive from Wilemstad and 10 min walking from the famous Coredor which is a great promenade along the sea with a couple of local fishermens eateries where you can taste local fresh fish every day. The Hilton Resort has a great private beach a Bar Restaurant which serves delicous food and also a swimming pool with breathtaking views over the ocean. We had a room with Ocean view and it was incredible. The atmosphere is so chilled that you can spend your days at the beach or at the swimming pool sipping your cocktail and enjoy memorable sunsets. There is another beach only 10 min walking distance called Momba Beach Club which all guests can have access to and it is a fantastic small white sand beach never crowded perfect for privacy and relax. The service of the hotel is great staff always smiling and happy to assist you. We fell in love with both the hotel and the island. We will definitely come back.", "offset": [507, 652], "date": "2018-11-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "0b53bf0a-99ee-4b99-95ae-0cf6f93d1395", "sentence": "Nice location outdated rooms and bad wifi. The hotel is in a nice and quiet location with a private beach. The swimming pool is relaxing and the scenic view looks amazing. There are some very good price quality restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel that are worth checking. Pro tip use the WiFi from the Corner Shop. The rooms feel very outdated you would expect much more from a Hilton brand. The bathrooms clearly need renewal with a very low bath rust and no temperature adjustable water taps. The WiFi keeps on reconecting every 5 10 minutes and there is no good coverage.", "offset": [107, 171], "date": "2018-11-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "6fff7c4f-3eb6-40e3-968c-b8bc01bec526", "sentence": "Finishing up a great vacation. Been to Aruba couple of times and Bonaire. Curacao has some of the prettiest beaches. Stayed at Ritz Carlton in Aruba and this property certainly matches up and exceeded our expectations. It \u2019s beautiful particularly at night. The two pools are great one for adults and one for children. Property just reopened in November 2019 and the staff is very well up to speed on Mariot hospitality. Do n\u2019t miss a cocktail at the bar prior to dinner where a server named Jeaneau is absolutely a stand out amongst the staff. Upon observation he ensured things ran smoothly while making sure all guests were well attended to. We also had some very good food at the bar. A couple of improvements that are needed are room service and the beach. Beach is rather small and rocky more sand should be brought in. There is a lack of umbrellas with lounge chairs on the beach you need to get out there early to grab one. If you \u2019re a pool person no problem at all grab a lounge chair and look out at the beautiful Caribbean water. Room service needs a bit of improvement due to lack of accuracy with our orders and a bit unorganized when called. The first time we called they were unsure of what was on the room service menu and we had to read it to them. If you want to explore the beautiful beaches on this island a rental car is highly suggested. In our opinion this property could easily become a five star resort with suggested improvements.", "offset": [258, 318], "date": "2020-03-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}]}
