I would like to commend the bar staff for their friendliness and the speed of service. On arrival I had discovered that the 3 rooms I had booked for 3 nights were for sea view without balcony which was not very popular. However the reception staff were very helpful and we were able to change 2 of the rooms to with balcony after the first night. For the first night we were in room 120 which as you know looks straight at the exit from the bar to the beach. Because the opening window is at the right hand side it is not even possible to close the curtains for privacy. whilst keeping the window open. I really think the price of this room should be less than the other rooms of this type.

Our experience in the hotel was okay it served the purpose of a stopover travelling from southern France back to England. My comments are as follows. Hotel kerb appeal Poor the building is well past it is best and does not look particularly inviting from the outside. The car park is insufficient for the size of the hotel with guests parking on the highway or down the road in a public car park. Welcome Very good staff on reception looked smart were very professional and attentive. Our Room Okay the hotel is very tired looking internally and this is reflected in the rooms walls were stained around air vents plus lots of other little things that add up to a lot refresh of rooms required. The room was clean beds comfortable facilities ie TV kettle were available. limited supply of tea coffee though. PAPER CUPS. NOT GOOD ENOUGH IN A HOTEL ROOM COSTING \u00a3 150 night. Room was very hot and stuffy and proved difficult to sleep. AIR CONDITIONING required. Restaurant Evening meal Great food below average service long time waiting for attention food. Excellent breakfast good selection of food and plenty available. Bar Looks tired drinks expensive. Pool area Not really that special considering the beach side setting small changing area difficult access. This hotel could be a real jewel in the Novotel Crown. it has a fantastic location by the beach but is in desperate need of a refit to bring it up to current expectations.

A few weeks prior to our planned trip we were notified by bokingscom that the hotel had cancelled our booking as they had now let the room to someone else.
