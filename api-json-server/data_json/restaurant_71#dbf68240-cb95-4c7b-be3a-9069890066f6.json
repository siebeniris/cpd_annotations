I had wanted to go to Little Palm Island for years. I finally had the opportunity to go and was so excited. Upon arrival to the welcome desk you are given a yummy rum punch cocktail and are then taken by boat to the island which is exciting to see the dolphins swimming along as you boat across. When you arrive you are shown to your bungalow and told about the amenities of the island. You will have access to all the fishing and boating you like and it is all included. The rooms are large and nicely decorated. There are Key Deer that reside on the island that are very friendly and make for some neat photos. There really is not any beach other than by the restaurant but they have lovely docks that have loungers facing the water for your relaxation. The food is good but not outstanding. They have a nice wine list though we had some special bottles we brought along that we would open each day and bring over to the fire pit to sit and share making the evenings very romantic and relaxing. The down side of our stay was the spa. The spa is VERY expensive and you would expect for the price would be luxurious. Sadly the attendants do not really put any effort into he services and really just phone in the technique. We were hugely disappointed in the spa services. On our last day We got 2 massages and a scrub and also signed up for the steam room. The massages were awful no effort and felt as if the attendant was just putting lotion on us and the scrub felt the same. When we were ready for the steam room we told the attendant we were ready and they told us they had forgotten to turn it on. They took us over to the steam room which is in another building a diving office and attached to the bathroom it is not very nice. We decided not to wait for it. At that point some one brought all our luggage from our room and dropped it off at the steam room for us to then carry ourselves to the departing boat to the mainland. This made us feel like they were rushing us off and they did not intend to carry our bags out to the boat for us. The whole experience was odd and because this was the last part of our stay with little palm unfortunately this is the memory we were left with and probably would try another resort instead of revisiting.", "offset": [647, 789], "date": "2015-01-11", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b1114622-83e5-4e7c-8222-66b2bc2f9118", "sentence": "Relaxing Getaway beware of. My husband had a conference at the Resort so this was our first time on the island. All the staff were very friendly and very helpful.

The resort is a true relaxing getaway with no cellphone use allowed except in your suites and no TVs in the suites. The bathrooms are bit dated but otherwise the acomodations were great. There is a library that guests can borrow or leave a book behind which was very convenient. I spent much time reading on the beach on the hammocks and by the fire pit areas at sunset. The Chef was amazing. Food was presented beautifully and delicious. My only complaints are that we were not advised we had a Full Meal Plan and exactly what that included so we did not take advantage of the various courses for each meal. We also were not advised about the No See Ums which attacked me during our stay. We had a lot of breeze wind during our stay but the last day on the beach was brutal. I never felt them but had been attacked and noticed all the bites when I got home which was bad.

We loved our two prior dinner excursions to LPI and were looking forward to our first over night stay. Our visit started off with a very nice welcome from the staff and a tour of the island amenities. Our room was very nice except for the air conditioning unit that sounded like a Manhattan construction site every time it turned on and off. Do they know that they actually sell quiet AC condensers. This is supposed to be a tranquil paradise. I had expect that at a cheap hotel motel but not here. Our dinner is where things went very wrong. We arrived early for our reservation to enjoy the sunset and a cocktail and both were wonderful. We sat promptly at our reservation time and then began the endless march toward our entr\u00e9es. During the 2 hour and 30 minute excursion we noticed the following. The room was at least 80 degrees a humid sweaty 80 degrees. There are tables inside and outside causing the staff to constantly open and close the doors. Not a good design. They should find a way to serve outside without walking through the main dining room or invest in an air conditioning system this seems like a recurring theme here that can handle the load. My tuna ceviche was a great start to the dinner. It was full of fresh citrus sweet and tender. The Caesar salad was a flop. It came out at room temp with little or no dressing and very little cheese. One of the worst I have had anywhere. that is where the meal came to a halt. An hour passed from the time we received our salads to the time we received our main course. Our server vanished the ice in our water glasses melted we were adrift with no life line. The restaurant emptied and the staff started to close the restaurant. This is a pet peeve of mine. Yes I know everyone had a long day and they want to end their shift but. you do not start packing up a fine dining establishment when there are guests in the room who have not received their main course. The aforementioned outside door swung open and closed dozens of time while the staff cleared the patio and our room got HOTTER and HOTTER. During this extended wait we had time to notice more flaws. We also noticed that they allow some guests to ignore the dress code. We came appropriately dressed and sat inside to enjoy the comfort of a fine dining establishment. Some people ignored the dress code but we could tell that they were regulars. They had staff hovering and joking with them all night long. In fact it sounded like a family reunion at times. Very loud very hot very SLOW for us. When our dinner finally arrived 2 hours and 15 minutes later we had lost our appetite. Our server reappeared to tell us they would be removing 2 of our dinners from the bill because of the long delay. that is not the point. We do not care about the cost or we would not be here.

I stayed 4 days at this resort with my wife for a couples getaway. In general we loved the location. The grounds were really beautiful and immaculately maintained. The service was exemplary and the food was excellent. It really is a boutique experience. and we enjoyed it very much. Our bungalow was beautiful well appointed in old Florida Island luxury style with bamboo dark hardwoods palm thatch roof etc. There were dozens of extra touches to let you know you are in a boutique environment. For example when you return to your room after dinner each night the white sheer curtains on the 4 poster bed are let down and a message card is left on the bed with a peaceful or philosophical message. A spotlight illuminates the card so it is the first thing you see when you enter in the dark a neat thing to come back to after dinner. Your name is spelled out in wooden letters on the front entry of your bungalow instead of just using the room numbers. Anything we asked for was granted immediately several times with a follow up visit not a call to our room to make sure we got everything we needed. etc etc. We felt there was little that could be asked for that would not be accommodated. We had exceptional dinners here and the service preparation and presentation were all 5 star in our opinion. I rarely use that designation but our experience was worthy. All of these wonderful things being said there are a few know before you go. items1. This is an island and like many there are no seums here. They were worst at dawn and dusk and not problematic for us outside of those hours. If you are not an outdoors person and have no tolerance for insects skip the beach dinner at your request they will set your table right on the beach. That was the only time I really thought they were annoying. 2. If you are a boater they have a small fleet of center console boats for guest use. A quick call to the quarterdeck and they will set one up with ice for the cooler ship to shore radio snorkel fishing gear charts etc. A call to guest services and they boxed up a perfect lunch for us. We spent 2 of our days exploring the beautiful waters and mangrove islands of the keys on our own time with no pressure or concerns. This is pretty unique and I have only experienced it at one other resort. We saw all manner of turtles sharks rays fish birds dolphins etc. during these boating trips. A very cool feature for us. 3. If you are looking to party this is probably not your place. It was very quiet which was lovely as long as that is what you are looking. we are nearing 50 and were amongst the younger people on the island. Not a deterrent just a note4. The place is small. At only 5 acres just about every inch of this island is spoken for. It is beautifully developed but I was aware of the closeness of surrounding bungalows etc. I play guitar and there was almost no place on the island I could play outside of my room without feeling like I might bother other guests. Last but not least yes the place is pricey. it is in the eye of the beholder to determine whether it is worth the cost but I would say if a beautiful environment and exceptional service are higher priority to you than cost you will probably be very happy here. My only complaint They had a welcome bottle of champagne for us in our bungalow upon arrival which was a nice touch. When we pulled it out of the ice however we saw that it was only a 12 sized bottle. This is not a big deal but it seemed out of character for a place where everything else was first class. I had say give your guest a full bottle of champagne or perhaps consider a different welcome gift. The 12 bottle seemed low budget to us.", "offset": [1213, 1321], "date": "2016-04-20", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "9f2382e6-7661-4a98-9c88-0699b4f09958", "sentence": "Peace and Paradise.

Top notch.", "offset": [256, 349], "date": "2017-01-25", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "e2c23225-3caa-4a6b-bf22-29c6b0b22183", "sentence": "The true meaning of paradise. Little Palm Island is truly a piece of paradise. From the moment we showed up for our 3 night honeymoon stay to the very minute we drove off the property it was amazing. If you are looking to completely disconnect but reconect with your significant other this is the place to do it. Put away your cell phones and GET LOST. The staff there are beyond accommodating and pay such close attention to detail. The little surprises the staff and the island have to offer make it that much better. Shout out to Belinda who is the bartender at the bar by the pool. she was by far one our our favorite people to interact with. Captain Wilie who does the snorkeling excursion is also very awesome and we would recommend the snorkel trip as it is unlike anything you will ever see. We visited the spa while we were here which was also very nice. The dining room is a nice place to eat but we actually preferred to dine by the pool or in the privacy of our bungalow. The bungalows are super cute and beachy. Just remember you are not checking into the Ritz so do not expect the decor to be modern. It is a beach bungalow. The outdoor shower was one of our favorite features of the room. This place is so quiet and peaceful and other than at dinner very rarely did we see too many other people which was nice. We were really able to focus on each other be it we were laying in our hammock outside the bungalow taking a dive in the pool or sitting on the dock by the ocean. there is not a bad seat in the house. I highly recommend this place to couples and although pricey it is worth the isolation and romance it has to offer. If you go there for the right reasons you will not be bored even when you seemingly have nothing to do. We will definitely be looking to return for anniversary trips in the future.
