Me as a Hilton Gold Member usually stay in hotels of the Hilton family group and I always had a pleasant stay in any property. That s the reason I chose his hotel. But this time I had a really bad experience. After a long drive from Las Vegas we just wanted to get to our beds as fast as possible. Ok Check In was fast but cold and no one helped us with our luggage or did not even ask us for help. On the way to our room we felt like being in prison. Dirty dishes everywhere in front of the rooms and you just have a bad feeling walking there. From every room you have a window to the hallway and the lobby. The room suite itself was nothing special. Small bathroom and old dark furniture. Two of us had to sleep on the sofa bed which was the most uncomfortable night ever furthermore the bed blankets were used and full of hair. so we asked for new one. Breakfast.

First of all I booked this hotel because it was close to a bar I wanted to visit. I had seen the bar on YouTube and came all the way from Chicago to try it out. This hotel was literally a 5 minute walk from the bar. So I was extremely pleased with that. Second the hotel has a lot of parking. Especially in the front which is ideal because that is usually where the cameras are located. So every time we parked our car it would be very close to the front doors of the hotel. Third the hotel staff was very nice and helpful. I had very many questions and they always greeted me with a smile. Fourth the hotel itself is beautiful. It looks upscale without the upscale prices. We took very many photos in the lobby at the restaurants in the middle fountain sections on the lounge sections. The grandmas were so excited. Fifth the hotel comes with a nice size indoor pool. Sixth the room itself was a very affordable suite. At any other hotels we would have had to pay for two rooms and this was a two room suites just a little bit above other hotel one room prices. I was very pleased. The size was fantastic and the beds were comfortable. The living room in my suites came with a dining table that allowed us to all eat comfortably together and the room came with two easily to use TVs. Yes I said easy to use. I was in Las Vegas at a 4 star hotel and the TVs would not even power on or change channels without pressing firmly on the control and getting it close to the TV. That was not the case here. The TVs were modern and easy to use with many channels. Our room also came with snacks and my kids were jumping of joy. We also took these snacks back with us to the airport. We enjoyed them very much. Seventh the hotel comes with a breakfast buffet that features good hours. Unlike other hotels where the buffet is 630 8 this one was actually 7 10. We enjoyed the breakfast choices very much and the seating area was very large. I can not remember what else we loved about this hotel but I do remembered we enjoyed every bit of it. If we ever go back to Downey we will definitely be staying at this hotel again. ps. They took a 50 deposit from me and released it within 5 business days.", "offset": [1357, 1519], "date": "2017-10-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "dc91af31-e85a-4890-bc40-28dbaf240c78", "sentence": "Location was the perfect spot on a main Street that was easily accessible.

The property is undergoing a renovation to update the hotel we were in an updated room and it was very nice comfortable bed great amenities.

The shower was updated nicely with just a shower which is preferred as most hotels are small areas. The hotel staff also texted us to stay in contact and was helpful with the premium options and not being coke fans. Now for the BAD parking was a nightmare. There is a theater next door and had an event there when we arrived along with people taking the furniture that the hotel was getting rid of taking up more spaces we circled the parking lot for 30 minutes until we finally went in to complain the front desk staff acted like we were causing them an inconvenience.
