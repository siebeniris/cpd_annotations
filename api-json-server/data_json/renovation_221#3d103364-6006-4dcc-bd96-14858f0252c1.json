The St Louis Ritz Carlton is truly one of the finest hotels in St Louis and located in the increasingly vibrant city of Clayton. Friends and I stayed in a lovely spacious and nicely decorated room on the 17th floor and loved having access to the Club Level. Attentive staff and lovely food presentations at the throughout the day made our stay at the Club level feel special. That said we were disappointed to learn that the fitness center was under renovation and equipment was scattered though out guest rooms and the indoor pool and hot tub were closed none of which was noted on the website. We shared our disappointment with Peter at the front desk who kindly guided us to a nearby fitness center and spa as a complimentary amenity. It was a nice facility and we were pleased to have a good alternative to the normal hotel amenities. The main reason that I can not give this property 5 stars is that when we arrived back at the hotel at approximately 11 pm on a Saturday night we were famished. Club level was closed no food available there. We went to the lobby lounge only to learn that food service was finished there as well. We asked if we could order room service and have it delivered to the lounge but were told no. In fact we could not even have it delivered to our room and bring it into the lounge as that was not allowed. The waitress thought that a hotel restaurant may still be serving but was not quite sure and frankly the lobby lounge with it is dance floor and live music is the place you want to be on a Saturday night not in an empty restaurant. Eventually she was able to provide us some nuts and a bowl of goldfish. Disappointing at the STL Ritz Carlton where past experiences at other Ritz properties have resulted in staff being given the discretion to accommodate guest in every way possible within reason.", "offset": [416, 635], "date": "2015-06-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "54cc5b05-a4ab-42f7-b97f-e2a19f8fa2b6", "sentence": "A Bit Disappointing. Went to the Ritz over the Fourth of July. Not sure if they were understaffed or if this is their typical service but it certainly was not the same type of service I know to expect from a Ritz Carlton. We arrived from the airport with no one there to greet us. There were at least two hotel bellmen valets busy greeting another couple. We took our own luggage in and opened the door to the hotel as yet another bellman was coming with a cart to take the luggage of the couple outside making it three people waiting on one couple. We arrived at the front desk and were asked if we needed the bellman to help us upstairs. We said we managed our own luggage through the door we could continue to the club floor. Upon entering our room it was a large suite and somewhat tired in decor. The bench at the end of the bed was stained and a sheer on one of the windows was torn. Everything else seemed clean and in order. There was an old tub in the bathroom with a shower head but no shower curtain. There was a separate shower in the room as well. We went to The Grill with another couple. The smell of cigars from the Cigar Room was evident so we asked to sit away from the main entrance to the restaurant. My chair had a large stain on it and I was not offered a different one. My husband proceeded to order wine but after two attempts they finally brought out the wines that they actually had in that varietal for him to choose from even though they were listed on the wine list. The food was actually delicious and they brought us two free desserts of their choosing. The Club on the 18th floor was quite nice until everyone from every floor was there with their children who were running around and you can imagine the scene. People had their cell phones on and ringing. Perhaps a sign should be posted asking those in the club to silence their phones as you would do in a restaurant. There was not the usual decorum that I expect from the Club. On July 4th I was alone in the club. As everyone around me with families and small children were asked if they needed anything I was ignored. I was never asked how I was or if I needed anything. However to be fair I will say that the food was very good in the club and they replenished it readily. Had sushi in the lounge and when I asked for sake they told me they do not have sake. Finally the server went to the cigar room and got a bottle. She tried to serve it to me at room temperature to which I told her it needed to be iced. She did ice it and was very accommodating. Upon departure I went to the bellmans desk and no one was there. I went to the front desk and asked if I could store my luggage. The front desk person had to leave her post to store my luggage. When I returned it was the same situation with no one at the bellmans desk. Again the person at reception had to leave her post to get my luggage. When I finally got in the car to depart I was not even offered water just a hand with my luggage and a hand out for me to give a tip. Although this hotel is in a nice area I would think that the Ritz would look into refurbishing it and training the staff.", "offset": [3016, 3137], "date": "2015-07-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "f2c567c0-af7a-422a-b3aa-58d94d2862ce", "sentence": "Makes High Marks.

There are several upscale properties to chose from in greater StL. the Ritz is now our favorite. Valet bellmen reception and into our rooms was seamless. Reception asked if we had prefer our club rooms to be connecting and she placed us steps away from the 18th floor lounge. Other than knowing snacks and drinks might be available on the club level I had no idea of the range of this service one which is provided in an ambiance of an English country house sitting room. During a winter stay I could envision not only never leaving the hotel but never leaving the Club level. Our rooms were well provided beds very comfortable bathrooms marble and large. The packaged in room coffee is The Best. I had read an opinion the decor was thought dated. It was not tired and in my opinion stately is always in style. We did not avail ourselves of the hotels restaurants but did have excellent hamburgers delivered to us late one night in the lounge. We had a minor plumbing issue a call to the desk had a maintenance person at our door in under five minutes. A minor billing issue was looked at and resolved by the person I was speaking to.
