Snorkeling at Kanapali beach by the black rock is great. The reef is rich in colored fishes and in no time we were swimming with turtles.

Only two pet peeves for us during the entire stay the photoshot offered as part of the resort fee which in itself is too much at 25 per night was great and Jeremy our photographer did a great job.

I asked for a change to include the breakfast and was told that was not possible. Had also asked for a microwave in the room which the site indicated was available upon request and it was not in the room so I called down and was told there was a charge which was not mentioned on the site. Not a good start. The ocean view room was very nice and I was glad we did not go with a garden view where some of the rooms are very close to the back sidewalk and in the shadows. The room we had was spacious and clean. The lanai comfortable except for the fact that the guard rail has a 4 bar right at eye level so it was annoyingly obstructive of the view. I was disappointed that there was so much resort ground between us and the ocean though. Had asked for an upper floor room because seeing the ocean was important to me but got a 2nd floor and it was not optimal. Mixed review on the beds my roommate loved it. I found it too hard and felt bruised every morning. The sheets however are wonderful. Soft and luxurious. Housekeeping was very friendly but on 4 of the 10 days we were shorted towels coffee or both. And be aware that there is construction going on in one of the buildings where rehabing is going on. The noise was not too bad except on one day we had planned on resting in and the noise forced us indoors. The brunch at the Black Rock Kitchen was great and we dined there one night as well. I can highly recommend the risotto dish I had and my roommate loved her wedge salad. If you want to eat at the Tepan Yaki Dan get reservations. we could not get in at the time we wanted. Evenings however be aware that there are dueling musical venues which made being outdoors in the early evening hours difficult. From our lanai we could hear lovely Hawaiian style singing by a single male with a wonderful voice playing what I assume is a ukulele. It was enchanting and combined perfectly with the setting sun to create a magical and relaxing experience but then a luau started somewhere with their music and rhythms were so loud and the war on the other singers performance destroyed the calm.

I ca nt express how disappointed we were in this hotel considering its star rating and price. My now husband and I spent from 123 127 there to celebrate our wedding held off grounds at a private beach honeymoon AND babymon. We booked this vacation through AAA who used Pleasant Holidays to complete the booking. Overall the staff was not what I ve come to expect with a hotel having such a high star rating. There were a few staff members who were polite but did not go out of their way to be friendly. In all honesty I ve been to what would be considered lesser hotel chains ie Best Western Super 8 Motel 6 where the service was better. Funny enough when we mentioned being there for our wedding honeymoon and babymon to multiple staff members including front desk and concierge other than offering a quick congratulations before continuing on with what they were doing before there was nothing further done on the part of the Sheraton Maui staff. While at a nearby resort the concierge there not only congratulated us but excitedly asked us for details and when he found out that there were a few areas we still needed covered put us in touch with the right people even knowing that we were staying at Sheraton Maui and not his resort and followed up to make sure everything was going through all right after the fact. Although the itinerary from Pleasant Holidays showed that we d been reserved an ocean view room with a king size bed and noted that it was for a honeymoon couple the front desk attendant told us that we were getting a room with 2 full size beds but that he would upgrade us to a king size. We were taken to our room and just started getting settled in when I went into the bathroom and realized that there were tiny ants crawling all over the bathroom countertop at least 10 I stopped counting after that. I went out to the bedroom area to let my husband know and then saw a few more tiny aunts crawling around on one of the bedside tables. Immediately thinking that if they were there they might also be in the bed I called up the front desk and let them know. They were able to find us another ocean view room with a king size bed although the view was nt as nice because we were moved from floor 6 to floor 3 and told us that a bellhop would come get us and take us to our new room. We waited probably 15 minutes at least before hearing a knock on the door. Imagine our surprise when it was nt the bellhop but someone sent to fumigate the room not only that but he started spraying the chemicals right away WHILE WE WERE STILL IN THE ROOM AND IM PREGNANT. He left us there shortly after while we were still waiting for the bellhop. After waiting like 30 minutes since I initially called the front desk about the problem I called them again because the bellhop still was nt there. I explained that a man had come to fumigate and the front desk staff even commented that it should nt have happened while we were in the room and followed up with the bellhop should be there shortly that he had gotten sidetracked at the front desk and was delayed in letting the bellhop know. While on the phone with him the bellhop showed up and we moved to our new room. So much for being able to enjoy the resort that night after that debacle. To top it off we soon discovered that our new room was right near an elevator which we could hear at all times of the day from inside our room. Sheraton Maui outlines what you re supposed to be getting out of paying the required resort fee of 25 day in addition to the room fees that you re initially charged. The tote bag is a cheap bag that just says Sheraton Maui on it purely more promotion for them and blue grey. Not once during the entire stay was there a person at the photography desk who s supposed to be able to provide you with at least a free 4x8 photo more if you want to pay for them. The other people at the Information Desk and Concierge Desk said that the photographer should be there sometime maybe they were just out photographing someone else but we never saw them and never got our free photo which we were hoping to get to commemorate our wedding. In addition there s a 22 day charge for self parking your car. So if you got a rental car between parking and resort fees you re essentially paying 50 additional per day once you get there on top of your initial reservation. Although the cover charge to Black Rock Lounge Night Club is listed in my Pleasant Holiday itinerary as being complimentary as part of the resort fee. when I asked the front desk staff about this they told me there was an additional charge. I feel like the resort fee is a sneaky way to get more money out of customers. It should included in the room rates and be charged up front when the reservation is made. The front desk staff tried to give us this story about they have to do it separately because of the discounting that companies like Expedia get and that Sheraton Maui has to still ensure that they make some money but that s just nonsense. The first morning we went to a breakfast orientation for Pleasant Holidays so we were covered. However the second morning we attempted to make coffee and spent a full hour trying to get a cup coffee before realizing that the 13 full cup still was nt filling up and the coffee pot was broken. This put us behind schedule as we were planning to do the Road to Hana that day. The front desk attendant kind of rudely informed us that if we were planning on going to Hana that we should have left by 6 or 7 am by this point it was about 830am but she told us that we could each get a small coffee from the nearby Starbucks stand and that Sheraton would pay for it which they did for the coffee but not the 1 tip that I felt obligated to give. The room was basic at best with minimal furnishings in desperate need of being modernized especially for what Sheraton Maui is charging generally around 60night. The first room we were in had 2 bedside stands the second one only had 1 next to my husband meaning that I had to plug in my cell phone across the room. The one upside was that the balcony on floor 6 was nt large enough that you could even put chairs on the balcony the front desk staff explained that the closer you got to the top of the building the narrower the balconies were but on floor 3 there were chairs on the balcony. There was a small fridge but no microwave. I have to say that the Hilton Garden Inn that we stayed at in Honolulu immediately following with a lower star rating and much lower price was much nicer by comparison in addition to a fridge it also had a microwave a Keurig machine with multiple types of coffees and teas to choose from a much larger and newer tv and modern amenities such as a wonderful new shower and USB ports. As for shower and coffee amenities they were higher quality and refilled daily at the Hilton not so at Sheraton Maui. In addition staying at a lesser hotel like the Best Western you get a free hot breakfast buffet every morning you re there Sheraton Maui charges 30 per breakfast buffet and from what I saw it was nt that great. Finally my husband used the in room iron to get the wrinkles out of his white shirt for our wedding and it ended up leaving marks on the shirt which he had to stop ironing so it would nt completely ruin it. I wo nt deny that the ocean view from the room was beautiful and the grounds were very well kept. The disappointing thing for us was that with the wedding planning we were nt able to enjoy much of the resort amenities especially since the pool closed at 8 pm and the hot tub closed at 10 pm. It looked like Sheraton Maui used to be a very nice resort at one point but is now outdated and in need of modernization especially in comparison to other similarly rated resorts in the area. At checkout the front desk attendant was accommodating and friendly although it was nt until I requested something be done about the resort fees charged due to us losing so much time dealing with little things we should nt have had to at a 4star hotel that she removed two days of fees. It was also disappointing that there was no recognition of us being married on honeymoon or on babymon I mean this was a once in a lifetime trip and they were made aware of that by Pleasant Holidays. Nothing done to make the experience even more special which was very odd to me. I m very well traveled and have been all over the world staying in all different types of accommodations from 5stars to ones that do nt even mention ratings as well as on cruise ships with better customer service. This hotel experience has been the biggest disappointment I ve ever had. I am definitely going to go back to AAA and Pleasant Holidays to let them know about this experience so that they do nt continue to recommend the Sheraton Maui to others. I will also make sure to share with anyone I know planning a trip to Maui. It s also disheartening that while I see Hotel Staff is responding to the bad reviews they re just apologizing for the bad experience and telling people that they hope they l come back again instead of trying to do right by them. When I contacted Sheraton Maui and Starwod Hotels Resorts the overseeing company their response was a canned we re sorry that this was your experience we try to do better than that we hope that you l come back again. oh except they agreed that no one should have came into our room to fumigate with us still in there. But that was it. Not trying to right a wrong or compensate us not worth the 60night that they charge to stay there.", "offset": [9163, 9379], "date": "2018-03-22", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "7b37fdc3-2c91-4ae7-b91b-2758fe6668e4", "sentence": "Beautiful resort.

So we walk up to the front desk have our names and said we were supposed to be in the 60 building the girl looks at me funny and says No we have you booked in our Ocean Front and that would be an upgrade to an Deluxe Ocean Front room. and I said Correct our travel agent called over and confirmed the upgrade and j called over and pre paid the upgrade fee and resort fee. The girl searched and searched in her computer and was not seeing it. I walked out to our rental car and got the receipt that had been emailed to me after my call to pre pay the fees. I gave it to her and said she could make a copy of it if she wanted. She went back made a copy and came back out to look in her computer again. She then finds the reservation change but still trying to say we owed the fees and I once again explained that that receipt she just made a copy of showed I had paid the fees in advance. She looked through the computer again and says Oh I see it now they just did not get it on the account correctly. I will fix it so you will not have a problem checking out. Then she had to search to find a room for us. Finally got our room and the Bell person led us up to the parking area for the bldg we would be in and brought our bags to the room for us. We got settled into the room and decided to get something for supper. RESTAURANTSIt was raining and my wife suggested we get room service and I mixed that idea because I had done my research and the restaurants sounded pretty good. We get down to the area the restaurants are in and we passed a podium that had a small sign that said HOSTESS but no one in sight. We walk down to the first restaurant and did not see a place to check in we walk back out and now there is a man standing at the podium with the sign that says HOSTESS we politely ask about the restaurant we had just walked back from and he said that it was by reservation only. My wife inquired as to what type of food they served which was sea food and my wife said no thank you to his question if we wanted to make a reservation. So we turn to walk up to the next restaurant in plain view of the HOSTESS and he does not say a word. We go to the next restaurant with the same finding and ask an employee what type of food they serve and he points to a bench that people would normally stop to take a rest on with menus strewn about on it and says we have menus there. We walk back down still nothing said by the HOSTESS look at the menu and decide it looks good. The bench is straight over from the podium so I turn walk over to the HOSTESS and ask where we check in for the other restaurant. With a VERY smug look on his face and a VERY condescending tone of voice say I know our sign is rather small but and points at the HOSTESS sign. By that time I am very frustrated and I tell him you are being quite the smartass and I do not appreciate it. His only reply is a very smug laugh. My wife started walking away not believing it had come to this and I go to find out what she wants to do when he calls over to us and asks if we want a reservation and a name he can put on it. We took the reservation and ate. More drama about that but partially because of being frustrated by the HOSTESS. We decided then and there we would not eat at the hotel restaurants the rest of the time we are there. CHECK OUT. The morning of our check out we had a mid morning flight so went down around 7 am to check out. The girl at the front desk asks how she can help me and I say our room number and that we are checking out. She goes into the computer does a couple of things and says that will be 300 and I immediately ask what we were being charged for which she starts telling me the upgrade fee the resort fee and parking. I tell her I will be right back walk to the rental car return with the same receipt that had been emailed to me when I called and paid the upgrade and resort fees. She goes in the computer and says she does not see it. I tell her the girl that checked us in had made a copy of the receipt and said she was fixing it in the computer so we would not have any issues. She looks in the computer again and says she found it and will correct it. Prints out a receipt for the parking fee I sign it and I am gone. Best part of our stay housekeeping and Bell service. Our room was great but because of all the rain not the view we had hoped for. So to say our stay was a lackluster one would be highly overrated.", "offset": [1482, 1551], "date": "2018-04-22", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 22, "uid": "54ae0719-0f6e-47c5-96f3-565e01a3a9be", "sentence": "Sheraton Maui Beach Resort was one of the worst experiences that we have ever had with a hotel stay. We had changed our room classification well in advance and I had pre paid the resort fee and the upgrade fee for our 4 night stay 4718 4118. The only thing we had that needed to be paid was the daily parking fee. Upon checking in they still showed us in the previous room classification instead of the upgraded room. The girl at the front desk could not find anything in the computer and when she did she was trying to tell me that we needed to pay the upgrade and resort fees until I went out to our car and got the receipt that had been emailed to me when I called in and pre paid the fees. Then because of their error in not updating the reservation she had to search for a room and finally found one after a few minutes. Not a real pleasurable start to a stay. Next after checking in getting settled into our room and relaxing a bit we decided to go down and try one of the restaurants onsite but on the way down my wife had suggested just getting room service but I said I had checked online and the restaurants looked really nice. So we continued on As we arrived in the area of the restaurants we first looked in one and saw no where to check in went back out and saw a man standing at a podium with a small sign that said Hostess with no other signage stating this is where you check in for the restaurants. We asked about the one we had looked in and was told it was reservation only but my wife did not want the kind of food they served and was not told that we had to check. in there for the other restaurant as well. We walked away from there thinking it was just the check in for the other restaurant towards the other restaurant in plain sight of the gentleman at the Hostess podium. We walked up the ramp and started looking for the check in for that restaurant. Not finding anything we stopped one of the employees and he told us there were menus down below and when I did not immediately see it he pointed to a bench with menus strewn over it. We walked down looked the menu over quickly and being right across from the man at the Hostess podium where we needed to check. in for the 2nd restaurant at which time I received a very smartalic remark of I know our sign is rather small as he pointed to the sign at his podium that said only HOSTESS. At which time I told him he was being quite a smartass and I did not appreciate that which his response was just to laugh. We finally did get seated in the 2nd restaurant but let me state there was no other signs ANYWHERE. stating to check in at the HOSTESS podium. We decided then and there that we would not be eating at the restaurants the rest of our stay. The Bell service and the room service was the best part of the service personnel at this hotel. The one issue with the housekeeping staff was trying to figure out their schedule because they came at a different time each day. Other than that they did a very good job of keeping the room clean. The location was fantastic but with the weather being extremely rainy you would expect the staff to be falling over themselves to make every part of the customers stay as pleasurable as possible. When the rain did give way to partly cloudy skies the view from our room was fantastic with the ocean Molokai and Lanai as well as a few smaller islands visible from our balcony. Last but not least CHECK OUT. On the morning of our check out I went to the front desk expecting to be billed for the parking fees. I hand the lady our key cards and towel cards and she informs me that we owe 300 and I ask for what because we should only be being charged for the parking. She starts quoting the resort fee the upgrade fee and I again had to return to our car get the receipt emailed to me when I PRE PAID those fees. The lady still had trouble finding g it in the computer but finally did find it and removed those charges. So to say our experience was lackluster would truly be an overstatement.", "offset": [2630, 2724], "date": "2018-04-28", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 23, "uid": "e1f5acab-88a4-4945-a24a-08158606123d", "sentence": "Had the time of my lifenicest beachgreat food and service.", "offset": [0, 58], "date": "2018-04-28", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 24, "uid": "171bac48-8714-4e4d-8c9e-4cf7304c0071", "sentence": "The reception service was not very helpful or keen to close a booking over the phone.

It must have been very pleasant for the people sleeping and laying out. not shocked that food and drinks are overpriced but the service was meh. I felt like I had to walk 10 minutes across the hotel to get a drink because they had no one walking around taking orders. It \u2019s time for the Sheraton to get a face lift.

The front desk manager took this seriously sent hotel staff to check my room thoroughly and they called professional pest control company to check our room again the next day to make sure it was clean it was clean indeed. Once we realized the rash was from jelly fish sting they called security guard and he came in immediately with vinegar spray bottle. They also provided nearby urgent care doctor locations and recommended the one by the Times Market due to its co localization with a pharmacy.

The concessionaire that does that and hands out towels was very friendly and helpful each day we were at the beach. Right next to the pool the staff set up soccer corn hole lawn bowling etc every day which our kid loved to be able to go and play as well as meet other kids. The beach at Black Rock has eroded a bit from winter storms so right I front of the hotel there is n\u2019t a ton of room to sit on the sand but take a 5 min stroll south and the beach starts to widen and you can easily find a spot to spread out on the beach. The best part about this hotel is there is world class snorkeling right off the beach. We snorkeled it twice. Tip the earlier in the day you go the calmer the water tends to be. There is a concessionaire right there who rents equipment. The suite we were upgraded to was recently renovated and was a very large one bedroom suite. It was on the top floor. The balcony was big and had a beautiful view. Pic belowWe did the Luau one night. My husband and son enjoyed it. Just know it is out on the lawn and in the direct sun so it can be warm until the sunsets go down. If you are looking for 5 star luxury this is n\u2019t that resort. But it is a very solid comfortable and well staffed hotel in Hawaii. And with all the elite benefits and booking on points and using the upgrade certificates it was very reasonably way to do the vacation.", "offset": [1807, 1899], "date": "2019-04-08", "cpt": "5", "category": "general"}, {"id": 48, "uid": "0bff9d12-0867-468f-ae3a-6fd4da2bbe51", "sentence": "Ideal hotel to stay.", "offset": [0, 20], "date": "2019-04-29", "cpt": "5", "category": "general"}, {"id": 49, "uid": "686da66a-95c7-4682-8360-07df5b7ea76c", "sentence": "Beautiful Resort.

The grounds were well manicured with lots of paths and beautiful pools. I especially liked the lagoon pool with a float to just meander. Breakfast was very good.

So our check in executive graciously offered to arrange for champagne in the room on 3rd Dec We were disappointed when there was n\u2019t anything arranged despite they offered. This made me scramble and arrange in last minute for our midnight celebrations. Secondly we asked for couple of wine glasses to the room service and they conveniently forgot to get them even after waiting for 2 hours.

Second time staying here on points. Last year we received free parking and buffet breakfast which is why we chose to stay here again. This year although we received free buffet breakfast we were told starting in February it would only be continental breakfast. There was no mention that they now charge for parking until we asked when we got the bill upon checkout. We are titanium elite and were told it \u2019s only for ambassador status. We stayed 100 nights but did n\u2019t make the 200 minimum. Not sure if this is a hotel policy or Bonvoy policy but 25 on top of the resort fee is excessive especially when there is n\u2019t enough parking spots at times and people end parking on the grass or cross hatched spots. Mariot Bonvoy is making it hard in general to stay loyal. The view from our room in building 6 was amazing. The room however needed a deep cleaning. The carpet and pillows were disgusting. The carpet was worn and stained and the pillows were flat and discolored. We asked for new pillows but they were just as bad so we ended up going to Ross and buying new ones so we could get a comfortable night sleep. The mattresses were very stiff and uncomfortable. Housekeeping does NOT replace the glasses with new ones but instead wipes the used ones and puts them back. This I know 100. YuckThe hotel has changed since last year.

Sheraton has made a number of changes in past year adding a lounge and bar at entrance it opens up a a great view of BlackRock and Ocean. It \u2019s new so service slow even by Maui standards and a bit confused. Good for a quick snack or early morning coffee pastry. Main dinner restaurant closed and moved to casual food by the pool. Kind of confusing from pool bar to eating area. Stayed in ocean view room that gave very good views of ocean. Beach and BlackRock beautiful many guests from other hotels come to this area so it gets a bit crowded. This was our fifth stay in last five years and will be back next February. Close walking distance to Whalers village and shopping. Boardwalk area can be a bit crowded at times but great ocean view. Pool area crowded and if you want a lounge get there early as people drop off towels to safe lounges for latera very bad practice. If your not there by 9 am good luck. Food and drink service was very good most of the time. A big thank you to Liza our server. She was very good. We are usually offered free buffet breakfast or parking this year the upgrade was for continental breakfast with a 10 charge to upgrade to buffet breakfast seemed kinda cheapish for a Bonvoy member. Again it is a great location with great views.", "offset": [223, 277], "date": "2020-03-21", "cpt": "5", "category": "general"}]}
