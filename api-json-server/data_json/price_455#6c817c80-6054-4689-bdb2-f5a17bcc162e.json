Next the not so good things We did not get the usual Hilton exuberant friendly welcome upon arivalOur room 637 on the Hilton Honors floor had not been properly cleaned the desk had a layer of sticky dirt which we tried to clean off with a towel the windows were coated with an opaque film that would not rub off we asked Joan the housekeeper to try to clean them she tried but then apologized that it was impossible to removethe cloudiness from the glass the balcony rails had peeling paint and were coveredwith bird droppings the cement floor of the balcony had not been finished was rough with pieces of concrete and dirt and the table was covered in dirt. The bathroom was tiny and had only two hand towels two washcloths and two bath towels. Four of each is the norm for a couple staying in a room. The sheer curtains had a big rip in them. The little table for the little coffee maker was totally useless. No mini fridge. Traffic and train noise when the balcony door was open. Dining in the Regatta Grille was unrealistically expensive and a little depressing. We were the only customers it felt dark and unwelcoming. The quality of the food was definitely not up to the price we paid. We skipped the expensive breakfast and instead had coffee at a nearby service area on Interstate 90We will not be staying at any DoubleTree properties again.", "offset": [1448, 1605], "date": "2015-05-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "da5a7e91-fe7d-4006-803d-065d1113c549", "sentence": "Nice updated room but no free breakfast.

I never would have paid full price for this hotel but it was good for points. The rooms were large and clean and we got a nice view of the courtyard and pool. The Wi Fi was a disaster though the local tech was very helpful in getting it to work. I just do not understand why hilton has its bizarre fetish about supplying good free WiFi. I do not know why the hilton uses such tiny amenity bottles more plastic than product seems like a waste and I had always welcome a makeup mirror. Ok but most important DO NOT EAT at the restaurant. Bring your own or eat before you check in but the restaurant is a shocking ripof. We got charged 80 for a couple glasses of wine a club sandwich and Caesar salad WHAT. I understand breakfast is over 17. This is not the Ritz it is a basic roadside motel. Management needs to seriously rethink that restaurant.
