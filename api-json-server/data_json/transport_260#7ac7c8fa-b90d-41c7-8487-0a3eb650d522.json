My wife and I recently stayed at Le Blanc for our sixth visit and the resort is without a doubt world class in every respect. My wife and I and members of our families have stayed at or visited all of the Palace Resorts Le Blanc is the flagship resort of Palace Resorts have stayed at other resorts in the Cancun Mayan Riviera area and between our families have stayed at some of the best resorts and hotels in the Caribbean and the world. None have been better than Le Blanc. Even my parents who we took to Le Blanc for their 50th Wedding Anniversary several years ago and who had widely traveled stated that they have never been to a finer resort and on a better vacation during their lives. My brother in law who has also traveled extensively has declared Le Blanc as his absolute favorite. And the resort has repeatedly been recognized as one of the top resorts in the world and here are just a few of the reasons as to why. Check. In When you arrive at Le Blanc you are genuinely welcomed with open arms. Guests receive a cool towel a wonderful fruit drink and the ladies receive a flower. Check in is made very easy special and private where each guest is escorted to a separate desk where the check in process is completed. Mario the Front Desk Manager and his staff provide every guest the best accommodation possible and assist with any special requests guests may have. He and his staff are top notch all the way. Guests There is a nice mix of guests all the way from honeymooners to more elderly guests. It is a great place for all age groups minimum age 18. Ambiance. This resort is \u201c very relaxing \u201d more so than many of the other resorts in Cancun with a fantastic ambiance if you like it a bit more quiet my wife loves the more quiet ambiance and so do I. During the day a wide variety of planned activities are available at the activities pool and the beach ie water aerobics beach volleyball etc. Special events such as wine tastings tequila tastings and Mexican Coffee making demonstrations occur in the lobby area later in the afternoons. While there is lively nightly entertainment in their 3rd floor lounge or by the pool you will find soloists playing primarily more classical soft music in the evening in the lobby main lounge area. At night clubs are nearby for those guests that would like more of a \u201c party dance type \u201d atmosphere. Rooms and Suites. Le Blanc offers a variety of room types from their Royal Deluxe Suites standard suites to Honeymoon Suites all oceanfront to Junior Suites some with balconies that are larger than their more standard French balconies to expansive Governor \u2019s suites to a Presidential Suite. All rooms and suites have a large two person Jacuzi a small in room bar and either king or double beds. Many of the Royal Deluxe Suites face the Bayside which offers spectacular sunsets please see the Le Blanc website for additional details on room types. Concierge Butlers Fernando Royas Chief Concierge and his group of butlers are the best there is. It does not matter what special request a guest may have or how impossible the request may seem. They make it happen. From serving Presidents to royalty from all over the world to just plain regular guests like us unpacking our bags preparing our Jacuzi or making spa appointments nothing is impossible. I just want to add a special thank you here to Fernando and Tomas one of the butlers. My wife is a football \u201c fanatic \u201d for the University of South Carolina. Well we arrived on Saturday morning during football season to put this in perspective I have to plan our vacations around the football schedule. There was going to be an away game this day. Upon arrival on a Saturday I asked Tomas if there is a possibility that the game would be on TV somewhere in Cancun on the SEC Network. Well about ten minutes later Thomas found me and said that he found a restaurant bar where they can show the game arranged for it to be shown reserved a special table for us right in front of the TV and arranged transportation to the restaurant. Thank you both. Simply exemplary in every respect. And this is just one example of many. And we also received the same level of service from the butlers that were assigned to our floors. Thank you Joel and Antonio. Pools. There are three pools. The main pool area ocean side includes a large infinity pool with a swim up bar and deck with lots of lounges and umbrellas. This area also includes a large hot tub located close by. The moon pool on the bay side is the pool where the activities take place. These include in pool spinning classes water polo morning aerobics and other activities. This pool also has a swim up bar. In addition a smaller pool is located on the third floor ocean side. The nice thing about having a pool on both sides of the building is because when the shade begins to cover the ocean side pools late in the afternoon guests can move to the moon pool at the bayside of the building and continue to get afternoon early evening sun. Laura the Pool Manager and her staff are wonderful in providing every guest very personal attention from moving umbrellas so that guest have shade if so desired to making sure that the ice buckets by the lounges have enough ice in them to chill the water bottles to providing towels and books and magazines. Laura and her staff are constantly checking to make sure that every guest receives very special treatment first class all the way. many kudos to Laura. At the swim up bars it does n\u2019t take long for the bartenders to remember your preferred drinks and many times start working on them while you are still making your way towards the bar. Exemplary first class service. Not at the swim up bar. No problem. Servers at the pool and the beach make frequent rounds to insure that you are never left wanting anything from your favorite drink to your order for lunch. No matter where we were in the pool areas Lucinda our primary server always found us to refresh our drinks or take our drink or lunch order and to make sure that we had everything we needed. She without question helped make our stay at Le Blanc fabulous. The beach Beach. The beach in front of Le Blanc is wide and great for lounging on the beach andor swimming in the ocean. You can also walk quite a long way out into the ocean as the depth increases gradually. Perfect for just \u201c bobbing around in the waves \u201d surf conditions permitting. There are beach cabanas that can be rented during the day and serve to accommodate couples for the romantic dinners on the beach at night. There is also a beach bar. Restaurants. The menu selections food food presentation and service were all spectacular including the breakfast and lunch buffets. Our favorite restaurants for dinner were the French Restaurant and the International Restaurant \u2014 simply amazing in every respect. Try the special seven course dinner at the French Restaurant and the delicious seafood and steaks at the International Restaurant. But those were just our favorites. The Italian Oriental and the Pizza restaurant on the third floor are all excellent. The restaurant menus are extensive as well as the room service menus. The wine list offers many options. But it is not just the menu choices and quality of food that is outstanding. It would not be fantastic without the professional friendly and wonderful demeanor of the managers and staff that make all this happen. Employees such as Marco in the International Restaurant a wonderful manager who always go above and beyond to insure world class service for his guests. Also Aquilino the head chef at the International Restaurant who surprised his guest with different special morning pastries personally delivered every morning and will happily prepare whatever you want absolutely loved my special authentic Mexican breakfasts he prepared for me in the mornings. The selection and preparation of food by him and his staff is beyond compare. He insures that all the food is fresh and replenished and prepared equal to the finest restaurants in my country. And very special managers supervisors and waiters in all the restaurants who are totally professional with such wonderful attitudes and great smiles each and every day. I specifically want to mention Mayra Raul Pablo Jorge Rulo Denaro Armandao and Ivan who always make us feel so very special. And Mario whom we have known for years and who is so customer oriented and knowledgeable that he has been chosen to help train others congratulations Mario. I could go on and on but everyone in all the restaurants was truly amazing. Interested in wine. We are totally convinced that there is no better sommelier in Cancun then Gerardo. My wife and I have known Gerardo ever since we first started coming to Le Blanc. And every time we see him we are totally astounded by his knowledge of wines and equally astounding is his recall of some our favorite tastes in wine. We do n\u2019t know how he does it but even during times of high occupancy Gerardo manages to assist every guest that may have question or is requesting a special wine. He is always so helpful and has a truly warm and wonderful personality. During all our time travelling to different parts of our country or in the world we have never experienced a finer friendlier more knowledgeable and customer service oriented sommelier then Gerardo. The Spa and Beauty Saloon While I do n\u2019t use the Spa myself my wife absolutely loves it. The variety of offerings provide something for everyone and no matter what the choice the experience is amazing. A wonderful and relaxing spa hosted by a super experienced and ever so friendly and accommodating staff. My wife loves the hot stone massage. Mr Schmidt Le Blanc \u2019s Resort Manager has assembled a truly professional and wonderful team of managers and staff all working together like a well oiled machine to provide every guest a fantastic truly enjoyable and memorable vacation experience. We are very much looking forward to our seventh visit in April of 2015. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding this review or if we can be of any help as you plan your visit to Le Blanc.", "offset": [4704, 4772], "date": "2015-01-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "df331805-d857-4973-abe8-1c3da221ef4c", "sentence": "Relaxing Getaway. We stayed at the LeBlanc for seven days the first week of May and after reading some of the negative reviews I seriously wonder where these people stayed. Everything was not perfect during our weeks stay but we are well seasoned travelers and no resort is perfect. So read on for an honest and true review. The hotel the building is all white with a contemporary decor very nice and very comfortable. The 4 restaurants are beautifully decorated and the food is very good. The portion size is small but you can order whatever you wish and as much as you wish. We sometimes ordered 3 appetizers. And they are very eager to please. if you want an appetizer for dinner they will make it dinner size. For breakfast and lunch the one restaurant is turned into a buffet and the selection was unbelievable. The waiters were so nice and attentive too. Mario was the greatest so pleasant and happy. The 3 pools are very nice each with its own type of ambience. The gym is super clean with lots of great equipment towels cold water tv etc. Spa is beautiful and serene. my husband and I both had massages. really nice. The beach is beautiful blue water white waves there are plenty of chairs and umbrellas. You do not have to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve. The staff on the beach is really great. constantly asking you if you would like anything. Lucinda would always put out our chairs and umbrellas and towels with a smile and was so sweet and Jeanete was the best when it came to getting drinks at the beach. we loved her. We fell in love with a drink that she suggested called a Mocha Monkey. YUM. The hotel has butlers on each floor 24 hours a day. These guys can not do enough for you. they will even unpack and repack your luggage. Our favorite butlers were Jonathon Manuel and Jesus. Jonathon would always ask me what aromatherapy I wanted to burn in my room and I would say I love the one in the spa. what is it. He not only found out which one it was but got me a bottle to take home. That guy was a dream. Where else can you get service like thatThere were a few negatives. our travel agent had requested twice that we there were two couples be located close together. When we arrived they were on one floor and we another. They claimed it was not on the reservation and the hotel was fully booked. I immediately texted my travel agent and before she could call them they had found another room but it was not cleaned and it took us not our friends 5 hours to get into our room. It was a tiny irritation but still make sure your requests are on a printed form somewhere if it is important to you. Also as others pointed out in their reviews there was a very bad problem with seaweed and the ocean was very rough and waves very big. They did cleanup the seaweed on the beach every couple of days but truthfully it was very hard for them to keep up with. It did not stop us from going to the beach almost everyday as the seaweed was down by the waters edge and in the waterand your chairs were farther up on the beach. There was a problem with swimming too far out or in a certain place as the lifeguard kept blowing his whitstle and motioning for people to move down farther. twice we saw him go out and save two grown men. That being said two things I will say. the seaweed and rough water had NOTHING to do with the hotel that can be blamed on nature. several people we met said they had been there several times and never saw seaweed or waves like these and KUDOS to the hotel and staff for doing their best to watch out for the safety and comfort of their guests. The only other thing that was the tinest bit annoying was certain staff members trying to sell you on other Palace Resorts. We polietly declined but we were approached several times just be prepared. The biggest plus for this hotel is the staff especially the waiters beach staff butlers. These people work their tails off and do it with a great big smile. They are all friendly attentive and eager to please and do it in the blazing sun to boot. We tipped all of them all the time. I honestly do not think you need to do this because they seemed to give everybody the same amount of respectful care and attention but they deserve it and were truly grateful every time they recieved even 1. It seemed more people DID NOT tip than did. Our vacation was really great very relaxing except for the airport what a zoo. When arriving be prepared. do not talk to anyone just get out of the airport and find your transportation everybody wants to sell you excursions. If you are looking for a great adult vacation this is it. I suggest using a travel agent. our travel agent is Susan Peavy Travel and they helped us find this place and others and helped us out with several things after we got there. It is so helpful to be able to contact the agent if there are any problems. they have a lot of pull with hotel management and can get things done that just the ordinary traveler can not.", "offset": [4434, 4552], "date": "2015-05-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "4e9294b8-6ff0-4e34-8048-536c6510a6c8", "sentence": "Incredible. it is really nice to spend time writing such a great review many of us travel and say we must send a review about our holiday but do not this is my first. Well a few weeks later have and about timeI am very lucky having travelled across the USA and Caribbean for both holiday and business many many times it would be totally wrong not to commend Le Blanc Spa Resort. It was in fact my our first time to Mexico Cancun with mixed reviews from friends etc so went with an open mind. Our welcome at the hotel after a 10 hour flight was amazing warm friendly and totally professional waiting for us at the door with a fluted cocktail and a flower my soon to be fianc\u00e9 I did propose on the beach one evening the staff were so happy for usCheck in was easy and again so welcoming. Whilst we gathered our thoughts and took in the amazing reception area we headed to our floor seventh. Each floor having a butler dedicated. Our butlers Edwar and Joel were so attentive throughout our stay absolutely nothing too much and absolutely incredible attentive service. We were always welcomed by our names and always had a nice chat whether on our way to the beach or just heading to our room. The rooms themselves were beautiful I would suggest at least book the partial sea view room one side the ocean the other the lagoon with crocodiles we were lucky and saw one. The rooms were incredibly clean a lovely bed and an amazing jacuzi in each high quality throughout the hotelit is difficult to note all of the amazing staff at Le Blanc but have noted a few who should get a mention. Firstly on the beach excellent service to your sunbed beach waiters and waitresses along with the beach team who supply towels iced water etc do an amazing job in the hot temperatures special thanks to Jorge Jeanete and Mayre who looked after us always. Our favourite restaurants were the international and Italian the international doubles up as breakfast and lunch buffet absolute attention to detail with an amazing selection of food the evening it turns into a brilliant a la carte restaurant look out for Armando has the most amazing customer service ever. The rib eye was tremendous as was every meal there. In the Italian a lovely atmosphere with again touches of detail we loved four times we dined there and had a great reception meal and service every single time. Our favourite waiter was Carlos not that it took anything away from the others he just looked after us with a nice smile and was very warming always there to talk to us about the menu or top up our wine. Marcela was a radiant hostess. Sadly we had significant rain on our break but that did not stop the hotel catering for everyone small food and drink platters for people hiding from the rain and the job they did when the rain hit was amazing. I can honestly say with all my travels this hotel gave us the ultimate customer service every single member of staff was brilliant and it really was their pleasure. Recommendations. Gym was superb try out the aqua spinning very good fun extremely well equipped gym. Use resort credits on couples massage a wonderful experience and book the romantic beach meal. We used a few credits on certain wines at dinner but the standard bottles were good too. Remember you will have to pay the taxes on all credits but worth it. Catch the bus outside the hotel if you fancy shopping in the two malls although not the best selection was a welcome break during the rain and very cheap less than a pound dollar each and friendly drivers. The buses run every few minutes up and down the hotel strip. We walked to the flea market about ten mins away not really our type of fun being funnelled into every shop to buy something but I am sure there was a bargain to be had for cheap t shirts etc. Being Brits we never knew what was appropriate for tipping but made sure at the end of our stay we found all of of friends and ensured we took care of our favourites. We did not book any trips this time but there are so many for the adventurers next time for surecanot wait to go back to this hotel. If you want to relax with everything taken care of with the ultimate service then bokIt beats even Sandals Caribbean for service.

So right off the bat once you check in your introduced to your personal butler. This person caters to your needs food drinks room service set up your jacuzi hot tub etc. They even scent your room based on your personal tastes. Your butler changes based on the shift but they are pretty much all equally great. Downstairs below first level is a full spa. My only complaint is that they separate the men and the women for the pre massage and post massage treatment. They have a sauna jacuzi steam room and showers. My wife and I did not like that too much and was hoping to be enjoying those things with me. Other then that it was an amazing experience. If you book a trip more then a few days i think 3 or 4 you get credits that you can use for the spa otherwise expect it to be in the 250 500 range. The meals are all inclusive unles you go to the one French restaurant you pay for the lobster and these shrimp like items. Everything was great. The Infinity pool gives off a mirage like view of the pool meeting the ocean. It is just built in a way that gives that imagery but the beach is about 100 yards away. It was still awesome. The bar staff were great as well. No watered down drinks or frozen sugar concoctions. All great drinks some made with real fruits if you went for the fruity cocktails frozen drinks. Everything. The pool the spa the beach. Airline lost our luggage and fortunately we could have went there in swimming trunks and be fine. The downtown section was a ten minute car cab or bus ride away. other then the showers make the spa unisex.

My wife and I stayed at Le Blanc for the first week of April. Except for one problem the trip was wonderful. The weather was nearly perfect. Mostly in the upper 70s and sunny except for a couple days with light showers. The staff was wonderful with one exception. Bartenders waiters concierges were all great. Lots of great food great bar service. Every service person we met was eager to help and very friendly. Tried out the spa. I got a massage and my wife got a facial. Both were very nice. Overpriced but since we were able to use resort credit it really did not matter. The beach was great. Clean white sand gentle waves fairly warm. The pools were fantastic. clean warm large uncrowned. Most of the other vacationers we met were friendly and interesting. The vacation would have been wonderful if not for one problem. On our second day my wife had a slip and fall accident. This was due to very slippery conditions when the polished stone pavement around the pool gets wet. Her knee was badly bruised. By the next morning she was barely able to walk. When we reported it we got nothing but a runaround. Their doctor. examined her and said she needed to get to the hospital right away. but after making us wait for hours the manager Fernando Rojas just gave us lip service and denied us any meaningful help. His demeanor was insulting. He lied to my face. He is a one star manager in a five star resort. This incident nearly ruined a very expensive vacation. With medical care X rays analgesics it is starting to improve. If you decide to go to Le Blanc you will probably have a great time but two pieces of advice. 1. Watch your step around the pool. It is like ice esp by the public restroms2.

Lets start with the transportation as soon you leave inmigration and customs if you do not see your name do not cross the street just continue the sidewalk at your right hand and under the number 15 you will see PALACE people they will help you and find who is driving you to the resort. It is a small resort adults only as soon as you walk in the hotel the relaxation starts. We arrived around 430pm they served cold coconut milk and provided you with aromatherapy neck pillows while you are checked in and a flower for my wife. Our room was a partial view of the ocean and the lagoon beautiful view. no palms blocking either way in fact at that side no palms. At the bottom was the iguana yard were cute to see them. Your butlers are going to be there all the time helping with any information or service. Extremely helpful and courteous. We spent a week between Saturday June 18th and Saturday June 25th we only got one day of rain on Sunday. We visited Isla mujeres and Chichen Itza one of the new wonders of the world. We also went snorkeling and swimming in an open cenote and a closed cenote too. Our sons went snorkeling with whale sharks too. You need long pants close shoes and shirt for all restaurants but not for the International. This is the only casual restaurants and shorts are fine. We also used our credits for the lobster and meat cuts. If you are eating at the international restaurant and would like something for other restaurants just ask and they will bringing it for you. The beach is fantastic no need to run for a chair or umbrellas staff is ready to help you and look for the best spot for you cocktails and food are offered every moment. Every afternoon we try to join the aquatic spinning and afterwards go to the spa for hydro therapy. What a great way to end the dayMy wife asked for a lavender pillow from the pillow menu and she loved itAl the staff is extremely courteous and knowledgeable. Their main purpose is to provide the best experience during your visit. Everyone pampers you non stop. The resort is beautiful in every single aspect and smells delicious and with the staff makes an incredible experience impossible to describe with enough words.

However two weeks before our arrival we were notified that we could upgrade to Le Blanc and we were so excited to see why this resort is rated 1 in Cancun. Our travel dates were 061816 062516 and I am just going to break down some tips and facts I wish I would have known beforehand. Butlers. Yes they are amazing. Shout out to Alex and Santiago on the 5th floor thank you for tailoring our stay to be romantic for our anniversary. Although we did not use them for all of these services here are some examples of what they offer to do unpack aromatherapy scents drawn baths. nightly turn down service with chocolates iron steam dress clothes etc. Hotel Property. Not crowded. Thankfully it was easy to find spots at the beach pool and restaurants which was a big difference in comparison to our previous stays at other resorts in Mexico. Restaurants. Food was great at all of them. I liked the Asian restaurant because of the sushi much better sushi then other hotels in Mexico. and my husband really enjoyed the French restaurant for the beef and lamb he got both. Italian was also great especially the lobster ravioli. If you go to the French restaurant ask to sit in Manuels section he is the best server we have ever had. Although all the servers and employees try really hard to make sure service is top noch. Finally if you get a change to do the dinner on the beach ask for the 930 time instead of the 70 because there is still people on the beach at 70 and the stars are beautiful if you want to dance under them at the later time. Swim Up Bar We spent a lot of time at the swim up bar on the beach side. Viktor makes the best drinks. Ask him to surprise you with a drink and you will not be disappointed. Spa We used the spa almost every morning even if we did not have an appointment scheduled. Just go down in your swim suite and coverup and give them your room number. The men and women facilities are separate of course and you can use the sauna steam room foot bath and different hot tubs and baths at your leisure. Chichen Itza We did this excursion through the hotel because I am a history nut. Be prepared to be gone most of the day if you do it 80 am730pm. Luckily the restaurants are still open late for dinner so you can still eat at the hotel when you return but closer to 100. Since the site is in a different state it takes approximately 3 hours to get there on a large air conditioned bus with a tour guide. They allow vendors inside the historical site which is different if you visited Tulum. Tip. Ask for a boxed lunch from the hotel to take with you. Although the bus stops for lunch at a cute Mayan town it was nice to have additional snacks and have a back up lunch in case you did not like the food at the buffet they stopped at. Isla Mujers. Although you can travel to the island with Le Blancs Tour Around the Island package we wanted to do it on our own. The hotels tour just drops you off at the swim with the dolphins park but since we have done that before we caught a ferry and did our own thing. If your interested in doing that. Take a bus to the ferry it is 1 for the bus per person or 21 pesos for 2 get a round trip ferry ticket 19 person and the ferry runs every hour or so and rent a golf cart approximately 40 for the day. Then to save money on lunch visit the Isla Mujers Palace hotel since you have access to it. We budgeted 100 for the day for the two of this and after converting it into pesos we still had some money left. Some of the things you can visit while traveling on the golf cart the turtle farm 3 person then 3 for a bag of pellets to feed them the lighthouse the pirate cemetery cliffs and Mayan ruins on the south end. Hotel Hopping Since we had access to the other hotels we visited Sun Palace Beach Palace and Isla Mujers Palace the day we traveled to the island. If you want a hotel hopping day take the bus to Sun Palace for breakfast and morning pool time since it is at the beginning of the Cancun strip then travel to Beach Palace via bus for lunch and afternoon pool time be sure to go down the kids slide finally walk back to Le Blanc via the beach which is about 15 hotels down.", "offset": [2739, 2920], "date": "2016-06-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "fa824f34-23f4-4481-aa52-d4a777d085b5", "sentence": "2nd time in the past year. Glad we came again. Things are usually never the same twice and in fact there are notable differences between our first trip in January and the trip we are currently still at. For those of you reading this wanting to come I am spitting by the pool and its been over 30 sunny skies for the past 5 days and the mojitos just keep coming. As diamond guests we are used too being picked up in a limo checking in at the airport so we can hit the ground running. It was not the case this time. Let Blanc hired another company to come and get us at the airport and there was very little consistency between the first time and now. However this is a nit and to be honest consistency does matter but if this is all you need to worry about then the Le Blanc once again is achieving my 5About the rooms Higher floors are better beach facing better i had lagoon view before. so I can make that statement. However I made a recommendation last time here that the chairs in the rooms need felt tips. although the Management liked the suggestion they still have not implemented this simple fix. The chairs without felt rumble the floor waking your neighbours and those below you. This resort is for RR do not come her if you expect to be at a frat party. Its not that kind of resort and those who are obnoxiously loud will be dealt with. Le Blanc is a special place. You will not want to leave EVER. Trust me. You can see the sad faces of those who are having their last meal before heading to the airport. Indeed Sunday will be as sad for my wife and I Our Butlers are just amazing. Samuel and Hugo they made sure our room had aromatherapy all day and night without even asking and they ensured we knew what all the events are that happening. Our servers are pros. They are trained to please and they do. Ask them for anything I dare you and somehow they will get what you want. Our favourite restaurant this trip is the same as the last The oriental. It is fresh caters very well to celiac people and the variety is so good I could eat there every night. I also love the Italian the prosciutto and parmesan cheer is amazing as is Chef Rene and Manager Alexandro. Now what Makes the Resort great. no AMAZING are the people. Here are some stars. To those of you who are reading this please take the time to write a review and name the individuals who made your stay special. It truly makes a difference to them in may ways. My favourite server this trip is Rene in the Italian restaurant. He was funny attentive but not overly attentive. My wife and talk for hours and do not like to be interrupted. he read us very well. I also have a need to have my wine glass nearly empty before it is refilled and he accommodated that no problem. All the hostesses are excellent but standing above them all is Vanessa also at the Italian restaurant. Her smile chases the darkness away from every corner of Le Blanc. It beams as does her personality. She will do whatever it takes to please you make sure you wear pants in the restaurant otherwise she will kindly ask you to go put them on and I am glad she does. The restaurants are all nice and I am glad that Le Blanc insists on a moderate dress code. Hugo the manager of the international restaurant is first class. He runs a tight ship and his team of professionals are all trained well such as Armanado Jorge and Pablo. Thank you Le Blanc. Exceeded my expectations.

We were advised to only get on the buses with red or blue front bumpers NEVER white one. Cost is 1 to ride from pick up to drop off no matter the distance. Much less than a taxi. The Spa is wonderful but be sure to book your appointments as soon as you arrive because their calendar fills up quickly.", "offset": [642, 730], "date": "2017-01-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "0ee9968a-4d4b-436a-b667-a6209167449d", "sentence": "Absolutely perfect getaway. We just returned from Le Blanc yesterday. This was by far one of the best vacations we have ever been on. I can not say enough about the amazing staff. I would like to say a special thank you to Ana in guest services for here amazing service. She went above and beyond to help us out. Also Juan Carlos who transported us to and from the airport was so accommodating. Alfredo in the Asian restaurant was such a blast. There are so many others to recognize but I can not remember all the names. There was someone who is a waiter on the beach who was so friendly. Also the lifeguard on the beach did not catch his name either is so hard working. And everyone in the International Restaurant was amazing. This staff makes this place truly one of a kind. You barely get to your pool chair and someone is there with towels and a bucket of ice and water for you. The butler is always there to greet you and make sure everything is perfect for you. The accommodations are so clean and nice. And the food. I can not say enough about how amazing ALL of the food is. Also the spa was so relaxing.

Serene. A. We came here to celebrate my 30th birthday my husband and I my best friend and her husband. This place knocked my socks off when compared to other all inclusive resorts we have been to in Mexico. The best part was the fod my husband and I are a bit snobby in this department and had amazing experiences at every location. The asian restaurants seafood sushi was incredible. try the tuna tacos. we ate at the italian restaurant which was great room service was amazing and quick and the breakfast buffet was awesome. try that omelet station. we went to the international restaurant for dinner the last night our guys were not loving the long pants and close toed shoes rule and it was spectacular. tortilla soup YUM. like nothing I have ever had. The service was great everywhere including pool side and we were well accommodated. It was a bit overwhelming how great they were at service but not sure that can be counted against them. Rooms were clean beds outstanding turn down service was great and of course we loved the in room snacks drinks. The spa was incredible and my husband said he had the best massage of his life which is saying a lot. Also the rock band that played at the BlancStage was AWESOME. A few things we noticed which did not affect our rating pool and pool bar seem to need a small amount of tile maintenance. Shower floor pools up a bit which is just a drainage issue and totally could have been just our room. Also we received hotel credit which turns out to be taxed 16. and you end up spending a bunch of money you did not intend to. Buyer beware. We also got conned into sitting through a 45 minute talk about the other hotels owned by Le Blanc. Overall we had an amazing time and loved the Le Blanc. We would totally come back.

We were fortunate to stay at Le Blanc for 5 of our 10 day vacation to Cancun. We were hesitant thinking it would be a little too posh for our liking. To our surprise it was perfect. The staff is excellent and very attentive. Every floor has a butler. Our Butlers were Isreal and Joel both were helpful with things like finding out where out lost luggage was and arranging delivery to arranging transportation to play golf. We made a comment about the turtle release and Israel found information and shared it with us regarding time and place. The drink menu at the pool bar was extensive with top shelf alcohol fresh fruits and fancy acrylic glasses. The grounds are beautiful with an beautiful infinity pool overlooking the white sandy beach and unbelievable blue ocean. We ate at 3 of the 4 restaurants they have Asian Italian International a variety and French as well as pizza oven area. All of the food was delicious. At the pool they supplied individual ice buckets with bottled waters and kept it stocked. The staff passed by throughout the day with special snacks. Fresh fruit crab cakes etc. This is an all inclusive resort but it is fun to have the little extras. The staff makes comments like You are on vacation. It should be perfect. If you need anything at all just ask. This resort is adults only and no smoking both positive attributes. This is a smaller resort something like 200. rooms allowing the staff to remember you which is fun. We had our two young adult daughters with us which probably made us a little more rememberable. Anna at the spa walked us through each step of the water experience which enhanced the experience of using the sauna steamrom whirlpool. Laura at the pool was always attentive with setting up our chairs towels umbrella and water each day. Jesus the bartender at the lagoon pool made the best drinks. That pool was a little slower so he had more time to engage with guests improving the swim up bar experience. We did not have any trouble finding a chair by any pool. Beds and pillows were very comfy. The only drawback for us was that we did not have a deck in our room. There are a limited number of rooms with decks. Overall a 5 star experience and wishing we had spent all 10 days there.

Nowhere have we been made to feel more welcome and warmly embraced. The people of Mexico are the best. It is impossible to stay here and not feel like family. There are too many great people to mention them all but following are people you should not miss. Laura and Lucy at the pool are too of the sweetest hardest working and most accommodating people you will have the pleasure to meet. Danial mostly at the pool bar is a true mixologist who never seems to forget your favorite drink. Just when you are feeling bored he invents a new concoction to keep you in the game. Jose in the international restaurant is a rock star. Many at Lumiere is the crowning jewel of your dining experience. We are no meet no dairy no eggs major pains. He orchestrated three nights of off menu meals that rival our favorite in Boston and New York. Marco and Santana our Butlers left us never wanting anything. Our room was impeccable. They created the most romantic setting. Drawn bublebath rose petals and champagne.

I first visited Le Blanc in 2013 with my best gals we had a wonderful time relaxing getting pampered and chilling with Fonzie in the lounge. My next trip was the following year 2014 with my Honey to get some much needed RR. We were so well taken care of including spending a memorable moment on the Beach releasing the baby turtles into the surf from the Butlers to the pool and restaurant staff that we returned the following year 2015 with my office and a group of 18. The staff took care of our transportation a special private dinner and cocktails out by the lower pool deck and accommodated us in every way. The gang from work still talk about that trip as one of the best hotels they have ever visited. The next year we returned with a family group of 6 for a Special Birthday and again were not disappointed with a custom Birthday cake presented by the Pastry chef to a fun photo shoot. This month we returned for 5 days of RR. The renovations recently completed made the hotel even more beautiful and the staff many of whom I remember from the past were as fantastic as ever. Le Blanc is quiet and chill so if you are looking for lively action its perhaps not the best choice but if you are looking for gorgeous accommodations excellent service with a smile fantastic food and a most glorious pool beach and view then this is your spot.
