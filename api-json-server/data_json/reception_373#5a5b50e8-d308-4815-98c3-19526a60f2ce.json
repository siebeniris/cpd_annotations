I asked him if we needed to sign a check for our breakfast voucher and he said no only if we wanted it for a tip. When I told him that our voucher states gratuity included on the back he replied no it does not then I asked him to read the back and he said whatever you say. Hey we were asking if the service is nice we gladly leave extra tip but his attitude changed and his disregard for us was more than obvious. Even a manager came to bring us things when he saw us waiting so long. So although we traveled there for work and we thought the place would be great for our required meetings we did not like that a waiter would refuse to be courteous not attend us and outright ask if we wanted our check to be able to leave a tip. Obviously rude because whether or not he understood the words gratuity included means tip included or not his attitude has turned all of our party off to returning to this site.
