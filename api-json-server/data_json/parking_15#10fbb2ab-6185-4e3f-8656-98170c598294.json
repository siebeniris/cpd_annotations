This hotel is off the beaten path but was nice for a family with young children. We really enjoyed that it has multiple pools especially a HUGE kidie pool. On a chilly day we took the transport to the indoor pool. I think this is mostly used by seniors and you can not take any floats or toys into the pool area. A short walk down the beach and you are allowed to use the water park at the other hotel the Embassy I believe. do not forget your arm bands. Towels are provided so that was a nice perk. We left our stuff out on the beach and thankfully some nice person moved it back for us. the tide comes in very far and very fast. You really have to go by car to any restaurants except for the hotel ones which are very pricey. This hotel is really between North Myrtle Beach and Myrtle Beach. I enjoy being away from all the tourist stuff and would stay here again. The hotel is considered full service so if you need a luggage cart that comes with a bellman so be prepared to tip. The one who helped us when we arrived was so friendly I did not mind tipping and he always spoke to our family and gave the kids high fives when we passed him coming or going.", "offset": [335, 446], "date": "2015-07-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "b72563df-142a-4151-a388-8127d9e405c5", "sentence": "Great Summer Vacation. We had a 7th floor room with ocean view. High enough to avoid the pool noise but just right for people watching and of course ocean viewing and relaxing. I have no complaints about the property or amenities. The free shuttle to restaurants and shopping was a plus car stayed parked for four days. My recommendation is drop the fee for self parking 89 per day. I would not spring for 159 valet to park in the garage 50 yards from the front entrance. Hilton and Hilton properties are not on the cheap end of the hotel scale so why add to the price by charging for to park in the garage owned by the hotel. Even if others hotel chains charge Hilton can be a cut above the rest. I decided not to take a vacation to the Hilton resort in Ft Lauder dale this coming September because the mandatory valet parking is 395 per day. that is on top of the resort fee of 25 per day.

This was the first time we had ever been to Myrtle Beach and it had been two years since my husband and I had a vacation by ourselves sans childrenThe hotel probably because it is so busy did not let us check in until exactly 4PM. We were fine with that. We placed a pre order for a few things to have available in our room when we arrived. They were not there. We had to go back downstairs and request what we had asked for. It took about an hour for it to arrive. That was not too bad and we are not difficult to please. Check InCheck. in otherwise was very easy. Everyone at the front desk was helpful during the check in process. I want to clear up a few things about this hotels suites. We had an Enhanced King Suite which I had changed from a King Suite. I had called the hotel and was told that the only difference between these two rooms is that one has direct ocean views and the other does not. I asked specifically if there were any other differences and after being put on hold for about 20 minutes I was told no but I appreciated that someone at the call center took the time to call the hotel to check. Unfortunately that was incorrect. We were hoping for two bathrooms but quickly realized that the King Suite has two bathrooms while the Enhanced King Suite does not. We also learned that the Enhanced King Suite has cathedral style ceilings close to the balcony and the King Suite does not. There were a few other differences which I felt like I should have been made aware of before arrival but in the end we accepted the room we had. I was very disappointed that the hotel was not able to properly identify what was available in the room. The Enhanced King SuiteWe were in room 1418 combined with 1417. Like other reviews have stated the room IS dated and the hotel probably is due for some upgrades soon. However it was totally manageable and still a great room. We really enjoyed the two balconies. The the living area and the bedroom were roomy. The bathroom area and dressing area were very small and rather suffocating. The shower ceiling is very low and the vent which is right above your head if you are more than 5 feet 8 is absolutely filthy. The grout needs to be cleaned as well. The beds were way too soft and the pillow went flat like cheaply made pillows do. We usually bring our own pillows but forgot this time and paid the price. I am in pretty good shape and the extremely soft beds aggravated my SI joints. We have a TempurPedic at home so we could not wait to get back to it. This suite had direct ocean views so from the balcony off of the living area you could see up and down the beach. Lovely views. You will not regret having this room if just for the reviews. HotelThe remaining areas of the inside of the hotel are in good condition although the outside leaves something to be desired in broad daylight. When we pulled up we were kind of worried but accepted it is a seaside hotel and with the salt air the building is going to be a bit more beat up than buildings inland. We were pleasantly surprised by the decor on the inside of the hotel. There were a few things missing. There was no splash park no lazy river no indoor pool as advertised on the website. What we learned is that you have to go to the Embassy Suites 4 buildings down to use those facilities. That irritated me very much because the website indicates that these facilities are available onsite and does not explain that you will have to lug all of your belongings 4 buildings over by either getting in your car walking up the beach or taking a shuttle. It was not convenient and I do not appreciate the misleading advertising on Hiltons website. I probably would have selected another hotel had I known these amenities were missing and it certainly was a factor in determining whether the rate you were paying was worth it to you. Cafe AmalfiWe had dinner here and breakfast here on several occasions. Everything was prepared well and the breakfast buffet offerings were plentiful. Most seats have a view of the ocean. it is a great way to eat breakfastGrand Hilton Vacation A NightmareThe concierge contacted our room and asked if we would be interested in going on a tour of the new Hilton condo on Ocean Blvd. I think it was called Ocean 22. We were required to give 2 hours of our time and were promised a relaxed but not high pressure sales experience. We decided to take that offer as we were truly interested in learning about this opportunity which was a lot like a time share. We were told at the hotel however that we had to put down a 20 cash deposit to reserve our time and that we would get it back after we took the tour. More about that later. During the course of our meeting with Amy we were told that we lacked courage did not know the value of a deal when we saw it did not understand what we were missing would miss out on the opportunity to be a part of a distinct and elite group wasteful of our money if we did not make a decision to buy distrustful by choosing to trust hilton but not hilton grand vacations with our money etc. Good thing we have a healthy self esteem. When we finally decided against that opportunity right then she promptly left fine we get it is sales and you need to move on. but then we sat there for another 30 minutes waiting for someone to sign us out. I felt like a trapped animal. Back to the 20 dollars this really is not that much money but after attending the tour where no one said anything with regards to receiving the refund of our 20 dollars and after returning to the hotel to talk with Brad Christina and another new person we were told that we were supposed to receive our refund at the Hilton Grand Vacations office. Well we did not. For two days we checked back about 4 times to see if the matter had been resolved. It took two days to get the 20 back and I felt badly that Brad one of the hotel workers actually gave my husband 20 dollars out of his own pocket either because he wad disgusted with us and wanted to be done with it or because he felt bad for us. I am not sure which one. We did try to be very polite about the entire situation but it seemed wrong for them not to return what they said was a deposit. The lady behind the desk said she was new and had no idea what was going on. No one wanted to take responsibility. I thought the entire situation was handled poorly and I would never go on one of these again. The BeachAces to the beach is wonderful. It is very close and there are water facets to rinse your feet off when you are finished. There is a bar next to the beach and close to the pools as well. It is a very comfortable and fun atmosphere and we were very happy with that aspect of the hotel. The beach is beautiful but do not wander too far. The Apache pier is about half a mile away and it costs a dollar to walk on it. On the other side is an unsightly trailer park and everything goes downhill from there. I did have concerns about people playing in the pooled water on the beach that appeared to be coming from two waste tubes from the hotel. It appeared to be dumping gray water all day and I wondered what that was since children were playing in it and no signs were posted. ParkingParking fee for self parking or valet parking is mandatory. We used self parking and it was very easy to get to and from the parking garage. There is really no need to use valet parking unles that is just a lifestyle requirement for you. what is aroundWe were pretty sure we were in paradise until we left to explore the rest of myrtle which is way more commercialized and gaudy than I thought it would be. The hotel is at least 5 miles from the nearest decent restaurant. There are no restaurants that you can walk to as this is not near the city center or near ocean blvd skywhel area. That was fine for us as we prefer to get away from it all and visit chaos when we feel like it. The Business CenterI think there are about 8 computers in the business center and I used them briefly for work because I left my laptop at home. It was not very busy and met all of my business needs.", "offset": [7426, 7522], "date": "2015-08-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "5ac0f51c-abfc-4132-a837-1d4764711e44", "sentence": "Good price thanks to Hilton Grand Vacation.
