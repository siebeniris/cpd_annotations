Went on a vacation and stayed 7 nights. Hotel is very nice well maintained and the lobby is beautiful and lively. The check in process was a little annoying. I was here a few years back for a few nights and encounter a similar issue upon check in. The hotel check in time is 4 pm. Both times we arrived after 4 pm and was told that our room was not ready. After traveling from NY since 9 am this is the last thing you want to hear when you get there to start your vacation. They bribe you with free drink tickets while you wait. Finally got into the room around 530pm. We were on the 7th floor decent view of front of hotel and the beach in the distance on the other side. Room was fine little sign of wear and tear but it was clean and served it is purpose. Housekeeping was in every day of the stay and looked good as new each day. The lobby comes alive at night from Thurs Saturday. They have latin music dancing live music. it is really a fun time. Too bad the drinks are so overpriced. I would have actually stayed in those nights to party. You can find cheaper bars around the area that have a party atmosphere with better drinks. But it seems to be the spot on the weekends. They also have a nightclub open on the weekend. I did not go. Avoid the casino at all costs. If you play slots you will not win. They only have one blackjack table open one roulette table and one craps table open for the most part. But the slots do not pay. The casino is small and dated. They need to update their slot games. Pool area was beautiful. Service for the most part was ok. Again drinks are overpriced. They do not allow coolers or bottles at the pool. but we were able to sneak it down and no one really said anything. The beach entrance is nice to have as well. The security monitors to ensure no outsiders come in to the resort from the beach. They have a nice steak house italian restaurant and asian restaurant inside. All were bustling for them most part. We chose to eat out throughout our stay at local beachfront restaurants in the town and Old San Juan. The hotel restaurants again were grossly overpriced. Tip Watch the honesty of the cab drivers. For the most part it was 192 for a ride to airport Old San Juan Condado Beach. One driver wanted to charge 50 to Old San Juan because there was traffic going into the town. Turned out to be not true and I only gave him 30 for the ride and left the cab. If you want to party El San Juan is it.

The El San Juan Resort Casino was breathtaking right when you stepped foot into the lobby it was beautiful and the staff outside were very friendly. We went to the desk to check in and mentioned we were there for our birthdays to see if we could maybe be upgraded to something better. Originally booking we booked the Garden Lanais room DO NOT GO NEAR THEM. We got into the building and it was like a bad scene from a horror movie with a motel we then got into the room they were spacious but oh boy GROSS. We then checked out the balcony so gross you did not even want to sit on it. We changed sat by the pool and said no way went back to the front desk where we dealt with Eric. super nice guy and I asked if we were on the TV show punkd that is how bad it was. He then told us renovations were coming up on that building and moved us into the tower we walked in and were just so happy to see tile on the floor not carpet from 1930s. It was much better we did not have a balcony but was worth it. Much nicer. The beach was okay not the nicest area we have seen but lots of chairs available. There are two pools the one closest to the hotel quiet the one closer to the ocean was much nicer and livelier. They also had a dj on the weekends. Drinks were pretty pricy two drinks cost us depending on the drink anywhere from 100 150 each. The restaurants at the hotel were decent the Italian one was pricy and not the best Meat market was pretty good the Japanese restaurant pricy and the food was very bland the best was the little gelato and pizza place amazing pizza. Weekends this hotel is the place to be it gets packed with lots of locals and tourist as there is live music in the lobby a casino a night club and a roof top bar restaurant. Lots of shopping to do in the area there are two malls close by and you for sure have to go to Old San Juan. One other thing you should know if you are a smoker you can not smoke anywhere.

These are our thoughts of our recent trip to El San Juan hotel. Full disclosure we have been here before and we are frequent travelers. First the good. Jesie at the pool area will go above and beyond to make sure your stay is a wonderful one. Luis at the swim up bar is the best bartender on staff and also very friendly. Now the so so. The hotel is currently still under renovations. Everything is freshly painted white and the rooms are what you would expect a resort hotel room to look like not bad but nothing special either. Now the reasons why we will not be returning to the El San Juan hotel any longer. Upon arrival we discovered that the casino is no longer operating. We were told to walk up to the Ritz Carlton to visit their casino. This was a surprise to us because when we booked our trip 6 weeks earlier their listing on Expedia states hotel AND casino. Ultimately I believe it is the hotels responsibility to make sure their listings are correct on Expedia. Most of the rooms and the pools are open but that is about all. None of the shops are open and only 2 restaurants are open. It would have been nice to pick up some of the toiletries you can not bring on a plane from the hotel rather than walking 3 blocks to a Walgrens. Again no advance notice of these closings. Friday while at the pool they decided to power wash tar from the roof of the hotel. It ended up blowing into the pool and we have been cleaning tar off of us and our clothes for the last two days. BEWARE OF THE POOL AREA ON SUNDAYS. It seems that they open the resort up to the local community on Sundays and the entire atmosphere changes. The instant pop up club was so loud that I literally could not hear my wife speaking in the lounge chair next to me. While we have been to many club style resorts in Miami and Las Vegas we knew what we were getting and wanted. I did not expect a Miami pool party to pop up here. I would have gone to Fontainebleau if that was what we wanted. As I currently type this review from my room on the 7th floor away from the pool area I can still here the music. Also the pool service has closed everyday at 5 pm which is odd given that the sun does not set until almost 7 pm. Big surprise today though party is still going at 630pm. I am not sure who they are trying to cater to today. their guests or the hotels reputation. Friday night after returning from a nice dinner we returned to the hotel to find two bouncers and brown velvet at the front entrance. Upon trying to enter the hotel we were treated like we were unsuccessfully trying to get into a NYC nightclub and quickly ushered into a side door rather than through the front. HILTON PLEASE LISTEN. This extremely disrespectful to the people who are keeping your resort open. If you want to be an upscale club then close down your hotel and go for it. Very classless move. Saturday night was the same Upon presenting our dissatisfaction to the hotel we were refunded our 51 per day resort amenities charge for our inconvenience. In my opinion there should not have been one to begin with as most of these so called amenities are not open yet. As a side note the added 3 different style cabanas around the pool area. We are big cabana users and prefer the amenities and treatment that go along with cabana rentals. These were by far the sorriest lokingcabanas we have ever seen. They were also extremely overpriced 500 for basic 1000 for basic plus and a ridiculous 150 for the basic without even a small refrigerator. see pics of each completely absurd. Needless to say we are extremely disappointed with our recent visit. If you have been here in the past you will not like the changes.

I guess the concept has changed with the new owner and that brought about some changes we did not like 1. Casino closed so that put a damper on those in our group who wanted to gamble. 2. Casino workers picketing at front entrance and on beach. They harassed you when getting your towels and were annoying with chanting. Most of the time you really could not hear them over the crashing waves or music at the pool. By the end of our stay the bullhorns were taken away so it was fine. Two things should have happened the hotel should have let us know the casino closed they gave cab fare to the Ritz and the protesters should not have punished the guests. Owner and Union lawyers need to work it out and stop using the workers as pawns. The new concept brought much higher drink prices and fewer restaurants Marea was terrible so we canceled our Meat Market reservation and ate off site the rest of the stay. Polside option of Tuna Crudo over breadfruit was super if you added a squeeze of lime or salt. The hotel gave free drinks and massages at the pool but if you were not there to hear about it you lost out. They were always coming around the pool with little tidbits and that was really nice. Also we were supposed to be given letters upon arrival notifying us of the issues with the protesters and we were not. They gave us a credit to our room for some inconveniences we experienced because we paid a very high room rate and the rates dropped due to protesters so that was helpful. The local dancing was good on Friday but slower on Saturday. This was one of the main reasons for staying there so that was a bit disappointing. I guess they changed the policy on admission for locals. Too bad because that is a unique feature they should not mess with.
