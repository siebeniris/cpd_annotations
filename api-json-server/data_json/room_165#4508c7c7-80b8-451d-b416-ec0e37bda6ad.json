The check in and out was easy and efficient typical Hilton the reception staff organising our bags to be taken to our room. The staff were generally helpful and we really did n\u2019t experience any problems we were provided with maps and advice on how to get to the Oktoberfest which was helpful2 Tell us how you liked the room We stayed in 2 room at the Hilton as with it being Oktoberfest Munchin was packed and we booked a little late so we had to split our stay. 1st room was the standard king and the 2nd was the executive king room both rooms were identical except for larger shampoos and conditioners in the bathroom and larger towels. Both room were large enough to be not tripping over your bags and were modern and clean. The only advantage of the executive king room was the executive lounge where you had access to free alcohol finger food and internet access 1 pc for all guests3. Talk about the location amenities The Hilton City is on Rosenhiemer STR right on top of the Rosenhiemer Platz subway station from the Airport to Rosenhiemer Platz is about a 40 minutes and its 3 or 4 stops Mareienplatz the city centre where you can organise a lot of tours from the street vendors who organising them look for their signs to book a tour we walked this and it \u2019s about a 20 min walk there is a permanent taxi rank out the front also if you do n\u2019t want to walk or use the train. To get to Oktoberfest the best station is Theresienwiese but you have to change trains at Isartor Theresienwiese is the name of the place where the Oktoberfest is held and you walk out of the station right into the fair ground. The walk from the Hilton city hotel to Theresienwiese is anything up to an hour via Mareienplatz but it is and easy walks and very pleasant as we were there during Oktoberfest the town was buzzing with hundreds of people walking to and from the Theresienwiese in various states of intoxication. what a townWe did a day tour to Dachau Concentration camp we booked this through the guys in Mareienplatz so its fine to deal with them it was a very moving and enlightening tour we left Mareienplatz via the subway and travelled by train to Dachau and then took a 15 min bus ride to the camp. The train coming back arrived at Munchin Hof main station and we walked to Theresienwiese which was about a 15 minute walk down Herzog Heinrich Strabe. Mareienplatz is where all the main shops and lots of great restaurants are here the mall is abuzz with people this time of the year all enjoying the festivities with the sidewalk bars overflowing with stein drinkers. Breakfast well breakfast ca n\u2019t really tell you about it as whilst it was included we were never up in time for it after a massive session in the Bavarian beer hall so we ate breakfast across the road at the various delis Macas and pastry shops which were wonderful. If you head down the Pizzeria del Cavalier passed the roundabout in Weinberger Pl in to Weinberger STR this is where there is a golden Arches and many supermarkets our favourite was Norma there is also a Chinese restaurant where we had a really nice meal one night. There is a great street fruit vendor on the cnr of Rosenhiemer STR Pizzeria del Cavalier where we got fresh fruit and water. This really is a business type hotel with lots of business types and air crews about the joint but it was a typical Hilton with a ridiculously overpriced bar restaurant and internet facilities4 Say what you liked best least The City Hilton was really the only hotel available to us at this time of year and it \u2019s really more set up for the business clientele that tourists \u2019 having said that it is still Hilton and its ok to stay there. If your there for Oktoberfest it \u2019s a long way from Theresienwiese as I have previously said and I would be looking to stay closer if I ever went back to Munich.", "offset": [695, 783], "date": "2015-05-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "67c28189-af1d-4d79-88f5-8708d063ff24", "sentence": "2 12 Not too impressed but note this is a very early first impression ie first night. I normally choose to stay closer to the Hauptbahnhof but my company has a Corporate Rate so I decided to give the Hilton a try. It is accessible to the subway and not too far of a walk from Marianplatz. The lobby area is very nice. Here is a short synopsis of my first time with them ie tonight They lost my reservation the international reservation team had it but they had trouble finding it at the desk. Note that the staff was very courteous friendly and helpful in trying to resolve the problem but it was surprising that with a reservation confirmation they still had trouble My room was on the floor 3 4 floors above ground leve Floor 0. I was above the meeting conference area where there was a wedding going on. I initially thought they had a disco on floor 2 below my room. The bass was palpable in my room and there was a lot of boisterous party ing in the courtyard below my window. I was not trying to sleep and the party calmed down by 130 but their sound proofing was not up to the task The room is nice slightly bigger than average for the hotels where I have stayed in Munich but much of the decor especially in the public areas off the main floor are very much in need of a renovation Initially internet was good. then poor then good then poor but it eventually settled out and became useful. THIS I REALLY DISLIKE. and I debated giving an overall rating of Poor. The mini bar fridge is one of the pressure sensitive units that I have only encountered before in Las Vegas. Essentially if you remove something and put it back you still get charged. They provide a little shelf for personal use. I like to have a few sodas and a cold water bottle at the ready. The capacity was barely two bottles not upright. Actually dislike is too generous. HILTON I hate this crap. I do not want to buy overpriced snacks drinks from your mini bar I do not want to rent another little fridge for personal use I want to make some space in the fridge you provide put my 3botles of Coke Zero and 1botle of water in there to keep them cold but no you want to nickel and dime me. The message is We value your money over your convenience. I have a work colleague that enjoys this hotel and I will potentially stay again if traveling with him but unles my 1st impression is quickly changed through some unforeseen wonderfulness this will not be my first choice of accommodations in Munich. The thing that saved this from being a Poor is the check in staff and bar staff seemed to genuinely caring and customer focused. For my check in troubles they offered me some complementary chocolate nuts or dried fruit which I very much appreciated. However it really is hard for me to get past the you touch it you own it mini bar.", "offset": [870, 980], "date": "2015-09-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "07c9eb9e-cca6-4cc7-af19-f828d56300d8", "sentence": "Very nice hotel but not really in the city centre like the name suggests.
