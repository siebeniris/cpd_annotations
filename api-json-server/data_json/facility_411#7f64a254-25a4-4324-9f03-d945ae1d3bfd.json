I had stayed here years ago on a business seminar but came back recently with a friend who was visiting from out of state. The Vintage Inn is ideally situated within walking distance of several fine restaurants French Laundry Bistro Jeanty Bouchon etc and boutique shopping. It is also within an easy drive to the various small towns and wineries. We arrived a bit early but that was not a problem our room was ready. The room itself was very spacious with two comfortable queen size beds a table and side chairs a large over stuffed reading chair and a beautiful fireplace all ready to go. We had a closet as well as an armoire so there was plenty of room to hang our clothing. The bathroom was huge with two sinks and a large spacious tub shower. We had clean linens every day and the housekeeping staff kept our room immaculate. The gardeners are amazing and the grounds surrounding the rooms are kept in perfect condition with flowers everywhere. The rooms must be well insulated because we never heard a sound from the adjoining rooms. The breakfast is quite sumptuous with a buffet of fresh fruit various cereals pastries juices breads and spreads. Outside on the patio a chef is prepared to make hot egg dishes try the omelets they are amazing. In the afternoon there is a tea service with lemonade and ice tea along with various cookies cakes and little sandwiches. You will definitely not go hungry. The staff at the front desk are helpful friendly and efficient. They went out of their way on several occasions to answer questions and give advice. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this was one of the most pleasant experiences I have had. We were in room 210 which was on the ground floor conveniently located near the lobby and dining area.

I am happy to report that the property remains in great form and continues to provide excellent service and access to the great food beverage benefits of Yountvile. The wonderful rooms especially the cottage suites still provide good amenities large living space and great bed. I will not restate the many positive reviews touting the breakfast and afternoon tea. I will reiterate the that service across the board remains excellent. Its worth noting that the Vintage Inn and sister propoerty Vilagio were recently purchased by a large commercial developer property company. I understand that Vilagio is in great need to refreshing. The Vintage will benefit from a revamped lobby lounge area and pool area. While these areas are decent now they will surely be quite improved following the winter renovation. Hopefully they will also spruce up the fitness room which is the one area I found to be sub par for a top resort. if you are planning a winter visit to the property I had check on the level of service ambiance disruption during the renovations. Side note. One somewhat unpleasant surprise this visit was the number of families with kids at the property. I have kids and adore them but I do not go to wine country to hang out with them. I am mystified that people would choose to bring their kids to Napa seems like there are many far better kid friendly choices. The only real downside was that the pool area was less relaxing with kids playing and splashing about.

We were upgraded to stay at this nice property on October 27 and 28th. We had originally made plans to stay at the sister property Vilagio but the hotel contacted us and asked to upgrade us to a villa here since their bookings were down after the North Bay fires. We agreed sight unseen expecting that this would indeed be a better room than what we would have at Vilagio. The staff is superb everyone working there is nice helpful polite smiling and hardworking. I can not say enough about how wonderful they were. Room wise the bed was amazing brand new and perfect. The room was well appointed but strangely lacked a bathtub something I was disappointed in. The double showers were really nice but there was only one mirror over one side of the double sink area which meant my husband and I had to take turns getting ready for the day evening. The toilet is also completely exposed meaning no one could use the bathroom without closing off the entire bathroom suite. I understand that the reasons for all of these missing pieces in an expensive hotel is simply the configuration of the original property would not allow for it but still it is a bit unusual to pay for a luxury room and not have these amenities. The room also happened to be located next to the main Yountvile drag which did have some late night truck traffic noise but nothing drastic or too loud. Finally the morning breakfast buffet is excellent and complimentary and held in a gorgeous magnificent room. The grounds pool fireplaces etc. make this a must stay place if you are coming for more than just a day or so.

Just stayed here from 25 January through 28 January. We were here as part of a group for a corporate retreat so I did not have any input on the choice of destination and after coming on here to read the reviews after learning where we were staying I will be honest I was a little concerned however after our arrival my concerns began to quickly dissipate. We were properly greeted by the valet staff and yes they are young but you have to admit parking cars and loading and off loading luggage is a bit of a young persons job and I who had biased myself by reading reviews was going to be more than critical and I thought they were fine and did a great job even when I started giving them light hearted crap as I like to do I like to tease or joke with them a bit to see how stiff they are and let them know I am NOT stiff at all. and they took it like champs and gently returned the favour as I expected they initially should. The lobby it is modern just as many recent reviews describe but it was plenty warm on a very cold evening and no the fireplace was not lit as it looks to have been converted to gas and has a bunch of candles in it anyway but as a California resident I have to wonder if through their renovation permit they did not have to convert the fireplace as the formerly fine state of California is now a horribly regressive nanny state which I suspect in a matter of a couple more years will tell us how often we can even change undergarments and the only reason the fireplaces in the rooms are left as are is likely due to the fact the room renovations are redecorations rather than renovations and as soon as something requiring a permit is done to the rooms you can kiss the fireplaces there goodbye as well. but this is the fault of the California Communist Party which now has full control of all branches of government in California and has for quite some time not the fault of the new management of the hotel hopefully management will respond and clarify if this is indeed the case. Now for the rooms. We did have a second story room with a fireplace and the vaulted ceiling which was very nice. The bed side lights do have a pretty annoying flicker problem even when on full power so we just lit our fireplace and had firelight. We also had a Jacuzi tub in our bathroom which I know from talking to some of the other members of our group is not true of all of the rooms so I guess we got lucky and I was more than happy to use the tub as I do have rheumatoid arthritis and greatly appreciated the tub. We also did have a vanity with twin sinks and a mirror which covered the full length of the vanity contrary to some of the reviews I had previously read so I do not know if these are changes which have been made or just variations of the rooms. As for squeaky sheets I do not know our bed was so bloody comfy I think we were both out with mere seconds of hitting the sheets or maybe it was all of the wine booze and food we were consuming nah I will stick with comfy bed that does NOT have squeaky sheets. another previous review myth busted. I will agree the rooms are white on white on white with a wee touch of grey so they really could use a pop of some colour or better yet it would be really nice in the upper story rooms to see the beams restored to a natural wood colour or something as is the current decorating trend anyway but this is truly a really nit picky thing to harp on when the rooms were quite well appointed and comfortable. The only item I really would like to have had was a desk of sorts as I said I was actually there for business and believe it or not I do actually get my work done which was a bit difficult with no desk of any sort. The hotel staff was wonderful through and through. Every staff member I interacted with was very helpful and friendly genuinely friendly. Whoever is the actual property manager should be quite proud of the staff he or she has as they are a good bunch of people. My only complaint is you need to get the fellas some pants which fit rather than the high water pants they wear they looked like Santas elves had been painted grey and transplanted for the ofseason 0. A shame as they are a top notch staff at least let them look decent. I know there were a lot of reviews regarding the changes to the breakfast as well. having not experienced the previous breakfast I can only speculate however what I will say is I always love an omelet bar and it would be an amazing addition to the breakfast. Otherwise fruit yogurt cheese cured meats bagels and lox cereal and some scramble eggs seemed adequate to start your day. My only other real complaint is the lack of an actual bar on property. It would be nice on a rainy day to be able to go to a bar on property without the need to walk somewhere else. They do set up a decent bar in the lobby in the evenings on the weekends but during the week you are on your own. All in all both my wife and I really enjoyed are stay and would absolutely go back. I know for some long time patrons change is hard to accept but not knowing what it was like previously I only have this visit to judge the stay on and while I do feel the hotel is overpriced I think the accommodations are nice and I would go back.", "offset": [973, 1775], "date": "2018-01-29", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "73c102e1-fd85-477b-a28c-7601869ba4e8", "sentence": "Breakfast skimp.

We were booked for two nights at the Vintage House. When we got to the hotel one hour prior to the official 4 PM check in time our room was n\u2019t ready so the valet took our luggage and bags and placed them into a closet in the lobby area with several other bags and suitcases. At 4 PM we were advised our room was ready and that our luggage and bags would be brought to the room shortly. When I got to the room which was located next to the rear parking lot as well as Highway 29 I was impressed with the interior upgrades to the room. Good job. The wooden stairs leading up to the room however looked like the original stairs from when the hotel was originally built. The wood was splintering and nails screws were coming out of the wood in different places. While waiting in the room for our luggage to be delivered I could hear the vehicular traffic noise from Highway 29 which was close to the back of the hotel. After waiting 20 minutes for our luggage my wife called the clerk at the front desk to see where our luggage was located. She was advised the luggage was on its way. After waiting 35 minutes for our luggage I walked down the stairs and encountered the luggage valet with only a portion of our luggage. I told him that he did not have all of our luggage. He said that is what was given to him. I helped him take the luggage up to the room and then we went back together to the luggage closet to look for the rest of our luggage. After looking in the closet for my bags I could understand why items could be left behind. After we turned off the TV around 11 PM on the first night of our stay we could still hear the traffic noise from Highway 29. There was n\u2019t that much traffic at that time of night but the vehicles that were on the highway were noisy enough to make sleeping difficult. I did not bring any earplugs thinking I would n\u2019t need them for a room that cost 500 per night. When we left the room in the morning around 9 AM I noticed a tray with some dishes drinking glasses and cloth napkins sitting on the ground outside of the room just below our room. I really did n\u2019t think much about it until I saw the same tray of dishes sitting there in the evening hours of our second night stay. We had their included breakfast which had a nice selection of items and tasted very good. The room was cleaned in a timely manner and the maid did a great job cleaning it. Our second and final night in our room was n\u2019t any better traffic noise wise than the first night. We tried to fall asleep but the traffic noise was just too much for us. We checked out of the room around midnight and when I returned the plastic rooms keys to check out the man behind the front desk never asked me if we enjoyed our stay or anything else for that matter.

My wife and I spent two nights at Vintage House on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and it was our second time at this hotel. Although we had a good trip we were disappointed that our stay was not nearly as good as last time when the hotel was still Vintage Inn. We concluded that the renovations and re branding from Vintage Inn to Vintage House do n\u2019t really add much to the experience and we were disappointed to find that several amenities have been cheapened or completely removed since our stay two years ago. Despite this since the property is nice and the location in Yountvile is perfect it may still be worth considering. Arrival Experience Since we had such an exceptional stay when the hotel was still the Vintage Inn and we fell in love with the town of Yountvile almost instantly on that previous trip we did n\u2019t even think twice about booking the property again this time especially since we received an email offer with a very good discounted rate for repeat guests. We were excited to arrive at the hotel and see what changes had been made to transform the French country Vintage Inn into the more modern Vintage House. The main lobby building looked totally different from before with a newly whitewashed brick exterior a sleeker and more modern feel and now even valet parking and a doorman features that were n\u2019t present last time we were there. The interior of the lobby was all new now larger and more open with a modern aesthetic in white gray and purple tones. My wife and I were both impressed when we saw the new lobby since it definitely had a more substantial feel than the previous one. Although the old lobby was cozier it was too small so we liked the new expanded space. The friendly staff stood out to us on our last stay and they still seemed nice this time. We had less interaction with staff on this trip but the doorman was really friendly every time we entered or exited the lobby and the front desk staff member who checked us in was nice welcoming us back to the hotel and offering lots of information including a discount card for certain local wineries. I think it would be helpful to let guests know about the wineries where they can obtain discounts in advance as it would be good information to know at the earlier planning stages of a trip. We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around noon and were excited to find out that our room was ready early so that we could get settled in before an afternoon of wine tastings. Room On our last stay we booked a basic Deluxe King room and had an excellent room in one of the closest buildings to the lobby overlooking the pool. We were hoping for something similar this time especially because we were staying midweek when the hotel did n\u2019t seem overly crowded. We booked the same Deluxe King room again and we were given a room on the second floor of one of the buildings further from the lobby overlooking the parking lot and busy Route 29 Room 605. We ended up being very disappointed with our room location. The way the buildings are set up they are scattered on the hotel \u2019s property between the main street of Yountvile Washington Street and busy Route 29 which serve as the boundaries of the property on either side. Parking is all along the back of the property on the Route 29 side which is what our room faced. It was disappointing to have a bad view of the parking lot and also to be so close to Route 29 which made our room quite noisy at all times of day and night. Even though we booked a basic Deluxe Room which are billed as being on the edges of the property we thought there had to have been a better room in that category especially at a time when the hotel was n\u2019t full. In fact when we \u2019d walk around the hotel at night or early in the morning it was particularly obvious that many rooms were empty because the housekeeping staff would leave rooms fully lit with TVs on overnight basically prepared for new guests at all times. This seemed odd and wasteful and we saw rooms remain empty our entire stay but always with lights and the TV on. We were excited to see what the newly renovated rooms looked like especially since we felt that the rooms were in great condition two years ago before any renovation. The rooms do have a lot of nice features like hardwood floors a very large balcony a wood burning fireplace and lots of windows on all sides for natural light. However we were a little surprised at how little the room d\u00e9cor had changed for a hotel that has supposedly undergone renovations and re branding. From what we could tell all they had done since our last stay was very cosmetic. They replaced the area rug on the floor swapped in a new armchair and settee and added some new lighting and artwork along with painting the natural wood paneling on the ceiling white. None of this really made much difference aside for removing some of the original character and going for a more streamlined and modern look. However since the exterior of the buildings and grounds still have such a classic and cozy look and the rooms still have warmer colored wood floors and an older stone fireplace the room just ended up looking mismatched even though it was nice. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you \u2019l probably find the rooms to be nice but for those who have it was a little bit of a letdown. We liked it before and do n\u2019t think anything has improved. If anything some of the charm was actually removed and there \u2019s a bit of an identity crisis. It \u2019s unclear what theme or feel they \u2019re going for even though the previous d\u00e9cor was very clearly meant to be a cozy French country feel throughout. The bathroom was one of our favorite parts of the room last time. During that stay we had a huge bathroom with an enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family with two separate showerheads at either end of the shower. Disappointingly instead of having the same type of shower our room this time had a deep jetted jacuzi tub which we did n\u2019t have much interest in using and which also doubled as the shower. It was such an odd shower setup since it was so deep to get into and it was so open with shower water getting all over the bathroom while showering. It was also clear that the tub was n\u2019t meant to double as a shower since the way the showerhead was placed you would have to stand right on the tub drain in order to be under the water. It made for an awkward shower experience and all we really wanted was the shower back from last time. Beyond the shower the bathroom featured a large vanity with double sinks and plenty of storage for toiletries underneath or on the counter. The previous L\u2019Ocitane toiletries that we liked were replaced with new ones that were uninteresting. The bathrooms generally do have a nice look with white subway tile and natural stone floors that feel updated but this was already in place before the renovation. Some other features of the room are great such as the wood burning fireplace that is easy to operate with a log and matches ready to go. We also appreciated the twice daily room cleaning with turndown service with delicious Kolar chocolates. It was also nice that a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room when we returned from dinner on the first night a nice bottle from Hill Family Estate along with a note thanking us for returning for another stay. All rooms used to contain a free bottle of wine upon check in so I \u2019m not sure if we only received one this time because we were return guests. Despite having a bad view and highway noise our balcony was pleasant and large with new outdoor furniture to go with the modern theme which included a modern swing and daybed. I would recommend requesting a room on the second floor since it gets you vaulted ceilings which contribute to a feeling of spaciousness. The only negative to the second floor is that there are no elevators so you \u2019l have to carry all luggage up the exterior stairs to get to the room. Another thing I would note is to be aware of which blinds are open in your room. The hotel is designed with all exterior corridors as well as each room having windows on multiple sides which is really nice for getting plenty of natural light. However it also means you might find something like a big window in your bathroom directly overlooking an exterior corridor where others could walk by. Despite being a little disappointed with our room I do appreciate that the rooms here feel more like a comfortable guest room in someone \u2019s home not a generic hotel room. The buildings have character and the rooms clearly are not all the same since we had totally different room shapes and sizes between our two stays. If we returned I would be more specific in requesting the room features we prefer. Grounds Amenities Location. The grounds at Vintage House are wonderfully park like and pretty. There is essentially one main courtyard in the middle that most rooms open onto which features well manicured landscaping and fountains. It \u2019s a small enough property that you can walk from one end to the other in about two or three minutes and all rooms are relatively convenient to the main parking lot that runs behind the property on the Highway 29 side. Being in Yountvile is a huge bonus of this hotel. Yountvile is perfectly cute with great restaurants shops and tasting rooms within walking distance. Vintage House is right in the center with world renowned restaurants like the French Laundry less than a block away. Other Thomas Keller restaurants that we enjoy such as Bouchon and Ad Hoc are also in very easy walking distance. The hotel is technically part of something called the \u201c The Estate \u201d which is essentially just Vintage House its sister hotel Vilagio that \u2019s down the street and the V Marketplace shopping area that is between them. In addition to liking the quaint feel of Yountvile we find Yountvile to be particularly convenient for visiting wineries. When driving up either the Silverado Trail or Route 29 the main concentration of wineries does n\u2019t really begin until you hit Yountvile and the towns going north. As far as amenities there is an outdoor pool and hot tub. The pool area is attractive but we did n\u2019t have time to use it. It \u2019s located right outside of the lobby and appears to have been renovated with new seating in keeping with the modern aesthetic. There were also fire pits by the pool at night that looked nice. The spa for the hotel is over by the Vilagio which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. It looks very nice from walking by but we have n\u2019t had a chance to try it. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t have a restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are so many highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. However a complimentary breakfast is offered to all guests each morning. This was another area where we were very disappointed in changes that have been made since our last stay. The breakfast used to be offered in the lobby but when we were there it was in the Groezinger Estate House building on the end of the property by the lobby which appears to normally be some sort of event space. We were told they were having the breakfast there because Vilagio guests were coming to Vintage House for breakfast while their lobby is under construction. I thought the space itself was nice for breakfast still decorated in the old French country look we preferred and offering lots of tables in a couple of different rooms as well as outdoor seating. A huge thing we loved about the hotel last time was that there were multiple hot options at breakfast each day including really good biscuits and gravy as well as a made to order omelet and waffle station and local champagne and various juices to make your own mimosas. It used to be a very sumptuous buffet for one that was included in the room rate. This time we found that the buffet selections had gone downhill significantly. The omelet waffle station is gone and the number of hot items offered is down to one each day it was some sort of quiche our first day that was cold and then scrambled eggs our second day. The make your own mimosas are gone and they \u2019re now instead selling them for 12 each along with coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos for a fee. Other than one hot item per day the breakfast now basically just includes a selection of pastries as well fresh fruit yogurt and charcuterie a relatively simple continental breakfast. Maybe I was just annoyed about the changes but I thought the pastries even went downhill from last time. I recalled them being very high quality but found them to be relatively basic and unremarkable this time. It \u2019s nice that breakfast is included but it \u2019s become the style of one you \u2019d find in a very basic hotel not one of this class. It may be presented nicely in a nice space but it \u2019s nothing special beyond that. We were also disappointed to find that the hotel no longer offers afternoon tea. Last time we enjoyed stopping in the lobby in the afternoon for some lemonade tea cookies and scones which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. There was no mention of this feature this time and we saw no evidence of it so I assume it \u2019s been yet another fatality of the \u201c upgrade \u201d from Vintage Inn to Vintage House. Overall I know we had a bunch of complaints but overall we did have a nice enough stay at Vintage House and a great trip to the Napa Valley. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you will probably like this small hotel that is well maintained and in a great location. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. However as past guests we were expecting to come back to find the same level of quality if not better knowing that the hotel had been renovated since our last stay. Instead we found a hotel that has definitely not decreased its rates but has definitely decreased what it offers guests. While I left last time ready to recommend this hotel to anyone going to the area I would be more hesitant this time. The rates are far from cheap for a hotel that seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis with very few of its unique extras left. Next time we will probably try somewhere new. Changes have taken an exceptional property and made it much less remarkable. To earn loyalty in a town with so many great options Vintage House needs to up their game or very simply restore some of the services they had in the past.", "offset": [2789, 2978], "date": "2018-11-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "6c4c7214-eb49-44ed-939f-61b66df5f635", "sentence": "Still Nice Used to be Better. My wife and I spent two nights at Vintage House on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and it was our second time at this hotel. Although we had a good trip we were disappointed that our stay was not nearly as good as last time when the hotel was still Vintage Inn. We concluded that the renovations and re branding from Vintage Inn to Vintage House do n\u2019t really add much to the experience and we were disappointed to find that several amenities have been cheapened or completely removed since our stay two years ago. Despite this since the property is nice and the location in Yountvile is perfect it may still be worth considering. Arrival Experience Since we had such an exceptional stay when the hotel was still the Vintage Inn and we fell in love with the town of Yountvile almost instantly on that previous trip we did n\u2019t even think twice about booking the property again this time especially since we received an email offer with a very good discounted rate for repeat guests. We were excited to arrive at the hotel and see what changes had been made to transform the French country Vintage Inn into the more modern Vintage House. The main lobby building looked totally different from before with a newly whitewashed brick exterior a sleeker and more modern feel and now even valet parking and a doorman features that were n\u2019t present last time we were there. The interior of the lobby was all new now larger and more open with a modern aesthetic in white gray and purple tones. My wife and I were both impressed when we saw the new lobby since it definitely had a more substantial feel than the previous one. Although the old lobby was cozier it was too small so we liked the new expanded space. The friendly staff stood out to us on our last stay and they still seemed nice this time. We had less interaction with staff on this trip but the doorman was really friendly every time we entered or exited the lobby and the front desk staff member who checked us in was nice welcoming us back to the hotel and offering lots of information including a discount card for certain local wineries. I think it would be helpful to let guests know about the wineries where they can obtain discounts in advance as it would be good information to know at the earlier planning stages of a trip. We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around noon and were excited to find out that our room was ready early so that we could get settled in before an afternoon of wine tastings. Room On our last stay we booked a basic Deluxe King room and had an excellent room in one of the closest buildings to the lobby overlooking the pool. We were hoping for something similar this time especially because we were staying midweek when the hotel did n\u2019t seem overly crowded. We booked the same Deluxe King room again and we were given a room on the second floor of one of the buildings further from the lobby overlooking the parking lot and busy Route 29 Room 605. We ended up being very disappointed with our room location. The way the buildings are set up they are scattered on the hotel \u2019s property between the main street of Yountvile Washington Street and busy Route 29 which serve as the boundaries of the property on either side. Parking is all along the back of the property on the Route 29 side which is what our room faced. It was disappointing to have a bad view of the parking lot and also to be so close to Route 29 which made our room quite noisy at all times of day and night. Even though we booked a basic Deluxe Room which are billed as being on the edges of the property we thought there had to have been a better room in that category especially at a time when the hotel was n\u2019t full. In fact when we \u2019d walk around the hotel at night or early in the morning it was particularly obvious that many rooms were empty because the housekeeping staff would leave rooms fully lit with TVs on overnight basically prepared for new guests at all times. This seemed odd and wasteful and we saw rooms remain empty our entire stay but always with lights and the TV on. We were excited to see what the newly renovated rooms looked like especially since we felt that the rooms were in great condition two years ago before any renovation. The rooms do have a lot of nice features like hardwood floors a very large balcony a wood burning fireplace and lots of windows on all sides for natural light. However we were a little surprised at how little the room d\u00e9cor had changed for a hotel that has supposedly undergone renovations and re branding. From what we could tell all they had done since our last stay was very cosmetic. They replaced the area rug on the floor swapped in a new armchair and settee and added some new lighting and artwork along with painting the natural wood paneling on the ceiling white. None of this really made much difference aside for removing some of the original character and going for a more streamlined and modern look. However since the exterior of the buildings and grounds still have such a classic and cozy look and the rooms still have warmer colored wood floors and an older stone fireplace the room just ended up looking mismatched even though it was nice. If you \u2019ve never stayed here before you \u2019l probably find the rooms to be nice but for those who have it was a little bit of a letdown. We liked it before and do n\u2019t think anything has improved. If anything some of the charm was actually removed and there \u2019s a bit of an identity crisis. It \u2019s unclear what theme or feel they \u2019re going for even though the previous d\u00e9cor was very clearly meant to be a cozy French country feel throughout. The bathroom was one of our favorite parts of the room last time. During that stay we had a huge bathroom with an enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family with two separate showerheads at either end of the shower. Disappointingly instead of having the same type of shower our room this time had a deep jetted jacuzi tub which we did n\u2019t have much interest in using and which also doubled as the shower.
