We went to the little bar at the front of the hotel next to thr cromwell n the drinks were pretty reasonable and the bar staff were lovelyWe also had a couple of nights inside the mexican restaurant which turns into a pretty cool bar on the evening with a fab dj and an open bar for 25 or 30 for branded drinkscanot think of the name off the top of my head but u ca nt miss it just down the few steps from the check in desk. will update when i remember the namefab atmosphere in there if not looking for a heavy night of clubingWe got charged 2x extra for connecting phones to the wifi which we did nt do but tbh the que for check out was huge that it would have held us up when trying to get to the airportUber picks you up just by the main taxi rank at the back of check in. Another handy tip is that we found the address for a dollar tree store and the uber worked out about \u00a3 6 each way n wa definitely worth it to stock up on soda and chips etc and their was also a target on the same retail parkwe got stuff litrualy at a fraction of the price from off the strip 2ltr bottle of sprite cost 7 off the strip.

Upgrade helped but this place needs work. Let me start this review by providing a disclaimer I rate properties on value. It not fair to compare lower grade hotels and resorts to higher as it is just not apples to apples. But an experience can be rated by whether is meets or exceeds expectations. We are not above staying anywhere or too good to stay in some places but we believe it is fair to expect to at least get what you pay for. Realizing we were late to get into a hotel on the strip during CES we knew availability would be limited and prices would be inflated but never did we expect to land in a basically condemned room for 450night. Again we would have been happy to stay in a room this bad had we paid 80 night and we are not even sure it was worth that. We got in late so after dinner and some meetings we did not have a chance to really see the hotel room we were assigned at the Flamingo until it was too late and we were too exhausted to be able to do anything about it on the first night. Kudos to the auto check in kiosks though which helped circumvent a long check in line. It was apparent that the room and wing of the Flamingo we were staying in was an older more dilapidated part of the property. This is fine though and almost adds to that classic and vintage Vegas strip ambiance really part of the Flamingos appeal. The room was lack luster at it was best not to imagine what a black light might reveal. But again we were okay with what seemed like a decent room for the 450night rate paid. But then the next morning we wake up and start getting ready for some more meetings and click the lights on in the bathroom. The completely unacceptable condition of the bathroom can not be adequately described. You will have to refer to our photos to see the absolutely appalling and disgusting neglect of cleaning and maintenance. It is not as if the room had not been cleaned since the last guest it is more so the room had not been visited in years. The worst part was the significant amount of rust and paint peeling off the shower ceiling and a shower air duct vent so neglected it must have had years of dust and mold built up on its slats. You will have to see the photo to believe it. Maybe the hotel decided to open up some rooms that were slated for renovation or maybe they thought they could see who could be taken advantage of given the high room demand during CES. Either way it was bad enough for us to take our grievances to hotel management. We showed these very same photos to a receptionist who had an immediate visceral reaction. She quickly called a manager over who reviewed the photos and decided on the spot to upgrade us to a suite. This was a very nice and appreciated gesture and the only reason this rating is not 15. The new room was fantastic and definitely improved the rest of our stay but we could not shake the disgust of the original experience paired with the fact that the hotel may have fully known the conditions of this room and decided to book it anyway. If there can be anything positive to say it was that the new room was nice definitely clean and did not look like there was mold blowing out of the vents onto you while you shower. Also the receptionist and the manager were very sympathetic and quick to remedy the situation. Still a guest paying 450night or event over 100 night should never be put into that situation in the first place. We did have the opportunity to check out some great restaurants and bars while in Vegas which will warrant their own reviews as to not lump them into the experience at the Flamingo. Our advice inspect your room fully upon checking in and before hopping into the showerChers.", "offset": [1757, 1877], "date": "2018-01-19 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "6e4290f4-2826-4965-96ad-3399126f5708", "sentence": "Fabulous Flamingo Upgrades.

Perhaps a few dollars each day helps but I feel like that should be given if your room is up to your expectations anyways. The buffet was excellent. The staff were helpful check in was not time consuming at all and although our room was not ready for an early check in as we had requested they took our bags and stored them and reserved a room with a view for us for peace of mind at regular check in time.

It \u2019s been quite awhile since we \u2019ve stayed here and the changes are very apparent to us.

They have 16 18 stations and only 3 people working and we were 11th in line. The clerk said that they \u2019re hoping people will utilize the kiosk check in instead.

No I did n\u2019t want to pay more so they gave us a room with 2 queen overlooking the Habitat. The room. well it like other areas has n\u2019t been updated in some time. The furnishings are dated showing their age and it \u2019s obvious that they have n\u2019t painted or cleaned the carpets in some time.

Because they used quality materials years ago much still looks ok but the soft furnishings are wearing and the hardscapes in the habitat are in rough shape in areas.
