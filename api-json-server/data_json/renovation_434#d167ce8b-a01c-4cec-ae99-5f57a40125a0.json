I do not want to sound repetitive regarding the other reviews but I wanted to add my two cents. My wife and I were there for 5 nights and it was a great stay. I will start with a minor annoyance. When we arrived we were given a room that smelled a bit musty but we figured hey it is hot humid and figured the air conditioning on high would do the trick but still smelled in the morning. So I went to the front desk explained to the woman at I think her name was Vania sorry if that is wrong. she apologized profusely and she quickly accommodated us and gave us different room on the top floor with an ocean view. A nice consolation and the room smelled much better. With that said all things considered the rest of our stay was amazing. The food was plentiful and fantastic. All the specialty restaurants on the money with again great food. Tropical drinks plentiful and tasty. But in my opinion what makes this place top notch is the people and the service they provide. I never once saw a staff member standing idly by doing nothing they all seemed like energizer bunnies eagerly waiting on the guests. I especially want to single out Claudio a beach pool waiter who never stopped moving and made sure we were well taken care of not just us but all of the guests nearby. All in all a great experience. Also the shows a night were very good a nice surprise. Will be definitely going back. As far as what others mentioned about the place needing an update I agree but upon checkout I was told the place is about to go through a renovation which is an even bigger incentive to return. do not let that discourage you from staying here it is clean and well maintained. One suggestion to management softer beds and nicer pillows. Looking forward to returning with some friends and family enjoy your stay if you are planning a trip here.

Let me begin by stating my wife and I are Fiesta Americana Vacation Club member. We have only been members for a few years and usually go to Fiesta Americana in Cabo which we absolutely love so most of this review is based upon expectations from the Cabo resort. We stayed at Condesa August 12 through August 15 just a short stay with our two boys \u2019 ages 14 and 12. From the numerous reviews we read our expectations were high and anticipated staying at a 4 star resort. Upon arrival the resort was aesthetically pleasing and we were greeted by staff which assisted with our luggage. As stated by other reviews the lobby has no air conditioning and it was extremely muggy. Check in was a simple process but we were a little early so we had to wait an hour or so before our two rooms were ready. We decided to grab some lunch Cevicheria near the pool and beach area. The food was average at best compared to the Cabo location and the bartender immediately attempted to upsel us after we ordered a margarita with Blanco Silver tequila. He eventually stated they did offer one brand of Blanco tequila. While awaiting our room to be ready we also discovered what other reviews had mentioned the construction noise was present throughout the resort. The main portion of the structure one complete building is under construction and there were numerous workers chipping away at the surface of the building. Throughout our stay the workers are busy from very early in the morning until shortly before nightfall. The rooms appeared to have not been updated in decades the shower area was extremely small and the water pressure from the shower head was not consistent. The beds appeared to be several years old and the pillows were extremely firm. The in room refrigerator always had cold water and beer. Sunday was a complete rain out for the entire day which left us looking for ways to pass the day. While walking through the resort you could n\u2019t walk too far before having to walk around numerous buckets which were holding water from the countless leaks coming from the roof. The main check in area had to put plastic bags over all the computers due to leak issues this is definitely not what we expected from Fiesta Americana. At one point we took our boys to the \u201c Teen Club \u201d which was another huge disappointment. The felt on the pool table had been torn in several places and patched back together. The fosbal table was covered in water obviously from another leak and the young lady working in the area was unable to locate a ball for the ping pong table when she did find the ball it was cut and not functional. These may all seem trivial but they are items which could be resolved with minimal cost but no there seem to care. On a positive note we did enjoy meals at Rosato and San Telmo. It was somewhat odd that there was a dress code pants and closed toe shoes for men at Rosato but not at Telmo. The beach area access at the resort is extremely nice with beautiful white sandy beaches and blue water. The time we spent there was quite enjoyable and the wait staff did a great job of ensuring we were taken care of. In addition the pool area was quite enjoyable other than the competing music from the swim up bar area and the infinity pool area. It would have made much more sense just to have one music option playing. We wished the outside casual dining option near the pool areas would have stayed open longer in the afternoon most closed around 5 pm with at least a few hours of pool time left in the day. In closing I really hate to be so negative but having stayed at another Fiesta Americana resort our expectations were extremely high and Condesa did not deliver. The resort has lots of potential but a major renovation of the entire structure is a must. Some of the management staff from Condesa should visit Cabo and see what a real all inclusive resort should be like.", "offset": [1558, 1712], "date": "2016-08-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "311ba9ea-df16-4eb8-9510-f928a131635a", "sentence": "Best Food EVER.

They played soccer on the beach pool volleyball huge pool water balloon fight hung at the Teen Center a few evenings playing air hockey and pool with other twens teens enjoyed the parade of entertainment by the pool etc. The one thing that definitely stands out to me is the quality of the food. as a vegan I am PICKY. Not one time was I told they could not accommodate my requests and even times I was not sure they would check and come back to clarify an ingredient or suggest an accommodation with a SMILE. Overall this resort is MADE by the amazing employees that all genuinely LOVE their jobs. One told me there is no drama here. it gets boring sometimes. My kids agreed we have to give several shout outs to the staff that truly went above and beyond. Jefrey and Gaby in entertainment by the pool were so professional yet super fun at the same time. Carlos and Adrian at the pool bar knew my sons order and made sure to make my drinks with coconut milk instead of any dairy. Claudio and Jonathan delivered drinks waters lunch from the Cevicheria or homemade pizza. they were so attentive. Our visit was OVER THE TOP because of Uriel who first brought up our bags. he guided us with pointers from transportation to Tulum private driver and opened coconuts for the kids and always was coming just to give a handshake accompanied by his beaming smile.

That said if you want to change rooms beds floors during your stay we switched the day after we checked in. they are more than happy to reassign your room with their shifting inventory. We all ended up in the Sea Tower which is modern and gorgeous \u2013 but beware the Moon Tower is in dire need of renovation \u2013. BUT I understand that will happen this upcoming January. The property is a wonderful size \u2013 big enough to feel expansive but small enough to locate each other easily and give the kids some independence to swim in the pools or eat together on their own. The pools and activities were great but the surf was usually too rough to let our kids swim solo which was fine because the water was so clean and quite warm so we all wanted to hit the beach anyway. The teens club had lots of game tables but revolved around screen video watching. playing so we limited our kids time in there and suggested that it would be nice if there were some organized twen teen excursions offered during the week that parents could pay for at an additional charge like swimming with dolphins or going to Xcaret park. The evening shows were a lot of fun and a higher quality than what we expected and just the right length at about an hour apiece \u2013 and always ample seating so you do not have to scramble to get a seat or sit together. The food was fantastic \u2013 fresh creative varied \u2013 and the staff was excellent \u2013 special shout out to Juan Jose Hernandez Palomec and smiley Tony at Kalmia \u2013 where I highly recommend the Mexican coffee and fresh pressed cornmeal fajitas with all the fixings to start your day. All the venues were interesting and fun to try \u2013 except the sushi seating area off the lobby is a little cold and uninviting. Almost every lunch we had ceviche and fish tacos at La Cevicheria \u2013 divine. Date night at San Telmo is a must. Alejandra Renovales with the Happy Smiles program was often on hand to see how they could improve our stay in any way \u2013 a truly lovely ambassador for the brand. Victor at the concierge station helped book all 19 of us for a full day deluxe trip to Chichen Itza which was so amazing \u2013 exhausting but worth every minute.

For example our breakfast waiter was Jose Luis Ochoa see photo. If you find a waiter you like it \u2019s a good idea to ask for that person the next time since they remember you and what you like. By the way if the person you want to remember is named Jose you will need to remember more than the first name since there are numerous Jose \u2019s. In this case Jose Luis Ochoa would remember that we both like decaf coffee muffins heated on the grill etc. Another person we would like to mention is Mr Ku see photo. In spite of his being high level management he is the embodiment of if he passes your table and there is used plate he himself picks it up. He does n\u2019t make you wait until your waiter returns. I love that hands on aspect that he and other managers practice. Finally Felipe Montalvo was the happiest man in sight. He had just become a grandfather for the first time.

I have never reviewed a resort before and have been to Mexico many times but I felt obligated to after our recent stay at the Fiesta Americana Condesa Cancun. This was our second stay at this resort and we would definitely visit again. We stayed here at the end of January and celebrated a 70th birthday while thereLet me begin with the resort. The resort is nearing completion of a major remodel which should be complete in the next couple months. They are renovating all of the rooms and the exterior facade. There are currently 2 buildings complete and they were working hard on the 3rd while we were there. The construction noise was not bad and was only noticeable when you were at the upper pool but even then it was not that bad and we did spend a couple days at the upper pool because it was heated which is nice. The exterior of the buildings turned out really nice. The room renovations were also nice but they definitely lack a little privacy. This normally would not be an issue but we shared a room with my mother in law. The rooms could have been set up slightly different and this issue would have been resolved. Also no bathtub in our room which is not really an issue but it could be for some. Overall they did a really good job on the remodel. The staff was great. I started emailing Daniel at the concierge months before the trip to confirm the type of room and plan for my mother in laws 70th. He was great to work with and helped us surprise her with a bottle of champagne and cake in the room after our dinner. See attached pictures. The activity staff was great and especially Gabriela. We did a wine tasting overlooking the ocean one evening a margarita making class another day then made a cool pineapple drink on another afternoon. All activities were fun and short and were a nice break from roasting in the sun on the beach or near the pool. This is a pretty laid back resort as you can tell by some of the activities but we loved it. We are not huge party people and this resort was perfect for us. I have one more person I would like to thank for his excellent service. Eligio at the breakfast restaurant was by far the best and made use feel special every morning. We looked forward to seeing him and were sad to leave him on our last day. He takes pride in his work really cares about his job and goes the extra mile to make sure his guests are taken care of. Ask to be seated in his area at breakfast. I hope management notices because he deserves a promotionRestaurants the restaurants were very good as a whole. I would say Kambu was our least favorite restaurant because the service was not as good and the options also were not as good as the other restaurants. It was still good but we only ate there once for this reason. The San Telmo Steakhouse was our favorite restaurant but they do require reservations the day before. The Italian restaurant Rosato was a close second and was also very good. We also ate at the buffet a couple nights and the Mexican restaurant one other night. One thing that could be improved on is the desserts at all of the restaurants. There were several options but we never really found one that we loved. Overall I would still rate the restaurants as very good though. We ate at the cevicheria wood fired pizza restaurant or grill every day for lunch. The fish tacos were my favorite and had them most days along with a shot of Don Julio. One tip they have a fondue restaurant that was not advertised near where the shows are performed. We found it while heading to the show on the second night. The shows that we made it to were entertaining and not too long which was perfect. I know this will make me sound old but it would be nice if they had more shows that started at 80. Currently all shows start at 90 which probably does not work for families with young children. I would recommend the Mexican show magic show and fire show. The resort is located right on the beach and is easily accessible within a couple minutes which is nice because why else would you go to Cancun. We love spending time at the beach and they have a beach bar so you do not have to go back up to the resort to get drinks. This resort is perfect.

I did not like them at all girlfriend said they were ok the room safe Ugh I complained about this everyday the safe was mounted on the left hand side of the wall in the closet and the door swung out so you could not see inside the safe. You had to duck down under the door to see inside. nightlife. Probabaly the biggest thing that we did not like about the resort. They did have some good nightlife bands on several nights but those were only for conferences and special functions we often watched these from our balcony. As for everyone else after the 9 pm show there was nothing just the lobby bar with maybe a guitar or keyboard player that is it. B O R I N G There was also the cantina bar which was dead they need to convert this into some sort of night spot. Thus overall great food service pool they just need some work on the nightlife and I would easily bump this to 5 stars. If you do not care about nightlife you will give it 5 stars. Everyone wants to know what booze they have.

We were celebrating our 46th wedding anniversary and the FAC out did themselves showing us a great time. They upgraded us to an ocean front room with a balcony and gave us VIP braclets. From the swan and rose petals on the bed when we got to our room the bottles of champagne we received thru the week and the beautiful rice art. They even had a wooden name plate on our door. Thru out the week we received dessert or fruit plates in the evening. It was great. Claudia Eligio were the perfect pool side servers. Always there with another drink. J is the perfect server at Kalmia. Always there with a hug and a smile. Carlo at the pool bar was terrific. I just wish I could remember everyone \u2019s name. The Chefs Table dinner was fantastic. A great evening with new friends. We met people from all over made lots of great new friends. Already planning on meeting up with 6 8 of them next year at the Fiesta Americana Condesa. Same time next year. And I ca n\u2019t forget Fernanda. Fernanda is really the main reason we come back year after year. She has made us feel like we are family. She is always popping up to check on us and make sure we are having fun or needed anything. And the wonderful people who do the Social Media please forgive me but the names have slipped will know you when I see you tho. are the best. I can not name everyone but they all made us feel welcome. We did n\u2019t make all of the shows in the evening but the ones we did were great. The Fire show by the pool was fantastic. This resort is mostly all remodeled but what they are doing never bother us or interfered with anything. Very unobtrusive. All the restaurants were fantastic as usual. The pools are always clean and beautiful the beach is fantastic. The entire resort is spotlessly clean. All the drinks were top shelf. We are very much looking forward to next years trip to our home away from home the Fiesta Americana Condesa Cancun. This is a smaller resort very family oriented but not over run with children.

J and Durante welcomed us in the breakfast buffet and Mark was happy we were there early enough for his made to order omelet. As I said our time was short but we had a great time. Enjoyed Italian the first night with our new friends Nicole and Jef who I met on the Friends of FAC website. We enjoyed Mexican the next night. The restaurant was temporarily located to the lower buffet area during the remodel. Delicious short ribs and we used our 500 resort voucher on a delicious lobster seafood pot. Yum. Great sushi the next night that was relocated to the pool area and on our last night we enjoyed the Italian buffet. I am sorry I can not remember his name but the chef was wonderful. Upon hearing that I am gluten free he arrived at the table and gave me many options to choose from that he could prepare in the back. I way over ate with the delcilous pizza and pasta dish but so good. Then he surprised me with a special gluten free dessert. So much appreciated. The renovation continues but its no reason not to book your vacation. This time the lobby was under construction. We have watched them renovate over the last four years and they are in the final phase. They are working very hard to make this resort even better than what it was before and it was great before the renovation. Please do not pay attention to other reviews who say this is an inconvenience because it has not been. I can not say enough about this resort and the wonderful people we have met along the way. Book the trip and enjoy every moment. You will be glad you did. Big shout outs again to Fernanda who works hard and always takes time to get to know all of us a little bit better and always welcomes us back with open arms. Mark really enjoyed his birthday surprise in our room. Our friends Isidro Claudio Claudia Diego and Angel at the pool. Always nice to see our amigos again. And always great drinks. Chef Josue who always makes me the best gluten free lunches and always has something special for Mark also. The pineapple seafood dish was delicious. Jaimie in the Italian restaurant. Misael in the dinner buffet. Gabriele and Alfonso entertaining us at the pool everyday with aerobics or fun games. Luis and Victor H at the concierge. We had a wonderful couples message and use of the facilities that was very relaxing. Did not see any of the shows this time but spent more time in the Cantina watching the NBA playoffs.

Nice touches and the focus on going the extra mile for guests are indicative of excellent management.

Brenda did a wonderful job keeping our room immaculately clean and our room service requests were delivered quickly even though they were getting slammed due to frequent rains during our stay. The hotel utilized their arena for the World Cup game between Mexico and Germany great buffet spread and full bar service and it was one of the highlights of our stay. Our favorite chef Chef Josue Chelito created wonderful dishes for us and as always with his trademark infectious smile. Thank you Chef.

He delivers a level of service that sets the bar for his coworkers and his friend Angel is following in his footsteps.

The breakfast buffet had a good variety of options to pick from every morning some days bacon was available other days not. You can order mimosas at breakfast here.

So we decided to plan it at this resort. Once arriving I could already tell the friendliness of the employees was going to be great. They welcome you with open arms making sure you understand everything that they are explaining. Our wedding planner was violeta and let me tell you how awesome she is. She goes above and beyond making sure you do n\u2019t stress about a thing. She takes care of everything and makes sure everyone is punctual. I was so nervous about how the wedding would turn out but it was more than I had expected. We had a total of 50 guest attend our wedding. If you decide to have a wedding here or renew your vows I would definitely recommend this place. This is also a great place if you have kids. They treat you so so good. I hope to come back in the near future and celebrate our wedding anniversary.", "offset": [770, 866], "date": "2019-08-04", "cpt": "5", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 47, "uid": "b7511a04-b02d-4579-adfb-2f0d5a0409a1", "sentence": "Our Happy Place 6th time visiting this resort. Once again we just returned from another fabulous 7 day vacation at Fiesta Americana Condesa. Fernanda in the public relations department ensured our stay there was memorable. We reconected with many of the staff there including Rodalpho at the pool bar Isodora always kept our glasses full polside. Sexy Sophia and her cohorts in the entertainment department polside kept the party going. Pedro in the lobby bar was always there to greet you with a smile and conversation. The restaurants were fabulous as always. Luis made us fresh guacamole table side at the Mexican restaurant. Unfortunately we misplaced the card that was given to us at Rosatos but everyone there was fantastic. Our last night the chef personally greeted us as well as the manager. Our waiter and I am so sorry I can not remember his name. made us strawberries jubilee table side. It really made the evening special. You will never get the type of service we receive here anywhere in the USA. In keeping this review real we can not deny that we were more than a little disappointed that the Asian restaurant and swim up bar were closed for demolition and repairs. The sound of jack hammers and general construction was impossible to ignore. We know that hotels have to continually upgrade to keep things fresh and new. It just seems we have exceptionally bad luck. Last year they were renovating their lobby bar and the year before that the Mexican restaurant. Hopefully when we return next year the major construction jobs will be complete. That being said we have no reservations about returning here next year. One more thing I feel I need to say. The whole staff here work extremely hard to ensure everyone is enjoying their stay. We bring 100 ones and tip frequently throughout the week. This goes a long way to show just how much we really appreciate all the hard work they do.", "offset": [1384, 1479], "date": "2019-09-10", "cpt": "5", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 48, "uid": "63256cfd-d597-4df7-9c8b-e5da2e4beeaa", "sentence": "Food and service was fine Front desk bad service. This is a really nice resort but it is now under renovations and for that I think the rates should be lower having to hear all the machines banging. We booked through Southwest Airlines Vacations and was suppose to be VIP inclusive. We upgraded paying the additional fee for King Suite and was given a double bed and offered to push together with a balcony that I could barely get my whole foot on. I went to front desk to show them what we were suppose to have and demanded our right room they said they would change the rooms the next day in which they did. The new room was what we were suppose to have only now 2 days of no hot water or TV service we called down and went to front desk multiple times even spoke with manager Iris who was not accommodating at all kept giving us the run around saying it will be taken care of just to get us away from desk. Iris kept making promises that she did n\u2019t keep and rushed us out during check out after we asked why the hotel did n\u2019t call us about our troubles after we contacted Southwest Vacations and they told us they were. She just blew us off and told us we could wait downstairs for our luggage. Our confirmation also stated we \u2019d have a 50 Food beverage only credit not to be used on anything else. We got a 50 credit split up between multiple things as to make us spend more money and when I showed this to front desk Roman he asked when did we book this vacation because that was a March promotion but we just booked it 2 days before our arrival still they did not honor or compensate us as of yet. I also told them we were celebrating my husband \u2019s 50th birthday and when the Southwest agent Lashon asked if we had something set up in room upon arrival I told her \u201c nothing \u201d. We spent more time on the phone with front desk Amstar Southwest Vacations and at front desk to fully enjoy our vacation. I do n\u2019t recommend unles all you expect is good food the beach nice pool and your accommodations or friendly service from front desk manager Iris does n\u2019t matter.

The next day we did see some guys who appeared to be working on plumbing so hopefully they were working on resolving that issue. My wife and I went to an Excellence Resort in Cancun last year and found ourselves constantly comparing everything to it and I think we were spoiled by how new everything was there. and they give you better selection of liquor as part of the all inclusive which made it a little difficult for us to enjoy this resort to its fullest. I will say the beach at FAC is more impressive with warm crystal clear water with varying shades of blue.

We have vacationed at the Condesa multiple times and it gets better and better with each visit. Our check in experience was outstanding and we were offered an upgraded room at a reasonable coast. The hotel was completed booked so there were not a lot of options from which to choose as far as rooms. We were pleased. Had a little trouble getting in as our key cards would not work but friendly and helpful Diego called someone to work on the lock that fixed the problem. Diego quickly got us new key cards. We dined in the Italian restaurant within the Condesa Rosato two different evenings. It was fabulous the first night so we decided to go back a few nights later. The staff in the restaurant is amazing. From the chef Adrian the manager Miguel our waiter Roberto waited on us last year as well to the hostess Lupita everyone came by the table to make sure everything was perfect. Let me say that what makes the Condesa so amazing is the staff. I wish I could remember all the names but these stood out. Rudolfo and Edwar at Cevicheria the servers outside at the pool Jose and Claudio all outstanding. We can not pass up Julietas omelets in Kalmia each morning. I have never seen anyone multitask like she can. My only problem with the Condesa is the ventilation air conditioning in the guest rooms. I always come home with a really bad cough and would advise anyone with severe allergy issues to look elsewhere. The rooms have a musty moldy smell but it is not overpowering. It does not bother most people but it always causes problems for me. I would love to see that improve but after a beautiful recent remodel. that has not changed. I guess you have to weigh out your properties. It is an outstanding property extremely clean safe friendly and has that Mexico feel unlike some of the other resorts that are way too American like for us.

It seemed to be a little older crowd which was nice. The pool area gets hopping around 3 pm. They play a diverse array of music. The ocean was very rough it was red flag 5 out of 6 days.

This was our first visit to Cancun and our first time visiting an all inclusive resort so we had high expectations for our Christmas vacation. We had done our due diligence along with our friends who joined us for the 6 days. First the beach was awesome clean and plenty of chairs. No waiter service on the beach but the bars are very accessible with a short walk. Lots of daily entertainment and activities by the staff which kept people very entertained. Numerous restaurants near the pools that offered great food and drink. Most of the restaurants had good food at a minimum with 2 that were excellent. First was the Thai Kuh restaurant which serves as morning buffet and evening dinner. We had gone deep sea fishing earlier in the day and brought the fish barracuda and red snapper to Chef Luis who offered to prepare a special meal for our group of 11. Awesome experience. They prepared a 4 course meal for us and everyone enjoyed the meal. Captain Jonathan was exceptional in arrange the event for us Hostess Martha was very attentive and our waiters Reyes and Julio were outstanding. Great Mexican wine selection by Jonathan as well. We ate at this restaurant on four occasions during our stay and were not disappointed. The second was the Italian restaurant Rosato which gave us a private seating for our group. Again outstanding service by the wait staff the chef stopped to check on us during our meal which was outstanding by the way. Ca n\u2019t say enough about the wait staff at all of the bars and restaurants they go out of their way to treat you well. Check out Tratoria for very good pizza. A few of us utilized the spa for a massage and it was well worth the money. Eyl gave me a deep tissue massage that was phenomenal. One of the best I \u2019ve had and I would highly recommend her. The hotel is very clean and well kept up. Our room had a balcony that was was n\u2019t a balcony. It had a railing at the sliding glass door so it was not function. Our room had a musty smell when entering the room so we would leave our sliding glass door open all night and that solved the problem. It was great to hear the waves crashing all night and the noise was minimal. One small complaint about leaving our doors open for some reason they would repair broken floor tiles around the pool complex during the night. 2 am in the morning and you could hear the repair man chipping away at the tile. We just laughed about. Overall it was a great experience. One last thing if you are doing tours check out the guys at Aquatours near the kids pool.

Lot of restaurants Italian Thai Mexican authentic Sushi Buffet and Steak house only restaurant that needs one day prior reservation and you can reserve only from 2 3pm. Casual wear is a min requirement for all these restaurants except Buffet place. Also there are Open food counters with sitting lounge surrounding pool with choices sea food pizza and healthy options like salad etc. There is no dress code for these counters. Check timings before heading to any of these restaurants food counters and also bars. And there are shows different show every night. Did n\u2019t get a chance to go to each one of them but I \u2019d highly recommend going to a MEXICAN show on multiple local regions. Within hotel mainly there are three tours Sea tower Sun tower and moon tower. Each one of these had ocean front rooms suits lagoon and garden view rooms. Also there are lot of food choices including a small ice cream parlor gift shop day care for kids teens lounge gym fitness center table tennis billiards gift shop pools all 5 ft max depth kids only pool area ball rooms gazebo beach volleyball beach soccer for kids etc. One other thing we liked about this place is security. Compared to other resorts that we visited in hotel zone security at main entrance is checking every one including walkers. Never ever lose your all inclusive wrist band during your stay. They will charge you 150 per piece to replace. At least that \u2019s what they said during checkin. Funny part is after checkout I \u2019ve seen many people leaving to airport with their wrist bands on. Room that we stayed is pretty good and little signs of wear and tear. Not brand new for sure but maintenance is pretty good for the most part. Overall I \u2019d recommend this place in Cancun.
