Took about an hour to get to hotel from airport but that was due to Friday traffic and on way back to airport Sunday only took about 25 min. Overall the hotel was just fine. Rooms were spacious and clean bathrooms were just fine with no complaints. AC got nice and cold and had a decent view from front of hotel. Seemed they were doing some renovations to the lower lobby restaurant area but did nt have any problems with that or any noise. Only thing that was curious was we had no idea they had the breakfast buffet behind the big wall they put up to do construction. Luckily we found it Sat morning and the food was very good for moderate price. Hotel is very large with a maze of walkways outback with water running and surprisingly good scenery all around. Overall we had no problems and next time I am in the area would def stay here again.", "offset": [400, 527], "date": "2015-10-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "3db1f358-ac6f-4cbc-8112-5fcf58e939a0", "sentence": "Not Satisfied At All. The Staff was friendly. The bathroom needs a major repair remodeling. The first room we were offered had mold spots all over the shower. I could not allow my body to get in that tub. We got another room and it was mediocre. There was a horrible moldy mildew smell in the room. The toilet ran for ever before it stopped after flushing and it is extremely loud. The air conditioner unit. wall fans are super duper old. Not a traditional unit like most rooms and the air ducts and vents were very filthy. The shower curtains were torn severely so they barely stayed on the hooks the vent in the bathroom was a huge open space and it was scary looking and filthy as well. The paint is peeling severely in the entire room several nasty looking stains on the walls in the bathroom and door that apparently can not be removed or housekeeping did not try previous guest pubic hair was all over the toilet seat and the inside of the toilet was just disgusting. I actually told my husband in the middle of the night that I felt we needed to check out and go somewhere else and find a hotel.

I have stayed in nice places and cheaper places. I am not a hotel snob but know the difference between a really nice hotel 5 star service and 2 3 star service rooms location. This hotel was a great price for the dates I was traveling for work. Much cheaper than the other surrounding options for some reason on these dates the first week of May Service was great although I did not require much attention. Room was comfortable good size and clean. The park behind the hotel was truly nice and relaxing calming to walk through. I was traveling alone on business one night only. did not spend much time at the hotel but what I did was comfortable and no complaints other than the hotel I was on the 6th floor was somewhat crumbling here and there. Just outside my room door 636 in the hall the wall was literally crumbling behind the wallpaper onto the floor. The ceiling in my bathroom had damage appearing that the bathroom above it is leaking or was leaking at some point and needs repair. The bathroom next to the toilet by the tub was also damaged needing good repair. I did not inspect the room walls or ceilings these things were those that actually stood out to me without me looking for anything. It did not so much bother me as it did tell me the ownership of this hotel is not taking care of it. My only actual complaint is that you could not get fresh ice. You could call and have ice brought to you when I called nobody answered after like 10 rings. I went to the front desk and they had bags of ice in the room next to it for people to take. but these bags of ice were pretty much big solid ice chunks that you had to take to your room bang against the bathroom counter to break apart in order to get in the ice bucket and then the bag tears and ice is everywhere. Come on. Put a couple ice machines in. Other than my ice problem I did enjoy my very brief stay.", "offset": [923, 1055], "date": "2017-05-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "52dd8c21-ae09-4209-8971-dd6ed4813a91", "sentence": "We are currently staying here for a Weekend to Remember marriage conference. We added an extra night and came in early to make a little trip out of it for our wedding anniversary. I have not stayed at a Crowne Plaza before but have always understood it to be a luxury brand. The lobby is impressive but unfortunately that is where the excitement wore off. There was only one person ahead of us in line and it still took almost 30 minutes to get checked in. We waited almost 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were standing there. The woman who checked us in was very nice but told us she was in accounting and did not normally work the front desk. She was unable to help us take care of both reservations at check in one for the conference the other for our extra night and said we would need to come down the next morning and re register. I worked in the hospitality industry for 10 years and I know better than that. Anyway we were excited to see our room. We did not book the highest end room standard king but we still expected it to be nice. The room has terrible lighting and we are right next to what seems to be a supply closet. Anytime the door is opened or closed it shakes the wall and our head board jiggles not classy. We were only given decaf coffee really. Called the front desk and whoever answered acted like we were personally inconveniencing her for daring to request regular coffee. At least the house man brought it up quickly and had a great attitude. Housekeeping knocked on our door at 815 am even though our do not disturb sign was hanging on the door. They did not announce themselves when they opened the door either. Staff should always identify themselves before entering. In general the room is okay. It is in bad need of an update. Parts of our room appear to be unfinished. Overall this is a major disappointment and we will choose to stay elsewhere in the future. As IHG rewards members we typically stay with Holiday Inn Express. The Crowne Plaza could take a few lessons from them.", "offset": [1742, 1773], "date": "2017-05-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "7b11c7e8-fbae-4196-8a2f-fe0c8e60c0a0", "sentence": "A Conference Hotel Nothing More. Attended corporate training at this facility in July. Reserved a king room room 40 but the bed was more queen sized I sleep in a king so I know its size. Brought my wife and niece with me. I was assured that the room had a pull out couch. It turned out to be a chaise and ottoman. We made a cocoon for my niece which she thought was amazing thank goodness for 7year old thinking and flexibility. Gave her a shower the first night and my wife had to call me to pull the water faucet out from the wall. Elderly or handicapped people could not do it. Unfortunately the water control was minimal causing my niece to get scalded. The next morning my wife and I were treated to room temperature showers at the same setting. I asked for maintenance to adjust the shower control. They must have done the best they could but it never really worked correctly during our 3 days. The was some mold evident in the shower as well. My niece was excited to visit the pool. Unfortunately the pool is a uniform 4 feet deep. If you are bringing kids be forewarned. This is very dangerous for anyone less than 5 feet tall. The water was refreshing I would guess about 75 80 degrees. My nieces teeth were chattering when she came out. Since she is just over 4 feet tall the only place she could play was on the steps leading into the pool. The peeling paint inside the pool and the iron stains outside were not appealing either. A manager was trying to work on heating up the pool to his credit but the pool was closed for the next two nights. Parking was ample and free which was greatly appreciated. Also the staff was friendly and courteous. Special praise goes to the bellmen who always greeted us when passing through the lobby. Another praise goes to the food service employees who put on delicious buffets for us. They were helpful and kind as well. The hotel in general was also clean. The location was good. It is within walking distance to the Perimeter Mall restaurants and MARTA. The hotel offers free transportation in a two mile radius. We walked but I witnessed the shuttle running frequently. A nice touch is the park like setting behind the hotel. There are wonderful trails through the woods which I would have liked to explore but time and July temperatures prevented.", "offset": [751, 804], "date": "2017-07-16", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "7f7b905c-3854-420d-9d62-a16cf9faebf3", "sentence": "it is old and needs more updates.", "offset": [0, 33], "date": "2017-08-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "8c1caea7-69c2-46c8-aa3e-037f4caa958a", "sentence": "A Little Disapointing. I was waiting to close on my new home and had spent a week at a different hotel that was excellent but was getting very expensive there after the original booking special ended. I saw a decent rate at the Crown Plaza Atlanta Perimeter Ravinia and booked it for 3 days. I have seen the hotel for years and always wanted to stay there. My arrival was great. I was met by a man that was extremely pleasant and directed me to the front desk for check in and everything seemed fine. The check in was quick and the person was very professional and provided me with what was expected. The room was the problem it is definitely time for an update or total remodel. They had attempted to do some patch work but that made it worse because it brought more attention to the issue. The only problem I had was the condition of the room not the cleanliness but the room itself. The rating of 3 35 is accurate but this place could be 5 easily with just some work. The staff was great the lobby is very attractive and the location is excellent. If you get a good rate. I can see taking a chance on the Crown Ravinia but if not there are much better hotels in the area to chose from.

The hot water must be rationed for it took OVER 30 min of it running to get any hot water at all. So much for being green. Food is okay. prices are midrange to high. Good snack shop and additional munchies in the gift shop. Workout area is ample. with bathrooms IN the area which is rare these days so that is a huge plus plenty of things to help you stay fit.

Gone is that giant chest of drawers with a TV you do not use the TV is now built into the wall and there is tons of floor space between it and the bed for yoga setting up your equipment or whatever else you need. Couches and tables can be moved into different configurations to fit your needs instead of molding your needs around a fixed desk and lamp. There are a few more pleasant surprises waiting guests who book when they reopen in 2019 I will not spoil them all.

I stayed at this newly renovated Crowne Plaza hotel for a week long business trip and it was a most pleasant stay. Right from checkin and throughout my stay the staff were very attentive and helpful. I simply can not stress enough how the staff are amazingThe rooms are also very comfortable and the beds are cozy. They have a variety of pillows of different firmness so you can be sure to find one that works for you so you can get a good nights sleep. The amenities in the room are perfect. In my room I had an iron and an ironing board which were great for me since I was there on a business trip. They also had wax so I could polish my shoes. There are sufficient power outlets in the room as well and also powered USB ports right by the nightstand by the bed which was a lifesaver for me because I had forgotten to bring adapters and only had European plugs on all my chargers. Fortunately as there were USB ports I could still charge my phone. The in house restaurant also serves good fodthere is also a gym which I did not try so I can not comment much on that but my colleague did go for a run on the treadmill there so there is at least that. The furnishing and decor of the hotel are also beautiful and I found the overall aesthetic of the hotel to be well thought out. The lobby is very stylishly put together and there are plenty of comfortable lounge chairs and also tables with power outlets which you can use if you need to get some work done while waiting for someone. In the lobby there are also a couple of computers and a printer which you can use. This came in handy as I was able to check in to my flight and print out my boarding pass. The hotel also provided an on demand shuttle service to guests which can drop off and pick up guests within a 2mile radius of the hotel. Within this 2mile radius there is a Marta station subway. a Walmart and a Target. Just across the street there is also the Perimeter Mall which is a convenient short walk away so if you are on a business trip and on a tight schedule you can still get some quick shopping done if needed.
