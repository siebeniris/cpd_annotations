My wife and I spent three nights at the Motif Seattle both before and after a recent Alaskan cruise. We arrived two days prior to sailing which allowed us one full day to see some of the sights. First the hotel the Motif is an upscale hotel located in the busy downtown area of Seattle. The rooms are modern tastefully decorated and roomy. On our first visit May 10 12 we had a room on a lower floor. On the return night May 19 the hotel generously provided an upgrade to a larger room on the 20th floor. We returned to Seattle from the cruise a few hours before the room was ready and the staff graciously tagged and stored our bags while we waited. The hotel has all the expected amenities for a place of this scale. One nice feature is the Frolik Restaurant on the fifth floor which serves scheduled meals and has a lovely bar and an open patio deck for relaxing and looking over the Seattle skyline. there is a basement tavern and restaurant on site called Elephant and Castle as well. You will not find any lack of quality restaurants in the area with many just walking distance away. Speaking of walking there is lots of sites to see nearby including the Space Needle Seattle Center and Pikes Market. Both are a reasonable walk from the hotel. I mentioned that the accommodations are lovely. The beds are roomy and comfortable there are large screen TVs with actual HD programming you had be surprised how many places do not have it spotlessly clean bathrooms and plenty of necessities. When reserving ask if there is a room facing 5th Avenue in the front of the hotel for a more desirable view. My only complaint and it is a minor one has to do with the TV remote controls in both rooms. I do not know if it is an installation programming or battery thing but both were a bit difficult to use. One only worked when we mashed the buttons and the other literally had to be pointed directly at the TV in a certain spot or it would not react. Like a lot of hotels they use generic remotes that are replaceable and universal but you should not need to sit on top of the TV to turn the volume up or change a channel. Luckily each room is equipped with an Amazon Alexa device which can turn the TV on and off as well as provide a lot of other helpful information. If you are going on a cruise at any of the nearby ship terminals this is an ideal place to stay. All the terminals are no more than a few minutes away by cab rideshare. We sailed from the 91st Street terminal which is the furthest away and it was a quick trip by cab. Most of the cabs offer a flat rate between the downtown hotels and the terminals as well as Sea Tac Airport. Regarding cabs you will never have to wait more than a few moments to get a cab or rideshare as the cab stand in front of the hotel is very busy. Getting an Uber Lyft in Seattle is really easy as just about every other car we saw appeared to be one. When we left to fly home we dragged our bags to the sidewalk and a cab appeared in literally no time for a lift to the airport.
