I just got back from a long weekend at Epic and it was hands down one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. I traveled with a group and we had 3 rooms. We stayed in the suites and they were UNBELIEVABLY GORGEOUS. The staff was so incredibly friendly and helpful. From the front desk to housekeeping I was blown away by the outstanding customer service. We ate at Area 31 and the food was delicious seafood risotto was out of this world. We also passed by Lilt for a complimentary wine happy hour which was great. The pool area was beautiful.

I was in Miami for a special event and booked the Epic specifically for its location. There are many positives about this hotel and only a few negatives from my perspective. I arrived early and although there was a room available the front desk person said that he would have an upgraded room available later on if I wanted to wait. The upgrade was to a room with a water view instead of a city view and I spent time every day sitting on the balcony enjoying the tranquility of this view. The room itself was quite spacious and the bathroom area included a glassed in shower as well as a jacuzi tub. The only negative about the room was that there was only closet space. no drawers so I ended up living out of my suitcase for most of my items. The housekeeping staff was efficient and there was turn down service each evening. My room rate included continental breakfast each morning which is available at the restaurant on the 16th floor. My suggestion is to arrive at least an hour before breakfast ends because the amount of food seemed to diminish as the time went on and it was not readily replenished. On the weekend the pickings were especially sparse. The pool area is lovely and there are a variety of furnishings to use. The service at the pool depends on who is working that day though and it varied considerably in terms of attention and courtesy. Other than some of the pool staff the employees that I encountered during my stay were exceptional professional but friendly and seemingly happy to have me as a guest. This is a very busy hotel with many events going on. I am glad that I did not have a car there because it seemed as if the lot was always jammed with cars. One last tip become a member of Kimptons loyalty program since it gives free wifi among other things.

I had a pedicure at the spa in the hotel and the esthetician was not very friendly. It was the fastest pedicure I have ever had and she did a good job but I am paying for the experience being pampered friendly service etc. You are required to pay an 18 gratuity for all spa services as well as at the restaurants in the hotel.
