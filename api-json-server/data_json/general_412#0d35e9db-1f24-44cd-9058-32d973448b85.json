Having room on the alley also means an early wakeup call when lorries use the alley in the morning. The pool is extremely small although we did not use it. The breakfast is a simple bread and cereal affair. Some bagels bread cereal and coffee in a very small room with 4 tables in it. We ended up taking it back to our room due to no seats. We stayed for 2 nights and upon check in the charged an additional 50 resort fee to cover the costs of breakfast WiFi and the beach loungers.

I was extremely embarrassed and felt discriminated against but I am not one to make a scene. I went back to my room and called the front desk despite being hung up on again and again until I finally called from my cell phone instead of the room phone. would not you know I finally got an answer from Javier.
