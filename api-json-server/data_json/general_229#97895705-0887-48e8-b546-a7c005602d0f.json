Four days ago my husband was facing a birthday and his professional life was making him very stressed. What to get him for his birthday. My answer was a surprise long weekend in San Juan. To say he went kicking and screaming was an understatement. San Juan because it was one of the few non stop flights in the Caribbean from our home airport in Tampa. I did not want us to spend gobs of time getting there. I chose Dorado because I had spent so much time there as a kid with my family so I knew how beautiful the setting was. The hotel is now run by the Ritz Carlton which is not my first choice for a beach hotel the brands predilection for my grandmothers silk drapes and crystal chandeliers sucks the easy relaxation out of a beach holiday. Love them for their city hotels though. so I was a little worried about my surprise. Wow were those fears unfounded. We were the happy recipients of a whole new brand concept. From the moment we were met at the airport the service was impeccable as one expects from the ritz Carlton. The Mi Casa restaurant fed us exclusively and delightfully for three days. Our personal comprador Jenifer was a delight helping us arrange everything she was only a text away. We stayed in a plunge pool west reserve villa which in addition to the pool allowed us to walk 25 paces to the beach where we found comfortable lounge chairs and a most helpful beach attendant who offered us drinks towels shade and food before we even knew we needed them. We slept every night to the sound of the waves and tree frogs. The hotel itself is modern constructed from organic materials like coral stone and wood and set in a primordial forest which produces a chorus of sounds beginning at sunset. there is plenty to do not just for couples but also for families with kids of all ages. Surfing and kite boarding for the 9 25 year olds a water park for all and of course great golfing. This would be a perfect holiday for extended family. For families that have toddlers there are great facilities for you too my only advice is that you should not book a suite with a pool. The spa is set in an exquisite tropical garden with hot tubs cold plunges and showers. The facilities could occupy the day. The services we received were restorative and memorable. I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. We will be back.", "offset": [825, 869], "date": "2015-01-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "8833da22-ff0d-4316-83f7-55a91beb9cdf", "sentence": "Horrible Experience. The equation for success is a combination of professionalism with high standards diligence and sympathy with no room for negligence always being one step ahead. Unfortunately all of these are lacking at the Ritz Carlton Reserve in Dorado. What was thought out to be a magnificent weekend getaway became the worst experience that we have ever had staying at the Ritz Carlton Reserve. Stay 1302015 212015 Early October a reservation was made for a specific room and date. We were advised by Luis at reservations that for the weekend that we were going to stay the room was available and it was reserved for us. Upon our arrival not only was the room occupied by other guests but another room that was assigned to us was not ready. Check in is to be at 40PM and we did not get our room until 514PM. Why is it necessary to wait so long. After arriving to the room belongings that pertained to the guest before us were left behind such as half a pack of cigarettes fruits opened juice bottle etc. The floor was dirty meaning that housekeeping did not do a good job cleaning prior to our arrival. From the get go we complained and were told that the situation was going to be addressed but nothing ever happened. The lock on the door that leads towards the outside shower was broken therefore the Engineering Department was notified and 2 hours later it was finally fixed. The next morning room service was ordered for 3. Three different meals and only food for 2 arrived. When the food arrived we told the gentleman and he got upset and advised us he would be back with the food shortly. An hour passed and the coffee was already cold but the third plate finally got to the room. Later that day housekeeping came and we were greeted by Elizabeth housekeeper. Elizabeth did the job of our Ambassador. She was so attentive and detail oriented. She even sent us breakfast the next morning. Hands down Elizabeth should be promoted to Ambassador because she has the charisma personality sense of urgency customer service empathy and respect that none of the employees during our stay this time have. Saturday night we were taken to Zafra and at 1020PM our sever requested for us to be picked up. We were at Plantation for 40 minutes waiting and finally at 105PM we were picked up because we had to personally call our Ambassador. Why should we wait so long. What happened to what was a fabulous sanctuary of a hotel. The level of customer service satisfaction sympathy urgency and empathy has gone down the drain. We really thought about going back 3 4 more times this year but after this horrible experience we are taking our business elsewhere where we are treated like we deserve. Ritz Carlton Reserve at Dorado has lost its sense of tact and this is unacceptable. The only good things that happened were meeting Elizabeth and being able to see Wilfredo Ambassador in September 2014 upon our check out. I am pretty sure that if Wilfredo would have been our Ambassador again our experience would not have been horrid. Oh. And we only got a tote bag as an amenity for our horrible experience.", "offset": [1437, 1487], "date": "2015-02-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "5f16d240-e5aa-4972-954b-ba48eef2afc3", "sentence": "Puerto Rico Paradise.

The resort is new and the rooms and facilities are first rate. However the experience was very very disappointing as the staff is completely disorganized and the service poor. We spent seven nights at the resort during Presidents week. Luz and Oscar were our butlers and they were very good gracious and effective. Christian Clair who runs the restaurants is also stellar the food at Encanto where he spends much of his time is excellent as was most of the staff at Encanto the restaurant near the West pool. That said the employees are very gracious and friendly but highly inept. requests were repeatedly forgotten and orders botched. We spoke with several in management within 24 hours of arrival and thus begun our Groundhog Day cycle. Employees would simply forget our requests waits at the deli and pool were interminable and we received approximately one apology day from management and assurances that our experience would improve. It did not. To add insult to the disorganization we were sometimes charged for our young children and other times were told their food should be free. When we were erroneously charge we had mentioned the mistake and the staff would take 15 20 minutes to resolve. In addition the staff is trained poorly. They no nothing about the history of the property and have virtually no knowledge of the schedules of the various facilities. I suspect the issue is staff turnover but Ritz needs to address this issue among others. I also concur with the other recent reviewer that the West side is not necessarily better for families the East side is just a nice and has a better beach. Back to the deli and pool the frozen yogurt machine was broken for most of our stay and service at the pool was virtually non existent. Again the head of Food Beverage and Christian Clair worked their hardest to make us happy they seem to work 20 hours day six day week. Issue is that the staff is pleasant but incompetent. They have periodic spurts of enthusiasm then disappear. The deli is understaffed and inefficient. We will not return to this resort. While I recognize that one can sound spoiled when complaining about service in a bucolic setting Ritz sets expectations high with the 200 night rate and unfortunately does not deliver. We hope for some sort of refund the service was no better than a mid level hotel but I suspect we will simply receive the standard glad you liked the room. sorry about the service we will endeavor to fix our processes and look forward to offering you a free drink next visit.

We had heard a lot of great accolades about this hotel. It was a HUGE disappointment. Upon being brought to our beach side room I immediately noticed trash by our plunge pool. The next day I asked a service worker to pick it up. He picked up a bottle and left the rest of the garbage. We had asked to go to yoga class. They forgot to pick us up. We hitched a ride and were brought to the wrong gym and we missed yoga. No one cared. At the restaurants the food was often burned and our entrees came out at different times. We had reserved deck chairs in advance only to find they gave them to someone else. And the issue with that is that they do not have other deck chairs. So we were out of luck. At the spa there were no magazines they did not have fresh towels and they ran out of hot water. Again trash all over the lounges. Consistent for both the womens and mens sides. The room butlers are a joke they do not check in regularly nor do they give messages to the person they are handing you off to for the evening. As we checked out we had a 150 spa credit that was not applied to the bill. Our concierge could not figure it out and said she would after we returned. Three calls later three months later still not refundedOveral it was NOT a quality experience. We had just stayed at the Ritz Carlton Montreal two months before and it was incredible.

I visited Dorado Beach in late March with my girlfriend and her family and felt compelled to write a review due to quality of the experience. Despite some minor issues with the service which I will address later in the review the stay was extraordinary. Architecturally and aesthetically very few locations I have seen can be held to the same regard as this resort. The grounds are immaculately landscaped and the beach was simply amazing. Beach access from the rooms was a breeze simply taking a few steps from the entrance of the room. The accommodations were also impeccable. Perhaps the most enviable part of the room was the bathroom with its indoor and outdoor rain showers massive tub and sound system. However the iPod adapters only worked for older iPhone models so bring an adapter if you have one. Despite the outdoor shower being right next to the entrance privacy was not an issue. Still the next door neighbors son got annoying with his endless renditions of Lady Gaga so be aware that your neighbors may hear your singing if you choose the belt it out in the outdoor shower. As for the pools and other facilities the same goes throughout. Everything was beautifully designed and maintained. Still there were a few problems. For one the food was nothing special. Save for Mi Casa the flagship restaurant. the quality of the cuisine which I best remember are the prices. Clearly the business is taking advantage of its isolated location to price gouge visitors who either can not leave the grounds for their meals or are too wealthy to bother. This mostly applies to the lunch and dinner offerings of Positivo and Encanta. While the breakfast at Mi Casa was also outrageously expensive we had a package offering free breakfast and it was actually remarkably delicious. Still the food was above average for resort fare despite not being particularly memorable. Another equally frustrating issue was the service. While everything got off to a nice start with our embajador meeting us and showing us the rooms we never saw her again. I do not care if the embajador system is presented as a team effort but to think that the embajador is a personal assistant only to never see them again just made the issue more obvious. Despite being told by her that iPod adapters would be available for the room when I called the embajadors I was first told that was not true then after pressing was told that none were available. Several later calls received the same response. Wait times at the restaurants for seating were outrageous especially considering how few people were present. The final straw was at check out when the bellhops forgot our luggage three times before we finally went back with them ourselves delaying us significantly and nearly causing us to miss our flight. More issues occurred but I will not mention them to save spaceRegardles the trip was totally worthwhile. To me the service was not such an issue that it overwhelmed the rest of the stay especially considering I did not mind taking care of these problems myself. The only reason I mention them is that they are so easy to remedy yet the hotel clearly has done nothing to address them based on earlier reviews. It comes down to expectations If you are a traveler who wants to be waited on hand and foot not lifting a finger then I do not think Dorado Beach will live up to your expectations. But if you are willing to make forgo that to experience this brilliant unique and absolutely breathtaking property the you can not miss this place.", "offset": [2946, 3102], "date": "2015-04-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "bc319291-cd51-440b-bbd5-14802b443cde", "sentence": "Absolutely gorgeous. My husband and I stayed at Dorado Beach for a long weekend as part of a work event for his company. Everyone in the group and this is a pretty well traveled group. agreed it was one of the most gorgeous properties in the entire Caribbean. The buildings pools rooms beach landscaping golf course all spectacular. My only complaint is that our group was told all rooms would be available for us by 2 pm as the conference began at 4 pm and people would need to get ready. When we arrived not one of the rooms was ready for anyone in our group. As a result half of the people went to the conference in shorts travel clothes and my husband who was presenting had to get his bags from the storage room and go shower in the fitness center so he could change into his suit. Our room was finally ready sometime after 4 pm but others waited until after 5 pm. The early check in had been arranged FAR in advance so it is not like we surprised them and considering that we were a large corporate group spending a small fortune to be there I feel as though they really dropped the ball on that one. Other than that there is nothing negative to be said about this resort. All the meals we had were excellent and there is no beating this setting. The spa was one of the most gorgeous spas I have ever been in and the massage therapist I had was one of the best I have e ever encountered. This property has all the nice touches you expect from a Ritz. Our room was one on the lower level with a private patio and pool just a few steps off the beach. One reviewer complained it was not private enough because the balcony above could see into the pool. Yes maybe if they were hanging over the edge of their balcony they could see but who does that. We found the room to be fabulous from the spaciousness of it the view the incredible bathroom with both indoor AND outdoor showersal of it. Be sure to borrow a bike and pedal around the property. Very cool waterpark for kids is open only on weekends do not really understand why it is not always openbut it is not really walkable.

Nickeling and diming people who can afford to stay anywhere they Iike is a recipe for disaster in any business much less the hospitality resort business. Such is the case I experienced at the Dorado Beach Ritz Carolton. Upon arrival the resort appeared to be world class. The architecture tropical landscape design were all amazing. The arrival procedure was also a pleasant experience as we were greeted by a staff of 3 waiting with cold coconut Popsicles and welcome introductions. The entry and reception area alerts one that this place is special with tropical flora and incredible water features all designed to visually mimic a lush antique sugar plantation. We were then introduced to our designated butler and whisked away to our room via golf cart. there are no motorized vechiles on this ECO resort. When the door opened to the room I knew we would be staying in the lap of luxury. The interior decor was amazing and the suite was spacious. The view to the ocean was unveiled as the floor to ceiling glass doors all folded back into the wall opening the outdoors in. The private patio with infinity plunge pool was perfect and gave view to a lush grass lawn landscaped perfectly with the ocean crashing on the rocks passed the private beach and saltwater lagoon. We had arrived at paradise. That evening we took our first outing at one of the resorts three dining establishments. It was right on the beach and again the decoration was perfect and the view inspiring. Then the menus came and we were surprised. Sushi. In Puerto Rico. Really. Ok well we dug in and ordered the same sushi that we get back home only a lot more expensive taking a lot more time to get and while waiting drinking cocktails that started at 20. first red flagDay one one the beach perfect. Very private and exclusive feeling. Our own terry covered lounges under an umbrella steps from our suite and plunge pool. The view is spectacular as are the sounds of the surf crashing over the rocks. We are sitting on a beach and in front of us is a man made saltwater lagoon that has perfect sand bottom at varying depths. This water is gin clear and a beautiful shade of turquoise. Perfect for swimming and Sunning. Now lunch at the second dining establishment on the resort sort of a pool sand side grill. burgers pizza but also some limited main course items and a full bar. We decided on a Cuba Libre and Pi\u00f1a Colota with two sandwiches. It took forever to get our order even though there was very few people in the restaurant. The drinks were lite of rum and the menu was just average pool food. I had to flag down the waiter to finally get our bill so we could pay and get back to the beach. The bill came and was 1370 for two drinks and two sandwiches. second red flag. We went to the spa for treatments and were completely amazed by this place. world class does not describe the art and architecture. almost Disney like for adults good. I have never experienced the visual sense that this spa exudes again thanks to the amazing architects and designers. But again once past the facade the massage treatments were average at best and the prices were double any other world class spa that I have been to. Third red flag. The next day repeat day one. Beach and swimming in the lagoon. Took bike rides along the 11 mile Rockefeller trail which was very nice and beautiful scenery. You really get a sense of the entire property by bike. That afternoon I decided that I wanted my own bottle of rum in the room so I did not have to keep trying to find a butler who assured me would be at my every be on command could not even get him to deliver ice cokes limes or even get our turn down service correct. but he put on a convincing show upon our arrival. None the less he told me of Puerto Ricos finest and most coveted Rum. Don Q and that I should experience this fine liquor. so I called him up and had a bottle delivered with cokes and limes. Again it was average at best and I was charged 2470 for the bottle. Being a drinker of fine single malt whiskeys and small batch bourbons I was ignorant and felt price must be inline with fine Rum. fast forward to leaving the island and at the airport. The shop at the airport was selling THE EXACT SAME BOTTLE OF DON Q RUM FOR 140 USD. Fourth red flag and now I am furiousOh and I forgot to tell you that the incidentals not including room tax or transfers came to 3800. Over 1000 was Spa treatments but the rest was nickel and dime charges delivery fees gratuity and many other unknown charges that should have been included when spending 1400 per night for a room with a view. Summary Is the Dorado Beach Resort by Ritz Carlton a beautiful and visually amazing place. YESWould I ever stay they again. NO WAYDoes this property measure up to other properties in this price range like Las Ventanas in Cabo or the Anangati in Jackson Hole. In beauty yes in service integrity and food service not even closeSo be warned this place is a wolf in sheeps clothing. Shame on Ritz Carlton management for these less than professional tactics.

The Location The resort occupies a large area of prime beachfront property in Dorado which is about a 40 minute ride from San Juan Airport. You can make arrangements for private car pickup at the airport in advance. We did this and it worked out very well. The beach is quiet clean with crystal clear water and no seaweed which has been an annoyance at several other resorts we have visited in the Caribbean. The waves were fairly strong but buffeted by rocks not far offshore. The views are beautiful wherever you look with various types of trees dotting the property. Coqui frogs get pretty noisy at night. Wi Fi worked well throughout the complex. The Rooms We stayed in room 124 a second floor unit near the end of the east villas. It was a quiet location overlooking trees and a part of the beach apparently reserved for those with the first floor units. The layout was excellent. There was a comfortable king bed and sitting area with large flat screen TV on the ocean side with a spacious patio. In the middle was a closet area with a fairly good array of food items and beverages available for purchase. And on the other side was a contemporary bathroom with indoor and outdoor shower. I have never stayed where an outdoor shower was an option but I must say I enjoyed using it every day. Restaurants. Mi Casa is their signature restaurant. it is open every day for breakfast but was closed for dinner two of the four nights of our stay Sunday and Monday. The breakfast buffet at Mi Casa was not exceptional but I would highly recommend the a la carte waffles which come with vanilla whipped cream and a bananas foster like accompaniment that is delicious. The one dinner we had at Mi Casa was terrific and the service was incredible more belowPositivo Sand Bar is their beachside casual restaurant. We had two lunches and a dinner there and were very pleased with our meals. Dinner is tapas style so order several items and share. The blackened fish sandwich was a highlight for lunch. We had a lunch and two dinners at Encanto on the west side of the resort. Everything I had was enjoyable however my wife was disappointed in the recommended pasta with seafood dish. I would have liked a larger wine selection and those that were available were quite overpriced. We also had breakfast and lunch at Zafra at the golf club. Good but nothing special. Golf. There are four golf courses on the property Pineapple Sugarcane East and West. The West Course is currently closed due to housing construction there. The East Course is their championship course which is quite expensive and requires a caddy though we saw golfers playing without caddies. We did not play the East course but played Pineapple and Sugarcane. Though the layout was interesting with doglegs on quite a few holes I would not recommend the Pineapple course as it is not in great condition particularly some of the bunkers which have a substance resembling concrete in them rather than sand. The cart ride is a rocky one that will jostle you as you travel the course. It is clearly not worth the money I believe the standard rate is 180 though we received a discount as resort guests. The Sugarcane costs the same as Pineapple but it is far superior in its condition. it is an enjoyable resort style layout that is fairly challenging and picturesque. Despite comments on the website I did not find the Sugarcane any more difficult than the Pineapple. Other Recreation Bicycles are free to use throughout the resort area. There are two walking biking trails that wind around the golf courses and some of the large homes in the complex. We had a pleasant walk on the longer of the two. There are at least two free form pools for resort guests which were right alongside the ocean and quite attractive quiet and clean. Some villas have personal pools though ours did not. I was told by friends that the spa was magnificent but we did not make use of it. We also did not use the fitness center which looked impressive. Not sure there is a lot to keep children sufficiently busy but I will let other reviewers speak to that. We stayed on the property for our four day stay so I can not comment on any outside activities. Service. The service level is perhaps what sets the Ritz Carlton Reserve apart from other 5star properties. In fact it was among the best we have ever encountered. You are assigned personal assistants who take care of anything you need throughout your stay and everyone on staff is as helpful as they can possibly be. Everyone learns your name and respectfully addresses you in all instances. Golf carts are available to pick you up and take you wherever you may wish to go. We celebrated a special anniversary on our vacation and mentioned this in the short survey sent in advance of our stay. From the moment we arrived until we left we were treated with complimentary treats to acknowledge our occasion including Champagne at several meals a plate of gourmet chocolates and even a bottle of wine to bring home after letting our waiter at Mi Casa know we enjoyed it. I really can not say enough about the incredible serviceHave a wonderful time.", "offset": [1332, 1370], "date": "2015-12-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "850bae7e-4a1d-4ee8-b284-e0d4087d83bc", "sentence": "Great getaway.

A couple of complaints that prevent a 5th star1. The overall restaurant offering ended up feeling a little short. I think this is because the Main Restaurant Mi Casa is a tapas restaurant. I do not have a solution but we felt limited in our choices. Room service menu was limited as well. We ordered Encanto Grill items to our room one night but we had to make special arrangements for this2. The Dorado Beach Ritz Carlton Reserve does not participate in the Mariot Rewards program. I can find no reasonable explanation for this. I have no idea why this property wants to turn it is back on all the Mariot Rewards members by not participating. I also do not understand why Mariot allows this. Not earning points is a deal killer for us to regularly stay at this hotel3. Ambassador program. When you check in you are escorted to your room by your Ambassador. This person is your single contact for questions and any of your needs.

West Beach is nice because you can swim right out your door. East Beach is nice because it is super private you do not get people walking past your yard all day and night. If you are a photographer bring your camera. Every single sight is worth shooting. There is a water park with a lazy river and slides open on the weekends. Well worth a visit. A couple of complaints that prevent a 5th star1. The overall restaurant offering ended up feeling a little short. I think this is because the Main Restaurant Mi Casa is a tapas restaurant. I do not have a solution but we felt limited in our choices. Room service menu was limited as well. We ordered Encanto Grill items to our room one night but we had to make special arrangements for this2. The Dorado Beach Ritz Carlton Reserve does not participate in the Mariot Rewards program. I can find no reasonable explanation for this. I have no idea why this property wants to turn it is back on all the Mariot Rewards members by not participating. I also do not understand why Mariot allows this. Not earning points is a deal killer for us to regularly stay at this hotel3. Ambassador program.

There was never an bad attitude or an aura of waiting to punch out of the clock. Your team truly seems like they love working there and being the best that they can be. Enormous kudos and thank yous to our Embajadors Orlando and Jimmy. If there are opportunities for them to be promoted then please give them consideration. What a team they are. We traveled with four kids and their thoughtfulness and intuition was outstanding. Also an enormous shout out to Josue in Mi Casas kitchen. The morning we checked out the to die for banana muffins were not available due to unripe bananas. I feigned exaggerated disappointment lots of laughs over that one and when we were leaving Josue surprised me with a box of hot out of the oven fresh banana muffins. WOW.

It is that good. Simply put this is among the most spectacular hotels I have been to. From the moment your pull up alongside a waterfall and floating lily pond you will walk up steps to the lobby actually a outdoor check in area with a full view of the ocean. We were given a personal tour of the grounds after check in and escorted to our room. As many people have noted there are pools located on the 1st floor rooms but ours was on the 2nd floor. I may be wrong but I am skeptical of those pools and what fluids other than water and chlorine may or may not be lurking inside. The outdoor shower on the other hand was one of the most exciting experiences it is a bit of a thrill to be taking a shower like that at first but you quickly begin to luxuriate in the experience. Rooms were much larger than normal some 110 sqft with a large sitting area and sliding doors to the patios. The pool bar and general landscaping are flawless. When you decide to go to the spa the magnificent tree with hanging lights at the entrance will make you feel like you are walking into a scene from Avatar. The hanging herbs at the spa give off an amazing aroma. On checkin they invite you to relax in their men or womens wet lounges or in their pineapple garden. When I heard that I thought this was some silly Ritz Carlton marketing gimmick that would have a carving of a pineapple or something. nope it is a actual pineapple garden with rows of growing fruits. The mens side of the wet lounge felt like something from swiss family robinson. Jacuzis built into the rocks iguanas hanging from trees and rope pull buckets of water to cool off. There is a steam room that appears to be made from shipwrecked salvaged parts but is in fact a outstanding example of sense of place that even Disney World would slow clap for. Make sure to eat at Mi Casa. Jose Andres is an amazing chef and this restaurant lives up to his reputation. I suggest arriving early and having a seat at the open bar where staff will make any drink under the sun you can think of with local fresh ingredients. If you have a longing for a bygone experience of elegance and opulence with a dash of island whimsy thrown in then look no further. Let me make a note There are those who say I stay at Ritz hotels everywhere and I always get X or Y I hate those people. This is not a Ritz Carlton in the traditional sense this is a Reserve product.

We visited this resort for six days in February for my fathers 70th birthday it was a wonderful place to celebrate. Upon arrival we were offered fresh tropical fruit popsicles delicious. Check in was quick and we were immediately brought to our rooms which were in a building that was maybe a 4 minute walk from the main building down beautiful tree lined paths. RomOur room West Beach was breathtaking. It contained a king size bed and a queen size sofabed a couch during the day for our 10 and 12 year old daughters. The room was spacious clean and contained fresh chocolate chip cookies and milk as a welcome. In my dads room which was next door there was free rum for his welcome. there is a fridge and a Tazo coffee maker fresh fruit and plenty of storage space from shelving to drawers to a large closet. The bathroom amenities are plentiful. Because we were on the ground level the back of the room contained enormous sliding glass doors which opened up to a private plunge pool incredible. just steps from the beach. Another highlight was the outdoor shower with a huge shower head that made it feel as though you were standing in the rain even more so because there was no roof you could see right up to the sky. This space is separated from the rest of the bathroom by just a window so if you are anxious about showering where others could see you it might be uncomfortable. but we just made sure to give one another privacy so it was not an issue. Amenities. ActivitiesWe rented bikes which was a fantastic decision as we were able to use them to tour the property get exercise ride to dinner etc. One morning we rode through the golf course to the Watermil. Unfortunately we got there before it opened and our daughters were too hot and tired to wait so we did not get to experience it but the slides and pool looked like fun. Our embajadores were able to get us boogie body boards all we had to do was ask. Although we did not realize it until too late it seems that you can ask to use the stand up paddle boards too and your embajadores will help you out. The fitness facilities were well apportioned although we were not always in the mood to get to them. The trail past Ambassadors of the Environment along the beach and golf course is a beautiful spot to go running walking biking etc. It does become a public path farther along but that was not a problem in any way. Speaking of the trail there are several art installations set up around the property including some along the trail that are really interesting. We did not take part in any of the programs being offered although they were varied and all looked good. We spent time playing games and using the fosbal tables in the rooms near Mi Casa and Positivo. Fun. Ambassadors of the Environment We did a night snorkeling adventure and it was one of the highlights of our stay. Our guide Caitlyn was tremendous helpful informative funny reassuring. We saw octopus eels conch and an incredible array of fish. The entire time we were scared out of our minds. but it was more than worth it. HIGHLY recomendBeachesWe spent most of our time at the beach in front of the West Beach rooms and suites all of the other beaches looked great too. There were always chairs and umbrellas available with cold bottled water and sunscreen too and our embajadores were happy to set up towels for us on the chairs. Employees come by at fairly regular intervals to take food and drink orders your order can take a while to arrive but such is the nature of asking for a daiquiri on the beach. The sand does slope somewhat deeply into the water so sandcastles is a bit difficult. but it was not a problem. I have seen others say that they felt the surf looked too rough to swim in but we swam every day and had no issue with it. The hammocks near the pools tend to fill up but we were able to use them when we wanted to. PolsWe spent time at both pools which were great we found the one near Encanto La Cocina to be more crowded and kid filled not necessarily a negative. Food and beverage service was available too both at the bar itself and via servers who would bring everything right to your chair. Food RestaurantsLa Cocina. We stopped here several times for coffee ice cream and snacks. Not a huge selection but nice as an option. Mi Casa We ate breakfast here every morning and loved it. The buffet was very affordable for the kids less so for the adults but we were able to find things off of the menu that we enjoyed. My father and stepmom also ate dinner here one night and said it was good. Encanto. We ate dinner here twice. Both times the food was good and the view was fantastic. but the service was lacking. Side orders that never arrived drink orders needing to be placed three times before arriving not following requests hamburger arriving on a bun despite asking for no bun allergy meat being over or under cooked etc. Positivo sushi. We ate here the night we arrived. Although we enjoyed the food our daughters were so exhausted from traveling we were not able to fully take in the restaurant and the sushi menu appealed more to the adults than the kids so we did not go back another night. Really beautiful venue. Barlovento We ate here before doing an evening adventure at Ambassadors of the Environment. Although the menu is small the restaurants hours it stays open through the afternoon and into the evening whereas the official dinner restaurants close between lunch and dinner and location made it appealing. Our food was just fine too for what essentially amounts to bar fodServiceEveryone with whom we came into contact was extremely friendly. With that said service was a bit hit or miss. Our Embajadores were alternatively tremendously helpful ordering us lunch on the beach when we were not able to find anyone who was taking orders or unavailable for hours at a time. As such we did not rely on them but when they were available it was great. Side NoteJim Gafigan the comedian was staying with his family while we were there celebrity sightings make things fun. Bottom LineThis is an absolutely stunning property with well kept clean beautiful facilities and plenty of activities and amenities for people of all ages and abilities. Gorgeous beaches lovely pools. The rooms especially those with plunge pools are superb. Good service. Overall we had no true complaints about Dorado Beach. but for the money we do not particularly feel it is a value we have had similar experiences service and amenities wise at far less expensive resorts.

The Ritz Reserve at Dorado Beach has left me speechless. From the location to the service to the food my breath is simply taken away with their perfection. Thankfully TripAdvisor has never asked me to speak or breath for that matter so without spoken words or breath I am happy to write of my phenomenal experience at the Ritz Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach. To begin it is my belief that a vacation is an investment. An investment of your free time as well as your money. It is wise to do your research for such things and after multiple visits to this property I can tell you that this is one of the greatest vacation investments I have ever made. Here is why1. The service. At this beautiful possibly perfect setting it is hard to imagine their service and people as their 1 asset not the pristine beaches or lush jungle atmosphere. And then you meet the people and you witness their service and you know why they are 1. The service at this property is second to none. The people are kind and gracious and eager and amazingly so happy. It is obvious that the luxury Mariot brand treats their staff well and that treatment is then passed on to us while they resist the temptation of becoming annoyingly stuffy which some luxury resorts end up being. The staff genuinely wants you to enjoy your time with them and are all incredibly skilled in understanding your needs while seamlesly meeting them with a smile. I always say that we come to Puerto Rico but we always come back for the people. Well we came to Dorado but we will come back for the people. 2. The location. This setting is amazing. Morning to noon evening to night the views of this property will take your breath away. From strolling through the natural jungle setting to relaxing with your toes in the sand what Mother Nature once tried to take away Maria the Ritz has given back and with amazing gusto. Within the last year over 300 more plants have been planted here. After the hurricane the island of Puerto Rico needed its own plants so they had to get them from Costa Rica. I ca n\u2019t imagine Costa Rica has any plants now as this place is a jungle paradise. As for the beach it has everything one could dream of with soft sand turquoise water and easy waves. Long ago large rocks were placed far out in the surf to help make the \u201c bay \u201d of Dorado incredibly serene. I \u2019m not sure how they got those rocks out there without the help of God or a Maria but it makes for the perfect amount of ocean waves to swim in and just the right amount of ocean sounds to fall asleep to3. Couples families. While vacation investing this is a bigie. To be fair there are resorts in the world that cater to adults and there are resorts in the world that cater to children. Couples Resorts in Jamaica do a nice job at catering to adults only but there \u2019s something about all that \u201c free \u201d booze wine food. while Disney does a great job catering to children but there \u2019s something about all those kids. \u200d \u2640 \ufe0f. The Ritz Dorado focuses on guests of all walks and all ages of life. From a couple on a romantic getaway to a family looking for some quality downtime all together every need of every guest is anticipated even before arrival and constantly met after. The last time I visited this property I was a couple and they stopped at nothing to ensure our visit was romantic perfection. This time we had our 8 year old son with us and I was blown away at their level of family focus that I feel is incredibly difficult to pull off without appearing over the top kidish. My son took part in their Ambassadors of the Environment program and had a blast while exploring the nighttime jungle experimenting with nighttime sounds while finding the adorable frogs with the ambassador group. But to further my point his adventure ended at 9 while my husband and I were still enjoying dinner at Positivo. I texted our embajador Joshua that we were still at dinner so he insisted we stay and enjoy our meal as long as we liked picked our son up and then made fresh picked smoothies together in the chefs kitchen while our dinner ended. Everyone knew our sons name and asked about his day whenever we passed by. George the GM made sure he had his very own ambassador rash guard and dorado hat and while Zekiel and Jordan went out of their way on the beach to give our son boogie boarding tips we sat and enjoyed ourselves on the beach. That is how you cater to couples and families. 4. Money. When investing it often comes down to it. This is a luxury resort. You can find a lot of options that are far cheaper on the island and in the world but you will be missing out on all of the above as well as everything else. You wo n\u2019t get Karla who emails you your itinerary and dinner reservations a week before your arrival. You wo n\u2019t have management deliver you flowers and cake for your birthday. You wo n\u2019t get to spend a rainy afternoon with your son playing in your room \u2019s plunge pool while Jordan offers you afternoon guacamole and champagne as you read on your patio. You wo n\u2019t have a Joshua or a Jonathon or an Orlando tactfully meet your every need with a smile that makes you return their smile with a gracious hug. Here at the Ritz Reserve of Dorado you will spare no expense because they have spared no expense. That being said they do NOT nickel and dime you. You pay a hefty room cost but bottles of water are plentiful everywhere you look and free. Sunscreen and Evian facial spray are readily available and complimentary. Rides to and from the many resort amenities are quickly offered and at no cost. The waterpark is simply amazing with a jungle set lazy river and waterslides at no additional cost to note the waterpark is close enough for families to easily get to but far enough away that couples need never know it \u2019s even there. The bottom line is that never is there a time when you are paying a bill that you feel as if it is not worth it and that is quite an accomplishment on their part. You have accomplished a lot in your life why not let them show you theirs even if just for a week. Spare no expense. They have n\u2019t. 5. Lastly but far from leastly come to Puerto Rico. We have traveled the world. We have stayed at very nice places. We know how to vacation. While friends and family go to Hawaii and Mexico and other islands in the Caribbean we try them all and always come back to Puerto Rico. Whatever you want from a vacation Puerto Rico can offer and let me say they are back up and running and ready to offer it to you more than ever. I hate to say that they need you to but they do. On this trip we traveled all over the island. From Dorado to Rincon to San Juan they are bustling communities that are ready to earn your dollar. I can not think of a place or a people more deserving of you.", "offset": [5190, 5287], "date": "2018-10-20", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "894b4b2e-5665-4455-9973-d6c2f5e34a24", "sentence": "Best in class location and facilities poor food and service for the price. First the positive this place is truly amazing in terms of the hotel rooms beaches spa tennis courts swimming pools water sports. My family and I made the most of all of these and combined with the awesome 88 F weather when back home in NY it was freezing made us very happy. Unfortunately there were a few issues that put quite a damper on our experience. Every meal was very slow including twice having to wait 15 hours for room service dinner. The restaurants did not have tables unles you booked well in advance and the service at the pools was also terribly slow even for a singe drink. At least four times the orders were wrong we have 3 vegetarians in our family of 4. eg gnocchi with pesto came with meat. And it is pricey for quite mediocre food a meal for 4 without drinks can easily be 150 200 which we had be more than willing to pay fir it was good but not for something that tasted like Olive Garden or Aplebes. Also while the staff were polite and wanted to be helpful they were trying way too hard. So for example we had 3 different people come and apologize about the dinner. when really we just want them to get it right and one apology is enough three actually makes it worse. Perhaps they are not fully ready for guests after all they only just re opened a month or two ago. But that is no excuse at their price point. I would consider going back if their service and quality of food improves but without that there are many better places to go for the same or less price.", "offset": [205, 350], "date": "2018-11-30", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 33, "uid": "4ce59037-3f15-4534-8bfb-8899ae974f91", "sentence": "Re opened dorado beach Ritz Carlton.

My family and I stayed at the resort 114 117 for my birthday weekend and we instantly fell in love with the resort and ca n\u2019t wait to go back. We were really impressed with the level of professionalism dedication and commitment of every team member at the Ritz. The grounds at the resort were just incredible the landscape was to perfection the villa we stayed in was gorgeous and the views were just stunning. Unfortunately during our stay my husband became ill and had to be rushed to the hospital. At the time of the incident I was with my daughter at the water park and my husband was resting in the room. He called for help and you instantly responded to his care and for that I will always be thankful. The prevention team took care of him and every need. They were quick and efficient and even had an assigned ambassador with him the entire time at the hospital. I was so touched by everything the team did during our stay at the hotel and at the hospital. I also want to mention that The Loss Prevention Team Antonio Quinones and Felix Echavaria was amazing. Felix stayed with my husband for 12 hours at the hospital and did n\u2019t leave his side. During the emergency hospital visit he even stayed with my daughter so that I could see my husband. He maintained the same level of professionalism and Ritz standards as if he was still at the resort. He is a tremendous asset to the Ritz Carlton Family and is a stellar example of the Ritz Carlton brand. I was impressed by the constant communication between Felix and you also on how efficient the team was in getting my daughter and I to the hospital to see my husband for the thoughtful and delicious lunch bags and the linens and blankets for my husband. After spending 5 hours in the hospital waiting area my choice Felix arranged our transportation back to the hotel. When we returned to the room I noticed that all of the bed linens were changed and the room had been cleaned. I was so impressed by the housekeeping team for taking the initiative and for all the details during our stay. I also want to acknowledge and thank the gentleman I did n\u2019t get his name. that took care of getting my husbands prescription before our departure on 117. He was also amazing quick and efficient. Everyone went the extra mile for my family and I and there is n\u2019t enough praise or thanks that can ever match what you and the team did for us. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.", "offset": [301, 449], "date": "2019-12-22", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 39, "uid": "29a6be15-09e7-4bec-b79c-e79c13c6df67", "sentence": "Nice property terrible service. THE GOOD. Amazing gym. Nice pools especially for the kids. Rooms are nice. THE BAD the service is about as terrible as can be aside from anyone being outright rude. I say this being a pretty patient and understanding guy having been a service worker and worked in hospitality at earlier points in life. I almost never write reviews but the service is so poor I did n\u2019t even wait to leave to write a review. Unbelievably bad service consistently at the pool at the restaurant in room dining concierge. It was refreshing when someone was the exception and there were exceptions. Do n\u2019t get me wrong.
