Let me explain. Ok so I stayed here for five nights so I think that gives me the right to write a review. I am currently on my 5th night so I do know what I am talking about. So starting with check in on Sunday evening at check in. Natalia was at the front desk and checked me in. Now I am 51 years old and have traveled a fair amount. Never before have I been asked if I had a floor level preference. In the past I have asked several times and usually told that they couldt accommodate me. But Natalia did and I was accommodated. She is a very courteous and pleasant person to speak and deal with. A Moving on I ate dinner at the bar lounge all five nights. The bartender server Michael was a GREAT guy great sense of humor very busy the whole time but on each subsequent evening he greeted me by name told me the dinner special remembered what I was drinking and asked me if I wanted the same or wanted to try something different. I had told him the first night that I was partial to craft beers. When I wanted something different he gave me suggestions described the beer and always gave me a fresh frosted mug and was very cheerful. What a great asset to have at a business serving the public. One night as I was sitting at the bar he was restocking the liquor shelves. He removed the first bottle and began wiping down the shelve. After several minutes and after he had removed all the bottles and was wiping down all the shelves I joked with him that he may be a little OCD. He laughed and just explained that he liked a nice presentation and wanted everything to be clean. I 100 agreed with him and I can definitely appreciate that. that is awesome another A As to the food It was also very good. I had the Big Hippie Salad twice and the dinner specials twice different specials and on the fifth day I had a burger. I even asked for peppers on it and they were happy to accommodate me. The only criticism I would have is the variety. They once had the same special three nights in a row. But on a side note Michael offered me a shuttle to another dining location of my choice which I declined but it was a nice tough. I did have it one of the nights and it as was the dinners each and every night was very good. I have to tell you the salads were awesome always VERY fresh and very presentable but like I said they should mix it up a bit on the specials. An A at the worst. maybe an A And on to the room. Now I am a bit of a clean freak. Not terrible but I make the bed rinse the tub after my shower etc. But every evening when I returned to my room it was a bit better than I left it. That is awesome in my book. The cleaning staff I believe took the extra time to maybe get rid of the wrinkles in the beed cover straighten the pillows a bit etc. Every aspect of it was an improvement. Another A Now I can not guarantee everyone will experience the same as I did. but I believe an hope you do. I really believe they really treated me like they would want to be treated. And that is what gives them a solid five stars.", "offset": [1660, 1723], "date": "2016-02-08", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "4cf1f35f-29c3-4955-a0f9-defbace8c356", "sentence": "Great hotel close to spring training.
