Not to mention the delicious warm cookie on arrival. We have been using this hotel for 6 years now and it is our go to prior to flying somewhere warm every year. They have a complimentary airport shuttle and it runs until midnight but will come for you up to 1 am if they are aware of a flight delay late flight. The front desk is always helpful and ready to assist if we have forgotten any toiletries etc and really make you feel like they are there to help you. we will keep coming back. Ask the bar to make you a Doubletree Martini which is a mixture of vodka butterscotch liquer and baileys.

Till You Stay There. Started with a long drive and a seemingly hurried check in. Got to my room with all my luggage and the key did not work so I had to go back down and have the key reset. Was impressed by the facilities lobby pool and work out room. Walked into my room and saw a huge sliding door and got excited until there was no way to open it it had rusted shut. And yes I had removed the security bar. Then I had left my bathmat down on the floor from my shower after my work out the night before and when i went to readjust it there were two large bugs under the mat. Left my toiletries case in the bathroom because I did not want to put it back in my suitcase. Then i went down to breakfast and was asked if I wanted the buffet or to order off a menu and I said the buffet was fine. Had an egg and a piece of toast with coffee and was presented with a bill for 1695. There was no signs indicating that they would charge that for a simple breakfast. I made it a point to check out and tell the clerk about my issues and was promised that they would add an extra 70 points to my Hilton Honors account and it is now a month later that did not happen either.

My sister and I stayed overnight before a flight to Orlando. The building is undergoing a substantial construction update. The front desk was moved to a hallway as was the computer access. The restaurant is also undergoing a facelift so was displaced in another area. With that said the staff from front desk to the restaurant to the airport shuttle chauffeur were wonderful. They accommodated our concerns and questions in a very understandable and pleasant manner. We had breakfast and supper in the restaurant. Supper was a signature pizza for 12 which we both thoroughly enjoyed. The sense of humor of the waitress with us was fun and made the time relaxing. Breakfast was also enjoyed fresh fruit parfait delicious and omelet flavorful. We were able to use the indoor pool and hot tub both clean and refreshing. The construction of course produced a little dust and minimal noise. We understood. All of our needs were met in a very professional courteous manner.

The Doubletree was a very nice business style hotel. By that I mean that it looked like the type of hotel where business meetings or conferences are held very spacious several meeting rooms and a lot of amenities. There was also a nice restaurant and a small bar available. When we stayed the hotel was pretty empty and the staff was extremely friendly. I was surprised that the room prices were so low. The restaurant and bar prices were more in keeping with a conference hotel. We really liked staying there but I could see that it could prove different if it was packed with conference attendees. While we were there there were several families taking advantage of the beautiful pool. We really liked the quality of the entire facility. There is quite an array of hotels nearby.

The staff was completely unprepared stressed and we ended up waiting an hour and 20 minutes to never receive our food. We had to take a coffee carafe and utensils sugar and cream from a vacant table as we were totally forgot about. Our server I did n\u2019t catch his name was extremely rude and stressed. They did n\u2019t prepare well for guests and a brunch simultaneously I guess. Besides the breakfast fiasco it was good. Again front desk staff was very helpful and nice.
