We found a video on The Vintage Inn and Vilagio online and were hooked. From the beauty of the rooms and resort to the amazing town of Yountvile we loved everything about Vintage Inn. Our room was large had a wonderful fireplace 2 head shower one rain had a comfy area outside the back door to sit and read or nap. We used the pool and hot tub nightly after spending the day at the vineyards before heading off walking to incredible dinners in Yountvile. Each morning there was wonderful buffet that included fruit pastries and an omelet station. We did not get a chance to use the Spa but we stopped by and were very tempted.

I just returned from my third stay at the Vintage Inn. I am happy to report that the property remains in great form and continues to provide excellent service and access to the great food beverage benefits of Yountvile. The wonderful rooms especially the cottage suites still provide good amenities large living space and great bed. I will not restate the many positive reviews touting the breakfast and afternoon tea. I will reiterate the that service across the board remains excellent. Its worth noting that the Vintage Inn and sister propoerty Vilagio were recently purchased by a large commercial developer property company. I understand that Vilagio is in great need to refreshing. The Vintage will benefit from a revamped lobby lounge area and pool area. While these areas are decent now they will surely be quite improved following the winter renovation. Hopefully they will also spruce up the fitness room which is the one area I found to be sub par for a top resort. if you are planning a winter visit to the property I had check on the level of service ambiance disruption during the renovations. Side note. One somewhat unpleasant surprise this visit was the number of families with kids at the property. I have kids and adore them but I do not go to wine country to hang out with them. I am mystified that people would choose to bring their kids to Napa seems like there are many far better kid friendly choices. The only real downside was that the pool area was less relaxing with kids playing and splashing about.

My fianc\u00e9e and I spent two nights at the Vintage Inn on a recent trip to visit Napa Valley wineries and we could not have been any happier with our hotel selection. We found the Vintage Inn and the town of Yountvile to be the perfect places to stay as a home base for our trip. The inn was just so cute and quaint \u2013 small enough to feel cozy large enough to operate as a well run hotel. Everything at the Vintage Inn from the room to the breakfast to the staff to the location was top notch and exceeded expectationsChosing the Hotel. This was our first trip to the Napa Valley so before arriving we really did n\u2019t have a good sense of the geography of the area. We identified pretty quickly that Napa Yountvile or St Helena would be the main towns to choose from for accommodations. My initial thought was to stay in the town of Napa simply because it was a familiar name which we assumed would be the center of the Napa Valley. However that \u2019s not really the case and after visiting I \u2019m glad we chose to stay in Yountvile instead. Napa is basically the first major town you encounter when driving into the valley from the San Francisco area and it \u2019s nice enough but it \u2019s more built up and more busy than we were looking for with many chain hotels restaurants and stores around. It is a larger town with more permanent residents and activity whereas Yountvile feels like a sleepy little village seemingly there almost solely for the benefit of tourists. Fine dining cute boutiques and wine shops are all within walking distance and everything looks perfect at all times in Yountvile. Beyond liking the quaint feel of Yountvile we found Yountvile to be much more convenient than Napa for visiting wineries St Helena would also be quite convenient. When driving up either the Silverado Trail or Route 29 the main concentration of wineries does n\u2019t really begin until you hit Yountvile and the towns going north. By staying at the Vintage Inn we were always close to the wineries we wanted to visit and could easily stop back at the hotel any time if we wanted or needed to. After identifying Yountvile as our ideal location for our accommodations we looked into the various hotel options in the town. The Vintage Inn and Vilago its very similar sister hotel right down the street both quickly came up quickly as options to consider. We also looked at several other hotels in Yountvile all of which looked great. However even though we were going to be staying during the shoulder season in November and we would be there on Sunday and Monday nights the prices still managed to be pretty high at every hotel in Yountvile. While exploring our options I noticed that Hotwire was offering one of its Hot Rate deals for a 4star hotel in Yountvile at a rate that was 50 less than the cheapest rate we were finding for any hotel in Yountvile at the time. The only catch was that the name of the hotel would n\u2019t be revealed until after we had booked and paid and it could n\u2019t be cancelled. Since every possible hotel option in Yountvile was appealing to us we were willing to take the risk. I was pretty sure we \u2019d get either the Vintage Inn or Vilago anyway and it turns out we got the Vintage Inn. The one and only somewhat frustrating experience with the Vintage Inn came right after we made our reservation. Hotwire specified that we were n\u2019t able to choose our room type and that the hotel would choose the room type for us based upon availability. Although we preferred a room with a king bed we were willing to take the risk that we \u2019d get a room with two beds to save money. I decided to call the hotel after we made our reservation in order to put in a request for a king bed. When I called the staff member I spoke with in the reservations department indicated that we had been blocked into a standard room with two queen beds. I had already done my research online and knew that the hotel still had standard rooms with a king bed available for our dates which sell for the same price as the standard rooms with two queens. I explained that we had booked on Hotwire and knew the hotel had discretion to choose our room type but that we would prefer to be blocked into an equivalent room with a king bed if possible. Her response was that our Hotwire reservation specified that we had to have a room with two beds so they could not change that in their system. She did note our request for a king bed which she said would be handled upon arrival. However I just found it odd that she acted as if the hotel had no control over its own reservations. The staff member I spoke with was n\u2019t necessarily rude but it seemed like it would be a really easy switch to block us into a king room. On the flip side since Hotwire specified that the hotel had full discretion to choose our room type I reminded myself that it was ultimately up to the hotel to choose to our room. During our stay we ended up with a perfect room with a king bed that we wanted so everything turned out fine. Arrival Experience. As soon as we drove up to the Vintage Inn I was pretty sure we had chosen the right hotel. The minute you turn off of Highway 29 into Yountvile you are transported into an idyllic little village and the Vintage Inn just fits into it perfectly with its well manicured grounds pretty flowers and rooms set up in various buildings that each look slightly different all with the feeling of French provincial cottages. We arrived on a Sunday morning around 930 am just to see the property and get the basic check in mechanics handled before departing for a day of wine tasting. The man who was working at the front desk at the time was extremely nice and personable. He gave the feeling that the staff was genuinely delighted that we had arrived and would be staying there for the next two nights. The front desk staff at most hotels is significantly more cold and business like. He was extremely apologetic about the fact that our room was n\u2019t yet ready at 930 am I never would have expected it to be ready anyway and offered to expedite room cleaning for us. Without me even mentioning it he also noted our request for a king bed and confirmed that a king room was available for us. He also encouraged us to take advantage of the hotel \u2019s complimentary breakfast which was set up in the lobby and outside on the patio at the time. We received a call about 90 minutes later to let us know that our room was ready for check in but we did n\u2019t have a chance to go back until around 60 pm. The staff member working at that time was also very nice and I was impressed that after simply mentioning that we had already checked in and that I was there to pick up our room keys she knew who I was and immediately greeted me by name giving the feeling that she had been expecting us. Room. After initially being worried that we were n\u2019t going to get a good room we ended up feeling like we had one of the best rooms at the hotel. We were given a king room on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to the main lobby building overlooking the pool Room 805. We had a great view but also appreciated that we were so close to the lobby for breakfast and afternoon tea although no room is overly far from it. The room itself was just lovely. It was spacious but felt so cozy which was great on the chilly fall evenings that we were there. I highly recommend requesting a room on the second floor since it allowed us to have great vaulted ceilings in the room which contributed even more to the feeling of spaciousness. The only negative to the second floor is that there are no elevators so you \u2019l have to carry luggage up the stairs to get to the room. However that \u2019s a small price to pay. It was obvious that the rooms and bathrooms here are recently renovated and they \u2019ve done a great job of making the updates that really matter like installing new bathroom fixtures and bedding while retaining the classic features that make this hotel unique such as the stone fireplaces in every room comfortable armchairs to sink into and nice area rugs and accessories. The bed was extremely comfortable and nice for sleeping off a day of wine drinking. It was so nice that a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room with glasses and a wine opener ours was a cabernet sauvignon from Sonoma and the wood burning fireplace was also easy to operate with a Duraflame log and matches ready to go. I also appreciated the twice daily room cleaning with turndown service as well as some other little things like the nicely sized mini fridge and the separate wifi network for each room with complimentary Internet access. The bathroom was one of my favorite parts of the room. It was very spacious featuring a large vanity with double sinks and plenty of storage for toiletries underneath or on the counter. The L\u2019Ocitane toiletries are a nice treat as well. The floors and all fixtures were clearly recently re done but the piece de resistance of the bathroom was the enormous walk in shower which could literally hold an entire family. There were separate showerheads at either end of the shower which was beautifully finished with white subway tiles all around and very pretty iridescent tiles on the bottom. Overall it was clear that bathrooms had been a focus of the hotel \u2019s renovations and I think it was definitely money well spent. Although the room was very spacious and comfortable it was really nice to also have a separate covered balcony. Our balcony was quite pleasant and large with a nice outdoor couch and chair and a good pool view to one side. Since the hotel is right off of Highway 29 others have commented that the rooms can be loud with traffic noise. We could not hear any traffic noise at all from our room but we could hear it from our balcony. However this noise was n\u2019t significant enough to be much of a bother. I really do n\u2019t have enough good things to say about our room at the Vintage Inn. Our room felt like a really comfortable guest room in someone \u2019s home not a generic hotel room. The only thing I would note is to be aware of leaving windows open in your room. The hotel is designed with all exterior corridors with each room having windows on multiple sides which is really nice for getting plenty of natural light. However it also means you might find something like a big window in your bathroom directly overlooking an exterior corridor. We had this and our housekeeper would always leave it open which was n\u2019t a big deal but we had to make sure to be cognizant to close the window and shutters to avoid being on display to passers by. Grounds Amenities Location As I \u2019ve already mentioned the grounds at the Vintage Inn are wonderfully park like and pretty. There is essentially one main courtyard in the middle that most rooms open out onto which features well manicured landscaping and fountains. It \u2019s a small enough property that you can walk from one end to the other in about two or three minutes and all rooms are relatively convenient to the main parking lot that runs behind the property on the Highway 29 side. I think the Vintage Inn really does have a prime location for touring the Napa Valley. It \u2019s in Yountvile which is both well located and perfectly cute with great restaurants shops and tasting rooms within walking distance. The Vintage Inn is right in the center with world renowned restaurants like the French Laundry less than a block away. The V Marketplace is right across the parking lot and we even went hot air ballooning one morning with a company based there Aloft Napa Valley which was an excellent memorable experience just a couple minutes \u2019 walk away from our room. As far as amenities there is the outdoor pool and hot tub which our room overlooked. The pool area was attractive and would be quite pleasant for swimming during a warmer time of year. I suspect that the pool must be heated since it was open when we were there in November and I saw other guests using it on a couple occasions. I know there is also a fitness center which I believe is located slightly ofsite somewhere between the Vintage Inn and Vilagio. I never ventured over to see it. The dedicated spa for the hotel the Spa Vilagio is over at the Vilago hotel which is about a five minute walk down Washington Street past the V Marketplace and a couple other businesses and parking lots. Dining. Vintage Inn does n\u2019t its own restaurant but it certainly does n\u2019t need to since there are several highly rated and well regarded restaurants in Yountvile within walking distance. We tried Thomas Keller \u2019s Bouchon and had a very pleasant dinner there as well as RD Kitchen for something a bit more casual. Both were quite nice but I thought Bouchon was the better of the two. However the dining that is offered at the Vintage Inn is great. A complimentary hot breakfast is offered to all guests each morning in addition to tea each afternoon. The breakfast is offered in the lobby where the food is attractively displayed right when you walk in with a bunch of tables available to one side. There is also a very attractive outdoor patio right off of the lobby with more seating. We chose to take our breakfast outside each morning since the weather was nice and there was more space outside. It was just lovely sitting out on the patio to start each morning. The food offered on the buffet is really high quality which also impressed me. In addition to Chandon champagne and various juices to make mimosas the breakfast included a large selection of pastries that were quite tasty as well fresh fruit a nice selection of Clover Farms yogurt delicious biscuits with sausage gravy and breakfast potatoes. Outside on the patio a chef was making omelets to order with various toppings and the omelets I had were some of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel breakfast buffet. As a whole the breakfast here was one of the best I \u2019ve had at a hotel anywhere so it seemed like such a value that it was included in the room rate. The only thing that was disappointing about breakfast was that the made to order waffle station was n\u2019t available everyday. When we stopped in briefly on our check in day a Sunday we did n\u2019t eat too much from the buffet but I noticed that there was a waffle station outside in addition to the omelet station. I was really looking forward to trying a waffle the next two mornings we \u2019d be there but found that the waffles must only be offered on weekends since they were n\u2019t available on Monday or Tuesday. I \u2019m not sure why this would be a weekend only item since the hotel felt no less crowded on Monday or Tuesday when we were there. Regardless the breakfast was just lovely and delicious and I could n\u2019t think of a better way to start our mornings at the Vintage Inn than to enjoy a mimosa and tasty hot breakfast on the patio. We also stopped into the lobby one afternoon to check out the afternoon tea offerings. There is n\u2019t as much offered for afternoon tea but it \u2019s still nice. Lemonade tea cookies and scones are available which we took back with us to our room and enjoyed on the balcony. The afternoon tea felt a little bit sparse in comparison to breakfast but it was a nice feature too. Overall Overall I really have nothing but positive things to say about the Vintage Inn. It \u2019s a small hotel that is well run and well maintained. The rooms are spacious nicely decorated and comfortable. We could not have felt happier with our decision to stay here as it contributed in a positive way to a couple of wonderful days in the Napa Valley. We enjoyed starting each day with breakfast at the hotel and ending each day walking to dinners in quaint Yountvile. I really did n\u2019t want to leave when our two night stay was over. Definitely do not hesitate to stay here \u2013 you wo n\u2019t be disappointed.", "offset": [6957, 7092], "date": "2017-01-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "4095b998-2b85-4e97-979a-4deca17a0723", "sentence": "Loyal customer.

I stayed at the Vintage Inn for four nights last week. Prior to this visit I stayed there both while I was single and married for a total of five or six times. The reason that I stayed at the Vintage Inn in the past is that it seemed to offer a lot for the money. That is most certainly no longer the case. In fact I would say that it is a very poor value. To start there are some positives. The location is fabulous. The rooms have recently been remodeled. The bathroom is lovely. The rooms are quite large. However there are some weird parts. The makeup mirror has been placed at a level only a really short person could use. The really nice Nespreso machines have been replaced with Keurig machines cost cut. Before leaving I checked the website to see if they still used LOcitane products in the bathrooms. The website said that they did. That is simply not true. Two months ago the hotel changed to Espa. Seriously. The website still has not been updated. Yet another example of cost cutting. As for the fabric on the new love seat and the chair. Shiny cheap velvet that looks like it should be in a 1970s disco. Speaking of cost cutting the breakfast. Each and every time I stayed at the Vintage Inn a big part of the attraction was the fabulous breakfast. omelet station cured meats cheeses different quiches boiled eggs smoked salmon with all the fixings bacon and sausage berries etc. Oh how the mighty have fallen. I have described the current breakfast offerings to my friends as Hampton Inn esque slop. The omelet station is gone because of construction there are none of the other items I just listed and the replacements are awful industrial scrambled eggs sausage gravy with cold biscuits bad fruit. It is just awful. I asked if I could go to the Vilagio for their breakfast wrongly assuming that the construction was the only cause of the lack of nice choices and was told I could go there. Notice the hotel did not inform me that I could go there for omelets I had to ask. Well the Vilagio which has the same owners has the same Hampton Inn esque slop. It is such a disappointment after knowing what the previous owners served for breakfast. A new guest may not find it so awful but any guest of the old owners will be sorely disappointed. Yet another example of the new owners cost cutting. On our third day we just went across the street to Bouchon Bakery for breakfast for which we paid 250. This should not have to be done when you are paying for breakfast as part of your hotel cost. Now onto the construction. I made my initial reservations online with the hotels website. I called at least twice to make changes to the reservations. Neither on the website nor over the phone was I ever notified of the construction that is affecting the property. The property is partially surrounded by chainlink fence covered in green mesh the pool is being rebuilt and the lobby is gone. Because of the construction you have to either walk down the street in your swimsuit and coverup to use the Vilagio pool or drive there. The website states that the Vintage Inn has a pool. That is simply not true. The breakfast which was previously in a large part of the lobby is now in a separate building next door. For this I paid 48 for two of my four nights. In no way was it worth this. I was told that an email should have been sent to me about the construction. Well they never sent it to me and they have never updated their website to inform guests about the major construction that is going on until July August. The hotel has been bought by a private equity hotel group Thayer. Thayer has made many many cost cuts. Besides the cost cuts they fired many of the employees by letter and then rehired them two days later. If someone from management is reading this review they might ask themselves well why did not she say something when she was checking out. The reason I did not is because upon checkout no one asked how my stay was. I certainly would have told them that the lack of notification about the construction the lack of a pool the poor poor breakfast and the downgrade of amenities made me regret staying there and spending what I did. From now on we will stay at either the North Block Hotel or the Hotel Yountvile.

Three hours later the people have not been to collect their things. We asked if there was possibly an umbrella for use and they said they would check. After 12 hour nothing was done.

Their direct tv server was out of order and so we were not able to get any movies in our room either. Because the lobby was under construction the otherwise amazing breakfast wasub par. Gone were the custom omelets crepes and Belgian waffles. Also no sausage or bacon. We also had to make our own mimosas. We were told we could use the pool at the vilagio a sister hotel since theirs was out of order. It was inconvenient since we had to drive there but we were ok until upon arrival at 105 all lounge chairs had been saved by people laying something on them. After 12 hour of laying on the cement and noticing that no one had come to lay on the loungers we talked to the pool staff who said they would check into it. They did not. We then asked management who said they would look into it. They did not. After an hour we finally moved the belongings and used the loungers. Three hours later the people have not been to collect their things. We asked if there was possibly an umbrella for use and they said they would check. After 12 hour nothing was done. We found one ourselves. We are very disappointed in our stay at the vintage and pool service at the Vilagio. Mostly if there are two busy hotels using the same pool on 4th of July weekend there should have been a bigger effort to accommodate the extra guests.

Just returned yesterday from a four day stay at The Vintage House and all I can say is WOW. I had read hundreds of reviews here to pick just the right spot for a place to stay in Napa since we do not get out to California very often and I believe we found it. Yountvile is perfect if you want tranquility and ease since Napa proper is super busy. We booked a suite and were given a wonderful newly refurbished room with large double sink bathroom which is rare in most hotels and so nice to have vaulted ceiling fireplace and super comfortable bed. Check in was easy and you are welcomed with a cold glass of sparkling wine. Parking is ample and yes there is construction around the pool area but it did not hamper our stay one bit. We came to the Napa Valley to relax and enjoy wine not swim. The location is superb walking distance to Bouchon Bistro Jeanty and The French Laundry three world class restaurants. Also near many tasting rooms if you are tired of visiting wineries. Breakfast is included at Vintage House and has a nice array of choices eggs croissants quiche cheeses. and of course sparkling wine. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Thanks Ryan and Daniel.

We were excited to return to the Vintage House after the renovation after having visited it and sister property the Vilagio several times in the past. While the reno itself is gorgeous and bright and the rooms continue to be outstanding we were disappointed with several service differences that did not meet our expectations for a hotel at this price. We visited the property during a harvest weekend in prime season but have also visited at the same time in the past w better service. I do want to share that the concierge and front desk staff were quite helpful and assisted us with bikes as well as calling wineries for an availability. With regards to our service concerns the pool was consistently out of towels and it took a long time to re stock. I do not know why housekeeping was not prepared. Second it took an extremely long time to get drinks at the pool during the day as pool attendants were not walking around unles guests went and asked the front desk to send someone. The hotel is losing revenue from this alone. We were disappointed with breakfast given our past experience. The brunch is a combined area for both hotels during the Vilagios reno which might impact the service. The brunch was extremely depleted even at 830am and we had to wait for everything each day coffee fruit yogurt eggs even water. The brunch while still nice is a downgrade from the prior buffet. no more mimosas made to order omelets or waffles. Additionally as we left early our last day before brunch was open we were disappointed that the hotel lobby no longer has coffee service for those departing early. We also thought it was unprofessional to hear hotel staff in the front lobby talking negatively about the number of events that weekend including an event that we were ourselves excited to attend. Net the property and renovation is gorgeous rooms are extremely comfortable.

The balcony furniture was so comfortable and spacious we had coffee on the balcony every morning and these were some of the best moments of our trip. Really loved having such a useable balcony.

We were truly impressed by this. Lots to choose from it \u2019s on from 7 1am giving you plenty of time which is ideal when on vacation. it \u2019s constantly being refilled so nothing runs out and the lobby is so bright and comfortable we could sit for hours. They truly do a superb job The grounds are very well manicured. The pool area is calming and serene with a beautiful view of the mountains behind the pool. Although there were no cushions on the furniture around the pool making it essentially unusable this might have been due to the time of year but the surroundings are so beautiful that even in cooler temperatures it would have been nice to sit around the pool. There was some prior damage to our room there was a huge dent in the bathroom door and stain on the couch. This did n\u2019t affect our stay just a bit odd to see on an otherwise beautiful property. It also would have been nice to have milk already in the fridge to make coffee with the Nespreso but we simply called in the mornings and the front staff provided it to us. The only other negative is the room service it \u2019s highly overpriced the food is mediocre it comes in disposable containers with plastic cutlery and the food is cold by the time it gets to your room. BUT the breakfast more than makes up for it. Plus there are so many places to eat it in Yountvile it really did n\u2019t matter. Other than those very minor things everything else was wonderful. If we needed anything we simply asked and the staff were accommodating. Chris the front desk manager is fantastic. He is the utmost professional friendly and accommodating.

I am judging this hotel using a higher standard because of the hefty price we paid 60 per night inclusive of fees and taxes. There were four negative incidents during our stay which would never happen at a five star resort. 1. Shortly after we arrived we decided to go to the fitness center to work out before dinner. First we got lost trying to find the fitness center partly due to a lack of signage throughout the property and partly because you have to go out to the parking lot and through the parking lot to the adjacent Vilagio. Eventually we found the fitness center and it was rather small and unimpressive with about five or six pieces of cardio equipment and a weight machine. I ran on the lone treadmill which for some reason was turned around the wrong way facing away from the televisions. I notice that there was no bathroom no water fountain no water cooler and a small fridge that was empty. I needed water so I picked up the house phone to call guest services and the phone was dead no dial tone. Fortunately I had my cellphone so I called the front desk and they said they would send over some water. The water did arrive about twenty minutes later 2 we had breakfast the first day at about 830 and it was very good but the second day we arrived later. about 930. and it was pretty busy. We had to walk around to find a place to sit and we did find a table outside that had just been vacated by another couple. A nearby staff member cleared the dishes and said she would come back to clean the table but she never came back. They simply did not have enough staff on hand to deal with the large number of guest and they ran out of a number of food items as well 3 on the morning of our last day I requested a later checkout which was graciously granted. Upon returning to our room from the pool area we found our key did not work because we were now past the normal checkout time. I went back to the front desk and the associate reprogramed our key card. Back to the room he happened to have the most distant room on the property and the key card still did not work. Back to the front desk again and again the key card was reprogramed. Fortunately this time it worked. 4 the handle on the shower faucet was so loose that it actually fell off and narrowly missed my foot. On a more positive note the rooms and the grounds are quite nice as is the pool area aside from the issues noted above the breakfast is really good and the bellmen are terrific even taking us in a golf cart to the nearby RH for dinner. In sum this is a very nice hotel in a great location but for the price I expected a higher level of service and a better fitness center.", "offset": [1828, 1954], "date": "2019-07-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "4511c316-c44e-4317-a7a2-9b0dc6b5516f", "sentence": "Very comfortable hotel.
