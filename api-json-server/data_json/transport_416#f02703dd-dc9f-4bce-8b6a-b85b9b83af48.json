When we arrived at our room that we were staying at for 3 nights the bathroom had yellowish water that smelled like a porta potty on the floor. We saw it was a leak from the toilet and called the front desk immediately. After waiting 45 minutes in our room that had the worst odor a guy came and spent 20 minutes in the bathroom and then left for tools and did not come back for an hour. Even though we were waiting to get ready for our night our plans were on hold in patience for the bathroom to be fixed. After calling the front desk twice a different guy came to fix our bathroom and he was in there for 2 AND A HALF HOURS. When he left yes the smell was gone but to flush the toilet we had to take the top off and push the lever down inside the top of the toilet. Also our shower head was squirting water from the sides and kept sliding down to where the shower head was upside down shooting water upwards and would not stay in its upright position. ALSO our shower and our sink would not hold hot water for more than 30 seconds. I guess I expected for hotels to check the rooms before they allowed guests to stay in them. I find it unlikely for that room to have been cleaned before we arrived because the fact that there was poop water and a foul smell in the bathroom that went unnoticed is insane. I also found it weird to have the hotel know we were sitting in that room while it smelled and while it was being fixed without any offer to change rooms or wait in the lobby. I liked the balconies could have had a table out there though. Close to the freeway to go to where I wanted to be.

By local standards where the usual two options are either hyper expensive luxury or moderate price and sketchy The Domain was a wonderful exception.

The main interior is a large open atrium that extends up several floors with a large tiered staircase that takes you up to rooms.

A particular perk at this hotel is the free pick up drop off facility to your office in their shuttle provided it is sufficiently near and provided you are OK with the scheduled timings.

First off check in was extremely fast and the front desk and housekeeping staff are considerate and helpful. However the star of the show is the shuttle driver Alex. Alex made my early morning commutes a breeze. I had to travel to multiple campuses for work over the 2 weeks and Alex made the morning commutes seamless.
