The grout was pretty nasty and the toilet seat was completely loose. The walls are paper thin and you will need ear plugs to sleep here or white noise. The plus was that our room was clean but there is only so much maids can do to something run down and old. I will post some pictures. The iron leaked on ironing board and had begun to mold. It took the hotel staff slightly over 40 minutes to get a replacement to us making us miss the beginning of our event next door. I called after fifteen minutes to ask for an ETA and was told he could not give me one. I asked if there was a way I could just come get it and I was told No it will get there when it gets there sir. Once thirty minutes had passed I called again admittedly agitated this time. He said I will call on the radio to see where they are and hung up on me.

First off I understand they are renovating starting 2017. We our locals who went because they offer a secret deal during December called \u201c 5280 Mile High Holiday \u201d.

The reason for the lower rating was the cocktail reception they offered in the evening Oh I wish I took pictures of that. As you can see from pictures posted I am looking at freshly bakes pretzels with hot cheese dip and the like. What they had looked like leftover from the kitchen. A bowl of chips graham crackers a few veggies and some ranch dip. Pretty disappointing if you ask me. I mean I get it hey it \u2019s free but you \u2019l do much better going to the 16th St Mall and simply paying for the aps during happy hour.
