The royal service option ensures you will be pampered. Incredible how EVERYTHING is included. From 6 am to about 9 or 10 pm there is unlimited champagne and all other kinds of fine alcoholic beverages in the dining area of the royal service section of the hotel. Along with top notch buffet of finger foods from prosciutto and mozzarella to amazing little cakes. Everything is absolutely delicious including the breakfast buffet. I am not even sure what else they had available since I was too busy trying to eat at every restaurant included in my itinerary. Everyone was so friendly say made sure you felt at home in your kingdom. My butler unfortunately I forgot his name was incredibly helpful. He made sure all my restaurant reservations were made well ahead of time and he gave me tour suggestions of the Yucatan.

We have stayed at the Paradisus several times and it is our favorite place. The staff is exceptional providing the best friendly service we have encountered anywhere. We always stay in Royal Service that provides a Butler and the royal treatment from all. I recommend Sergio for your Butler. He is the best great service friendly like a family member and goes beyond what is expected of him. The buffet breakfast and lunch at Naos is top notch and for the week we had outstanding service by Ricardo Jorge and Alejando. All the restaurants are great but our favorite is Bana the Asian restaurant in the center of the fabulous lobby area that also provides nightly entertainment. This resort is amazing in that it provides all kinds of daytime activities but also fabulous night time entertainment in the lobby bar across from Bana. Each night there is a a dancing singing show that can not be beat. You never have to leave this place because there is so much provided for you to do. A great place for families and singles and for those who want a destination wedding. My thanks to Mate Dalila Angeles Concierge Manager for helping to arrange for an upgrade to our favorite room. The staff and activities at this resort are just outstanding. We will continue to vacation there. We brought another couple with us this time and they were amazed how great this place is and most likely will return as well. It is a fun place to experience.

We are Club Melia members and this was our second time staying at the Paradisus Cancun. This time we invited my brother and his wife to join us. All of us had a great time at this beautiful clean and well kept hotel. We did start out with a few problems such as our air conditioning not functioning properly and their safe not working but these problems were promptly taken care of. Everyone there was very helpful and friendly. We were always greeted with Hola and a smile both day and night. Now as for the food. our favorite places to eat were at the Market Grill and the Naos restaurants. The buffet at the Naos was fabulous. There were so many food options and the quality of food was great. We were never bored with the same old food. Each day a new selection of fresh food items were added. We were however disappointed in the Vento and Enso Restaurants. The Vento served Mediterranean Tapas which was more or less just appetizers. That would not be so bad but the quality just was not there. None of us really enjoyed our dishes. The Enso Restaurant served Asian cuisine. Once again we were disappointed with the main course. The appetizers here were very good I had egg rolls which were tasty and so were the dumplings. Noodles were soggy in our main dishes and were prepared more like a soup. Not at all what we expected. This aside once again I must add that at both restaurants the service and friendliness of the servers was excellent. Rigoberto was very helpful in explaining each and every course item on the menu. Claudio was also our server and could not be more accommodating. On to the beach the beach was absolutely amazing. Flor and Luis were our service staff here and they were both wonderful. Flor was so sweet and always had a smile no matter how busy she was. She took the time to answer some questions regarding some places we were interested in visiting and never seemed to be inconvenienced.

We arrived mid April 2016 at the airport and we were welcomed by our rep OLYMPUS Tours who provided the airport transfers well scheduled clean vans with wi fi. The Melia PARADISUS hotel several pyramid shaped buildings was gorgeous and clean. Our plan was all inclusive but tipping is very welcomed and appreciated do not forget the daily maids. I met many wonderful guests at the pool and bar. The young attendants at the pool and restaurants are absolutely delightful. They are compassionate polite more than caring and helpful. Most memorable was the extenuated family pool and beach attendant named Armando. Young always smiling always attentive and available to us party of 8. He kept us fed and watered and helped us obtain a beach cabana and late restaurant reservations a must. The ocean tides were rough. All pool waiters were wonderful. The pool side entertainment was fun. One activity was the wax hand by ART WAX free. Other free pool activities were the wonderful pool bar salsa and belly dance lessons and festive pool games and music. We frequented the BANA and NAOS buffet restaurants and were never disappointed with the many many diverse food stations including almost anything you would desire. Lovely waiters there were Fernando Arturo Chacho Rodrigo Fredy Alexia and Jesy. Very attentive and helpful. Every restaurant with or without reservations was just wonderful and tasty. In the main AVENUE BAR we were welcomed and attended by Gerard who kept us well watered and amused. His smile was heartfelt. Evening hotel entertainment was interesting. When you take the short bus ride to downtown you can find up scale designer shops and a large clean mall. If you have extra dinner money do not miss LORENZILOs fish restaurant bit pricey including it is lake side alligator who eats your left overs off the patio.

There really is nothing negative to say about this place. We enjoyed time at the pools on the beach jet skiing drinks dancing at the bar. However by far the high light of our trip was my husbands surprise birthday dinner.

It is honestly hard to think of ONE bad thing to say about this resort. We booked with Vacation Express Nexus and opted for the Royal Service. I HIGHLY recommend the Royal Service. From the moment we got to the resort which is only 15 minutes from the airport they offered us cold towels champagne and drove us to our private check in room. The check in process took about 15 minutes where they explained what amenities we had gave us a map of the resort and our wristbands and a cell phone to call our butler on and introduced us to our butler Gerardo who showed us to our room. Our room a Junior Suite with an Ocean View was in a great location in Tower 4. We had a welcome fruit tray 4 bottles of liquor and our fridge was fully stocked with beer soda water and snacks which they restocked everyday. They also provide a beach bag with towels to take to the beach everyday. The AC worked well in our room and so did the shower. After that we went exploring around the resort. THE FOOD. Everything we had to eat was amazing. I am a very picky person and I found something I liked at every restaurant we went to. I do recommend Vento Market Grill Blue Agave and La Palapa which is only for Royal Service guests. We went to breakfast at La Palapa every morning because it was right on the beach and not crowded. We got fresh fruit omelets hash browns coffee and mimosas pretty much every morning. We had 24 hour room service that we only used the last morning and it came right on time and was very good. Everyday for lunch we either walked up to La Palapa or we just ordered food directly from the beach from our waiter. We especially loved Edie both of them Rafael and Octavio. THE DRINKS. Literally any drink you can think of they have. All the drinks were strong and delicious. We had pina coldas beer champagne frozen coffee etc. on the beach every day. There was also a little coffee bar we would go to in the afternoons to get a latte. There was a bar Avenue Bar right around the corner from our room that we could go to each night to get whatever we wanted. THE BEACH POOL. The beach is absolutely beautiful. We stayed on the beach under our umbrellas all day every day. The waiters would come around from 10am50pm so you never had to get up if you did not want to. The water was the clearest blue water I have ever seen and it was not too cold either. There are people selling things on the beach all day everyday but you just kindly tell them No and they leave you alone. Since we had the Royal Service we had our own private section of the beach which was never crowded and always quiet and relaxing. We only went to the pool for about 30 minutes at the end of each day but it was quiet and warm and large. There are beds you can reserve each day by the pool too. where you have a waiter and they have sunscreen and towels each day for you. Maybe the only cons I can think of was the room numbers were a little confusing so we got lost the first night getting back to our room. And the gift shop is SO expensive. My beach sandals broke the first day so I bought a new paira cheap plastic pair that said Cancun and some sunscreen and it was 50 USDI would recommend this resort to ANYONE. It was the most amazing trip and we are definitely coming back. We did not have to lift a finger the whole trip and they really think of everything. All the employees speak English and are so friendly and accommodating. A special thanks to our butler Gerardo who made everything so easy and relaxing. He sent us something special to our room each evening and made all of our dinner reservations. 6 nights was not enough.", "offset": [679, 822], "date": "2016-09-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "0ece0847-abbc-471a-8d99-69a1703b07e5", "sentence": "Awesome stay.

Me my boyfriend and our 7 month old baby stayed for a 5 days. We also were joined by our friends and their two young children who are loyal Melia customers. Here \u2019s my thoughts on our trip. Check in Service was A1 the moment we stepped on property. They made check in a breeze. Only negative was the time share sales pitch. After traveling 10 hours with a 7 month old I did n\u2019t want to be haggled for 15min. Also the check in area has the strongest and I mean STRONG odor of incents or oils not sure but it \u2019s intense. Room. Here is where it went BAD. We stayed in a lagoon view junior suite room 3429 the view was beautiful BUT that was he only positive. The room was SO unbelievably musty and damp that it was clear the moment we walked in that it was infested with mold. I immediately called the front desk after 30min of trying to get over the odor. They stated that they could n\u2019t move us and i \u2019d have to try my luck the next day. We said fine and showered and got ready to meet our friends for dinner. The room was seriously dated mirror cracked mold on the pictures in the room mold all along the ceiling old AC unit blowing hot air furniture chipped. After dinner I went to the front desk to beg for another room. He said no again and told me we could move the next day. We did n\u2019t even sleep under the covers we were so disgusted. I luckily brought a sheet from home for the baby crib and his own covers. Also the bed was broken my boyfriend had to prop one side up with one of our pillows. Included are pics of the black mold. They never offered to refund us the one night we were forced to stay in a mold infested room. The new room 3 doors down 343 was much better you could feel the difference in the air quality OKService. Wait staff at the restaurants are great. So polite and always on top of things. Staff at the pool bars servers pool attendants were amazing. Even on the beach they are right on top of things. They even had staff playing soccer with my friends son. Francisco and Victor at the bar The Stadium I think that \u2019s what it \u2019s called were amazing. My boyfriend even went down alone sometimes to visit and have drinks there while they worked. They remembered all our names and what we drank for the entire trip. Food. Naos buffet was n\u2019t terrible but was n\u2019t great. The best dinner was the Brazilian restaurant the last night. We had not one good Mexican dish while we were there. The pool buffets were convenient and did the trick while out with the kids. Wish we walked to a local restaurant one of the nights for better quality meal atleast once. Activities. we rented the jetskis and that was fun. Wear sunscreen I got so burned out on it for even 30min. It \u2019s a little walk but me and my boyfriend took turns going and it was a good time even alone. Pool beach. pool was amazing clean and nice and deep for adults. They have a children side also and a swim up bar too in the main part. Service at the pool and beach did not lack. The beach had a ton of seaweed but was still nice and a beautiful view. Lots of shower areas to rinse off. Tips bring lots of sunscreen I barely wore any because I wanted to tan and I am covered in a heat rash now. Also I did use the tap water to brush my teeth did n\u2019t drink only rinced my brush and I had diarrhea one night and bad stomach pain. Not sure if it was the water food or heat but probably a combination. My friends husband got up at 5 6am every morning and reserved pool chairs and beach chairs.

We stayed here for 4 nights and LOVED every moment. We stayed in a Family Concierge one bedroom suite. We used Whatsap on our phones to chat with our Concierge staff to get anything and everything we needed. Mostly it was to accommodate our daughters needs. Each day we would message for steamed veggies and a smoothie around 5 pm. We would feed her before we went to dinner as she gets distracted very easily so it made our dinners very calm. We would request for a cabana and based on availability we usually were accommodated. On our second day we forgot our daughters swim hat and life jacket at the pool our fault. We remembered the next day and was just saddened that no one returned it and it could not be found. We asked the staff to keep a look out it was never found but the next day that loaned us a fun flotation device. Our daughter loved itBefore our arrival I sent the concierge service the list of restaurants we wanted to go to and the timing. They made sure we made it to each and every one. They could make it only 24 hours in advance but it all worked out. All restaurants were AMAZINGSome of the items that could use updates are the room bathroom.

I have stayed at other Melia properties and the one in Plays is still in my opinion the best one we have stayed at in all our trips 18 to Mexico. However this property fails in almost every way.

I mentioned this to the GM and he told The hotel is a pyramid and they get smaller on the way up. does not make any sense to me but OKRom Service I do not like waiting until 50PM to 60PM to have my room cleaned. I mentioned this to the GM as well and his answer was We are very busy property. To me being busy is not excuse for poor service. Also they were very bad at stocking the mini bar. Even knocked on my door two nights at 10PM to do so. So unles you call down and ask for them to come clean your room it could be dinner time before they get to it. Food Was just Ok. Good selection but typical resort food. Their other property I felt the food was outstanding. Beach Pools. Beach is nice service on the beach is good however you have to get down there earlier to claim your spot. People were laying towels out at 645 in the morning to claim their spots and not coming back until lunch time. If you did not claim a spot earlier they run out of chairs very quickly.

My wife and I spent a week at Paradisus in mid June. Overall we had a great experience. Prior to booking I searched for details related to the differences between Club Melia Royal Service and the standard Paradisus. Since I was unable to find a lot of clarifying info I assume others may also be curious about the differences. So I hope my experience helps. its a long read. I would like to point out that the positives DID out weigh the negatives even though for transparency there were some detailed negatives which I included. Also my most recent all inclusive comparison is with Bahia Principes Don Pablo Luxury collection in both the DR and Cancun. These are very different style resorts and there are different things that both BP and Paradisus do a little better than the other. Lastly I read a lot about Cancun safety before going. I am happy to state that we felt safe our entire trip and there were tons of families in the resort and throughout the Hotel Zone with small kids. During our week we were not privy to any negative reports of crime. We have been traveling to Cancun for over 20 years and the only difference was that we stayed in the Hotel Zone HZ and no longer ventured into the downtown area like in the years past. We did not notice any increased police or military presence in the HZ. This may have been different near the nightlife or in Playa de Carmen. Differences between classifications Paradisus standard hotel bookings. In simple terms the entire resort is Paradisus there are 5 attached buildings Pyramids. The center building 3 has most of the administrative entertainment shops and restaurants. Everyone has access to resources located in the common areas. Even though I refer to Paradisus as the standard hotel type of booking it is still very nice. Its like calling the entire resort a premium. Club Melia Timeshare units. This area is located in building 1 and has access to everything that you would get by booking at Paradisus. There are only very minor differences. I found that the room was the same size but contained a small cook top and cabinets with a full set of dishes and pots for cooking. These were not used due to the all inclusive feature of the resort. Our room also contained a Jacuzi tub on the balcony that was also not used. If anything I felt that the additional cabinets and counter just took up additional space in the room. But not an issue. As you can see in our pictures the room was okay. It was not too old but definitely did not feel modern. CM also provided discounts to the Bali beds which was the best perk that we found. There was also an exclusive section of the beach that was marked just for CM members. Since we were in the CM section booked through RCI. we also had a personal concierge and separate check in area. Our understanding was that the concierge was there to assist us with our stay and to book services. Royal Service. This area like CM is located in a separate building 5. The opposite end away from CM. Access to building 5 required key access. It also has a private section of beach and separate adult only pool with Bali beds. Also there is no charge to the RS members for Bali beds. We only looked over to this area and it seemed nice and much quieter than the rest of the resort. RS has access to all of the same restaurants but adds one additional one for lunch and breakfast. We understood that it also provided 50 minutes of daily Spa access. I could see the value in RS if you could get it for a good price. Pros Great location in the HZ on a very nice section of beach that is close to external activities and shoping Smaller resort in comparison to BP. Paradisus is easily walkable from end to end. there is no need for shuttle carts The majority of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Service was always prompt and the resort was always clean and safe. Pools there are lots of lounge chairs and palapas which provide shade. There are also a lot chairs and palapas at the beach which is a big plus. The pool is large and has a lot space. Even though there were a lot of people over the weekend it never felt too crowded. Seating is spaced out to provide a relative amount of privacy. This is not like a cruise ship where you are elbow to elbow with your neighbor. Bars Drinks very good service and quality options. Many brand names were available even at the standard Paradisus level. This is much better than other AIs. The slight negative is the bars did not have menus posted with ideas about different drinks. So while the bartenders could make just about anything you had to kinda know what you wanted. The premium bottles which were an upgraded charge were truly premium. As an example Johnny Walker was available in Red and Black labels. But the Blue label was an upcharge. This may have been different in RS Bali beds we got hooked. We used Bali beds 6 days. They were worth every penny. what is really good is that there are a lot of them and you can select your location based on your preference. For example some faced the beach and others faced the pool so you could watch your kids. Yery in the bed registration was great to work with. We booked directly through him. One day we also got the seafood package with the bed which was amazing. It included a bottle of sparkling wine two lobsters octopus and more shrimp than we could eat. Food overall the food was good. I do not recall anything special that stood out. We ate at 3 reservation restaurants the buffet Market Grill Bana Blue Agave Sunset Grill and Neos. Blue Agave was the best. We did find that many of the restaurants had the same or similar items. For example I am pretty sure the risotto at the reservation restaurant and buffet were the same. Many of the restaurants are situated around a single backend kitchen. Regarding the buffet there were a lot of options but it was not expansive. Kid Friendly We did not have kids in our group but the entire resort is very kid friendly. The exception is the adults only section. The kids seemed to like that you could use floats in the pools. The Ave Bar which was a great location for just hanging out was a favorite spot for kids even late into the evening. No Smoking can not say how good this was. There was only one open air bar area that you could in. The rest of the resort was smoke free. Plus PlusCons here are just a few things that I thought could have been better. Check out. We checked out at 7AM and had to use the main lobby on Saturday morning. I guess expected a little more. The guy who checked us out asked for our room number and then told me its done. Those were his words its done. I kinda expected a thanks for staying or we look forward to seeing you again at the end. It just soured our exit. Information sharing Occasionally we felt like we got the runaround. For example I inquired about getting a taxi twice and was told it was easy and when I was ready come back and they would have a taxi pull up. I came back 30 minutes later and requested the taxi. A call was placed and we were told to proceed to the entrance and there would be a guy there to assist and the taxi would be there shortly. At the Club Melia area. We waited 15 minutes in the heat. No taxi and no guy. It was also not totally clear where to go and where to wait. Just around the corner. The person who originally helped us walked by and noticed that the taxi had not come. They pressed a button to call a taxi and indicated that there was one just over there at the stand and it would be over in just a minute. They left and the taxi never came. We waited another 20 minutes outside in the heat with out a taxi. We then left and walked to the main lobby and asked for a taxi. Its much busier at the main lobby So the bell hop that asked for a taxi walked away. While we walked away someone else walked up and asked for a taxi and the next hop called for a taxi. 5 minutes later a taxi arrived and we were told it was not for us but for the people behind us. He would have to call us our taxi. This is not big deal and I assume a lot is lost in translation. its just an example. Another example was when we ordered a fresh coconut. I went to the Cocos bar and asked about the coconut. I was told there was an upcharge. I asked how much and the guy said 8 and turned away started do other stuff. It took a while for him to turn back around and ask if I wanted one. Maybe 5 minutes. Like he was surprised when I said yes. The I found out why. He had to get me to fill out a charge ticket get it to his manager to check my info in the system. Them go get a coconut and then do the prep of cutting the coconut. it made sense after the fact. The coconut process was a lot of work that he did not want to do. I see why he hoped I just went away when he told me I had to pay for it. Restaurant Availability There are some gaps in the middle of the day when there are no restaurants open or at least no one is able to direct you to one that is open. Staff appears to float between locations. So they may be working at the pool grill during the middle of the day and have to transition to the buffet at the evenings. Several times because of the shift the Sunset Grill was closing and the other restaurants had not opened. They would also run out of burgers which were the best things at the Grill and say that they were closing in 30 minutes and were not making anymore. The same was true for the Nespreso bar great that it exists but the hours seemed wrong. It was only open from 7 10am and then 3 6pm. Call me lazy but it was a little hard to make by 10 am. The guy who operated it was great and he did not set the hours. On a positive note the Blue Agave taco place was open late until I think 4 am. All in all there are about 9 restaurants which seem like a lot. But one is 5 star and you have to pay. Another is exclusive for RS members. 3 are only by reservations at night. Which means during the day there are gaps when there are none were open. Air Conditioning Most areas are not A C This is similar to most Caribbean resorts that I have stayed. But more areas here just seemed hot even at night. Yes it is June but the temperature was in the high 80s. In the Ave Bar there are open windows which allow in really good air flow. However you have to stand in front of the windows. two feet over on the recliner there is no breeze. One night we had a reservation at the Brazilian steakhouse. Its open air. We were sat near the kitchen and I had to cut dinner short because of the heat. A few of the restaurants have AC but there are limited other places other than the stores that are cool. Maintenance the entire resort was very clean. But there are places where it shows its age. While we were there we noticed that someone cut their foot on loose jagged tiles in a section of the pool. They promptly closed the area and started the repair. Also in building 1 a section of the glass atrium broke and feel about 70 feet to the bridge walkway and garden area below in the center of the building. We were on the side but the caretaker in the pool had to run for cover to hide from falling glass. Thankfully there is not a lot of guest in that area during the middle of the day. In comparison with BP we noticed more wear and tear. Concierge We were assigned a personal concierge prior to our arrival. We were excited because we had a similar experience at BP and loved it. However we found our contact not really helpful. A couple weeks before we received an email regarding our upcoming trip and were asked if we were celebrating anything. We were traveling for our 19 year anniversary and let them know that the date was 2 weeks prior to our trip due to scheduling. When we checked we were told that we needed to next meet with our personal contact to go over our benefits and all of the resort features. We checked in at 10 am and was told the contact would be available at noon at the main lobby. Again no specific place just in the lobby. We went to find food but after asking a few people it seemed like we had just missed everything. Each time we told to check a spot that was just around the corner. At 5 to 12 we went back to inquire about our personal contact and someone pointed us to their supervisor. We were informed that they were not going to be available until 2 pm. At this point we were offered the hospitality room to change into shorts and to shower. See my other point about the lack of cool places to hang out at. At 145 we came back and asked where we could find our contact. We were told to wait around the corner until 2 pm. At this point It appeared that we were disturbing irritating the Russian lady at the CM desk in the main lobby in building 5. We waited until 230 and never saw our contact. So we left. We were in directly across from the info desk so I assume they were happy when they saw us leave. It kinda spoiled our check in process. The next day we asked about our contact and was told to locate her in the main lobby. When we met the contact she was pleasant but wanted to book us on excursions or a time share sales pitch. We were asked again if we were celebrating anything and we stated the same about our anniversary. It was never acknowledged. We were also told we could make 4 reservations with the restaurants. Our contact called to book one place for that evening. When we asked about the others she said that the people on the phone were busy and did not want to wait for us to figure out what we wanted. So they could be booked later and she would let us know. We were told we could also call 0 to ask about the bookings or make them ourselves. The next day notes were placed under our door that we had two more reservations. In the end we got 3 of 4. Honestly I felt like I had wasted several hours over two days chasing after our concierge only for them to be little to no help. Maybe we just got a bad one or maybe I was having a bad day but this is not what I expected. This was polar opposite from what I experienced at BP. As far as personal service BP won hands down. Our concierge experience here was a zero. We just avoided it for the rest of the week since it seemed she just wanted to sell us something else we were wasting her time. do not go to the Royal Service area if you are not in RS Mid day we took an hour long walk down the beach. The first access area back to the resort is though the RS pool. So we took the shortcut from the beach through RS back into the resort. It was hot and we were tired so when I passed the bar I asked the bartenders if I could have a carton of water. He said no he could only give me water from the larger bottle because we were not RS. I get it and I suppose I should not have asked but the response was quite embarrassing. It was water not alcohol. I guess from my expression he changed his mind and gave me the carton there are no individual plastic bottles at the resort. Water is available in paper cartons or from a large water cooler type jug in bulk. There are also glass bottles of water similar to an old school coke bottle in the rooms. He said he would do me a favor this one time which was even more frustrating. We never went back near the RS area again. Despite the service blights that took me by surprise overall we were happy with the resort. There were just a few things that could have been better. The vast majority of the staff were great and promoted a positive experience. I felt it important to share some of the negative details so that those booking would have an honest appraisal. Would I book again yes. Overall the positives outweighed the negatives. After reading numerous reviews Pos and Neg I can totally see some truth and some pettiness in all of them.

My friend and I went to Paradisus Cancun from January 5 12. Both of us have not gone to an all inclusive for a long time but that definitely will change after this trip. We booked this trip with no expectations and let me tell you the bar is now set really high. From the service hospitality drinks cleanliness and aesthetic there is nothing really to complain about. Make sure to take the time and go to all the restaurants the hotel has to offer. Special shoutout to the manager Gabi at Enso restaurant and Nicolas for kicking it up a notch and providing the most stellar service. The beach was stunning and clean and the pools always had something to offer. If you are by the pool area make sure to say hi to Victor such a great dude always greeting with a smile and making sure your drink is cold. Within the week we decided we wanted to venture out a bit Christian at the concierge was the real deal. Always available to help us and answer any questions we may have. We were two girls and he was totally honest and told us where to go what to do. We had to reach out to our airline a couple times and he with no hesitation made that happen. Finally we inquired for a room upgrade David big shout out too you. He was so kind and literally made our already amazing trip SO much better. We were upgraded to an ocean front view that were newly renovated. Definitely no questions asked will be returning to this hotel I do not think we have both stopped talking about it.", "offset": [195, 287], "date": "2020-01-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "1cd6ea9d-2156-4e4b-8ca5-b6971e35b88a", "sentence": "Nice week at Paradisus Cancun. My wife and I recently spent a week February 22 29 at the Paradisus Cancun. We were somewhat wary of the resort due to reviews touting their Royal Service which is an expensive add on and other reviews where people could not get dinner reservations. We did not pay for Royal Service and frankly it was the best money we did n\u2019t spend. The resort was very nice we had zero problems making reservations and ate at each of the restaurants that were available to \u201c non royals \u201d. If we did n\u2019t have a reservation we just walked up and asked when we could be seated. This may have been due to our only needing a table for two but even when we called a day or so before we got the restaurant and reservation time we wanted. The first night after leaving Vento we noticed people dancing in the Avenue bar with headphones on. No music \u2026 just people dancing. The headphones were lit red green or blue. It looked like an episode of Black Mirror. So we walked over and it was a silent discoth\u00e8que. So we joined and danced for about an hour or so. It was great fun and too bad it \u2019s only on Saturday nights. There were two DJs competing for the crowd to change their color which brought a different DJ selection. Again excellent idea. Other than the usual towels reserving loungers early in the morning everything else was fine. Breakfast was great including mimosas. We loved the tacos at Blue Agave. Not sure why there were so many negative reviews of their tacos but we thought they were good it was empty for lunch and they make a great margarita. As others have posted the rooms could use an update but we had really nice weather and spent little time in the room other than sleeping. The only thing we did n\u2019t care for was the non stop pounding techno music at the main pool and on the beach. It was so loud on the beach that it drowned out the sound of the sea which in Cancun is hard to do. But the resort is large and there are at least two places we found where the music was barely audible. So all in all we liked the resort had a really nice time and did n\u2019t miss the Royal Service. One last thing. not sure what the deal was with the falcon that the handler had on their arm every day. Nobody approached for pictures etc. Just this huge falcon sitting on it is handlers arm making the rounds by the pool. I would think a bird less menacing would have been more appropriate for photos.", "offset": [748, 847], "date": "2020-03-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}]}
