The hotel drops in a quiet residential area which is about 4 stops away from the central hbf station a little bit off the city but acceptable. The hotel itself has been built for many years but refurblish 2 years ago so everything is functionable and looks under well maintained. Staff is always friendly the pool is nice with warm water the free tea lounge is interesting. The morning buffet breakfast is okay but I feel bored at the third day since the food is exactly the same everyday. Afteral this hotel is a good choice at Hamburg especially the room rate is quite reasonable at Euro 95 per night including breakfast.

Good hotel. Stayed on a business trip. Subway close by taxis at the door step and access to the Alster lake. Tea lounge and coffee available in the reception area was welcome. The TV in the room was strange very small screen and funny when first switched on with its colours. Once you got into the TV channels it was fine but I thought the room could definitely have a much more modern piece of equipment. Staff was nice and friendly.

I did not want to give it an average score as it is better but very good is a little too much. For the price you are paying you should be expecting more. Although it is clear that the hotel received a make over the furniture in the rooms looked like they were saved from before. The very small TV looks rather funny and does not provide for a pleasant piece of entertainment. Trying to regulate the temperature in your room is a nightmare what ever I tried to do the temperature did not drop below 12 degrees C Opening the window was the only option but that created a nasty draft. Paying 22 Euros for breakfast is to me on the high side. But aside from that the beds are nice and soft the area around the hotel is quite so a good night sleep near the center of Hamburg is perfect. The temperature of the show can be regulated perfectly. The restaurant and bar are doable. Service was perfect all staff spoke English and I believe the lady behind the bar spoken even more languages. The parking garage has an easy access and wide enough spaces for modern cars.

Good business hotel or even for leisure as it is well located next to the lake and in a nice trendy neighbourhood 10 mns away from the center and the train stationThe hotel is slowly ageing and would need an overall renovation but this is not a show stopper. You see that the design is from another period but everything is fit and clean. During my last stay I was upgraded to a suite the first time in my 4 stays in this venue. It has a parking under the venue but with a cumbersome access to the reception once you a reparked as you have to walk down and up some staircases under the venue so not convenient at all if you carry a large suitcase. The hotel is equipped with a nice gym and an internal pool and has a nice and quite business lounge on the top floor with a balcony terrace. The hotel is fairly large very clean with a large TV channels acesthere is free wifi access in the room I guess this is part of the perks of being Platinum with HIG and the parking charge was normal.

Just spent 3night at this hotel and overall an average experience. Location wise hotel is a bit far from downtown and it does take about 10 15 minutes to walk there although you do have the choice of taking the nearby U3 subway or M6 bus. The saving grace is it is also within 3 5 minute walking distance to a wonderful residential area called St George where you find lots of nice shops and good restaurants. Check in upon arrival was speedy and pretty painless and so was the check out. Front desk staff was very nice and upgraded me to a Club Room which unfortunately looks absolutely nothing special to me at all other than free wifi there is no welcome fruit cookie plate and the room is just about the same size cramped as any Holiday Inn room except the furniture may be a bit nicer. Room decor is rather old fashioned and may I also say a bit outdated. But in all it is clean tidy and since I am not spending tons of time at hotel it is manageable. Unfortunately Crowne Plaza similar to InterContinental same IHG family does not always automatically give you full benefits such as Club Lounge access even you are the highest standing member. This means you have to pay for food and drink on your own. The cost was 35 euro extra per night. considering breakfast is additional 15 20 euro per day and front desk was willing to offer me a discount of 25 euro for lounge access per day with free drinks and simple meals I decided to take the offer. IHG Group please re think how you treat your elite members Mariot and Hilton are always nicer to their elite members why can not youIn all I would consider my experience at CP Hamburg this time totally OK and the price was much better than almost all other hotels in town including my preferred choices of Mariot and Renaissance due to a big convention in town. But honestly speaking I felt like I was longing the whole time for some better treatments that a premier IHG member deserves. especially when you were told you have to pay for everything and you could not even get a fresh supply of toilette during your entire stay. It just makes you wonder what is the point of or why bother being a IHG premier member then. Among all CP properties I have stayed in Europe thus far unfortunately to say Crowne Plaza Hamburg will not likely be a top choice on my list. I think I will try other choices next time when I am in town.", "offset": [521, 822], "date": "2015-04-17 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "3a160495-b350-4648-92d5-9898fb427ff6", "sentence": "Mini Bar is scary.
