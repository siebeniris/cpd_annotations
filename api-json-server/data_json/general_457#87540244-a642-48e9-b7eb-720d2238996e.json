On check in we were offered a fab room with beach views and advised about all the great hotel facilities. As we arrived early and our room was not yet ready we hit the downstairs bar for a casual lunch. The downstairs bar is fantastic and overlooks the pol beach with lots of comfy alcoves and sofas to curl up in with a coffee or cocktail. Food was great cocktail list extensive and service wonderful. The reception then called us when our room was ready and we headed straight up to find our luggage waiting for us in the room. The room. wow. Completely blew us away with the most amazing modern gadgets enormous bed facing a panoramic sea view not to mention the floor to ceiling windows and bay window sofa. The toiletries in the room are Bliss products which we completely adore a real treat for beauty product junkiesWe had made advance reservations for the Bliss spa on site so then headed downstairs in our robes and slippers for our spa afternoon. The Bliss spa was phenomenal. Fab Bliss boutique in reception super clean modern spa facilities luxurious treatments I had a blisage massage with the fantastic therapist Jason one of the best massages I have ever had. And what girl would not be won over with champagne and brownies in the relaxation romFor dinner we visited the on site tapas restaurant which was also wonderful and we visited the sky bar for a cocktail to round off the night though we actually preferred the downstairs bar as it had more of a lounge feel whereas the sky bar is more nightclubThe outdoor hotel pool pictured and pool side bar looked so inviting and super modern. and I would love to come back and try it out in the height of summer.

The rooms have open room planning meaning the bathroom facilities are inside the bedroom. The sink area is in the room. The toilet and shower are merely separated by a milky glass partition. It is not recommended for those who might need to use the toilet more frequently due to stomach issues. There is zero privacy to ones self maintenance. The shower concept is also mind boggling. Bath towels are held under the sink and the only hooks to hang the towels are in the shower area. Once one has showered and dried oneself there is nowhere outside the shower to hang the towels to dry. One is forced to leave them bundled up for daily replenishing which I found wasteful or get the feet wet again to go back inside the shower and hang them there.

Stayed 4 days at the W hotel. Nice staff and beautiful hotel. However be careful to do your homework. The concierge team is charming helpful but needs a bit more preparation. If you want to go to the trendier restaurants make sure you book way in advance as they ca nt do much about hard to get reservations once you are there. Restaurants like Tickets are better done by you far in advance of your arrival. Also remember that Barcelona has become THE tourist hub in Europe so everything is packed. If you want to go to La Sagrada Familia Parque Duel Casa Batlo The Dali museum BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE BEFORE ARRIVING. The places are not well prepared for the monstrous amounts of tourists they are getting and the lines can get to be a real nightmare. The concierge team does not have any special relationships with any tourist venues so they will actually go online to the venue website and let you know if there are tickets available. Not much in terms of concierge service. Example We planned for the Dali museum two days in advance. We inquired if we should buy the tickets in advance and both concierges we talked to said it was not necessary. We arrived at the museum to find out there was a two hour wait and most people going in were telling us we should have bought the tickets online. WhatSo we called the hotel and asked them to help to which the answer was there \u2019s nothing we can do. Although I understood it was not their fault thy should have at least tried to do something to help us being that they made a mistake. Mistakes happen but as a concierge I would try to fix it or offer other alternatives etc etc. The rest is excellent and trendy as in good W hotel styles. Incredible room and bed great location lovely views and the service and staff were very acomodating.

This hotel is not in any way a resort. There are some great things about this property and some not so great things. I am not generally a big fan of larger hotels but for a large hotel this one does not feel like it is that big. It is kind of in a remote location to the rest of Barcelona so if you are a walker like I am you wo nt really mind it but it is a 20 minute walk to go anywhere. The metro is 20 minutes away by foot but its great to get around efficiently. There are some great restaurants surrounding the hotel so if you get a chance eat at the Blue Spot it is amazing. They really do need to work on the front desk hospitality they can be a bit gruff. As well as design it is the party till you puke vibe and i am not so much into that. The hotel needs to be renovated. The overall design is a bit tacky I would not say that it is great design. The good design is in the lobby bar with the cool fireplace and basket seats but that is about it. The views on upper floors are amazing however. I first checked into a room that smelled horrible but they did move me to a better room right away. The star of the show here are the beds and the views. Mine was comfortable and the best part of the entire hotel for me. Nice sheets and pillows. I did sleep well. Lets talk about this room. The design of the room is functional i do like the window seating with the table in the middle. That is good design. The view of the city was awesome. What is not good design is the bathroom. You have a frosted glass closet that houses the toilet which you can practically see through and you have an adjoining glass closet that is the shower. This shower is like a prison shower or a mens locker room shower all ugly flagstone. I hate flagstone for interiors. This weird closet is dark and smelly and not a nice shower experience. Flagstone absorbs odors. You will want to wear flip flops in this shower due to the locker room vibe. The sink is ok but the lighting is typical W dark lighting that you can not really see your makeup application very well. I hated the whole bathroom design. Thank god i was alone in the room I would nt want to have to look at someone sitting on the toilet in there. The bath towels were very thin and not soft. I did appreciate the Bliss face wash. That was a nice touch and I wish every hotel had that. I also did like the automatic curtains that was a fun touch. There is even a plug that is for US devices so you never really have to use your adapter. There is also a neat clock radio that you can use for a bluetoth speaker which I always appreciate. I loved that. Bonus points on the tech aspects of the room. There is a ton of closet space so you will have no problem there. The room comes with a nespreso coffee machine and a kettle but housekeeping will not give you more coffee even if you leave them notes in spanish and catalan. If you want more coffee they will send it up just call the desk or go down and talk to the nice guys at the desk next to the elevators. They always were very nice about my requests for more coffee pods so service points there. What cracked me up was the security guy hostess at the elevators every night that police the nightclub goers. We went up there just to see what the fuss is about and its no fuss. I think the lobby bar with the cool fireplace is better. All and all it was ok but I would not choose this location again I would stay in a more centrally located part of the city but that is just me. If you want to be a bit isolated and on the beach this is the place for you.", "offset": [2266, 2303], "date": "2019-12-03", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 33, "uid": "4938b41c-abd0-4507-ac1b-f5f8698bb263", "sentence": "Sexy iconic but meh.

Pictured is a delicious entre from the opening of Fire restaurant in wbarcelona. Hopefully this new restaurant will bring some required diversity in to the cousine offering of the hotel. I am still wondering how they were able to spend ca 270 mio Eur on a hotel that can not even sustain a heavy rain without all the hotel premises leaking and floods all over. W is considered as an eminent premise for the demanding travelers that should offer a guest a full comfort and was even ranked as 6 \u2b50 \ufe0f \u2b50 \ufe0f \u2b50 \ufe0f \u2b50 \ufe0f \u2b50 \ufe0f \u2b50 \ufe0f hotel. To be honest the restaurant manager was the only bright side of the hotel. We entered the hotel through sideway since the main entrance was flooded secondly in such cases I would consider coaching employes there are 400 of them can you imagine in a way that guest would fill welcome. Spa experience was so modest the receptionist was not even able to offer a brownie since she had those reserved only for my gf that was having a treatment. I felt very strange when she explained that she can eat it and I do nt. Does anyone teach you basics of hospitalitySecondly following your rules and regulations might be inappropriate when your capacities are not able to offer what the guests are expecting cold jacuzy non functional pool but you still manage to be strict to the guests even though you are not offering anything to them. Furthermore the Skyline bar on the top of hotel looks like a brothel and whoever made such architecture should perhaps reconsider if that is really what guests are looking for. I would suggest closing that trashy bar and opening a nice restaurant with a view. I believe that wbarcelona is a nice example of how you can waste your investment money on totally irrelevant stuff so people can see the glam when the reality is totally the opposite. With approximate cost of 5000 eur per room this investment will not offer any roi shorter than 30 years if even. There is so much little details that places that proclaim themselves fancy fail to offer. Having money does not buy you a style. Attitude does. The same goes for all fashion victims putting their LV Guci DG on just to prove they can afford it and disregarding how it really looks on them. Another funny stuff is that hotel has a Michelin star restaurant called La Bara thst was given Michelin \u2b50 \ufe0f on the other location as another restaurant and they proclaim it like it is this restaurant thag got it. Really deceiving towards guests. What bothered even more is the fact that restaurant was flooded and there were literally thousands of towels on the window doors preventing additional water to slip in. Furthermore restaurant that proclaims itself as seafood and fish restaurant was offering me a fresh fish and when i wanted to see the fish they were not able to show it since they do not sell FRESH FISH but frozen fish fillets. Absolutely awful for a Micheline star restaurant that would charge you this this as 100 eur or something. Last but not least I asked about wagyu beef they sell for 76 eur per stake. They have a Chileniam wagyu. Are you kidding me. You are seeling a 80 eur stake that costs like 6 eur. SHAME ON YOUBotom line I believe you should reconsider the whole concept of hotel start educating your employees about hospitality and definitely make some architectural amendments to the building so it would not resemble that there was probably some drug money laundered to get this hotel running.", "offset": [2868, 2973], "date": "2020-01-23", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 35, "uid": "668c9750-b68e-4858-bbf4-d8845462d932", "sentence": "Cool hotel but inconvenient location.

We eventually checked in and we were pointed towards the lift. Our suite was really nice with a great view electric blinds mini bar tv music etc basically everything you would need. We had breakfast in the upstairs restaurant I thought it was very badly organised after a good half hour wait my poached eggs came more like hard boiled so we left. We had lunch every day at the beech side restaurant they served burgers nachos etc good food but quite expensive for what it was. The pool areas were very busy and we struggled to find sun loungers during the weekend so we sat on the hotels private beech. This area had its own security guard who walked up and down patrolling the small area this made it difficult to relax as we were always on edge thinking we were going to get robbed due to the Barcelona reputation. There \u2019s graffiti all over Barcelona they even have it all over the rocks in front of the hotel. At the front and rear of the hotel it \u2019s surrounded by kids on skateboards maybe a good 1525 of them every night they do n\u2019t cause any problems it just was n\u2019t what I was expecting.
