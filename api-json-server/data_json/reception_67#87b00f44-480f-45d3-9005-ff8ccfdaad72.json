Restaurants and shopping were nearby. The amenities were nice. The carpet did not go all the way to the walls and they put a couch in front of the balcony door. Instead of having an outlet near the bed they daisy chained extension cords for the bed lights. There was only a single hook in the bathroom for hanging a toiletry bag or towel. The room was clean just do n\u2019t open the curtains or look in the shower. The sliding glass door was filthy. The shower was stained badly and the water did not drain properly. Had 2 inches of dirty water after 10 minutes. HD channels work if your room is close to the front desk. Rooms at the far end of the building have poor signal and continually receive no signal. Standard TV channels were fine. Only 2 ice machines one on the first floor and the other on the sixth. No refrigerators or microwaves in room. Only one way to get to any floor from the basement which is where a majority of the parking is. Just 1 bank of 2 elevators located on the far end of the hotel from the only basement entrance. Most of the parking is near the basement entrance of the hotel with few spaces by the main entrance. No stairs were stairs available from the basement to the other floors by the basement entry only emergency fire escape stairs in the basement.

When I arrived at 5 am I was informed that they almost canceled my reservation. I was told the hotel already charged my card for the room. I had no issue with this. Then the associate at the desk told me they needed to run my card again. It came back declined.
