For what they charged the level of service and the quality of the food was not worth the money. The room service food was terribly over priced 35 for a grilled cheese sandwich can of diet coke and slice of chocolate cake. On top of that the waiter forgot my drink. Additionally when placing the room service order it was as if I was being a burden to the guy taking the order because I asked him i they could make a grilled cheese sandwich which was not on the menu nothing vegetarian on their menu. I had lunch at Shulas Restaurant and the only person that was serving food was the bartender who was totally overwhelmed by the 8 people in the bar. It took forever to get serviced and the quality of my tuna sandwich was not that great. When the hostess came to take my drink order I was going to order food and she said that was not her job. I would be and expect to be. fired if I said that at my job. Lastly the food in the hotel at the conference was pretty bad as well. All in all a bad experience. The one good thing was bed.

The staff was nice. Nice check in lady offered activity books for the kids. 3 pm is a very busy time to check in on a Saturday expect to wait at least 15 minutes. Pool overchlorinated with only 1 unisex bathroom howerver towels ready for you to use so you do not have to bring your own and a nice workout gym. Beds had older mattresses which were not comfy. Pillows squishy not supportive. Completely not like the Westin in Atlanta which was uber clean and uber comfy. Mildew problems at the Westin in Indianapolis top floor room 1505. Bathroom cracks and creases mildew both pink and black and a rusty screw noted holding up the soap dish in the shower. The hallway was extremely hot as if they only open or air condition it when they are full. I noticed I started having a runny nose when we were in the room before and after dinner. After one night my mold allergies were flaring and both my daughter and I were sniffling and congested. I did let them know when we checked out that the room needed attention before anyone else should be put in there. If the kids had not already been sleeping I would have asked for a new room. Coffee pods nice that they are Starbucks but are too big for the cup brewer and so if not careful hot water spills out the side while brewing creating scalding hazard if you have kids. Nice having a mini fridge bathrobe cable TV and desk. I did notify the front desk man when checking out of the mildew and allergy situation. He thought I had feather allergies related to the down pillows to which I laughed and said I own a whole flock of chickens with no allergy problem normally. I rarely have allergic reactions sniffles congestion to things in the air except to major dust. Parking is convenient but about 30 per day self park. Convenient walking location to restaurants within 2 3 blocks. Between the main Illinois Blvd and Westin and Hyat on Washington many panhandlers some having territory disputes and the smell of stale human urine at the intersection.

I liked the comfort of the bed and pillows. A firm bed is a necessity for us. Although the bathroom is small and I prefer bathrooms with the vanity separated from the shower I loved the rainfall shower head and the hand held wand was great for washing my hair. Being a person who wears contacts I truly appreciated the magnified mirror. Awesome convenience for putting in my contacts. The TV was very nice and offering of free wifi to us was great. My husband and I found the staff to be top notch extremely nice and helpful. We felt the room was sufficient and comfortable as well. I feel the cost of the room could have been a better. deal. We frequently stay downtown for these volleyball tourneys. We generally pay 200 a night or considerably less. Our room for three nights was over 90. We also valet park and the Westin charges 45 dollars a day for that. I think a hotel of this caliber should include breakfast with their rooms and include a microwave in the room. Getting a staff member to help microwave something for us their alternative just is not for me. it is too inconvenient. So we did not eat dinner at Shulas because we did not want to deal with trying to heat up leftovers. The only other thing that would have been nice would have been to leave more coffee creamers in the room. I left a note that was most likely misunderstood because we ended up with extra soaps.

My 8 year old son and I stayed at the Westin July 16th to the 17th. We had an excellent stay in a corner room suite. Parking was way over priced at 40 for an adjacent lot not owned by the Westin.

The door was opened for me every time I entered. My son used the revolving door. With our upgraded room we had access to the State Room. The State Room had cookies Pepsi Products Coffee and fruit. We got our moneys worth in the State Room. For breakfast it had cereal juices coffee breads biscuits and gravy potatoes eggs sausage fruit and other items. The room was on the 10th floor a corner suite with 2 rooms. A nice sitting room with a pull out couch a main bedroom with a king bed and a nice bathroom. The pull out couch was not comfortable at all but my 8 year old did not notice. As someone who has to have a fan or noise to sleep I did not sleep well. Would recommend taking a fan or solid noise.
