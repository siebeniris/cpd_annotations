A ground floor 2 bedroom lagoon suite cost us 340 for 6 nights. This included full buffet breakfast for 5 of us every day. We looked at other comparable accommodation on the coast at this time of year and the average is about 40 with no breakfast. Value is actually great because you get so much more than just accommodation. As an Acor Advantage Plus member this is the only hotel I have stayed at where I was actually made to feel like a VIP. The grounds are enormous and beautifully maintained. The beach is at one end of the resort with patrolled flags the lagoon is in the middle and the river is at the other end for fishing. Every year we load up the car with scooters skateboards fishing rods boogie boards and board games and head up to Twin Waters. The kids pre teens teen have a ball meeting new friends on the free water trampoline and kayaks. The inflatable water park is new and not free. We checked the pricing before we went and allowed our kids a budget of 3 sessions each during our 6 day stay. They were happy with this. it is a shame it is right in front of Activity Central though. This used to be a lovely play area for young families in the shallow water and it made for a beautiful view of the lake. Unfortunately the water park commercialises this area. it is great but would be better moved down to another cove area where it is not right in your view. Dining options are a bit expensive on site if you have a big family. We can recommend North Shore Seafoods 5 minute drive for fish and chips and the local Friendly Grocer 3 minute drive for burgers. If you have the opportunity to do the 90 minute timeshare talk they are currently giving you a 150 credit to thank you for your listening time. This can be used against all the incidentals on your hotel bill so worth it to cover the costs of the water park and restaurants. We love this place it suits our family at this stage of our life and we are already looking forward to Christmas 2015.", "offset": [1796, 1925], "date": "2015-01-05 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "58627ec9-77ef-491d-9329-7bfcd836cd24", "sentence": "DISAPOINTING STAY.

Hubby wanted to go for a sail it was 3 pm Sunday afternoon and about 330pm he was told to bring the sail boat back in to shore as they were closing for the day even though the sign clearly states open until 5 pm.

Then the signage to our room from the car park was not clear and trying to view the map we were given while carting luggage was not easy and then had to cart luggage upstairs to our room was hard. My son went through the guest services guide and asked where the play station and keyboard were in our room try explaining that to an 1yr old. Reason for visit was it was my birthday and son recovering from operation its not a birthday I will remember with fond memories. Due to an operation to remove his tonsils my son was only able to eat soft food however on both mornings their was no croissants and neither morning did we have a particularly late breakfast and heard other guests complaining about this. My wife at breakfast took one look at the poached eggs and said she wanted to vomit also the bacon was extremely greasy she had cereal instead. Both my wife and I had trouble sleeping in our bed and I woke up feeling as I done 10 rounds in the boxing ring as I find your beds way too soft. At dinner my wife asked for a wine and was served 2 glasses and had to ask for one to be taken back. On checking out my wife was given a refund of our breakfasts. Also walking along the paths of the building from the carpark near room 234 I almost tripped where the steel reinforcing in the concrete was showing through as I found the lighting at night very poor near and in the car parks this was not the only spot I noticed cracks and gouges in the concrete. I also found the prices for breakfast and dinner to be a little steep considering the quality of the food on offer. For example the crown plaza on the coast offers a seafood buffet for 59 and the quality is much better. This is the third time we have stayed there in last 2 years and service and quality seems to be getting worse your chain will not be on the top of my list next year as we normally go to the Qld Garden Expo each year.", "offset": [1569, 1684], "date": "2015-10-10 11:34:21", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "03718b23-86c5-4e0b-9660-e0a31c26e4e6", "sentence": "Great staff welcomed by Claire check in. out by her.

Not much common sense demonstrated here in room allocations given booking made in December. No deduction on my account although my grand daughter indicated that was part of the wedding deal. Also charged for a movie that was not watched. Had to leave the wedding venue early as baby was bitten by sandflies. Interestingly we did not use all the breakfasts but still had to pay for these on the basis that different deals were associated with the individual rooms and the manager indicated the restaurant was separate from the resort. I must admit my family distributed themselves in the rooms differently to how I had anticipated in December. Does that justify charging guests for breakfasts that they did not consume. A rip off really. Regarding breakfast it needs to be noted that the line of guests waiting to enter the restaurant was exceedingly long. In all my travels I have never seen anything like it.

The waitress kept on changing our bowl for the leftover shells on the table and with large linen napkins and a finger bowl for washing our prawn fingers we managed not to make any mess. Even if you are not a great seafood lover there was plenty of other choices. The beef and vegetables were superbly cooked. There was ravioli bit bland I thought and along with cold meats and other treats there was plenty of variety. The only negative thing I could say was their desserts were not up to scratch although the children were having a wonderful time with various flavours of ice creams and lots of toppings and lollies to choose from. must not forget plenty of coffee and tea to choose from if you can fit it inSo overall it was a great night out and I would definitely come again.", "offset": [12, 107], "date": "2016-05-20 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "64794432-5a23-424d-847b-dc5d163492a5", "sentence": "I was a bit disappointed to arrive and find that the offer for children was reduced from last year. Last year the movie night every night and the Wi room were things my children were looking forward to. Disappointing to see that a consistent offer was not available from year to year. I have been telling people about all the great things on offer for the kids and will now not as I ca nt guarantee there will be anything there that I have experienced before. I also find it disappointing that I could not get any Acor points each visit. And that I have to show a card to get any discounts rather than just simplifying it and giving the discount when I pay my final bill. I found it to be a pretty pointless offer. Make life simple for people staying there. We are tired and in need of a break. The food stalls such as hot dogs and GF fish and chips were great and we made good use of them. The team down with all the water sports were very helpful giving my boys lessons on different equipment. The in room delivery of food was a fantastic service. I was a little unclear about what to do with all the dishes when we finished. It was a bit hard keeping them in the room til the cleaning came the next day. I would have preferred a full room service each day instead of getting a reduced service on some of the days. I love the day spa and used it a few times however it would be much more relaxing if it was not located above the screaming of people enjoying the water park below. The fireworks were great and my kids enjoyed them. My kids all enjoyed themselves at kids club. I would prefer the option of a longer session and the option for some activities outside the room to be held to keep the kids busy and active. I found the staff all very friendly and helpful. Somewhere to hang out our wet bathers to dry would be helpful. There was no where suitable which made dealing with 4 sets of bathers at the end of the day a bit tricky. I used the washing machine and dryers near my room. The dryers were not very effective at drying. I put half a load from the washer in each machine and ran them twice so for 80 minutes and it still was not dry. I think the laundry rooms could do with some cross ventilation or an extraction fan to be more effective or the dryers need a service. The buffet breakfast needs a little bit more than it gluten friendly. I feel like a pay full price but ca nt eat half of what everyone else eats there. Also indications with the hot food on what is gluten free and what is not would be helpful. I love the caf\u00e9 making coffee all day. It is so handy.

Not allowed to use Acor Advantage Plus cards in restaurants due to easter weekend. Just makes people leave the resort to eat at other restaurants.

I was disappointed with the lagoon view which was at most a couple of glimpses of water through the garden and trees. The room should be reclassified as garden view or some pruning of the foliage needs to occur so you actually do have a view of the lagoon. There is no compendium in the room nor a room service menu Trip Advisor indicates the hotel offers room service so I rang reception only to find that I was unable to order room service for breakfast. There was no minibar not even a bottle of water in the room and I was at the far end of the resort. Thankfully my relatives who live nearby had given me a muesli bar and a bottle of water to take back to the hotel with me. The old noisy rusty fridge in the room did not quite meet the promise of the Lagoon Room high end facilities as described on the website. It woke me up each time the thermostat kicked in so I was wide awake by 3 am. I found a cockroach asleep on the towel in the bathroom beside my toothbrush not pleasant. There was mould around the plug hole in the bathroom sink. The glass doors and windows around the breakfast room and leading into the main building were very dirty. I would rate the hotel as 3 star at best. The experience was certainly not worth 238 for the privilege. The highlight was the decent coffee made by the barista at breakfast.

Hi there We stayed at the Novotel during our travels from Gold Coast to Arlie beach then on our return. We arrived very late on our first stay and found the property to be very good except we were not given clear instructions on how to use or were the facilitys are for our stay. After traveling six hours from our day we would have enjoyed someone to direct us clearly to our room. Not so we had to walk all over the property to then get lost and this was rather frustrating when you have children with you. The high light the next day was the breakfast buffet and fresh coffee made On our second return we arrived after driving from Arlie Beach and checked in this was fantastic and we found out in detail what to do on the property. We decided to dine at the restaurant and this was from start very disappointing were a young cashier girl not the supervisor on the desk said they are so busy and ca nt seat us they were under staffed. I was shocked with her attitude and I explained that we have traveled from such a distance and we are staying at the property for three nights not to mention we were so exhausted and just needed to relax and enjoy a good meal. The restaurant was only full with ten tables. We then placed our order and our food was delivered to were everything was not cooked correctly. raw chicken for daughters chicken meal that was unbelievable was served to my daughter my meal partner was recoked three times to get the degree of meat cooked correctly to be honest I was shocked.

The restaurant supervisor manager was fantastic on her method of how to deal with the problem and she made our time more enjoyable if it was not for her we would have left the property and traveled to Brisbane the next day.
