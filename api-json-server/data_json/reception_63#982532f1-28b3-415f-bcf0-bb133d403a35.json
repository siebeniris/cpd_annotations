THE W IS THE VIRGIN AMERICA OF AIRLINES HIP MODERN AND RELAXING. Wow. My favorite San Francisco hotel is The Clift. Me and a friend were attending an adult prom event at The W hotel so we thought why not stay here too. Well it was the best decision I made. I was honored a AAA rate at 186 for a King Size room and it was worth every penny. The parking is worth the 50 because of convenience and hassle free parking and peace of mind safety. So the W insider Sara Hamza reaches out before our stay just to make sure we are in the know and have plans set. The night before our stay I needed to figure out dinner reservations and did not have time to call each restaurant and had to put in someone elses hands Sara came through very quickly with restaurant options 4 stars and up and times. I chose Slanted Door and a time and Wah Lah done. Check in was a breeze room was upgraded think because I was a Starwod Preferred Guest. so sign up. I felt as if I could live in the room. All amenities were appreciated. Check out is 12 pm which that extra hour I wish I could have taken advantage of next time. FYI they have a Pac Man arcade game right near the bar. I love this hotel.

We however encountered a quite difficult situation. We were on a road trip coming from the Grand Canyon area and ended up checking in at the said hotel circa 3 am. The staff at the reception offered to \u201c upgrade \u201d us to a better room with one bigger sized bed plus a movable mattress bed. Note that we had booked and paid for a room for three people sleeping on two double beds. The way we were proposed the upgrade seemed a better deal than the one we paid and therefore we agreed to the hotel \u2019s offer. Probably it was our mistake to deem that the offer would include the new bigger bed in place of the one of two paid doubles the other paid double bed and a bonus matres bed which indeed did nt make sense. We anyway did n\u2019t question much since this was presented as an upgrade. Arriving to the room we realised that three people had to share one big bed or could ask for an additional foldable mattress bed as was the offer. Having deemed this as unacceptable we returned to the reception only to be told that we have been offered this \u201c upgrade \u201d to which we supposedly agreed to. It took plenty of discussion with the reception in the presence of the member of the security staff for the reception staff to call in the duty manager after we underlined that the upgrade we were offered was actually a downgrade. The manager was indeed extremely polite and offered one extra room to solve the issue.
