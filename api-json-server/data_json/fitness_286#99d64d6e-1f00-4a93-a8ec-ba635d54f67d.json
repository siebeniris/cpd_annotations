The front desk employees were friendly. I was not given any instructions on where the pool or exercise rooms were located. All but one of the shuttle drivers was helpful. The view from my room was nice. I like the fact that the hotel has a shuttle bus pick up from airport to hotel and back. That is a major reason for me booking hotels. Restroom in the lobby smelled and was dirty. My room rug by the bathroom was torn. The shower curtains rods are rusty. You saw grind along the baseboards. That could be from the age of the room. The refrigerator was old and rusted looking. But I had no choice because of my medicine. I prayed on that. The location was too far and there was nothing surrounding the area to see. Shuttle buses were available but limited on how far the go. The choice of food on the menu after 10 pm is limited with nothing healthy to eat. Hotels should know that guest come in late from conferences and events and might want something light to eat. It took almost an hour to get what I order. I order a hamburger with grill onions and one of the cooks came out and said We do not have anymore grilled onions. Do you want raw onions.

Plenty of late night activity around there though as well as a couple working girls lurking around. I was only there for one night though so it did not bother me. What is bothering me though is that it is been a week now since I checked out and the 100 incidental fee hold that they put on my card has yet to be released. I travel plenty for work and have stayed in a ton of hotels and never have I had a hold on my card last longer than two days. When I called the hotel to ask about it nobody would answer the phone. Finally 4 hours and about 7 calls later someone answered the phone only to be rude when I asked how long it took to release the hold. 100 dollars is a lot of money to some people and could be used to put food on the table instead of it just sitting there waiting for someone to click a button to release the funds.", "offset": [30, 129], "date": "2017-07-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "f311d1a2-9fe6-48b2-83a9-dd4af0f675ff", "sentence": "do not get Robbed here.

Sometimes they will stop at every floor even when there is no one at that floor. Ended up taking the stairs even though my room was on the 12th floor.
