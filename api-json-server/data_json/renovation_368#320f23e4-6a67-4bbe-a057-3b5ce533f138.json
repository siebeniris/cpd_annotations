We never before had stayed at the SLS despite the fact that Sam and The Bazaar by Jose Andres are two of my favorite restaurants and are located in the hotel because their dog weight limit of 40 lbs had precluded us from bringing our 110 lb Rhodesian Ridgeback. For this stay however my Starwod Ambassador got us permission from the SLS to bring our dog. So off we wentThis 1 night stay was an award using 200 Starpoints. Several days before our stay the hotel front office manager emailed me to indicate that they had upgraded us to a Lifestyle Suite. Considering I had not used a SNA and it was days before our arrival I was pretty impressed. The manager also had indicated several days before our stay that the rooftop pool deck would be closed for a private event on Sunday. We already had planned to check out by 1030 am to meet friends elsewhere for brunch so this had no impact on us. Check InCheck in was busy with a small line and 2 attendants but it only took maybe 5 minutes for us to be helped despite the hotel being completely sold out. After a few minutes and me completing their pet policy form we were off to our room. One of their front desk managers had upgraded us from the entry level Superior Room 402 sq ft to a Lifestyle Suite 500 sq ft several days before arrival. Considering regular Platinum upgrades do not normally happen until check in this was a very nice gesture. I did not bother with a SNA for this 1 night stay. But my amazing SPG Ambassador and the hotel team clearly were trying to impress. RomThe Lifestyle Suite was not terribly impressive but it was not bad either. Basically it is just a larger room with a workout machine along one wall which we never bothered to use. The desk and seating area at the back of the room was clumsy and odd. The one window in the room made the room quite dark and the room lighting was pretty paltry as is often mentioned on TripAdvisor and other reviews herein. The view onto the courtyard was meager. as well. Closer to the door was the storage cabinet closet space which included a mini fridge a mini bar with a pull down drawer and safe and coffee tea selection. Near the door entry was the mirrored workout machine against the wall along the hallways that leads to the bathroom with a lot of wasted spaceThe bathroom was small and had a sliding set of mirror doors which allowed entry we kept it open and wondered about this designThe bath felt luxurious but very dark not helped by the fact that the room was already dark. The single vanity was disappointing for a suite level room even if it obviously was not a proper suite. It was not really a junior suite to me but it was a more spacious room. The air conditioning worked beautifully something that I do not always get to enjoy. I never had a single issue with air con despite the fact that it was 90 F outside for most of the weekend. The shower pressure was pretty pitiful another disappointment with the bath. The shower area itself was spacious and comfortable though the lack of a separated toilet room was curious for a suite room. The bed was very comfortable and soft for us. We slept pretty well even after Macalan jumped up in the middle of the nightOveral the room design was pretty nice but laid out in a poor way. The fact that the suite had but a single window was also pretty tragic. We did not love the room but we ended up having a pretty comfortable stay for the 1 night after all. ServiceThe service at this hotel is reputed to be very good. and we found the service to be outstanding as well. The bellmen were extremely friendly and helpful the check in attendants were friendly and helpful and quite efficient and patient with some cluels guests the guest services desk attendants were all friendly and the valets were great. I did call to let the manager know we found the room to feel more like a downgrade though we appreciated the hotel trying to be generous with the early and unexpected upgrade. I just wanted to give feedback with no expectation for more. Yet the manager I spoke to was incredibly gracious apologizing that we were disappointed and asking what she coud offer to help make up for that. I demurred since we had been upgraded on an award stay for just a single night. She made sure to tell me that the hotel was slated to start renovation soon to address some of the very issues that so disappointed us and she indicated how much they wanted us to return after the changes were made. She was incredibly deft at turning a bad situation into an extremely positive one. I already was impressed with her. so much so that I wrote to my Ambassador to compliment herBut when we got up to the pool deck for a drink we were told that the same manager had authorized a 100 food beverage credit for us. I was stunned. I at first declined but then the gracious pool staff convinced me that we should enjoy it. So we agreed to have a round of drinks at the pool bar. After that the bartenders really pushed us again to enjoy the credit since we had only used about half. so we had a second round. Yikes we do not normally drink during the day. But then we had used the credit and I tipped the bartenders generously. The entire scenario smacked of being at a St Regis or Aman hotel with such incredible service friendliness and eagerness to please. We truly were impressed. Even the next morning my husband went down to get coffee and walk the dog and the food beverage director ran into him and knew him and our dog by name. Pretty damn impressive indeed. We will not even comment on the incredible dining service at Sam see below. Overall the service in this hotel truly is fantastic and turned me around from my disappointment with the room to being so impressed by the high service standard. While I do not love the rooms in their current incarnation they definitely are decorated with high end details and the service here makes me extremely interested in returning once they do renovate. DiningDining was the reason I LOVE this hotel location. The Bazaar by Jose Andres is one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles and its private dining room Sam is my absolute favorite in the city. I believe Sam is better even than the famous Providence and Melise. Our dinner started off a bit slowly with a delay in being seated but then took off and was incredible from there. I had thought my last dinner at Sam for my birthday in Jan 2016 was the best I had ever had in LA. but this dinner at Sam topped it. This was unquestionably the best dining experience I had had in Los Angeles and it rivaled some of the best dinners we have ever had. This was truly a Michelin 2 3 star experience for us. LocationWhile the hotel is not located super close to anything of note it is not far from most things of note in Los Angeles. It was just a 20 minute drive from meeting a friend at the Luxe Sunset Blvd Hotel before checking in and it was just a 10 minute drive to our brunch at the Palihotel on Melrose. Beverly Hills and West Hollywood are just 5 10 minutes depending on where you need to go. Downtown is just 20 minutes. PolThe pool deck is quite impressive though not enormous. The bar area was small but we had no trouble finding seats. The pool service was amazing they offered to get us chairs or a cabana made sure we found seats at the bar etc. The bartenders were fantastic and really enjoyed chatting with people at the bar. The other patrons were also quite friendly and we met a number of them in our short 2 round time at the barOveralOveral we loved our stay despite not loving the dark room with only one window. The room was very comfortable as it turned out and the hotel service and amenities were tremendous. We can not wait until the hotel completes its renovation and improves its interior design and space allocation lighting issues supposedly lightening up the decor throughout. And despite having a 150 pet fee the hotel never charged us. Of course everyone said they loved Macalan and hoped we would bring him back up with us on our next visit.", "offset": [4308, 4523], "date": "2017-06-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "931f26c2-909c-438e-827c-3b1fd1ea9d14", "sentence": "Good location close to everything. Staff was great. Service was impeccable. I was disappointed in the hotel rooms. They were dark with all these mirrors that were even darker.

The bathroom was nice and spacious with enough space to place our toilette but the tub and shower was really inconvenient. If you turn the knobs the wrong way the water would get everywhere and that is another thing that was frustrating. I would definitely stay there again if these rooms were remodeled and there was more light coming in. One more thing the pool needs to be a little deeper to enjoy it and take a dip.

I am a frequent guest at the SLS often traveling for business. I had been looking forward to the renovated rooms because the old ones were too dark had uncomfortable seating and were long overdue for an overhaul. I had been back to the hotel several times over the last few months hoping the renovations would be complete but alas they were not. Then I recently read the reviews of the hotel looking for signs that someone had stayed in a renovated room. Though disappointed by what one person wrote I could only find one such review on here I decided I would try it myself. The rooms are MUCH nicer. They have new carpets with some color more comfortable furniture better lighting new wooden shades on the windows a dramatically nicer white marble shower and a warmer color scheme throughout all of the new pieces of furniture and accessories placed within the room. Furthermore the hallways are brighter also have new more colorful carpets have new artistic signage outside of each room and a much more tasteful appearance overall.
