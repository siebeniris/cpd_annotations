What an amazing trip in mid March for a winter getaway. From Katrin who saved the day when we had a pet emergency that required us to postpone our trip in February to the last good bye from Makala in the Club Lounge on our 5th day it was an unforgettable experience. The people are amazingVance Daniel Anna Shirley Penny and too many others to mention it was clear their number one priority was to insure we had a memorable visit. We generally stay on the CLub Level at The Ritz and this was the nicest Lounge with the best variety and qaulity of offerings we have seen. It is more expensive but well worth it. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable with the usual Ritz amenities very well done. The beach is very nice but did get a little crowded at times but the beach staff was always helpful when needed. The water sports equipment is included in the resort fee and it was nice not to feel nickeled and dimed every time we wanted to do something. We played a lot of tennis and it was great. They have two omni courts artificial grass and sand that are very easy on yhour body. The courts could have been in a little better shape but were very playable. The only real negative of the visit was the the tennis pro who visited every couple of days. Not friendly had not interest in trying to arrange of match find other guests who might want to play etc but the hotel does not hold itself as a tennis resort.

Overall the hotel is beautiful comfortable and convenient to the Red Hook ferry for visits to St John. We found it a pleasant enjoyable luxurious place to stay. We also really liked that you could take out snorkel equipment kayaks etc. at your leisure to use on the beach at the resort or more importantly take equipment with you to St John for awesome snorkeling. Downsides. The food is pretty atrocious and insanely overpriced. Like Moscow oil baron overpriced. you are much better off eating in Red Hook Fish Tails and Tap Still are cheap and delicious. Also go to Moes Fresh Market in Red Hook and get yourself snacks breakfast and liquor mixers to keep in your room fridge. Not to sound overly cheap but a rum coke at the bar next to the pool is 9. The ENTIRE bottle of rum at the grocery store is 8. Make your own drinks. As for breakfast. The buffet is no joke 36 per person. And it is not even all that good. We would not have minded all that much but Expedia advertised our package as continental breakfast included. The folks at the Ritz were super nice about it and comped us breakfast our first morning as a result of the misrepresentation but yowza 36 p for your basic hotel breakfast buffet is insane. We did have lunch polside one day and for fish tacos and a quesadilla it was about 80 \u2013 and pretty gross. So definitely stay here get yourself some breakfast and snacks from Moes small fridge in the room and eat dinner elsewhere. Beautiful comfortable rooms with ocean facing balconies. Spa quality bathrooms. Water bottles in rooms and solid in room coffee machine. Red Hook is no thriving hub but there are a couple good spots to eat and it is easy access to St John for hiking snorkeling kayaking beaching. The food. The restaurants are bad and overpriced.

It has been six years since my wife and I married. Focused on the advent of a new career our wedding was quick and elegant yet no time was given to go on a honeymoon. With our respective I Dos we embarked on our journey together. The years following passed gleefully enough filled with the many highs and lows joy and sadness that one would expect. Two boys added to the family equation in those years have provided exactly what one would expect of two energetic young men. We are happy and we are a family. As one would expect a slow and unseen plaque of stresses formed almost unfelt and rarely a bother. As the years passed without any vacations our eyes always looked out peering for anything that may make a good justifiable getaway. We tossed about our reasoning hashing and rehashing different possible scenarios wherein we would finally be able to escape together. Plan after plan was made and often fell apart shortly after their construction. We had the desire to go somewhere but in the end never went anywhere. In recent months stresses from work have begun to pour on wave after wave. Along with those stresses has been the pressure of selling a house and buying a new one. When home becomes a headache our next house is no sure bet and work is filled with uncertainty the unseen buildup of stress seeped out into every facet of our life no longer unfelt and anything but subdued. On one random Monday it was time. Time to go. Time to get away. Our anniversary was approaching again and this year it would not be allowed to pass without fanfare. With assurances from my local dog kennel to take the dogs and my mom on board to watch the boys I walked into the kitchen and told my wife to clear the schedule for the following week. With a bit of understandable confusion in her eyes she asked why this was. I told her we were going on a vacation. Finally. Given the many plans that had failed over the years she was in a bit of disbelief not fully believing that this was finally going to happen. She asked where we were going to go and I said that I was not sure but I believe that I had found a place. The Ritz Carlton on a little island that neither of us had ever been to Saint Thomas. That choice proved to be a turning point and a decision that in the end neither of us would regret. With a quick click of a mouse the anticipation began to build. What would this be like. What would it mean to us to finally get away. How would this feel. How would the kids react to us being away. What are we to expect from the resort. Was it worth the price. Certainly their name precedes them but what of this particular location. Would six years of building stress and anticipation years of unrealized desires and so on be finally satiated by this choice in destination. Allow me to skip ahead in the story and tell you this simple answer yesWe arrived kissed by the sun as we walked across the tarmac soaking up the foreign yet seemingly familiar and welcoming landscape. The island accents of the airport staff wafted across the air causing smiles to cross our faces. We were here. This is actually happening. Shortly we saw a man bearing a genuine smile and sharply dressed holding in his hand a tablet with our name on it. Our chariot awaited. With a brisk drive through the crowded market and cruise port area we ascended into the hills. Turn followed turn followed hill followed vista. Polite blurbs about local history and lore were offered up by our driver like a person updating a prodigal friend who had returned from a trip abroad. Humble dwellings scattered about our drive mixed in amongst the hills opening to views of unequaled beauty and mansions that called out their wealth with well appointed facades. The succession of views continued hypnotic in their flow. The island had us and we had not even arrived to the resort. We were drunk with smiles and hungry with anticipation. Another turn and we were there like a surprise we knew was coming but could not fully anticipate. What a spectacular surprise it was. The man at the guard house asked for our names and with a word we were in. Down the drive we slowly approached the grand entrance a luxurious porte cochere surrounded with tropical flowers and teaming with the most important factor of all the wonderfully skilled staff of The Ritz Carlton St Thomas. The greetings they provided made us both feel as though we were welcomed home by family happy that we were able to make it back for a visit. Their smiles were genuine. Their joy was palpable. Never have we met a staff of any sort with such honest conviction such noticeable dedication. The formalities were short and painless finalizing our payments and room selection. As we sat peering out onto the wonders of Great Bay we were delighted by an offering of rum punch. Those proved to be the perfect touch to start off our stayWe were then driven down a winding cart path sided by verdant gardens. We happily chatted with the bellman as he politely inquired about our vacation plans. Tucked neatly away far from the grand main entrance awaited our building. The bellman took our bags and showed us to our room the door hidden from view of the cart path and surrounding areas. As the door opened we were in resort heaven. The cool creamy marble floor lead elegantly into the main room wherein sat a table. Atop the stone of the table was a most surprising gift a bottle of champagne nestled in a bucket of ice that sat next to a decadent selection of confections with the plate having been written on Happy Anniversary. The most cherished piece of the display was a card that welcomed us congratulating us on our anniversary. They certainly made a wonderful impression on usThe tall sliding glass doors sided by elegant drapes beckoned us to the balcony. The cooling breezes of the island greeted us as we opened the door peering down onto the splendor of the resort and the azure waters of Great Bay. What a sight it was. We stood for happy moments absorbing the beauty concocting plans of how best to enjoy our time here. Venturing back into the bedroom the large king bed was tall covered in soft linens and pillows. The mattress was enveloping in its comfort and was truly rejuvenating. At the end sat a most useful bench to prepare ourselves. The room was light and elegant in its design and color palate capturing equal parts of the regal name of The Ritz Carlton and the honest beauty of the Caribbean. Back down the marble hallway in which we entered was the door that led to the bathroom. The name bathroom does not accurately conjure in ones mind what this room truly was. Spacious accommodations awaited us the two large sinks with their tasteful designs sat atop a broad countertop. Along its length sat a useful selection of toiletries and was far more comprehensive than I could have imagined. To the right of the sinks sat a deep soaker tub wonderfully surrounded by soaps and gels. The design of the tub was one with much thought to the user with handles placed to easily draw ones body from the warmth of the water. The shower was spacious and again offered a selection of soaps and gels. The toiletries provided were of unparalleled quality. Purple Water by Asprey of London quickly became our favorite in all categories provided to us. The scent was inviting and crisp yet relaxing. Their lotion has proven to be quite the new addiction being exactly what one expects from a lotion. To round off the rooms offering was a most useful espresso maker. It was used at numerous times throughout the day to add a spark to my step after being lulled by the sun and tequila. The room proved night after night to be the ultimate place for rejuvenation with each aspect well thought out and expertly executed. Down a short and quiet path that passed a babbling fountain and flowers of unknown names sat the entrance to the shining gem of the resort the oasis inside of the paradise The Club Lounge. Another subdued name that belied the wonders inside. Through the frosted doors we were greeted with sincere attention and warmth by the concierge. A quick tour revealed to us the many amenities that were offered from the decadent presentations of food from their expert chefs to the wines and liquors. The views and divine accommodations would prove to be an irresistible magnet to us time and time again. We can not speak highly enough of the expert skills of the Lounge staff and their amazing treats and dishes that tantalized us. Access to the Club Lounge is without question a new must have for us on our planned return trips. We can not recommend it enoughDown the steps adjoining the Club sat the beach. Its expertly manicured sands shown brightly in the midday sun and provided a muted warmth at dusk as the winds of the islands continued without ceasing. We witnessed each morning the level of care given to the beach a team raking the white sand even venturing into the water to catch stray bits of sea grass lest they taint their beach. Again each member of the staff worked with great purpose with dignity and focus. Along the beach sat many attractions from food and drinks to activities that would keep one busy for days. The chairs were comfortable and their beach staff was helpful and numerous. Exploring the waters of Great Bay revealed to me numerous colorful fish a large puffer that swam cautiously beneath me and conch too many in number to count. Every rock and every blade of grass seemed to have something upon it or behind it. For the truly venturous of which I am not one there are numerous spots to which one could easily swim and be even more astounded by the abundant life of the waters that surround and feed the island. Our days twice lead us to The Spa. If your body and soul were not already at peace by the joy and beauty of the island then the spa staff will see to it that you leave in a state of absolute bliss. The scents abound within the shop none proving offensive and selections of every sort await your trial and delight. The staff are wonderful in their skill from expert hands to warm smiles they proved on each occasion to be an amazing choice. We enjoyed manicures and pedicures on one day followed by a couples massage the following day. A visit upon our return is without questionWe had the distinct pleasure of meeting some of the management from different facets of the resort and each greeted us with genuine care and showed to us a magnificent level of professionalism. They truly do care about their guests and they seek to do what it takes to ensure your hapinesTo sum up our experience The Ritz Carlton. St Thomas is luxury and pleasure without parallel. They are experts in all that they do and it shows upon the faces of their guests as it did upon ours. They are a comprehensive team of professionals dedicated to your care and joy. For them to fail at nothing is an accomplishment unto itself but to be the superlative that stands out amongst the luxurious is truly a grand achievementTo the staff of The Ritz Carlton St Thomas thank you for all that you did.

Arrived at the Ritz Carlton late this afternoon after a long flight on Delta and hours waiting to hear that my luggage never made my flight and will not arrive in St Thomas for at least another day. But immediately after stepping onto the grounds at the Ritz I was so relaxed none of that seemed to matter. The resort is absolutely stunning. The grounds are meticulously maintained the pool and ocean view are picture perfect and the rooms are spacious. Everything I would expect of a Ritz property. However the most amazing thing about my trip was the way they helped out with my lost luggage. I arrived with literally nothing but the clothes on my back. Deidre who checked us in was amazing and after checking us in took me to the hotel boutique where the resort provided me with clothing for a reception I needed to attend that evening. That was above and beyond anything I would have expected. The hotel also provided me with a toiletry kit which is pretty much expected from any place but housekeeping then came to my room with 4 different types of deodorant for me to choose from so they could be sure I was satisfied. Again above and beyond. They then called several times to check that I had what I needed until my bag arrived. Amazing amazing amazing customer service.

Stayed with my wife for 4 nights celebrating our 20 year anniversary. I am a Platinum Elite and used points 700 per night plus 350 per night for the club lounge. In addition the resort charges 75 per day for a resort charge. On the surface the resort charge may seem pricey but you do get a number of things with that including wifi bottled water and a few other little things. The biggest benefit of the resort fee is unlimited use of water sport equipment including sailboats paddle boards kayaks snorkel equipment etc. My only problem with this is when I tried to get a hobie sailboat they told me I could not take it out because I had little experience. Of course they were happy to offer to charge me 85 an hour for a lesson. Come on. that is a little ridiculous. A 5 minute briefing would have been fine. Besides saw a lot of people out there with little experience. Regarding the club lounge it was fine. Full breakfast limited lunch and canap\u00e9s at night. Beer wine and liquor available open to close. You can even take it to go. What was strange is that they could not make things like margaritas. They had tequila but no margarita mix. Also a bit annoying that you could not take a bottle of wine to your table. We had a group of six one night and were told nope can not bring the bottle to the table even though four of us were drinking it. In summary I would not opt for the club level if I come back. Just not worth it. And it is pricey at 350 per night and you do not get the variety of enjoying the other places in and out of the resort as you feel since you paid for it you have to use it. Honestly not worth it and do not bother. I have stayed at nicer lounges at a few JWs not to mention other RCs. Okay onto the good stuff and there is plenty of it. The resort is beautiful. Just an overall great setting. It is very well maintained and the beach and landscaping are gorgeous. I did not find it overwhelming and everything was easy to get to well situated. The beach was roomy with plenty of shade chairs available. We never had a problem getting a chair on the beach and there were plenty of people around to help set up and get towels. Also bar service on the beach was very good. The beach was perfect and the breeze coming in was just icing on the cake. The views were amazing as was the water. Some rocks but not an issue. Our room was typical RC. Big and roomy with a comfy bed and huge bathroom with all the good amenities. The balcony was awesome and we overlooked the beach room 34. Great view. Housekeeping was excellent. The staff were over the top polite. They really seemed to go the extra step in delivering great service. Very friendly and responsive. We did a sunset cruise to St John aboard Lady Linsey the resorts large catamaran. Great trip and the crew could not have been better. Brooke Michaela and Captain Richard were superb and made for an excellent excursion. A must do. I just wish we did more trips with them.

This hotel is not ready to reopen. Welcome Home. That is what we are used to hearing when we check in at a Ritz Property. We book club level because they know I want unsweet ice tea my wife has a gluten sensitivity and they make sure to accommodate her without asking. My grandsons adore the Clubs chocolate chip cookies. We have stayed at many Ritz properties and the service is always a level above any competitor. The Ritz Carlton St Thomas however is not up to any civilized standard for a hotel let alone a Ritz property. This particular property was a victim over 2 years ago of Hurricane Irma and Maria. The property has been closed until recently to go through a 100 M renovation. When we heard they were re opening we booked a trip for us our kids and grandkids as a Christmas present to the family. We always stay on club level so we booked club level rooms. We arrived at the hotel on Tuesday Dec 3rd only to discover that club level is not ready and will not be open for month or more. We were very disappointed because club level is where we congregate as a family on our trips together. The Ritz should have notified us in advance so that we could have made other plans if desired. They did not do so. We also had to wait in line for nearly 20 minutes to check in because they had only 1 person handling check in. They then check us in and send us to our rooms on the 5th floor of E building. They had not bothered to tell us that the elevators in the building did not work. Climbing the hill from the beach to the rooms and then having to climb 5 flights of stairs in addition is not easy for an old fat guy like me. I called to talk to a manager and waited nearly an hour for a call back before I decided to go address my concerns in person. When I arrived at the lobby I found the elevators were not working there either. In fact we have had trouble walking the sidewalks around the resort because they are re tiling portions of them. Construction is going on all over the property and they expect their guests to tolerate the noise. They have hired someone to play music all day long at the old pool and beach to try to cover up the noise but they have to keep the volume too high for some of the guests comfort to accomplish that feat. We have found that the level of service at this Ritz property is not up to Ritz standards not even close. Ritz keeps a comprehensive database on their customers so they know how to attend to them. The concept they push is that if you have to ask it is not service. Currently at this property you have to ask multiple times. Our safe did not work. It had a battery issue. We called Wednesday morning asking they replace the battery. Nothing happened. We called Wednesday evening asking they replace the battery. 30 minutes later someone shows up and then has to leave to get a battery because he did not bring one even though we reported the error. At the same time they elected to fix a light in our hallway that was broken. When we returned from dinner the light was working and hanging from the ceiling. Nice touch. Today we left at 730 am to go on an all day boat charter. We returned this evening to find that neither our room nor our kids room had been cleaned. I called the concierge to get housekeeping but instead had the phone answered by in room dining. I ended up talking to the in room dining manager and he was simply no help. I called and requested to speak to a manager and then got fed up and walked to the lobby to see him in person. He was in a meeting. He did come to my room shortly afterwards and once again promised to make things right. I told him that I was not looking for any special treatment. I simply wanted the service I expect from a Ritz property. I explained that thus far I have received much better service at many Mariot Courtyards. I am not looking for freebies I am not looking for discounts I do not mind paying for service. that is why I have been a Ritz customer for years. However at this property that service is not remotely close to what we have become accustomed to at Ritz Properties. The staff is poorly trained. They do not have enough personnel working in some roles to handle guest volumes. The property is under construction so key facilities such as the elevators are not working. Ritz Carlton should have never opened this property in the condition it is in and they should have been much more extensive in the training of their staff. I can site a myriad of small examples as well but suffice it to say this property is not close to Ritz standards and every guest we have talked with agrees.

This hotel is not ready to reopen. Welcome Home. That is what we are used to hearing when we check in at a Ritz Property. We book club level because they know I want unsweet ice tea my wife has a gluten sensitivity and they make sure to accommodate her without asking. My grandsons adore the Clubs chocolate chip cookies. We have stayed at many Ritz properties and the service is always a level above any competitor. The Ritz Carlton St Thomas however is not up to any civilized standard for a hotel let alone a Ritz property. This particular property was a victim over 2 years ago of Hurricane Irma and Maria. The property has been closed until recently to go through a 100 M renovation. When we heard they were re opening we booked a trip for us our kids and grandkids as a Christmas present to the family. We always stay on club level so we booked club level rooms. We arrived at the hotel on Tuesday Dec 3rd only to discover that club level is not ready and will not be open for month or more. We were very disappointed because club level is where we congregate as a family on our trips together. The Ritz should have notified us in advance so that we could have made other plans if desired. They did not do so. We also had to wait in line for nearly 20 minutes to check in because they had only 1 person handling check in. They then check us in and send us to our rooms on the 5th floor of E building. They had not bothered to tell us that the elevators in the building did not work. Climbing the hill from the beach to the rooms and then having to climb 5 flights of stairs in addition is not easy for an old fat guy like me. I called to talk to a manager and waited nearly an hour for a call back before I decided to go address my concerns in person. When I arrived at the lobby I found the elevators were not working there either. In fact we have had trouble walking the sidewalks around the resort because they are re tiling portions of them. Construction is going on all over the property and they expect their guests to tolerate the noise. They have hired someone to play music all day long at the old pool and beach to try to cover up the noise but they have to keep the volume too high for some of the guests comfort to accomplish that feat. We have found that the level of service at this Ritz property is not up to Ritz standards not even close. Ritz keeps a comprehensive database on their customers so they know how to attend to them. The concept they push is that if you have to ask it is not service. Currently at this property you have to ask multiple times. Our safe did not work. It had a battery issue. We called Wednesday morning asking they replace the battery. Nothing happened. We called Wednesday evening asking they replace the battery. 30 minutes later someone shows up and then has to leave to get a battery because he did not bring one even though we reported the error. At the same time they elected to fix a light in our hallway that was broken. When we returned from dinner the light was working and hanging from the ceiling. Nice touch. Today we left at 730 am to go on an all day boat charter. We returned this evening to find that neither our room nor our kids room had been cleaned. I called the concierge to get housekeeping but instead had the phone answered by in room dining. I ended up talking to the in room dining manager and he was simply no help. I called and requested to speak to a manager and then got fed up and walked to the lobby to see him in person. He was in a meeting. He did come to my room shortly afterwards and once again promised to make things right. I told him that I was not looking for any special treatment. I simply wanted the service I expect from a Ritz property. I explained that thus far I have received much better service at many Mariot Courtyards. I am not looking for freebies I am not looking for discounts I do not mind paying for service. that is why I have been a Ritz customer for years. However at this property that service is not remotely close to what we have become accustomed to at Ritz Properties. The staff is poorly trained. They do not have enough personnel working in some roles to handle guest volumes. The property is under construction so key facilities such as the elevators are not working. Ritz Carlton should have never opened this property in the condition it is in and they should have been much more extensive in the training of their staff. I can site a myriad of small examples as well but suffice it to say this property is not close to Ritz standards and every guest we have talked with agrees. They will lose business at this property and potentially lose long term Ritz customers like myself thanks to this experience. I plan these Christmas trips for my family and try to make them special.

They should re brand it \u201c Mariot \u201d. The Ritz Carlton St Thomas does not live up to the Ritz Carlton name. Usually when you stay at a Ritz Carlton the facility and service are beyond expectations. At this hotel they disappointed my family repeatedly. The HVAC is loud \u2014 every time it kicked on during the night I woke up the system should have been better and quiet. There was no water left in our room. The room amenity for our arrival was a tiny tray of coconut chips and nuts with a single can of coke and 3 small \u2014 airplane size \u2014 bottles of liquor. The service in the bar and the restaurant were terrible and slow and simply not up to the standards of a 5 star hotel \u2014 in addition to the fact that the food was not very good. When housekeeping came for turn down service at 630pm we requested that they return when we went to dinner and the reaction we got clearly indicated that that was not an acceptable request.

My fianc\u00e9 and I are frequent Ritz Carlton vacationers this was our first time at the St Thomas resort and sad to say it will be our last as well. After reading reviews we understood that the hotel is just starting to come back together after the huricane renovation. Upon arrival to the hotel our check in process was very strange. We were kind of brought around to different areas of the lobby until we were sat down and someone came over to help us. It seemed like staff was unsure what to do with us. We did not like that our bags were sitting in a pile of other peoples luggages outside the hotel until our room was ready. Mind you we absolutely love the Ritz located on cayman island and all their other properties. Our hotel tour guide was great in showing us around and answering general questions. The view from the resort is stunning in itself. It was pouring our first day so we were looking to browse the shops at the hotel do anything however only their jewelry store is open all the other shops are not yet ready. To my knowledge there is no arcade or really much else to do besides lounge at the pool beach activities and excursions. Calling concierge the staff was not very knowledgeable on what stores are open which surprised us. Also we were being called by the wrong last name our entire trip do not know what was up with that. We had club access where we spent a lot of our time having drinks and munching on snacks which was nice. Our first night we ate at Bleu water restaurant the atmosphere was bland decor was lacking it came across like more of a family restaurant less of a romantic feel we were trying to go for being a steakhouse. Our food took over an hour to come out. However our food was tasty. Our next day we reserved a cabana by the pool which was nice. When we got to the pool area I let staff know we have a cabana reserved and we were told oh no they are all reserved I let them know I reserved mine a week before our trip then I was led to my cabana which was not set up yet. It was 11 am they rent out from 9 am for the day. Service was just ok. The beach is not the most enjoyable due to all the coral sea grass. This is definitely not a pure white sand beach Incase that is what you are looking for. Only one pool is open right now so everyone is congested into one area. There is a slide being built which looks fun for the kids. I highly recommend taking the ferry over to trunk bay beach in St John it was the highlight of our trip. That beach is beautiful pure and memorable. Pros. Staff was very very kind. They can drive you anywhere via golf cart should you choose not to walk. I truly feel bad writing this review because staff is so so nice however they were poorly trained lacking guidance. The room was clean and newly renovated. Bathroom was extremely spacious perks for water toilet having its own door. The property was beyond beautiful and everything is just a close walk away. Cons besides everything I mentioned already bathrobe was dirty with makeup smears. Food not good. Served raw food twice on our trip. Overall we love staying at the Ritz properties we love being club level. however there are nicer Ritz caribean locations than st Thomas they still need to get their act together here a bit to say the least. Nothing to quite rave about just yet. Food options could be better. Service at coconut cove was very strange my food was raw food is not Ritz Carlton quality. Room service food quality was not good plates came dirty and food did not look pleasant to eat. A Ceasar salad at the ritz should not be salad from a bag with bagged shredded cheese soggy pieces of bread serving as croutons and bottled dressing. Our room service chicken fingers were completely raw pink. My husband got sick. The kids can get sick this way. Where is the ritz quality. This luxury hotel giant is going down hill. No longer luxurious ritz Carlton.

The 3 separate balconies were designed based on the building facade instead of their usability and half walls blocked the spectacular views. During our stay the resort was not that full room wise and yet it was difficult to get reservations at the open restaurants onsite. The food prices were expensive like 20 hamburgers with fries at the two beachfront cafes. At the Aloro restaurant we sat at a counter overlooking the salad and pizza prep kitchen since we could n\u2019t get a table. It was fun to watch the food being prepared and having the staff talk about what they were making. The 22 Bianca pizza at the Aloro was delicious. Risotto al Funghi and Rigatoni were very good too. Since the 2017 hurricane not all facilities at the Ritz Carlton were available. The hotel officially opened in November 2019. With one pool closed on the hotel side it felt a little crowded at the other pools and the beaches were still being worked on.
