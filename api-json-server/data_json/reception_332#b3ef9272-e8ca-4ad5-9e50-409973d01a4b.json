This is a three star property with four star prices. Most staff were quite friendly but we had many disappointing experiences. We had a large 2 bedroom suite. 3star decor and amenities empty minibar had a sign under construction. During our four day stay we ate at Palm Court Rum Fish Bermudas Flying Bridge and the Sandpit. tiki bar. Plus conference catering and room service. All the meals were expensive nothing was special. Bermudas is the only restaurant serving breakfast and their 18 buffet is worse than some free breakfast buffets we have had at 3star hotels. Omelette person was mysteriously absent pastries seemed baked from frozen fruit was nearly empty and cut mangoes were in syrup. Room service breakfast turned out to be a better value although my cut strawberries were from the day before. Palm Court dinner was okay but the putanesca style grouper entree I ordered was made with fried fish which I was not expecting and which would not happen in a real high end Italian restaurant or in Italy. After being disappointed in mixed drinks we purchased our own liquor for DIY. Multiple staff kept telling us the food is good at all the restaurants and specifically mentioned Flying Bridge a casual joint. Their fish tacos had nothing Mexican about them no salsa or guacamole or spice none of your crunchy taco slaw just fried fish cheese and lettuce. The worst though was that they served my daughter rotten milk. I tasted it after she rejected it and gagged it was not just old but completely rotten. If I were waiting tables which I have plenty I would have taken the drink off the bill and apologized profusely instead of just replacing it. The decor at the restaurants is meh as well. Flying Bridge is a high priced diner Bermudas is a high priced dated chain restaurant and Palm Court is trying to be fancy but lacks attention to detail eg we had a thoroughly dead ginger plant decorating our table. My daughter and her dad went to Rum Fish and they liked the aquarium but did not enjoy the food enough to go back. When we ordered room service for dinner I had specifically requested standard condiments ketchup for a burger and steak sauce for a steak and despite. oh yes of course these were forgotten. Although I noticed immediately and they did apologize it took so long to return with them that our food was cold. I am not a snobby foodie type of person I just like my food to be fresh. And hot. None of these flaws were fatal alone but collectively the meals left a bad taste in our mouths. We were there for a conference and brought our 7 year old daughter expecting to drop her off for some of the fun sounding kids activities each day. All the kids activities are at the KONK center where all the kids really do is crafts like painting ugly and large pottery that you then get to take home with you. Each 12 piece takes about 12 minutes to paint. The staff at the center do not seem like they like their jobs and when you walk in they look at you like what are you doing here. One staff member said we should not pay at the activities center for the drop off camp because it is just doing crafts at KONK and not worth the 30 for an hour and a half. They have evening drop off that we had planned to use before we knew what it was like but we just kept our daughter with us. There were other activities listed in the brochure like various rides and mining for gems etc but those were not happening while we were there. There was a water slide but the weather was too cold for that we needed coats. My daughter enjoyed mini golf. it is the smallest course you have ever seen and falling apart in some places but it is free and still fun. During our visit everything we visited off property was great. Snorkeling with wild manatees with River Ventures in Crystal River was a peak experience. We spent hundreds of extra dollars for a private heated not fancy houseboat and it did not feel at all overpriced. Staff are outstanding. it is a 2 hour drive and you have to be there by 6 am group or 645am private. If it is a cold day you will get lots of manatees. We also visited Clearwater Marine Aquarium to see Winter the dolphin from A Dolphin Tale. it is 45 mins away and next time we had plan for more time and reserve animal encounter experiences maybe visit their other nearby location where they show you stuff from the movie. If you want to get your nails done Hawaiis about 10 mins from Island Grand is excellent. Quick good quality good value friendly.

We were told our bags would be taken to our room and we had be messaged when it was ready. We went off to explore and the first thing that hit us was the tiny size of the main pool which was extremely crowded and no lifeguard at any time. There was also an adult only quiet pool which was was full of loud adults drinking having fun and even noisier than the kids pool. The beach was really nice and as pictured in the marketing material. By 4 pm we had not been messaged I went and checked was then allocated a room and was told to follow the bell concierge I felt really awkward because it seemed obvious a second gratuity was expected of the second concierge after already paying the first 10Our room was a disappointment in that it was very dated in need of refurbishment and modernization and smelled damp and musty but it did appear reasonably clean. The air conditioning is effective but very loud and repeatedly woke us all in the night whenever it switched on. The room did however have a decent sized fridge and a sideways sea view through the buildings. The shower was good. The on site restaurants were varied and pretty expensive but the food was good. The Deli in the lobby was particularly good for breakfast but expect to pay 45 for 4 sandwiches and a couple of coffees. All the staff were extremely friendly the ladies in the deli were particularly helpful and we enjoyed a chat with Holly in the foyer coffee shop bar one stormy evening when everything closed down. We heard that the hotel was just over half full but the pools and facilities were extremely busy the pools are just too small and unsupervised would hate to see them when the hotel is full capacity. Also they are fully used but totally unlit outside or inside in the dark and appeared to us far too dangerous to let our kids swim after dark.", "offset": [280, 377], "date": "2016-08-29", "cpt": "3", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "ff35a6c4-5cbe-4100-975c-5f4a9e135eff", "sentence": "Left days before our checkout.

I had such high hopes for the TradeWinds having stayed there many years ago. Being forced into booking a sales pitch with the timeshare team at check. in is not appreciated nor is it conducive to a relaxing experience. This is completely unwanted and totally unacceptable for a resort where we are paying well over 200 night. When I called to cancel the event I was told that they were unable to help me. At check in the front desk preauthorized another 200 for the purpose of being able to charge to the room during my stay which is fine and makes the day smoother. I did not appreciate being told several times that it was expected that I should spend more than 200 and that they really encourage their guests to spend money. I felt several times during my stay that I was being upsold. We had lunch at Flying Bridge and the food was very poor. It took over an hour to get our food and when it arrived it was cold. Two sandwiches a soft drink and a pina colada were over 60. The drink was too strong and overall the experience was not enjoyable. On the positive side the beach was very nice and the clamshells were a nice addition especially since it was not busy so we were able to get the front row. I did learn though that regularly they do charge to sit in the front row. something I have NEVER experienced at any other hotel usually it is just first come first serve. The hotel overall is somewhat run down and you have to walk through a shabby banquet area to get back to your room. The room was average although thankfully it was clean. The two double beds totally inappropriate for a couples stay and we were not offered a different type of room at check in even though it was clear we were a couple were uncomfortable and the mirrors on either side of the bed made it somewhat awkward to sleep without waking up and thinking someone else is in the romOveral I was not impressed with TradeWinds and am unlikely to stay here again.", "offset": [125, 198], "date": "2016-12-19", "cpt": "3", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "c526429c-3389-4512-a852-1ab04b3c83b1", "sentence": "Graduation family weekend. Overall the Tradewinds is a great place for family fun. we have been a few times over the years with groups of families. The beach is very nice and we love having the cabanas and love being able to reserve one the night before for the next day. The rooms are good. We usually get a one bedroom which works well for our family of six. The staff is exceptional. Of note on this trip Mike at the front desk was very personable and helpful during check in and whenever I needed information from the front desk. Also AJ at the Flying Bridge provided excellent service with a friendly attitude during our lunch today. A few negatives we had a large dinner at the Bermuda restaurant. Service was slow and not the quality you had expect from a restaurant like that. The food was good but not as warm as it should have been when served and the cocktails were not good. Wish the room balconies were bigger gulf front and really wish there were more elevators. The seem to run slow jacaranda building at least. Overall a good trip and good resort.

The rooms are a little dated but the beds were very comfortable. The kids activities were enjoyable but the majority required an up charge or were located at the Guy Harvey resort which is about a 5 minute walk. This is not bad but with little children it is like herding cats. It would be beneficial to offer shuttle services to and from during other activities that are taking place and advertised. It is confusing as you must constantly seek your brochure to be aware of what the next activities entail and where they are located. The huge slide was a great addition but the floating park was not available until the day we checked out. The Konk club was small and crowded at times but the staff was very kind and accommodating. Food options in the resort were expensive and only mediocre. Would absolutely recommend Madfish down the street and have a steak.

We booked three one bedroom gulf view suites for a family vacation. The first issue was the rude valet attendant when my son in law was trying to ask where he should park. At check in Bluegren Vacations immediately goes into their sales pitch. Once we all got into our rooms heres what we all thought of the Tradewinds Grand Island. The Good. The property is lovey. Staff is friendly and always held open doors as we approached. Lots of amenities for which you pay 450 per day to keep you busy although most geared towards children. There is miniature golf paddle boats or reserve a cabana and just relax on the beach. The suites are spacious with the bedroom bathroom combination kitchen dining area and living room area. There is a small balcony with a nice view of the water. The Bad. The balcony is only about two feet wide with two chairs and a table making it difficult to move around. During the day the natural light makes the living room area a great place to read play games etc. After dark it is dark even with all the lights turned on. In fact all the rooms are dimly lit. Brighter light bulbs are needed throughout the suite. The bathroom is so dim it is impossible to apply makeup. There is a vanity light but with the low vanity it sits on bending down gets pretty uncomfortable. I finally took the mirror to the dining table where I could sit down to apply my makeup. While the walls seem to be solid concrete the rooms are noisy. Conversations and televisions from the next room are clearly heard through the closed doors connecting the rooms. At 105 AM there was a pounding like someone was banging on a metal pipe. Several people were walking outside their rooms trying to figure out where it was coming from. The front desk sent up security but then in stopped. A dish rag and dish towel are provided in the kitchen but a roll of paper towels would be nice especially if you want to use the microwave to reheat something. Every place I have stayed provides paper towel in their kitchens. The Ugly The shower head needed to be cleaned. It had a lovely green tint all over it. The bathroom that my daughter and her husband had had mismatched tile. Strange looking to say the least. The Restaurants. The Palm Court Italian Grill is good but do not expect to find the usual lasagne spaghetti or ravioli. It is more gourmet with Penne Ale Vodka Gamberi Genovese and Polo Al Marsala. Of course the fancy cuisine comes with a fancy price. Service was excellent. Bermudas Steak Seafood is more tradional with filets prime rib hambergers and coconut shrimp. Our waitress was friendly and took great care of us. However my husband always requests his filet be cooked medium well as he wants only the slightest amount of pink in the middle. We have found most steak restaurants serve their steaks medium rare regardless of what you request. Bermudas does the same. His steak came out with the middle mostly red. Overall we all had a nice time. I do feel that the price of the suites 614 per night before taxes and amenity fees is way overpriced for what we received. This is not what I expected for a 4 star resort.", "offset": [1750, 1802], "date": "2018-03-22", "cpt": "3", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "348bf8df-b5ee-4959-b634-26ca04d7859e", "sentence": "Great Vacation Visit Saltys.
