I am writing this whilst still being a guest for several days to come and I predict that a response to this will probably be quicker than answering a room call or responding to the email reservation request sent 24 hours ago. sadly this is the name of the game for many such businesses keep public perception high and failmiserably on services for guests on site staying. The executive rooms seem again in need of updates even though done a few years ago wonderful treats such as Aromatherapy shampoos etc have been replaced by nasty non existent beauty brands asprey which gives you more of a perfumed rash than cleanse. The lovely In room touches like phone directors in orange wallets spa samples towel art work at night and generally better room service all missing. our room looks like a clawed animal had a go at bedside table and damp spots in shower never nice. It seems now more quick turn and business than leisure so sad that you have to stay here or burj to access executive club pool which is still the best treat on resort if this were not the case of be at Mina al Salem in a flash. I would say without exception the premium leisure lounge you can access with executive club rooms on the ground floor is exceptional fabulous staff who do seem to know what they are doing good welcomes when you consistently return and knowledgable thank goodness. The top floor executive club floor was like faulty towers terrible morning service with Basil who was frankly useless and reception who openly spoke about holiday costs and required payments in front of other guests disgusting. Now onto reservations for restaurants frankly forget it. Not a chance in hell unles you eat at 630 and do not want their popular venues total waste of time if you want to stay on site and enjoy their facilities why on earth guests have no privileged access I do not know. We failed at both Friday lunches on both hotel sites ludicrous. As a loyal guest for years I am loath to say try elsewhere. but it seems this is what we will be doing this week and honestly if someone gives me 5 star service then they have my accommodation business going forward we will update on what we find as I am sure others are tired of high costs high expectations of their holiday and shoddy could not care less service.", "offset": [263, 408], "date": "2015-11-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "91428fb4-e18c-4f5c-a4c5-4a2dcde82bdd", "sentence": "Not as expected. When you think of hotel brands certain expectations come to mind. I had believed that Jumeirah was one of the premier brands at least in the Emirates. Unfortunately this was not the case in my previous stay at Jumeirah Beach hotel. Starting with the hotel entrance. The sheer madness of driving up and being overwhelmed with pure chaos. It appeared that bellmen or valets are not coordinated in assisting guests nor did they have the opportunity to greet or at the very least welcome gusts upon arrival. After passing a line of guests waiting at the concierge or guest services I headed to the front desk where again I had no idea what line to queue in some guests just walked to the desk rudely interrupting others while others were attempting to wait in some sort of line. I have to say this was to set the tone for the rest of the stay. They have a multinational staff at the desk and they attempted to console the masses but a lengthy check in does not help with the chaos at the desk. Please look at this process and renginer the lobby to allow for a pleasant check in or check out. it is not working especially for a 5 star property. I have no problems with the room not being ready especially if the hotel is busy so we decided to walk the property until the room was ready. However we were approached by a stealth like undercover security guard and said that the area were were in was for guests only. I gladly showed him the check in packet and said we are staying it is just that the room was not ready. We were they waved on through. Interesting but again not what I expected. We walked around including the several beach access points passed the health club building which is huge and the marina area. For a hotel that seemed so busy in the lobby the rest of the hotel appeared to be almost vacant. People certainly were not using the beach area. The views of the Burj were amazing and would be one of the highlights of our stay but that should be a plus and the Jumeirah Beach should be able to stand by itself and not need the Burj to draw people in. It was warm outside for November so we decided to talk with the concierge about a few of our plans while we waited for our room. Needless to say the concierge had the same challenge as the front desk. Endless lines and constant interruptions from the rudest possible guests we stood patiently in the line to speak with the concierge for over an hour. Clearly the staff knew it was a problem and when I was finally able to speak with one of the they apologized for the wait and yet I was still interrupted by staff members one had said that her printer was not working and needed the concierge to look at something. Really I am patiently waiting while other rude guests interrupt my conversation to be interrupted again by staff members who do not have the proper equipment to do their job. This is how the guests are treated by Jumeirah staff. I could have stayed at another brand at a significant savings and be treated better. The concierge had noticed that we had no room assigned and during the process of waiting for the computer systems to be able to book Burj Khalifa tour times he advised us that our room was ready. Unfortunately we had to go back to the desk to get the key packet but at least the concierge took that step to let us know it was ready. There was one glimmer of hope in the lobby and i wished that I could recall this staff members name. He had seen what we had gone through and took out luggage receipts and said not to worry that our bags they would be in the room when we arrived. He clearly was not a bellman as he directed them to quickly get the bags. We were to meet this man again in the lobby upon check out and again assisted with directing the staff to get our car. I wish I knew who he was as he was the single staff member at this property that understood what guest service was. He wore the traditional Emirates attire. Onto the room. We had booked a premier ocean with balcony as it was important for us to have the balcony for pictures but needless to say try opening the balcony door it took two of us to get the door open just beyond ridiculous. We unpacked a few things including our chargers for our cameras and found that the desk area had usb charging unfortunately they did not work so we had at least one socket we could use as we had brought our own converter and adapter to use. We left the room to do some sightseeing and returned hours later. The room was turned down however the two sets of drapes were now closed. Well this turned into a nightmare as we could not get the drapes to open. At one of the nightstands are they controls to even the drapes and guess what eye did not work. We called housekeeping and after an hour later someone came and said these buttons will open the drapes hm really. He then remarked. oh it does not appear to be working. After about 20 minutes has was able to get the two sets of drapes to open. But we had to again struggle with getting the door open. The next day we decided to go to the water park next door to the hotel but that was another experience. We returned to the hotel pool area to relax and again it was not very crowded. The staff at the pools really need a lesson in how to act with guests no welcoming pleasantries may I get you a towel nothing. The staff at Jumeirah Beach need to be taught how to be at least pleasant. I should not see a life guard in front of me playing an air guitar with his life buoy. If I wanted to be in Las Vegas I could have saved thousands of dollars and 16 hours in flight time to enjoy a better stay. Unfortunately I have a very bitter taste in my mouth from the Jumeirah Beach Hotel.", "offset": [4551, 4624], "date": "2015-12-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "a621816f-0c5a-4f31-8edb-0190aa2d88f3", "sentence": "Pleasant.

The breakfast buffet at Latitude was also very good lots of choice. We also ate at Beachcombers very nice food and Beach Lounge superb spot on the beach and food was great. The half board also gave us access to other Jumeriah hotel restaurants although we did not visit others hotels. We did eat using our half board at the Noodle house near the fountains display lovely place to eat and watch the display. The waterpark next to the hotel was busy but we had lots of fun the pizza for lunch there was lovely.

Our rooms were not quite ready but by about 11 am we were in the room. The location of the hotel is fantastic I stayed in The Zabel Saray in June which is also a lovely hotel but the location of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel is far better.

We have been coming here for 20 years this was our 15th visit we love the place perfect beach setting nice places to eat and the outlook is fantastic but this trip was not spoiltbut a couple of things that make it special were not there. The house keeping was the main thing. We were picked up from the airport on time in a nice air conditioned car so arriving at the hotel refreshed. Taken right away up to the check in on the 24th floor. we were give a room right away and went to breakfast and it was only 90 after landing at 7 am. All was as it is perfect breakfast for every nationality coffee food and back to the room to unpack. The room even though it must be only 3 years old looked tired tile fallen off the wall in the bathroom. took 3 days to sort. the plastic bag box in the bathroom had fell off and was left on a shelf that was there all week. We had 1 bottle of lotion no mouth wash and just 2 large and 2 small towels normally there are loads we got ready for the beach NO beach bag and No flip flops we rang house keeping for some to be sent up. There was plenty of bottles of water 2 in the bathroom and 2 each at the side of the bed. We went to the executive pool we walked as we needed to stretch our legs but there was no buggies. By the time we got to the pool no buggy either way had passed. We got our seat on the beach and our little cool box full of water and cold towels and lots of ice. Perfect. On returning to the room nothing had changedwe mentioned it to reception about the toiletries and when we went to bed there was a mountain of Toothbrushes and mouthwash thrown on the side that was telling me. We only had a proper turn down service once there was that much water in the room i could of sold it on Ebay. They did not change the water they just kept adding which made me think how long had the water been stood there when we arrived. Such a waste and a silly system 2 in the room is enough if they have not drunk do not replace it. Each time i closed the curtains to help keep the room cool someone came in and opened them the A C did not go lower than 19 so it was very warm in the room at night. On one occasion we waited 40 minutes for a buggy at the night time to take us to dinner and we were late by 15 minutes and the restaurant let our table go we had to wait for a space. All the little things add up when you are only there for a week will we go back YES maybe but looking at all the building work and huge changes it will take to perfect out of the hotel and make it commercialised like most of the others do we want that not really the beach is the only pull at the moment. However all the staff are wonderful Sredhar in the exec bar is outstanding the A C did in the executive bar was rubbish as was in most of the hotel those were the things that let it down the little things. The receptionist in the exec reception was wonderful booking tables buggies and other things for us. There was no buggy to take us to the Burj for dinner so we ended up in a car what has gone wrong. We were told of the renovations they were find it was clean tidy and no noise. It was Ramadan we were catered for we had food and drinks by the pool and yes most of the staff had gone on vacation but it is bad management when they leave them self so sort it affects the running and the standards of the hotel.", "offset": [2958, 3055], "date": "2017-06-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "d6a7d325-4e66-4a6a-af87-c0180dcc84a5", "sentence": "Still Amazing.

You hear minimal noise during the day if you are in the hotel. We booked an ocean club room and was upgraded to a superior club room which was wonderful room 1507 waking up to the Burj every morning was fantastic then seeing the sun go down at night. Fruit wine and dates were in the room on arrival. Breakfast and evening meal in Latitude choice of food was fantastic. Villa Beach Excellent food in a wonderful setting. It was our daughters birthday and we ate at the Burj Al Arab you are able to use the half board vouchers and pay the supplement well worth it to be able to experience this hotel. The JBH arranged for our room to be decorated and cakes sweets left on her birthday. Treats were left every evening for us all. Rooms were kept excellent with turn down service in the evening. Being on club meant you could use the executive pool there you were given towels a cool bag filled with ice and bottles of water and fragrant flannels. Every day fruit kebabs and ice lollies were given out at different times throughout the day. You were also sprayed down with cool water which was wonderful as you lied on your sunbed. You must always wear flip flops as the ground does get very hot same as on the beach. The sea water is like a hot bath but very relaxing and nice if it is windy. Family pool excellent too. Premier Club Lounge was great free soft drinks all day then from 3 5pm afternoon tea choice was very good. 6 8pm was happy hour with canapes and free flowing drinks. Sanjaya Samy Agnelo and Kennedy were just a few of the excellent staff who work so hard in the PCLWe visited the Executive Club Lounge a couple of times on the 24th floor and again the choice was endless Kelvin was really helpful. Lots of free bottled water in your bedroom. Helpful staff on reception Kosta and concierge ShabdanFre shuttle bus to the Mall of the Emirates and from there you can take the metro to the Dubai Mall 8 dirhams return. My hubby and daughter tried the gym out and we all then tried out the spa all good facilities. Visit the uptown bar for excellent views at night. Buggy service is excellent they take you all along the coast right up to the Madinat area so you can enjoy the restaurants there. Right next door to Wild Wadi free towels provided for hotel guests. You can take bottled water in but no food. All staff are very helpful and always have a smile on the face nothing is too much trouble for them. Would definitely return to this hotel.

Wow. They really make you feel special and welcome. We booked the club room so got access to the premium leisure club. What I did n\u2019t realise was that the checkin process we entered the hotel at about 10 am was done in the club while we had breakfast with views over the wild wadi park. The kids got to play in the play room and on he PlayStation games. The room itself was great. We have an 8 and 5 year old so the 5 slept on the corner sofa while the 8 had the pop up bed the hotel gave a second bed too but the sofa was ok for us. Amazing views of the Burj al Arab. Electric centrally controlled curtains and lights. Fantastic shower. Housekeeping was great. Little treats for all of us at turn down chocolates or toys or spa products omg I love a pillow spray nowPremium leisure club was great with afternoon tea at 3 5. The free breakfast that can with the club room could be availed at the main restaurant too. Free valet parking always efficient to get the car. although sometimes very busy at the actual turning circle outside the entrance. All the staff are communicative and serve with a smile whether you tip them or not. They do n\u2019t stand there fishing for tips like in some other places. The beach attendants are so helpful. Bring water and towels and set up stuff where you want. There are lifeguards always on the watch the most attentive I \u2019ve seen. At least one in the water on a canoe as well. The beach is great. Lovely fine whitish sand. Early December the water was cool but enough for me to get in and snorkel but the kids found it cold. Some of the pools were chilly too but the executive pool was lovely and warm. The free access to wild wadi is great. The wave pool is salty and warm and great for kids. The splash play area adjoins the wave pool so the kids loved playing between the two. The rides are so so for 5 and 8 year olds. The only real ride worth it is the jumeirah sceirah which is a bit beyond my two but not me woho. I got to the gym on day 1 fully equipped fitness centre and weights including free weights. table tennis table squash courts. Free bananas and cool wet flannels. Free tote bag really nice one and flip flops varying sizes. I even asked for another tote bag during our stay and they just sent one up no questions askedAs much water as you need and fresh fruit into the room each day. The breakfast at latitude is awesome. Take a bit of getting used to but never much of a wait for eggs or crepes kids loved a Nutela crepe each morning in fact so did I. Indian breakfast stuff there as well as far eastern and Arab or continental. The croissants and pastries were greatWe stayed at another two hotels after this one on this trip and nothing comparesA couple of small things the carpet did n\u2019t smell great in the room they could do with cleaning and my son left the little toy they gave him turn down and they handed it to lost property but the guy in lost property did n\u2019t have a clue and his English was terrible the only person who could n\u2019t communicate in English in the whole hotel. He was a little upset co it was a lovely little soft dolphin but he got over it in a couple of days.

I stayed here with my family for 3 nights half boardkids aged 915 17. We booked two rooms requested them to be together but unfortunately we were given rooms on different sides of the same floor. We stayed in room 103 106. Room 103 had a wonderful view of the Burj Al Arab from the bed. However room 106 was nicer because it was redecorated in 2017. Everything was spotless including the carpet. They had a turndown service where staff would leave either a chocolate or other small gift for you on the bed. It was a nice touchWe ate breakfast at latitude everyday even though you could eat at many other hotels but it was too much effort. the staff at the restaurants and indeed this hotel the other chain hotels were very helpful cheerful polite and welcoming. This makes a big difference. The food was very good and there was a great variety of it. The masala tea was very good. it did not take too long to get a table and if there was a queue someone would come round with orange juices. The grounds are lovely the beach pools were good and we were always able to get sunbeds at any time of the day. The weather in February was variable. we had days where it was cloudy and a bit windy but then other days we had beautiful sunshine and one day it was very hot. We did feel a couple of raindrops in the evening but literally it was like two or three drops of rainThe walkway to the 360 bar is nice because you can get views of the marina and to the other side views of the Burj Khalifa and downtown on a clear day. One evening we dined at Hanaya buffet restaurant at Mina as Salaam and one night at Amala north indian cuisine at the Zabel Saray hotel on the Palm. The Jumeirah Flavours is a great idea because you do not get bored in eating at the same restaurant every night and you get to see the different jumeriah hotels too and can decide where you want to visit next year. Next time we d like to stay at the Zabel Saray which had very opulent decor just like a sultans palace. The food at the Amala was good but we enjoyed the buffet at Hanaya more. My son has a nut allergy which gets noted when you make a reservation. The chef at Hanaya came over to our table and asked my son what he would like to eat and that he would make it for him. We really appreciated this gesture and he was very happy with his special pizaThe Wild wadi water park was smaller than expected but the kids still had a good time. It was extremely busy on their weekend but during the week there were very small queues. It was great that the the hotel allows you to use the water park even on the day you check out. Therefore we were able to make full use of this day too until the evening. The kids also tried out the paddle boarding and the climbing wall activities at the hotel. My daughter and I tried out the spa which was lovely although it was smaller than expected but well set out. All the staff were great but the concierge guys Faroq Zulfiqar were especially nice and helpful to my husband. Im trying to think of a downside and the only criticism i can think of is that the spa gym are too far away from the main hotel and the water sports other activities should be offered throughout the day rather than the restrictive times at present. Yes the hotel is very expensive by the time you have paid for drinks and lunches but its worth a treat. its nice to feel pampered and have some luxury on holiday. Hope to return to JBH or may perhaps try one of their other hotels. We stayed at the Atlantis a couple of years ago and although it is also a lovely hotel and their water park is bigger and better I think the jumeirah flavours package gives it that edge and would convince me to come back here first.

I have been staying here since August 200 and seen this great hotel transform across 18 years I visited in May before they closed for the refurbishment and I could not wait to go back in October to see all of the changes but mainly did the hotel retain the splendour and magic we have experienced on all previous visits. The answer yes yes and yes and more. The new rooms are amazing luxury and homely you would say home from home. I was so relaxed in the rooms we made the most and out of 6 nights took room service for 2 of the nights. Room service was excellent food was great and the set up on delivering the food made me feel like I was in my own private restaurant. The hotel is simply stunning and elegant the lobby and coffee area are wow. The new redesigned restaurant I think renamed Kitchen Connection is really lovely with a lot of live cooking stations new items introduced on breakfast we loved it. To be honest this is a holiday of holidays where the service and attention to detail is impeccable. I was wowed from start to finish The exec pool run by Earl and his amazing team was a haven of tranquility and relaxation. The gym was as always was great I tried PT with Eric and will be reboking him for our Christmas stay. he was brilliant. Babes and Jouda took care of our massages for myself and my daughter I can not tell you how amazing they are. These ladies have magic hands and we come out feeling like new women. Being honest I was worried about the team and service not being the same. but it was most of the same amazing team across the hotel and the pool had a lot of the same team which was great. Sanjev looked after all of our needs at the pool and the service was WOW. I have 5 weeks and 5 days until my next visit and I am counting down the days. If you want luxury amazing service an amazing resort that caters for everyone with amazing weather this is the one for you. To everyone at the hotel thank you for such a great stay.", "offset": [0, 47], "date": "2018-11-11", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "19f5b51b-cfd3-470e-bde6-2d2d596a5d6e", "sentence": "Will be back. Duration of stay 30 Dec \u2013 3 Jan Booking process and check in check out Booked directly with the hotel. Check in in the room after a very early arrival from LHR very smooth indeed. And a big thumbs up for Sarah and the manager at the PLC who granted us an extended late check out as well. BilTransport arrival departure by hotel car a Mercedes luxury van as we had a Club room which includes airport transfers. Very good. Room. our room was on the 18th floor even numbers. Nicely decorated in a neutral luxury hotel style. If you \u2019re looking for a more specific Arabian theme you should probably look into booking a room at one of the Madinat hotels. The room we had did not have the renovated bathroom that is shown on the website but rather the one from the previous renovation. Facilities Executive pool. This is probably one of the main reasons why we book a Club room. This pool is so much more relaxing than the main pool. We saw some familiar staff there. But also a new guy like Leslie provided us with excellent service. PLC as far as we could see there is more seating in the lounge and outside. The club facilities were very quiet. We are used to the mad rush at teatime and cocktail hour in July August but nothing of the sort now. Restaurant meals We used Kitchen Connection for breakfast choosing to sit outside. Our impression that the bigger. inside dining area now slightly resembles a company restaurant. But I think this can be easily remedied by dividing the area into smaller cosier sections without giving up the airy feeling of the place. Breakfast options were ample but our daughter missed the section with the stir fried beef chicken. Gala NYE. I struggled a bit to find information about the gala so I will include some pictures. On arrival at the hotel we went to the events desk to choose our table. Even though many tables were already taken we did manage to find 3 spots at a table in the middle of the event tent. The tables seated 11 people so you have to share a table. On the evening itself you are welcomed in the main lobby and then walk to the event area. Pictures are taken on the way 300 AED per picture delivered to the room. and during the evening. The dinner is buffet style with many options premium products and ingredients. There was live entertainment by DJ Lyndsay and the Pure Show Band. Fireworks were best watched from the beach. Gala times were 200 030 o\u2019clock. Conclusion.

We have stayed at this wonderful hotel many times since the first year it opened. We return because of the superb quality of service provided by the staff. The hotel is an iconic building which has held its own over the years. The pools are beautiful the food always excellent and the range of restaurants is varied. The Club lounge is excellent presided over the very competent Sredar who is an absolute asset to the hotel. The hotel has recently been refurbished. Some of this is beautifully done the lobby for instance but some aspects of the new room refurbs I felt were not as successful. One of the most wonderful aspects of all the rooms at the hotel is the panoramic view of the sea and the Burj al Arab hotel through the large floor to ceiling windows that run the length of the room. New cupboard units have been added which although very attractive cut down the view slightly. I did think this did n\u2019t make the most of one of the most stunning aspects of the room. There is currently building work going on at ground level but we heard very little noise and actually found the progress of the work over our stay rather fascinating.

I stayed in this hotel long ago and it was one of the best hotels so booked again. Received email that they are undergoing the marina repair but they will \u010fo their best to eliminate the effect on the guest. It was the biggest MYSTKE ever that I went with it. Its been just pure horrible. Starting with the view over the massive building site. The contruction is going for 24 hours every day. Its so noisy one can not escape to it even behind closed doors on the balcony which is what one pays premium view and balcony. The beach is poluted by the effect of this construction there is always huge ugly foam swimming in the water and ithe water is very oily. God knows what chemicals are in there. Even though the site is marked with some bartiers one day all that mess leaked to the waters on the hotel beach it was just disquisting. It took more than half day before they started to work on it. Tell you it was really awful. So one would think they can make it up to the guest by spoiling them rotten by service. Vice versa. The room are cleaned so poorly they did not hoover the carpet the whole week unles I asked. Same goes with cleaning the balcony even though there is messy buildIng site right bellow the windows. The products like body cream conditioner etc had to be repeatedly asked as were not provided. Worst was the breakfast. Not only every morning massive que as result of totally understaffed service. Which also means no one is coming and asking if one needs something there were always dirty dishes on the tables. Honestly once one of the best hotel in Dubai went totally down the gutter. The worst to come. They held 3 days Rusdian music festival. They built monstrosity arena for it Right at the beach and before it started these bands were preparing for it for the whole day. The noise of that was just unberable. Laying at the beach was really painful on one end this terrible sound production on the other noice from buldozers. It was like that for 4 days and 3 nights. In the night the concert was so laud that even with closed doors ear plugs and sleeping pills one can not escape. The music was so awful No one warn us from that horid exoerience. At almost USD 1000 night it was really the wors exoerience we ever had.

I stayed at this resort in April and was mostly happy with it. The rooms are large clean and updated. We chose a room with a balcony because the rooms without balconies do nt have windows that can open and this can be very claustrophobic for me. Breakfast is great and the service is good too. The kids absolutely loved the kids club. It is large with tons of fun activities all day long. I would recommend this resort to any person looking for a good fun 5 star family resort. There is direct access to Wild Wadi which is free for all hotel guests. This is a big bonus for families and my kids thoroughly enjoyed daily visits to Wild Wadi. Its convenient and easy to access. There was some construction happening next to the resort but I did nt notice it much. The only down side of this hotel for me was the amount of guests. It is crazy busy and is constantly buzzing. People just everywhere. I prefer a resort slightly calmer. I guess this is a preference but it is something worth mentioning. One tip is to not use the Jumeirah Beach Hotel Spa and to rather go to the Al Qasr spa. it is much better. I would also like to mention the managers Mr DMelo and Mr Hana who went absolutely out of their way to make my stay enjoyable.
