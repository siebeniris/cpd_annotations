Our overall experience at this hotel was was positive. For starters the hotel is pet friendly. They provided two bowls too small for our dog along with a blanket. The staff was very friendly towards us and Magneto. One night after taking Mags out we stayed in the lobby talking to the employees and they also gave him some treats. There is a spot of grass across the street where you can take your pet. The hotel is also located in an convenient area walking distance from a lot of restaurants and stores. One of the main drawbacks to this hotel is that they do not have refrigerators in the rooms. Because we also had wet food for Magneto we had to continue to get ice to refill our ice chest. The hotel stated they did have refrigerators at one point but they were removed.", "offset": [775, 855], "date": "2015-01-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "0294e11d-5bf7-43b7-a707-c97aa09c0a30", "sentence": "Yes but keep in mind. When you find a room here at the trip advisor price of 140 it is definitely a great choice. Newly renovated location is fun Gaslamp is where you wana stay. service is good they think of everything. nice atmosphere. BUT when you are charged 400 for a 150 room you should be very upset. And we even got a twin and not king. As for noise at first we did get a room with a connecting door which was horrible noisy like hell like it was a thin paper and not a door. Strangely a large group of women were shouting and laughing endlessly. Luckily they moved us to a quiet room where we only heard a couple having sex that is ok with me.

The Bristol Hotel is a nice hotel in the center of San Diego. The service staff I thought was outstanding. The valet parking was a little cumbersome but if you call ahead your car will be waiting by the time you arrive in the valet area. The bell hop was polite and efficient. On the negative side the bed was hard and the bed coverings were insufficient for a chilly night. Fortunately for me I had a double so I was able to strip one bed to double up on the bed coverings. The television although a flat screen was subpar it did not have high definition and reception was bad. No visible electrical outlets to charge your devices.

What a great hotel. it is in a safe part of town newly decorated with a restaurant and lounge and within walking distance of Little Italy or Gaslamp or within a block of bus and trolley lines. The Bristol Hotel on First has a trolley line right around the corner a bus line to PETCO on the other side on Broadway and is within a five block walk to Little Italy on the south. The staff must have been trained in nice school because the car valet receptionist and even the maids greet you and are quick to help. I kept leaving things in my SUV that would have elicited eye rolling from most valets but not these guys. The room has the cool look you would expect from a boutique hotel and is surprisingly large. The lounge downstairs and the room service have good menus and are very reasonable in cost. The only downside was room 306 and the other rooms that are on that side of the hotel are a little too close to the trolley line. We were awakened by the trolleys warning honks every 15 minutes. Maybe that is why they provide ear plugs in that room. We still were able to sleep in until 8 so we can not complain but I had advise getting a room near the elevators. Parking is 26 which is normal for the area although you can get better deals at the public lots surrounding the hotel. We really liked this hotel for where it is the vibe of the staff and it is cool looking. large rooms at a reasonable price. we will go back.", "offset": [1014, 1068], "date": "2015-05-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "d6ff2544-7445-4461-a27a-570414639112", "sentence": "Awesome Stay. but a little noisy can not beat the location literaly in the heart of Downtown San Diego everything was walking distance. The Staff was friendly we were greeted with open arms and never hesitated to ask you if you needed any assistance.

To wash my hair I had to get so close the shower control poked me on the rear end. I rolled to the center of the bed and the thermostat did not work so we called downstairs.

One night we came home late from a tour and asked the front desk for a list of recommended restaurants that deliver nearby we were told to use the device in our room which did not work and was taken by an engineer and never returned during our stay.
