It is a beautiful hotel however the staff from top to bottom are horrendous. The first of the many issues we ran into was the lack of communication. We had wanted to book one of their 2 executive suites in the building over a year in advance. We decided to take a week to think about it. It was majorly disappointing that no one reached out to us because during that time they both became booked. But we understand and dealt with it. Another instance we encountered dealt with the lack of communication about how to give our guests the link to our block reservation. I had to go out of my way for months tracking staff down to get the correct information. Come to find out that during this time there was a huge turnover and our account never became formally transferred to anyone. You would think that whoever was in charge of room blocks for the hotel would reach out immediately to clients to let them know the change in staffing. However we understood that this things happens in big companies like this. Fast forward to this past May of 2019. I had contacted our point person to pass out our 9 welcome bags to our guests. She agreed and said she would put a note in our account. When our wedding week came around my mother in law dropped them off and was assured that they would be given out by the manager. A manager who gave her his card. When my husband and I checked in that Friday before our wedding I also verified that the bags had been given out. The desk rep went and checked and said that since he could n\u2019t find any that they must have been handed out. It was the day before our wedding and I did not question him. I should have as not all our guests had arrived. But once again it was the day before our wedding. In the end 2 out of 9 bags were given out and these were only given because we told these guests to ask for them. These bags were well worth over 150 in total and took hours of time to put together. After finding out that this all happened I contacted another manager. He apologized and explained that he would work with those who were to blame to fix this mistake in the future. He also agreed to send us a gift certificate to make up for the hassle and money wasted from their carelessness. It has been almost a month and we have received nothing. I am not surprised at this point. From top to bottom the staff are absolutely terrible and I wish we would have used a different hotel for our wedding after our initial issues.
