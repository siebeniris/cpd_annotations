It \u2019s been about 3 4 years since we \u2019ve stayed at the Sheraton I ca n\u2019t remember why we stopped so we thought we \u2019d give it a go and took the mother in law and booked 2 rooms. We had 2 Park View rooms on the 10th floor both had the club package attached. I must admit I was expecting the club floor room which is a bit bigger higher up and slightly better than normal rooms I was told that \u201c they can now add the club package to all rooms \u201d. In an effort to maximise profits on all the rooms it seems. The windows are not double glazed granted the glass is a little thicker but we had a park view room on Elisabeth Street and it was very noisy. So if you \u2019re a light sleeper forget it. I understand they have spruced up the suites a couple of years ago but the bread and butter rooms are boring and quite dark. Everything is dark brown wood dark carpet and dark black marble in the bathrooms. If anything the rooms were a little tired. Gone is the free water and chocolates with the turndown service in fact gone is the turn down service. When they do the daily room service the bed is made turned downNo free Wi Fi. While other hotels are moving toward offering free Wi Fi for all rooms this hotel charges like a wounded bull for the slowest Internet. Having stayed here before and experienced the executive club in past stays it was a very pleasant place to go have a drink in the evening and a good breakfast in the morning. But it seems gone are the days where \u201c The Executive Club \u201d was that special place where you got that felling that it was a little bit exclusive. They are now catering for the masses. And I mean masses this was like a feeding frenzy at a zoo. You could barely get a seat let alone a drink and some food. Given the circumstances the staff did really well getting everyone served. We wanted to celebrate a family work event so you \u2019d expect in a Five Star Hotel to have The Bar open. Well you would be very very disappointed. The Conservatory Bar is not open till 5 pm on a Saturday this was 1 pm. I asked the staff that were behind the bar who were serving drinks to the restaurant guests why we could n\u2019t be served. No one could give me a straight answer. \u201c We \u2019re just not allowed to serve you \u201d. \u201c You could get a drink in The Gallery Tea Lounge \u201d but there were no seats available. We could also buy drinks in the executive club but our friends were n\u2019t guests of the hotel. We ended up walking down the road to the Swisotel on Market Street with our friends who were staying at the hotel and the bar at this 5 star hotel was openI do n\u2019t think we \u2019l be going back to the Sheraton in a hurry there are better hotels in the city that still give you the those little extras without charging you. that make it feel better than homeIn its effort to maximise profits minimise costs the hotel appears to have lost sight of it best assets the people who stay there its staff.

Many of my close friends and family are loyal SPG members including several VIPs and Lifetime Platinum members and I can assure you that they have either cancelled their bookings at the Sheraton Sydney or have curtailed future plans to book the place.
