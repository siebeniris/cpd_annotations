This was my first trip to the United States. We chose Miami Beach and we chose Fontainebleau because we saw that this is a very famous hotel we saw the movies etc. And for us is important a 5star hotel. The hotel is very huge but for me this is already a factory. The staff is unfriendly like a robot. The hotel knows that they are very famous so they do not have to give more they do not have to care about the guests. The only person who very kind was Omar the bellboy. Thank youWe got a room upgrade because I wrote an e mail to the reservation that this will be a surprise for my friend that we in Fontainbleau go so I think that is why we got a beautiful suite with a beautiful seaview. The suite had a bedroom with balcony a living room and 2 bathrooms. You could not stay on the balcony because it was always very windy. The cleanliness is very very bed. Upon arrival I found the following things the bathroom is disgusting in the shower is mold I had to take a shower in slippers. The water taps are white from water stain around the plugs is brown because of the dirt when I took the plug from its place come a lot of hair from down. The lamps in the bathroom are very dusty the mirror is with fat. In the room there are 2 big lamps on the nigt table. On the lamp shades were a lot of dead bugs. The carpet was not hoovered I found seaweed from the beach on the carpet. The curtain is very dirty. The matrases are also with spots. A housekeeping supervisor was there I had to show everything for her. She was also unfriendly and she apologised like a robot. She said that she will send somebody to clean the room maybe I can stay there and tell her what she has to do. Sorry this is not my work if they do not see what is dirty this can be a very big problem. The next days everything was the same they did not clean the shower they did not hoover we got a dirty bed sheet with holes on it. We got a turn down service on the first night the next day not the reception told me that I can request it. Then I called the housekeeping the woman was very rude and she did not send anybody. The public areas are the same on the floor were fries for 2 days. The carpet is also very dirty etc. They housekeeping needs development. Another thing that I asked from the reception and from the housekeeper if I can buy a bathrobe which is in the room. The answer was sorry but these are only in the rooms. Upon check in when we were waiting for the taxi we talked with a bellboy I asked from him the bathrobes he said that we can buy it in the spa. It was too late I couldt go back because we had to go to the airport. I am very sad Now I am back to Europe how can I get a bathrobe. This was also unprofessional that I did not get a correct answer.

Save your money. I have stayed here at least 4 times prior to this visit and always the same week. This was an awful experience from the time we checked in. Usually stay in Tresor but wound up in Sorento with a suite. View beautiful room worn and musty. We saw cockroaches everyday in this room. Disgusting. Notified housekeeping which all calls were ignored. Could n\u2019t change room as we were informed the hotel was sold out. Kept all of our belongings zipped up in our suitcases. We tried to get chairs at the pool but all were reserved so decided to go to the beach and reserve the beach bed with two lounge chairs. We paid the supposed rate at 1030am and at 115 some spring break girls decided to take the bed and chairs next to us when they were approached by the beach cabana staff they were quoted a price less than half of what we paid 45 minutes prior. When I approached the staff about this the answer was \u201d as the day goes on the pricing changes \u201d. No kidding. but not 45 minutes later. I guess the price gouging goes by what they THINK SOMEONE WILL PAY BASED ON THEIR APPEARANCE. Next we ordered club sodas a few drinks and a light lunch. Club sodas took 1 hour and 45 minutes to receive after I complained 3 times about the wait. We wound up cancelling lunch because it was after 20 pm and still no food which was a good 2 12 hours after ordering. Insane. No apologies nothing but excuses. I went up to the desk at the beach hut and said I wanted to speak to a manager about our lack of service price gouging etc and they apologized and said they would give us a free beach cabana the next day. So we left and went to get lunch and drinks. Later that night about 110pm to be exact I have pounding on my room door with a young man screaming and pounding. He left after a few moments. I did n\u2019t acknowledge or answer because he obviously had the wrong room. Well this continued on and off til 130 am by the same guy. I called the front desk when he came back a 2 nd time and they said they would notify security. Security did NOT come. The 3 rd time I asked to be directly connected with security and was told that they never received a call. So I asked them to come up. This went on 3 more times that evening with SECURITY NEVER COMING UP TO MY ROOM. I Complained to the VIP desk the next morning and said I wanted to speak to the hotel manager Michael. They assured me he would contact me within a few hours. NEVER DID. I called myself to speak to him 3 other times that day never heard a word. On the morning of checkout I had a family emergency and had to leave a lot earlier than expected packed up and left by 90 am. The bell hop helped me down to my car. Being in a rush I realized I left a few items in a drawer unfortunately the only items I had taken out of my suitcase the whole time which is why I forgot them. So within an hour of leaving I called the hotel to ask if they could get them and I would arrange them being sent home for me. Of course I was told they were n\u2019t there. And they also said housekeeping had n\u2019t been in the room yet. So now my new sneakers and a necklace I had purchased in the hotel the night before were missing. Just the icing on the cake of this awful long weekend. Spoke to security people and were told they would investigate. Yeah. yeah. yeah. I have heard nothing in a month. American Express refunded me the money I spent on the necklace thank goodness. My husband and I have made 11 calls to the hotel manager since that day and have yet to be contacted by anyone.

When you plan a trip for nearly 2 years and everything is set up the last thing you would expect to ruin the holiday would be a so called 5 star hotel. A big group of us had rooms booked and all pre paid back in January 2019. We get to the hotel they ca n\u2019t find our reservations. when they finally do it takes about an hour to check us all in. We get into the rooms to find one of the rooms has a double bed when we have booked twin bed rooms. We ring to sort it out they tell us they will look into it we never heard back. We were so fed up with the general customer service so we did n\u2019t even bother chasing it up. We went to celebrate a friends 40th so we decided to book a vip table at club Liv. first we are told it 300 dollars so we book turn up on Friday night they tell they ca n\u2019t find our booking but can get us another table for 360 plus taxes. So late notice and with no back up plan we agree to pay it we make the payment go in and then we are told they found our original booking no offer of a refund though how unprofessional. Go to the beach we ask for some sun loungers and we are asked for our rooms details 5 times before are given towels for the loungers clearly the wristbands did n\u2019t mean anything. When we asked for the umbrella to be put up we were told it would be an additional 20 dollars. Decided to head back to the pool instead and we ca n\u2019t get any sun loungers they are all taken I do n\u2019t see any wristbands on most of the people using them however. We had total of 7 rooms booked and we were not able to make most of the facilities without paying extra. A bottle of water in the room was 10 dollars. Sat. In the lobby one of my friends leg was hurting so he put it up on the sofa while we sat there security came straight over to tell him to put his foot down. I did n\u2019t see security approach the vast majority of people smoking weed in the lobby the pool the club and even the lifts the height of double standards. Luckily we did n\u2019t have any children in our party but this was all going on in open view other young children. Pool side was almost like a gentleman \u2019s club in water no rules or dress code about what is acceptable and not acceptable swimwear men throwing dollar bills in the air and women running around to catch them. I just dread to think what families with children who were staying there at this time were thinking. I actually recorded this on video it was disgusting. There was originally 12 in our party but we had a late addition to our group so instead of just trying to let the extra person share a room we already had we did the right thing and booked an extra room we were quoted a set price at the time of checking in so we booked the additional room when it came to check out the room was charged over double what was agreed. They said that we should have been told day rates differ and go up around Memorial Day weekend we were n\u2019t told this at the time of booking we disputed the rate and they said they would fully investigate and until it was sorted out they would not charge us for the room. I spoke to a lady called Lavendor at check out and she promised there would be a thorough investigation and I would get an email to confirm the booking would be left open until the matter is resolved. Not only have I not had an email the credit card has been charge as well. You almost could n\u2019t make this up. Finally we get to check out most of the rooms are wrongly charged for items and when questioned by us they quickly said sorry that was an error and take the cost off like they were just trying it on to see if they could get away with it. I have never experienced such unprofessional behaviour from staff at a hotel such as Fontainebleau that claims to be so good. All these matters have yet to be addressed by the hotel management even though they know issues are outstanding.

This hotel was everything but our experience last weekend would give anyone a putrid feeling. Read this review to gain perspective on how relying on a historic reputation combined with eroding what could be a lovely hotel with extreme monetizing all while staffing people who express no desire to help through obfuscation and sarcasm will get you what Fountainebleau has become a total ripof. let us break it down1. CHECK IN We arrived to a check in line that was a block or two long literally. With a lobby full of people laying on their luggage it looked like we were in a disaster relief shelter. After standing in line for an hour or we find out that their system is down and they were checking people in manually. What this meant was we waited in line only to give them our name and cellular number and wait for them to call us when the room is ready. We waited over six hours. They only allowed us one room key. This problem started no later than Jan 13th and lasted through Jan 20th which also meant there was not internet and cash only throughout the hotel and Fountainebleau refugees hanging in the lobby each afternoon. Not a pleasant experience2. THE ROOM. The room was unacceptable for ANY hotel. We were promised a King bed and got two double queen. The was not vacuumed and had food crumbs. Artwork had been ripped off the wall and not replaced. There were claw marks all over the headboard as if some had been shooting an unsavory film in there or several. We had to call to get our room serviced and it took them three days to clear out our glasses plates and garbage we had neatly stacked for removal. Basically they made the beds and threw fresh towels in the bathroom. Each morning at about 4 am we were awakened by the valets and security below our window yelling at cars as they direct traffic and club goers this was objectionably loud. One or two of these would suck but when you add them up it was just not what anyone would expect from the Fountainebleau. 3. THE POOL. If you make the mistake of staying at the Fountainebleau and head to the pool have your room key ready. The pool security impersonally steps in front of you and signals with their hand they need to see your key. No Hello No Welcome to the pool Just a big body move like they are bouncing at some strip club. The pool is expansive but venture to the most secluded parts and you are still subjected to pounding house music from their anemic pool party. It is not just music you get periodic sirens horns and yelling from the DJ. Go to Niki Beach for a fun day party4. THE STAFF READ THIS. The difference between nice hotel and a top notch hotel is the staff. The Fountainebleaus staff was the real failure of the weekend. I know they were dealing with a computer system meltdown but they themselves totally melted down. There was no accountability as they would periodically say There is nothing I can do. It got so bad that management started hiding seriously. Rather than step up when there is a problem in an effort to get the guests the best experience under the circumstances they skirted responsibility to the point where by the end of the weekend there were hardly any staff to be found. It was surreal. At one point I went to the concierge desk and asked to speak to a manager. Irina told me there was not a manager available. I told her there were a few issues I wanted to speak to someone about beyond the computer system issues. That is when Irina said Well there is nothing I can do for you so you can save your speech for someone else. I was totally shocked obviously not expecting to hear that. I approached in polite and empathetic way and was totally disrespected. Their patience had clearly waned to the point where they were just being snide and sarcastic to everyone. Regie on the beach was super cool they need more of him. THE FOOD These restaurants deserve their own reviews but I will keep this short. El Cote is swimming pool snack bar quality food with michelin star prices. You will get limp fish on a soggy bun with average french fries. Hakasun should be called Hack asun its a total fraud. You get Panda Express fried rice with truffle sprinkled in. There seemed to be an inverse correlation between item price and portion size. The Pizza and Burger by Michael Mina does not take orders over the phone. I am not talking room service. I mean we called the place and told them we wanted them to start a pie for me to come pick up. I even offered to put down a CC. They told me I had to come down to place the order in person and wait for it to be done. There is not another pizza place in the USA that will not take an order over the phone for pick up. If there is I will not go out of principle. Scarpeta was the saving grace. It was truly great. In summary DO NOT STAY HERE. It is a historic hotel that is now run by people who is only interest is their new investors not your experience. The Fountainebleau has endured tragedy and change of management but the changes have clearly been strictly for profit and at the cost of the patrons experience. The Fountainebleau considers itself premium but does not deliver premium accommodations nor a professional staff. Putting Liv nightclub in basement and shaving truffle on the fries will not keep this place classy. It takes a passionate approach to the guests. This hotel is bereft of any of those memorable details. If you have heard this place is nice it is not. If you are nostalgic and want to stay here again your memories will be ruined by a deteriorated standard.

I immediately walked downstairs at 145 pm to the Tresor desk and was told someone would clean right away. 1245 am. No one came to room so I went back downstairs and demanded to be moved. I was told there were no more rooms. 110 am Sat morning. A housekeeper came to the room. I wanted to hurry and get the room done and I felt bad for the housekeeper so actually helped by cleaning the toilet as in all the stains bathroom counters and the bathroom floor myself. I even gave the housekeeper 20 because it was so late in the night. She did not have a vacuum so the crushed food remained on the carpet. About 40 pm Sunday. My girlfriend and daughter were showering to get ready to go to Wynwod for pics while there was still daylight. I think it was hotel manager Alfred Reynoso who came to both rooms to tell us we had to move rooms that night because of some conference. On a separate note to hotel management maybe do n\u2019t go into rooms unles you know who is in them my teenage daughter was alone and going to the bathroom when she heard a man \u2019s voice in the room. That really scared her. We were told a bellman would come at 445 to move us. Because of the whole moving our rooms we had to ditch to Wynwod trip. I was afraid we might wind up with no rooms that night. I called Alfred \u2019s direct line multiple times with no answer during all of this. 515 pm Sunday.

The hotel staf apologetic that the service would be slow because systems were down we also could n\u2019t charge anything to our rooms. It took over an hour to get a drink at the pool. Worse was when staff confided their fears about how they would get paid as there was no way to document their time worked. We had heard the system issues started on the Thursday prior to our arrival. It would have been good to hear from a resort representative about the potential issues. At no time was any information posted anywhere on their website about this. The hotel obviously had no back up plan at all as to what to do or how to handle a situation like this. Am I wrong to think that an organization has a plan B if the computers goes down. An algorithm to dispatch help and communication to those affected. This is no Holiday Inn. We choose the hotel based on its reputation exclusiveness and reviews read right here on TA. The price we paid was not inexpensive. I think the Holiday Inn or other chain may have a better back up plan given that it is a larger hotel chain with better IT resources.

This is a long review so let me just start with the gist Fontainebleau did Everything possible to ruin our weekend. I urge you to stay at Loews or the ritz where you will be treated with the care and attention you deserveI have never experienced such a discrepancy between price and quality of service. From the resort fee to the mandatory Valet parking fee 50 night to the EV charging fee 25 to the umbrella fee 25 day to the service charge added to every bill plus 18 Gratuity I expect and deserve excellence. Unfortunately all we got was our patience tested at every turn. Staff is unfriendly uninspired uncaring and worst of all unapologetic. Room was very average no different from a Mariot or Hilton but with some glaring differences the room is trapped by money grabbing schemes. Their Policy about the in room fridge was laughable. If you use the fridge there was a charge. Having no coffee machine is an obvious tactic to spend money at their cafe which in itself is not terrible but the 30 minute lineup and atrocious service at the caf\u00e9 makes it unbearable not to mention. We called for wine glasses and a bottle opener to enjoy a bottle of wine on valentines and only received an opener after 90 minutes with no glasses. I \u2019m assuming they were less then motivated to have us open our own bottle. As for the 75 night 25 extra to charge our Tesla we shelled out for Valet well that was even more unbearable. On both of the times we left the resort. We used Automated service for Valet from the room was used about 20mins prior to arriving at the pickup area we were told we had to wait in line anyways another 20 mins. was then told that \u201c the order never came in \u201d and we waited an additional 20. At 50 a night the wait was 1 hour for such a simple task. If the hotel is this incompetent then let us park the car and retrieve it ourselves. As far as service from their Concierge desk we Asked for a recommendation to watch the NBA All Star events and he of course recommended a restaurant on property. So not wanting to deal with the Valet again we went for it. guess what. unfortunately they \u201c were n\u2019t taking any walk ins reservations only \u201d. Frustrated we went back to the concierge who only then decided to make the reservation. Absolutely no initiative or foresight and to top it off the restaurant had over a dozen empty tables available for the entire 2 hrs we were there. So this was either poor restaurant management to turn us away a policy to try to get us to eat elsewhere or just downright incompetence. The 11 pools is a front over half are small hot tube size swim areas. Did I mention the views you get to enjoy the day five rows deep looking at the back of a plastic lounge chair. If you want services you have to track down a server who will then come back to take your order 45mins later. tack on another 45mins to 1 hour to get your food. When we mentioned the wait times to our waitress her response was it usually takes up to 2 hours to get food. How silly of us to order food when we were hungry. Things are even worse at the beach. Not only does food take forever if you could even find a server unles you pay 250 to be in the first row cabanas your chairs are parked directly behind them with your view 100 obstructed. By the afternoon chairs are crammed so tightly in my son barely had room to build a Sandcastle. How was check out. First they never asked me how my stay was which was disappointing because I was going to be truthful and tell them everything I am writing here. I requested a key to the refresh lounge which was a nice facility only to have the incompetent checkout clerk give me one for the women \u2019s that was unable to be used for the men \u2019s. So my husband had to come back in wet beach clothes stand in line for 35 minutes to speak with the front desk clerk to get another card. It was clear when we were checking out that we were three people staying both male and female so for her not to offer cards for both genders does n\u2019t make sense. In summary do n\u2019t be fooled by the reputation. This hotel is beautiful scam and I highly recommend staying at the ritz or Loews.
