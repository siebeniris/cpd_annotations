This hotel had a lot of great facilities for children. the sail boats water sports water park was great and the staff on the beach providing activities were good friendly and helpful. The Novatau staff were also very friendly accommodating to families the chef was great and food good. The other team members were very unfriendly and impersonal. As a platinum member I was treated poorly from check in to check during services at the bars and food areas. The staff were unprofessional and treated my membership as a burden when I requested my 15 off etc. The teams behind the bar were slow and untrained. As well as this my opinion is that if a platinum member goes to order food regardless of which food outlet they choose to use the 50 off should still apply. On check in I asked if they had managed to upgrade my room they looked at me blankly and said you have a good room why would we upgrade you. Made me feel like I was greedy. Well every other acor hotel offers an upgrade where possible for platinum members. I think staff need to be trained better they need to understand the definition of hospitality.

A special mention to GOPI for his friendly professional and bubbly personality during our stay. Overall the staff were great at the Aqua bar pool bar breakfast ca nt complain at all.

Aqua bar awesome place only minor thing would be. extend the happy hour to at least 3 pm 5 pm and instead of having 2 beers only on happy hour tap have a standard price and keep it for all on tap beers. The reason for the 2 hours extension is that on a few occasions the line was long with people ordering cocktails which take a while to make so you basically spending time in the line and only end up getting like 1 drink during that hour4 Loved the mini golf however the grass should be maintained better much much shorter. it was enjoyable but not 100 due to the grass been abit long at some places or artificial grass would be an awesome idea thus you would not have to maintain at al5 BQ area was good however we had to clean it before use as people that used it prior to us left it as is.

Not as good as last timeThe food was a bit average. Smoked salmon was clagy and taste was overpowered the pastries were too thick the coffee the first 3 days was lovely then the last morning was horrible tasting burnt and dry. The staff were lovely especially the breakfast staff also the bar manager ran and tidy set up and was patiently teaching 2 staff. Our my drinks package was frustrating as pre paid which is fine but not only did we book that day we still had to go through it again twice to bat staff then wait while tacky wrist bands were handwritten on then stuck to us. Not classy at all. Then they did not have ingredients for first drink. Meaning it took over 15 minutes to get a drink with no others waiting there. Also we thought we had to buy two but given my husband bought almost all of the drinks we should have used the second a different night or just bought the one perhapsThe day spa was just next level bad. I arrived a couple of minutes early and was greeted then asked to fill a form this just writing all my details again but not to advise of reason for massage ie Feeling stressed or a little tight in the neck etc it was for promotional material to be sent. After filling in form I am now in my appointment time however both staff continue to talk on the telephone in the office. I walk the form in and it is taken while continuing on the phone. Then staff comes to take me to room and said my name incorrectly when I asked why she did not look at the form she looked blank and said she would while I get undressed. Made me feel like just another dollar and just another job. I then disrobed and climbed onto a high cheap wooden table awkwardly. There was no arm rests or cutouts for them which was a little uncomfortable. Then found lipstick and eye shadow and long red hair strands on my face towel and asked if she would mind please changing it. She told me that is the managers job and she obviously is still getting the hang of it all as she is new. I asked if she has been doing deep tissue long as that is what I booked in for. She said she is not a masuce and does more of a Swedish type massage. When I asked what a Swedish massage was she said basically like a relaxation massage but that she can do deeper so it is kind of a deep tissue massage. By this stage she was trying to go deeper but started doing a painful and uncomfortable move which I asked what is that. And she said it is Called the muscle flick. I said it is horrible and I am unsure if she knows what she is doing. she said she can try bamboo massage but I said your not doing what you should be with your hands so I am not confident you should do stuff with bamboo to me. She started to try to rub my neck but was grinding my collar bones quite painfully so I said we need to stop as it is really quite awful and I have never had to ask someone I am paying for a massage to stop. the experience left me upset as that was a highlight last time. I used the day spa for a few long appointments and loved it and the staff and intended to spend up a bit as it had been 2 years since our last getaway and we grown all our own food meat fruit veg the lot so it is a rewarding but physically demanding life. Nice if your break is all that you dream of and as good as the last time. Lastly maintenance staff were friendly but tried to convince us that changing Chanel would suffice when the remote would not change volume or turn off. Complained the only other thing he could possible do is change the to over. to which I replied that a remove the does not change volume or turn off is not good enough and changing to is not a big job and I am surely there are plenty of spares around. he changed the tv. should not have had to push the point though. Bar fridge was very noisy. Housekeeping staff were both friendly and did a wonderful job. Were fast unintrusive and polite. Rubbish. I collected a few handfuls of rubbish fro the garden beds. could not walk past it 5 times a day and not be annoyed. Some of it was around the restraint where staff are going past very regularly. This was disappointing as it gave a really shabby feel to the place. The you walk to the Sebel and there is nothing and the gardens are so tidy. Reception staff great friendly did not have kids prize bags ready and more waiting even though this was a feature of the stay and we were checked in already. Just being organised is appreciated and these things and the waiting are annoying after long travel to get there.

The downside unfortunately was the rooms. They left a lot to be desired and for the price I was paying I had expected more especially compared to what I could get elsewhere. In particular there were 3 things that annoyed me most about my room. They were 1. A broken powerpoint 2. No lights directly above the bed and chair desk opposite the bed. Late at night it was hard to see and read write here and I was so surprised that all the lights were near the entrance and the bathroom. for the price I was paying I thought there would be a light over the bed and desk at the end as well. Finally 3. I paid for a lagoon view but my particular room was on a ground floor and only really had a partial view and not as much as I expected. Maybe calling it a partial view might have been a better description of it. In comparison my experiences on the Gold Coast have been vastly different. there I pay extra for a water view and get clear views from high up looking directly over the beautiful beaches with very few obstructions if any. Maybe I have just been spoilt there but I pay similar money for the places I have stayed on the Gold Coast and so had expected more here. However on the upside the customer service experience was amazing and I can not write enough good words about that. Every single staff member I came into contact with from the reception to the restaurants to the coffee stands to the room service to any other staff I spoke and every single one of them was fantastic. In fact it was a case of great and greater. Every staff member was great and a few of them were even extra great. They all treated me and the people I was with as if we were all their best friend and they were happy to see us. Their kindness understanding helpfulness and more was wonderful to see. It really felt like I was talking to a best friend because they all treated me that way and I was very grateful for that. This level of service also helped me overlook the shortcomings of my room because the staff were being so nice to me and I was having too much fun staying at the Novotel. I should also add that the location outside of the rooms was beautiful and the food was absolutely delicious as well. In particular there were a few staff members that really stood out for me and unfortunately I can not remember most of their names but wish I could. The first is whichever guy was working reception in the early hours of Saturday morning when I came to check in. I was running very late and so did not make it there until the early hours of the morning just before the sun came up on Saturday. That was no issue for the guy who helped me at reception though. He was so friendly and so full of energy even though it was like 4 or 5 am in the morning. I was like wow this is cool. Not only did he check me in but because I was late and unsure of my surroundings he helped answer all the questions I had and never made me feel unwelcome. Instead he smiled and answered everything I wanted to know. He also went out of his way to help me with maps and since it was still dark gave me some extra directions to make finding the carpark near my room easier since I would not have the benefit of daylight to see it better. Even though I was running very late he put me at ease and that started my stay off on a really good note. Secondly I ended up getting room service for dinner most nights and throughout the week there was one guy and one lady who always used to deliver it and both of them were great. They were always smiling so friendly easy to talk to and I enjoyed saying hello to them every time I saw them. I have had experiences at other hotels where sometimes the room service staff look like they would rather be somewhere else and it is a bit inconvenient for them to be delivering to you. However the two staff who always delivered my food were the exact opposite and it seemed they loved what they were doing because they were all smiles. Something they probably did not know is that the workshop I was at during that week was actually a very intensive workshop it was quite difficult at times and I did not get a chance to get much sleep either. As a result sometimes come dinner time I was just exhausted and wanted to relax. Having my food delivered to me by really friendly staff who I could have a nice chat to really lifted my spirits and improved my mood. That nice experience followed by some delicious food allowed me to end my days on a good note and give me the energy to go again the next day. So unfortunately I also can not remember either of their names sorry. but they were both great and I really appreciated how friendly they were. Finally I could not leave some feedback without pointing out a few members of the restaurant staff who were also fantastic. For the majority of the week all my meals were eaten in either Nouveau or the room that was setup for us outside the conference room. Every single meal was delicious the buffets had a wonderful variety of food and all the staff here were so cool as well. In particular I had like to say a huge thanks to Natalya who in my opinion went above and beyond. She was extremely friendly and anytime I had a question she was happy to answer it. Also a few times where certain things were not available eg drinks etc. she would help direct me to one of the other food places in the resort that she knew could sell them to me. Furthermore once I asked her something she did not know the answer to and she actually took the time to go ask for me. She did not have to do that she could have just said she did not know and referred me to someone else. However she did not instead she took the time to go find out for me and came back to let me know. In my opinion this felt like she was going beyond the call of duty going the extra mile for me and so I was very happy about it and really appreciated it. Also if I did ask for something the restaurant did not have I also liked that instead of just saying we do not have that canot do that where possible she would offer me an alternative. That was cool as well and was very helpful. So a big thanks to her. And lastly I am not sure if I remember her name properly but I think it was Alesha sorry if I spelt it wrong. I saw her at Nouveau as well and like Natalya she was incredibly friendly and very helpful. If we had any questions about the food or options or where we could sit or anything like that she would always answer them to the best of her ability and with a smile on her face. Again like I said earlier it just felt like we were talking to one of our best friends because she was so friendly and it was things like this that just made the whole stay there so enjoyable and even when the workshop we were attending got difficult and stressful just being able to go eat afterwards and be served by such wonderful staff really lifted our spirits again and made us feel better. So overall I loved my time at the Novotel. Not because of the rooms because they left a lot to be desired. Instead it was 100 because of the amazing staff who basically gave us all a world class customer service experience and so a result I will be back. Not for the rooms of course unles they get some upgrades. Instead I will be back just for the beautiful location and the wonderful customer service experience I know will await when I do return. So thank you very much to all the awesome staff who work there. you are all amazing and you made my stay and the stay of a few other people I know such a wonderful experience and we are all very grateful for it. I wish all of you all the best in the future and thank you again very much for everything you did for all of us. Have a great day.

We have booked through Brooke also on previous occasions and she is amazing to say the least. We also ran into the Manager of Novotel Twin Waters at the coffee shop and he showed warmth and sincerity towards us and inquired about how we were finding our stay. He is a wonderful individual and what an asset for Novotel Twin Waters.

Very fond memories of staying at Twin Waters over the last at least 10 years. had not been for 3 years so was keen to return. Had been issues previously with attitudes of some staff which had left a bad taste hence the 3 year break. Was excited to enter the lobby and see the lovely renovations. Had been in contact with of the great staff in Paul and Gopi befoe arriving. Was served by Brooke at the front desk. No smile and not welcoming. Introduced myself and that it is been a while. And what did Brooke say. Oh I remember you. you are the one who always came to me with complaints. Why would she say that. I was shocked. Where was the smile and lovely welcome back. The thank you for your loyalty as a Platinum member. No all I got was bad attitude and a look of I do not want to talk to you. And sadly that welcome set a very bad tone for the entire stay. Yes there were some highlights. Lovely room. Great to see Semi at the activities desk Lovely helpful fellow. And met the new young chef Adam. Also very helpful. But the over riding tone of the stay was set by Brooke. Why does she actually work on the front desk. No pleasant customer skills there. And the other thing was that she is known for her behaviour and attitude by others staff in the resort. So it was sad to see nothing has changed with the attitudes of some of the staff. And that will continue to be a factor in any decision to return.", "offset": [339, 415], "date": "2019-11-21 21:34:35", "cpt": "3", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 37, "uid": "bc62fc70-4d6c-4703-954a-947c7ead9226", "sentence": "Good.
