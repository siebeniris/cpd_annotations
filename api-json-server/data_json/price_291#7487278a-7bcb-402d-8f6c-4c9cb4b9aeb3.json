The buffet breakfast has a huge selection and great quality. could not have asked for better location for a first time visit to Berlin.

The Ritz Carlton Berlin is a splendid property located in Potsdamer Platz Berlin. Arriving in the grand lobby and checking into our superior room I was glad to be welcomed by the traditionally luxurious interior d\u00e9cor. The Superior Room accommodation is relatively spacious with a beautiful marble bathroom. Toiletry amenities are provided by Asprey as of July 2014. The shower leaked into the centre of the bathroom with a significant amount of water that could not be dried up with only the use of the floor towel. Apparently the sloping gradient of the shower was incorrectly constructed so a large portion of water did not runoff into the drain properly this was quite unpleasant. Please note this room 828. Staying in the hotel during July it was considerably hot outside the air conditioning system is not powerful enough to maintain very cool temperatures in standard guest rooms in such weather conditions. It was comfortable but slightly warmish for sleeping. The complimentary wifi was slow and I hence paid for high speed wifi which was exceptionally fast especially for Europe. Fine dining lunch and dinner in Brasserie Desbroses is absolutely excellent the dishes are to the finest quality with the purest ingredients and service is very attentive. As we had a package we had breakfast included in Brasserie Desbroses. There was a wide selection of international dishes and the food was of a high quality. The restaurant was unpleasantly crowded and very loud during breakfast unusual for most high end hotels in Europe. I wanted a bowl for my dish and could not find any on display not even by the cereal area I asked a member of staff who reluctantly went into the kitchen to get a stack of bowls as there were apparently none stocked up in the buffet area. Some waiters were very courteous and busily hard at work while some were slacking off and serving customers rudely it is clear that the hotel needs to address the discrepancy in attitude across their restaurant staff in order to rival the breakfast experience offered in other five star hotels in Europe. It should also be noted that is was not possible to have a green tea at breakfast on request and it seemed only English breakfast tea could be obtained. The Curtain Club bar has a very nice atmosphere and the staff is very polite and attentive. It was a nice touch to have two complimentary glasses of champagne here that the receptionist gave coupons for when we checked in. The hotel is located in Potzdamer Platz which is a considerably good location in downtown Berlin in close vicinity to the Sony centre and many restaurants and shops. The hotel is literally right next to Bahnhof Potsdamer Platz and is a 10minute walk from the Brandenburger Tor and the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. In summation the Ritz Carlton Berlin is a very good hotel with a convenient location excellent fine dining and luxuriously appointed accommodation. It is only noticeably topped off by the Adlon Kempinski and its hallmark location. The hotel is not too expensive for standard room accommodation and we paid approximately EU28 per night with breakfast in summer. The hotel room tour video can be seen on my YouTube channel. clasified978Fel free to look at the enclosed photographs nevertheless they may tend to make hotels look better than they appear in real life.

We were originally staying at another hotel in another area of Berlin. One day we were exploring the Potsdamer Platz area and had read a couple of reviews for Fragrances without realizing it was in this Ritz we walked over to check it out. Apparently summer is the low season so Fragrances was only open on weekends but we spent a couple of hours at the Curtain Club the main bar here and had such a wonderful time that we decided to switch hotels. The cocktail menu is truly top notch and enormous and they were able to give us a simulated Fragrances experience as well using a tray of perfumes. Over the 5 nights that we stayed at the hotel we spent a lot of time at the Curtain Club and the staff were truly wonderful. I want to particularly thank Juan and Martin for their excellent attention and mastery of their craft. I think it was Fred has a tall build reminiscent of Michael Phelps who provided unusually great table service including really caring attention to our children. Even if you are not staying at the hotel the Curtain Club is a great cocktailing destination. The service experience overall at the hotel was extraordinary. The most obvious example I was in the room with my 3year old for a few hours and thought it would be fun to do some puzzles so I called guest services to ask if they had any. Without hesitation they said yes and said they would bring them up. We waited a bit and it was taking longer than expected. when Lina finally knocked on the door it appears she had gone out and bought. a couple of new puzzles put them in a nice gift bag and hand wrote a note to my daughter. I would not count on them doing that every time boy could that be abused but it was a delightful surprise this time. As for the hotel facilities themselves the rooms and bathrooms were quite spacious comfortable and well thought out. We always had smiles on our faces when we returned to the hotel after a long day of exploring the city. The restaurant Desbroses is not formal elegant it is a relaxed French brasserie style but a very pleasant space with a nice patio in the rear that is enjoyable in the afternoon. The food was quite good probably not a destination restaurant but reliably good if you decide to eat in I particularly enjoyed their salmon troutI saw a couple of reviews here complaining that the breakfast was buffet style. indeed that is true but there were plenty of servers happy to help bring things to you including if you want to eat in the adjacent Curtain Club. so I do not see how this is a problem. There is a pool but this is an urban hotel so the pool is small and in the basement kind of bad chi despite the starry ceiling. so it felt a bit like they were checking a box. But indeed if you are desperate for a pool it is there. I do not hold this against themFinaly we were pleasantly surprised by the price I did hear that summer is lower season but even so the value seems truly great certainly much better than any of the Ritzs in our home city. After 5 nights including some meals and cocktails our total bill was not small but it felt worth every penny. Whenever we may return to Berlin there is no question we will stay there again.", "offset": [2955, 3175], "date": "2015-07-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "46f4ad1a-51c4-4bb1-9f80-734a592b0f80", "sentence": "Ritzy.

The bed is very comfortable though. I basically live in hotels when I work and when you stay about 200 nights a year in hotels you get picky. Another thing about The Ritz is you do nt get lounge access like you do at Mariot properties. You may think you are at a Mariot property because they are affiliated with Mariot but when you ask about the lounge the front desk says we have to pay extra. do not get me wrong this hotel is very nicely located and the concierge is great. Just when you think you get all the benefits of being a part of Mariot as a Platinum member you do nt. That being said this hotel is nice but if you are a Platinum member I would recommend going to the Mariot that is literally across the street so you get all the benefits of being a Platinum.", "offset": [629, 787], "date": "2017-03-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "price"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "16644c7b-a3b4-46b4-ad9a-64c96b527c97", "sentence": "Blitz not Ritz.

I have also stayed in a corner Room and a Potsdamer Platz View Room both were excellent with comfortable Beds and were very spacious. The 24h room service here is outstanding and the food is the same at 020 as it is at 170. The failure of other Hotels ability to match this is something that drives me crazy and really makes me appreciate this hotel. The burger and chocolate cake with a bottle or 2 of Becks is a go to for me. The Schnitzel is also very good as is the Curywurst and Club Sandwich. Breakfast is also fresh and fairly priced. Potsdamer Platz SU Bahnhof is a couple of metres away making it ideal to catch a train to anywhere. There are multiple places to run and exercise directly accessible from the hotel if the spa and gym are not your thing and you prefer to be outside. I have to say that the Ritz Carlton in Berlin is my favorite hotel on Earth. The ladies and gentlemen running this Hotel are the best in the world. This is something I have never imagined saying on a review on Google.
