A few weeks ago I had the chance to stay at the W Midtown. I read some very mixed reviews so I was not sure what I was getting myself into. I am an SPG member and had stayed at another one of their hotels in Atlanta and did not really enjoy my stay but decided to call reservations anyway. To say the least I was very pleased. I stayed in a suite for my first stay but was unable to book it for a third unexpected night. I ended up with two stays. The view from my windows was great and my bed and pillows were amazing. I was greeted by Eliot at the front desk who despite my many questions was very happy to help and never showed attitude in any way. I used the Whatever Whenever service for any and everything. Amongst many other nice chipper young ladies I got Kayla on several occasions. I asked for everything from a microwave to light bulbs changed to the usual extra blankets and slippers. They obliged without making me feel like a bother. Mike I believe was the mantenance gentleman that was sent to my rooms. He was very nice and funny. I ate at the Trace resturaunt. Carlos greeted me with a pleasant disposition and made several suggestions. I ended up with shrimp and grits. I would not suggest this menue item. I was very hungry and very disappointed after ordering though I was credited without any fuss. I did get a drink that was suggested by the Robert a Bruiser something with blueberries. He was right. It was quite tasty. Jesica was cheerful and checked on me along with Carlos. We made small talk while I waited on my order. I noticed another waiter diligently taking care of others I believe his name is MD The chef that evenings name was Shean. He too was very friendly and the staff seemed to all get along which made me feel good especially since I was there by myself. On my second stay Caine helped me move my things to my new room. He was bright and youthful with good coversation. Valet was awesome. All 80 of them. Holding my hand as I got in my car starting my car for me as I sat. I was definitely spoiled. Now with all that said there were a few cons. 1. You are not told ahead of time that there is no self parking and valet is 35 a day. You are able to come and go as you please but if you did not budget for this it can be a true downer. Your only other option is the the parking deck I mistook for hotel parking. It is 27 a night and everytime you leave there is another charge. It is ridiculous. If Eliot had not told me I would have been screwed. I left my room quite a bit 2. On my second day after lavishing in my suite I realized I needed to stay an extra day. I called reservations directly and was told that a Spectacular room was available since all suites were booked. Since I have SPG Gold status I was told to ask for an upgrade when I went to check out and into my new room. When I got there Leo who was very helpful told me that I had a wonderful room when I asked for an upgrade. I told him that I just booked a Spectacular room. The best he said he could do was to upgrade me to a Spectacular. I decided it was just for a night and took it. When I got back I looked on the website page and realized the room that I stayed in and had pictures of was a wonderful room after all. So not only did I downgrade from my suite but then got a downgrade from the room that I reserved and was supposed to be upgraded to. This was a big glitch in the matrix for me. All in all my stay was still great.", "offset": [3391, 3434], "date": "2015-12-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "20b286ee-30be-4171-ae4e-9b4b8fe65826", "sentence": "Swanky hotel some of the setup could be clearer.", "offset": [0, 48], "date": "2016-06-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "4c075be2-1beb-4a33-a422-28d1ba5d2364", "sentence": "The hotel was cool.

Stayed at the W Midtown Atlanta 11 132019 as part of a large group in town for a wedding nearby. I booked my room using Mariot points but of the 15 rooms that were booked by friends and relatives only two were booked with points. Two people booked suites. From the moment I arrived out front under the portico until the minute I got into the Uber to leave the staff was attentive always available helpful and friendly. A Manager was the first person to welcome me when I entered the lobby. The hotel lobby bar and restaurant area has a great vibe to it which is hard to label because I would hate to pin it down. upscale eclectic almost a Moroccan feel but most of all comfortable and inviting. A large stepped area with cushions for sitting leading from the lobby and bar to the restaurant was a favorite gathering spot reminded us of an indoor version of the Spanish Steps in Rome. Although there are lots of great restaurants bars within the immediate area of the hotel a lot of us gathered at the hotel bar after the rehearsal dinner and wedding reception. Everyone that ate in the restaurant spoke highly of the food I especially enjoyed the shrimp and grits for breakfast. My wife and I got a suite since we brought my 6 year old daughter and my in laws to watch her while we were at the wedding events. The suite was amazing and comfortably accommodated the 5 of us with plenty of living and dining area and LARGE TVs. My in laws and daughter had room service \u201c on us \u201d and each thoroughly enjoyed the food. During the day we were able to walk to many places on the Bride and Groom \u2019s \u201c things to dominate Atlanta \u201d list. The biggest differentiator for this hotel was the staff. they were sincere in their warm and friendly hospitality. EVERY staff member that we encountered throughout the hotel no matter the time of day and during our entire stay made us and everyone else we talked to feel like royalty. We had absolutely no problems with our stay whatsoever and the staff jumped at every request. I forgot a tie for the wedding front desk staff found me the perfect tie to borrow so I did n\u2019t have to make time to shop for one. I am proud to wear a US Army veteran lapel pin on my suite lapel but lost the clamp that goes on the back. when I asked the two ladies working the front desk if they could help they both instinctively reached to their lapel to take the back off of their \u201c W \u201d lapel pin. I travel a lot and like to use my reward points wisely. to reward my family for the travel involved with my work. The W Midtown Atlanta was the best use of points I can imagine and I get to stay in some of the best hotels in the Country. Other folks that travelled to Atlanta for the wedding could have chosen a cheaper off brand hotel closer to the wedding venue but were all very satisfied with the extraordinary value of the W. The bride and groom specifically recommended chose the W because they live within a mile or two of the hotel and thought it would be the best place to represent Atlanta for out of town family and friends. I have stayed in other hotels in Atlanta on business in the past but when my business travels take me to Atlanta again I will be staying at the W Midtown regardless of where my meetings are in the city.

I had a couple great bartenders at the Living Room and a nice front desk assistant who let us change rooms after I realized we were too close to the elevator to get good sleep. I did notice a few things like the bedside table needed to be wiped down but it was no bigy. The bed was comfy and the big TV was great for laying around watching a movie. My only complaint was the bathroom. I did not like the shower door which was a glass wall on half the shower that could not be moved or closed. The other half of the shower was just open. Combine that with the sliding door that could not be locked and did not really close completely and the square basin sink that splashed water everywhere it we were both not huge fans of the set up. This was a rare staycation without our kids and probably unlikely we would select the W again but not entirely as it is in a great location and a little more affordable than Loews with better bar food. If we ever need to crash in Midtown again. Maybe. Also as an almost 40 yr old suburbanite it did feel like a much younger crowd. But then again my husband and I managed to stay up till 4 am so I guess when in Rome.", "offset": [1053, 1131], "date": "2019-12-13", "cpt": "5", "category": "general"}, {"id": 49, "uid": "74ec4e4f-3a14-43cc-88e5-7fb47c245ddf", "sentence": "Overall not a very satisfying stay.

For a five star chain we were very disappointed with this particular WWe have stayed in many Ws but a little disappointed For starters the coffee machine did n\u2019t work and the lady at the bar was n\u2019t particularly nice about it. I feel like we have normalized bad service behavior The room was very bare and as my wife put it they did n\u2019t even have slippers. So overall it felt like an expensive motel stay than a good five star stayWon\u2019t recommend this other than say for a business travel as the location is great for business.

Coffee and tea was great. The downstairs area was beautiful and a lot of fun with the snacks and drinks. Room service was especially attentive and thoughtful.

The room was large and well appointed. The bed was so very comfortable. The bathroom is enormous but there is no surface on which to set anything at all. Lots of non utilitarian wasted space. Also the closet is not a closet at all. You can hang maybe one dress that would not get wrinkled. Definitely not set up for hanging clothes other than slacks folded in half. Upon check in and further interactions I did not find the front desk staff personable or helpful. Asking for change for a 20 confounded them until a manager showed up. I was easily able to get non allergen pillows but other requests went unanswered. Note that you need to request a coffee maker delivered to your room.
