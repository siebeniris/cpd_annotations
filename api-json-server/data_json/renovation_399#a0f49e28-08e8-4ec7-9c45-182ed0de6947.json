At least it \u2019s not the worst hotel I \u2019ve stayed atThis was hands down the worst Hilton I \u2019ve ever visited. Old dated and run down do not even begin to describe it. I do n\u2019t think owners care. Let \u2019s start with the positive. It was clean for the most part and the people were friendly. It is also cheap and our room a king \u201c suite \u201d had a lot of space. This hotel has not been renovated in close to 30 years. It has an old heavy air vibe. See the pics. The hallways are dark the fixtures and furnishings look like they are from the 80 \u2019s popcorn ceilings old drapes low ceilings old wallpaper and a sofa bed that definitely is vintage and not in a good way. The ceiling lights in the bathroom have the old Florida grid cover. If you ever visited your grandmother in her 70 \u2019s era condo you \u2019l know what I mean. The A C was jet engine loud. That \u2019s not an exaggeration. When open the pull out sofa touches the bed in a way that makes it impossible to get out of the bed on one side. The doors to the rooms do n\u2019t match. There was no hot water in the sink and the shower had two settings cold or scalding. Nothing in between. We checked in Friday. I noticed a pistachio shell on a window sill in the hall outside our room. It was there when we checked out on Sunday. The breakfast buffet was adequate. I do n\u2019t think they were powered eggs but I ca n\u2019t be sure. There are no a la carte options. Just the buffet. We are for free due to status but I would not have paid for it. The hotel is renovating the top two floors. I \u2019m sure they \u2019l look nice but this hotel should have been renovated more recently.

I was hesitant to stay here because of the renovations but I was pleasantly surprised with our stay. We were given a renovated room and they were gorgeous. They are decorated in a modern style. The room is big so lots of space to stretch out. The two things I did not like about this was that the toilet kept refilling throughout the night so we had to close the door to the bathroom but you could still hear it because the doors are barn doors instead of hinged doors. Also we were in an adjoining room and the people next door to us were very loud. It sounded like they were having a party so I ended up having to call the front desk security about them. They were quieter but it was still loud so that kind of ruined our one night stay but that is not the hotels fault. I would definitely stay here again.
