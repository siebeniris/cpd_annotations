I stayed here one night on a business trip. It was very convenient to Lovefield Airport. Staff were friendly and efficient. The room was on the 11th floor right next to the elevator. In spite of its location I did not hear any noise or traffic from the elevator. The room itself was large clean and nicely appointed more than sufficient for one person. I ate at the hotels restaurant on the ground floor which also has a bar. The food was a bit pricey to be expected in a hotel but decent fare. Restaurant staff were very nice. The hotels surroundings ranged from office park to triple x adult store of some kind so not a great place if your looking for ambiance or a walk down main street. I booked the hotel through hotwire for a base rate of 76 so am not sure how much they normally charge.

I recommend the Asian chicken salad. It was delicious. Room was a king on the 21st floor. It was updated and very clean. Bed was on the firm side but it was comfortable. Breakfast was included in our stay but if it is not in yours be warned buffet for two was over 400. Nothing wrong with the food but I felt it was a bit over priced.

On the plus side the location is great near downtown Oaklawn Love Field and the room was comfortable and clean. The staff was pretty nice.

Late on the first night I discovered my heat did not work though they fixed it as soon as I reported it the next day. The water pressure was really low and it took several minutes to get hot water in the bathroom sink and shower. There must have been some kind of water leak in the lobby as there were tarps up on some walls and large fans going during my entire stay and very unpleasant moldy smell throughout. The whole hotel felt a little rundown and past its prime. Overall I would stay there again because of the location and price but it definitely has some issues.

At first glance the room seemed perfect. Nice layout nice size. seemingly clean. We put our daughter to bed and shortly after she fell asleep I went to check on her only to find myself standing in water and on soggy wet carpet. Which would explain the musty smell I was struggling with. Once again my husband found himself going down to explain the situation and once again we found ourselves packing up and moving again. This time to a two queen room. The room was fine and again seemingly clean. We slept on and off but the highway noise was disturbing.
