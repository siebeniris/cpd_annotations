For example the hair dryer looked like it was from the 80s and barely blew out air 2. we were on the 8th floor. so it required taking elevator to 7th floor and then climbing up a set of stairs. My mom got dizzy every time we climbed especially if we had luggage to carry. 3 a teapot in the room would be a nice touch especially on the 8th floor where you need to climb up narrow stairs with burning tea from first floor 4. the jacuzi was not working even after we called in help.", "offset": [651, 677], "date": "2015-01-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "66627585-c3c0-4ee7-bece-9c0459812900", "sentence": "As usual its a superb vacation.

I have just returned from a one night stay at Mitpe Hayamim Hotel spa and I am so sorry that it was only one night. From the moment we checked in the service was impeccable. Manor at the front desk yesterday and Faudi at the desk today did everything they could without cloying to make our visit pleasant. Many of you have already heard about this hotel so what I have to say will not be new. The spa treatments are professional and worth every moment spent being massaged or peeled. The room we were on the 7th floor was simple but luxurious with sheets that enveloped you. The bathroom with its jacuzi was enormous and I loved the soaps provided by the hotel. The room had a small balcony which perfectly accented the wood floor and furniture. And of course sitting outside provided us with a sense of serenity and nature. birds all over the place with the scent of the flora. As far as serenity goes the hotel just seems to come by it naturally. but it is clear that this was studied efort no cell phones in any public area except outside and no smoking in the hotel at all although smoking is permitted outside and on balconies. No children under the age of 18 are allowed and this adds to the peaceful atmosphere. The food is great. We ate in the vegetarian dining room fish is served there with organic vegetables and fruits cheeses breads and more grown on the property. Every morsel was special and I had to pace myself. The organic fennel soup was out of this world asked the chef for the recipe and am hopeful that he will provide. I am not sure what else to single out because whenever you go the produce and food will be made from what is available. but you will not be disappointed. More importantly was the service. Yousef and Liad set the tone for the restaurant. and it was interesting to note that as people left practically everyone stopped to thank them. In fact when we left the hotel today I noticed those who were checking out stopped to thank members of the staff who had made their visit enjoyable. I did not eat at La Mouscat this time but this is not to say that I will not eat there next. The chef is outstanding as is the manager of the facility and it is worth a drive up for dinner. I do want to thank Galit who is in public relations and advertising for the hotel. She is professional charming and extremely warm. and I want to make it clear that I am not in any field that deserves special treatment unles being an underpaid English teacher is just that. However the entire experience at the hotel has made me determined to start saving so I can go for two nights next time so I will have time to take a tour of their gardens dairy and fieldsEnjoy.", "offset": [196, 327], "date": "2015-07-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "8eb8562f-fadd-48b0-9810-ea35061a508b", "sentence": "Very special hotel.

From the moment our stupid sat nav directed us to the correct location after a very hot circuitous route from Tel Aviv we knew it was worth the angst. A hidden natural gem in the small town of Rosh Pinna. The staff were expecting us by name after passing through the security barrier. Our room had been upgraded to a deluxe suite and did not disappoint. The ethos of this hotel is not so much state of the art modernity and furnishings as rustic and natural charm. The room was spacious with a small balcony overlooking the natural terrain of the hotels huge organic farming grounds. The overall look of the room is slightly oldy worldy but the large bathroom compensates complete with an excellent shower and jacusi bath. The simplicity of this rambling establishment is enhanced by the tropical plants which abound both inside and outside the hotel in fact a huge palm tree is growing through the centre of the hotel itself. There are many hident patios and nooks and crannies to while away your day on assorted chairs and sun loungers without bumping into other guests. Without doubt the highlight for me was the wonderful array of food at breakfast. Never have I seen such a magnificent spread of home produced food on a table laden with everything one could wish from an Israeli breakfast bread cheese preserves yoghurt all home grown and made at the hotel. The loaves of different freshly baked speciality bread at the bread bar with baskets ready to load with your favourite flavour is mind blowing. The staff in the restaurant were charming and always available to give their help. We were lucky enough to get a personalised tour of the wonderful organic farm which surrounds the hotel by the most charming duty manager Mirav Baldwin who could not have been more helpful and informative. There is not doubt she went above and beyond her duty to ensure we were having a great stay in the hotel. The spa I had two exceptional treatments in tranquil rooms the hot stone massage was the best I had ever experienced and I came out feeling enervated and totally relaxed. The staff were welcoming and would switch treatments if you changed your mind it is hard to decide which to have as the choice is extensive. If I had to comment the facial I had booked was a little unremarkable although the products used were the famous Dr Hauschka ones. Advise would be to pre book these to ensure you can have the ones you want. There are extra activities for each day of the week my husband has a chronic back problem and participated in the exercise class specifically for this run by a wonderfully slightly eccentric lady who had learned her art in Japan. My husband said her technique was simple but life changingI celebrated my birthday there and we decided to eat in the meat restaurant for one night of our 3 night stay The rates include a meal in the vegetarian buffet restaurant each night they do serve fish and although we are not normally lovers of buffet style eateries the high quality of each dish and the choice of dishes more than compensated for this. The meat restaurant is a different more formal style room with waitress service. We had booked a table for 830 but found once we arrived that the majority of diners were finishing their meal. This meant that although the service and quality of food was very good the staff who had been on duty since lunchtime were clearing tables as we were eating our food and preparing for the following days meals which meant the atmosphere was somewhat diminished and we felt slightly that we had to rush in order to let them finish their shifts but this is a minor criticism overall we had a good meal. We felt our stay in this hotel would not be the first choice for travellers wishing all things sleek and modern but for us it provided the perfect resting place to re charge our batteries after the frenetic two wonderful weddings and 60th birthday party we had celebrated prior to our arrival. Would we go back. ca nt wait for the next opportunity thanks to all at Mitspe Hayamim and hopefully see you soon.", "offset": [217, 296], "date": "2016-07-05", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "2e8734a4-2ac9-468e-ae77-186ede9ec808", "sentence": "A Relaxing Utopia. This hotel spa with it is lush greenery inside and out and hilltop views of the surrounding town was the perfect accommodation during our 4day stay in Rosh Pina. My husband and our two sons ages 18 and 21 loved the large suites with their treetop balconies and huge bathrooms delicious buffet breakfasts and dinners and overall tranquility of the resort. The adjacent farm was an added bonus as we walked each morning to visit the goats cows and sheep thanking them for all the wonderful cheese labneh yoghurt and other products their milk provided. We also enjoyed petting Dulce the local border collie. Though we did not take advantage of the spa treatments due to our busy daily schedule we did enjoy the lap pool jacuzi rooftop balconies ping pong table and exercise room. Downsides. Internet access was inconsistent. And despite signs in the bathroom indicating that in an effort to be environmentally responsible used towels would only be replaced when left on the floor the housekeeping staff replaced them every day even when we hung them up.
