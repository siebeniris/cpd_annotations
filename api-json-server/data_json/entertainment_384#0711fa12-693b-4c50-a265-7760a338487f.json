The beach is just beautiful in the mornings I went down each morning and sat on the day beds just watching the surfers you must get a foot massage from my friend Ketut. She is so lovely.

I remember asking one staff member to help me make a coffee one morning he was so nice and did so but then every morning when he saw us at breakfast or at the pool or lounge he would make a point to come and say hello and welcome us and make sure we were happy or needed anything.

The Pullman Legian resembles a round fortress situation on an enormous site on the corner of Jalan Pantai Kuta and Jalan Melasti. The fortress has within its walls many and varied secrets aimed at enticing and keeping a legion of visitors. The hotel is same 6 years old and it boasts 100 \u2019s of quest rooms surrounding a beautifully maintained garden like grounds and featuring a large pool with a designated area suitable for children. In the grounds towards the western side is a huge mound with a manicured roof top garden housing a spa with massage facilities. The beautiful garden view is available to all rooms facing inwards on levels 23 4 the rooms situated on the outer of the complex enjoy the stunning view of the ocean featuring the amazing sunsets but also handicapped by the extra heat from the setting sun fumes and noise from the endless traffic which passes along the beach promenade and turns right into Melasti StretPOSITION POSITION POSITION The Pullman is positioned on the beach front within walking distance of Kuta Legian Street and the adjacent Padma Street Garlic Lane precinct all featuring countless shops restaurants eateries money changers and massage parlours. The adjacent 500 M along Melasti St. Jalan Legian is the major thoroughfare connecting Kuta Legian and to the north the suburb of Seminyak featuring up market boutiques and restaurants. FACILITESThe Pullman five star standard asserts itself immediately on arrival at the enormous luxurious lobby. Ever smiling ultra polite staff greets arrivals with a scented face washer towel and a complimentary cut of tea. All vehicles arriving at the hotel are screened by a under car cameras installed into the driveway a feature established in response to current concerns of terrorist activities. All rooms are of generous size with large balconies and are fully equipped with features expected of a quality 5 star establishment. Rooms are fully serviced daily and all consumables are replaced to the original level and more if requested. No reasonable request is ever questioned and it is satisfied promptly sometimes immediately. Housekeeping staff of whom there is a virtual army are a credit to MR AGUS SUNARYO the Housekeeping Manager. Reception staff are very friendly efficient as well as obliging and the quality of front of the house service is a great credit to MRS KRISTINA JULIO the Reservation Manageress. The showpiece of the Pullman is definitely the stunning horizon pool situated on level 3 and featuring the brilliant Bali sunsets. The pool is equipped with a comprehensive adjacent bar and features nightly disco parties commencing at 4 pm. Other facilities worthy of mention include organised facilities such as yoga classes movie nights fire dance shows and organised tours etc. The facility which deserves a specific mention is the kids club aimed at giving young parents with children an effective opportunity enjoying some quality time while there kids are being entertained by the hotel staff. FOOD. The room charge packages include the optional continental breakfast which is served between 630 am and 1030 am daily. The buffet breakfast is a veritable feast catering for a diverse range of tastes due to the ever changing cultural profile of the patronage. The banquet contains extracts from many cuisines and features dishes favoured by Asian European American Australian and other guests. The newly appointed Executive Chief MR THORSTEN SBRZESNY is a valuable asset to the Pullman Bali. Together with an army of cooks waiters and floor support staff he skilfully orchestrates the daily banquet which is more like a synchronised production of huge proportions. In the evenings the dinning room assumes the guise of a fine quality restaurant featuring an extensive international menu with a variety of dishes. The restaurant stars special events several nights of the week. They include a Balinese feast an Italian night and an Australian barbeque. All these events area all you can eat buffet events priced roughly at AUD 280 per head and accompanied by live band entertainment. FORWARD PLANNING FUTURE PERSPECTIVES. Under the clearly visible and expert helmsmanship of the General Manager Monsieur FRANCK LOISON Pullman Bali is certainly going forwards various initiatives are clearly at work aimed at future business development. In a response to THORSTEN SBRZESNY initiatives a VW combi van retailing hotdogs has been positioned on both the beach front and Jalan Melasti. Results obtained to date as at the end of our stay were unimpressive due to a variety of factors such as the selection of hotdogs as main food choice crumbling condition of footpaths and lack street lighting on Jalan Melasti. Despite the initial discouraging results these are most certainly steps in the right direction aimed at enlarging the footprint of Pullman food services and ultimately improving the bottom line. Specific recommendations regarding further development were left for MR SBRZESNY \u2019S consideration at the time of our departure. Another area of visible initiatives and MR LOISONS skill was the aspect of development of guest relations. A flow of revenue versus origin of patronage analysis obviously revealed the growing importance of the affluent Chinese visitor public in the Bali tourist market. The management of the Pullman Bali is to be commended on recognizing and fostering this connection whilst keeping and promoting the all important Australian patronage. Engagement of multilingual University graduates such as NANCY to welcome and make comfortable visitors from China are an essential bridging factor to eliminate the language barrier and to promote the growth of the increasingly important Chinse connection. THE FEEL OF THE VENUE. Despite the frenetic activity beneath the surface not visible to the eye of an average visitor the Pullman presents an image of serene tranquillity a relaxed atmosphere supported by the ever present smile and \u201c can do \u201d attitude.

This is our second visit to Bali staying at Pullman. We like it for many reasons good location on the beach good food though only one restaurant at the hotel attentive and welcoming staff good gym yoga taichi classes and very spacious clean rooms. We literally had all three meals here during our five days stay. Breakfast is Rp20 incl. taxes. the themed dinner buffets are about Rp 360 incl. taxes. Sometimes they open the buffet lunch prepared for groups to others too at Rp. 250 inc taxes. A la carte menu is always there for lunch and dinner. Prices are only a little more than the smaller restaurants outside. Bluebird taxis are great for all rides costing approximately Rp 100 per km in high traffic time. Being on a one way road going to Kuta side costs more than returning. Discovery Mall is about Rp 350 and Beachwalk mall is Rp 70. Arriving late night at the airport we got the hotel car at Rp 20 which was good. An honest taxi may have cost Rp 150. The exchange rate outside has been AUD Rp 1060 all the time.

We arrived at this hotel from Ubud. This journey cost us 30IDR. When enquiring with other taxi drivers as to how much the journey would be returning to the airport they quoted 100 180IDR however we were given a great tip from an American women working in Bali download the ap \u2018 Go Jek \u2019. It \u2019s like an Indonesian Uber but you pay cash. The amount of drivers available is limited and they do take a long time to get to you but you will be shocked when you see the price difference. In the event you can not get a car use the quote as leverage with drivers on the road. The ap quoted us 27IDR to go to the airport. From the hotel it took approximately 30 minutes mainly due to the traffic. Upon arrival to the hotel we received a very warm greeting from all the front desk staff including a complimentary welcome drink. Throughout our stay when met with any of the hotel staff they always smiled and said hello. The hotel has everything possible to tempt you not to leave the premises too many options to name them all. There are 2 pols ground floor pool more family focused 3rd floor pool is an infinity ish pool happy hour 3 4 music great views of the sunset. Unfortunately staff at both pools refused to let us use our pool float claiming it was too big. This was extremely disappointing as we brought it with the intension of taking fun holiday pics. The Hard Rock Hotel down the road are organising pool float races Pullman need to step their game up. The hotel restaurant do daily dinner specials laid out across the lawn area. There \u2019s also evening entertainment including live music performances and movie night big projector in the garden. As this is a 5 star hotel some items are quite pricey especially in comparison to local alternatives eg. Small Bingtang 5IDR 25 40IDR elsewhere cocktails from 15IDR. ice cream 50IDR a scoop 35IDR for 2 scoops at Flapjacks. The hotel is very large with the rooms divided into wings. WiFi is available throughout with a good connection. The location is at the top of the 1 way street which meant taxi \u2019s would often get caught in traffic when going anywhere however it was usually quite quick to get back. For example A taxi to sky garden was around 20IDR and a 20 minute journey due to traffic. The Beachfront mall is around 15 minute walk out of the hotel turn left passing many lavish restaurants nearby. Legian out of hotel turn right. has several shops restaurants and salons within 5 minute walk. Access to the beach is right across the road. Taxis are cheap if you always ensure they use the meter. Breakfast service was very overwhelming. There was no organised seating just find your own table. The dining room area itself containing all the food was a sweat box however there is an option to eat outside by the pool. It was crowded with guests and lots of staff constantly trying to stay on top of food and crockery replenishment. The buffet styled breakfast had a vast amount of options including 2 egg stations freshly made waffles pancakes salad bar Asian and English breakfast options. There were fresh fruits juices and yoghurts however with how hot the room was it concerned me how these would stay cold. The juice I had was watered down and required ice. I did not risk eating the yoghurt. Our room was on the 3rd floor giving us direct access to the pool. The room was like any standard luxury hotel rom fridge safe balcony robes ect. The bathroom had both a tub and shower cubical. The wall connecting the bathroom to the main room is made from glass enabling full visibility whilst washing or on the toilet. Do not fear there is a blind if you require some alone time. Negatives The king sized bed was actually 2 singles pushed together. The TV was quite off centred to the bed. The wardrobe was in the bathroom only a few drawers for storage in the room itself. Overall The hotel is beautiful that can not be faulted. As it \u2019s a luxury hotel you will pay luxury prices within it. When telling locals where you are staying you will also be faced with the assumption you are Mr Rocafela. A few changes could be made to ensure guests are fully satisfied pool float policy. Would recommend more so for families and older guests. Younger guests 20 35 might prefer to be more central in Kuta or seminyak.

This is quite a difficult review to write. Much like telling a best friend they have body odour. The intention as always is to inform management that there are issues to be attended to. All too often management are unaware of issues in this case quite serious issues. This is a heads up for them. First the PLUS points it is a beautiful resort and THE resort with street appeal in Kuta although the resort is named Legian Beach it appears to fall within the Kuta boundary on Legian Beach. Not that this really matters. The beach is just across the busy road take care when crossing particularly at nightThe resort was unaffected by road noise in the rooms where I stayed with a garden view. A huge plus for me in the very noisy traffic jam that is Bali. The restaurant and reception staff and cleaners are all warm friendly and professional. The food was of a consistently good standard at breakfast lunch and dinner. I did not suffer digestive issues while eating at the hotel which is a huge plus in Bali. I commend them on their food hygiene standards. The isuesIsue 1I was forced to move rooms 4 times due to lack of sleep caused by noise. The first room called a Deluxe Room on the 5th floor suffered from noise from water pumps on the roof. The noise varied in pitch and made sleeping impossible. The issue seemed to develop over a couple of days. The staff appeared to know there was an issue. We had to move room at 11 pm at night to a room on the 2nd floor. As this room had very little natural light we asked to be moved to a different room. The third room a Grand Deluxe was next to the pool. As the pool is shut down at night there was no external noise. Even the early morning swimmers caused no issues. Unfortunately this room as with the previous 2 rooms had a connecting door to the next room. I have encountered this before but usually the inter room noise is minimal. Unfortunately the connecting door has no sound insulation whatsoever. Conversations even whispered intimate ones at 230am TV programmes at 1015pm family chatter at 340am and loud vomiting at 230am were as audible as if they were in our BED. The inter room insulation was such that when they showered you could smell the soap. Even noise through the wall WITHOUT a connecting door was loud. Anything that tapped the wall sounded loudly in the room. At this point you probably think that I am overly sensitive. This would be partly true but you will have to trust me on this being shocked awake over several days in the early hours of the morning is no joke. We started having 2 3 hour naps in the afternoon to catch up on sleep. In the end we yet again begged to be moved. The Reception staff could not have been more helpful and the Restaurant staff smiled when asking what room number we were in this morning. But in truth we would have loved to have stayed in just one room. Our final room 4 was a Garden Suite. The wonderful lady at Reception was quite strategic in that rooms either side of us were being renovated. No neighbours yeay. When we entered the room you could actually hear the difference in the level of sound insulation. Ah at last we thought we can sleep. We drifted into blissful sleep but then suddenly around 30am why is there so much activity in the early hours. the resident of the room directly about our bed arrived home in heels. You would think she would have taken them off at the door but no she clicked and clacked loudly all over the room several times before dropping them with a crash on the floor. you are thinking is that it. Um no. Her LARGE bath which took over 30 minutes to SLOWLY fill seemed to be directly above our bed. This combined with the fact that she let the water run while in the bath meant a week of 230 to 3 am wake up calls. After 4 room changes and with only 7 days out of 24 to go meant we had by this time given up on getting a restful sleep. We realised that it was not going to get any better no matter how many times we moved. What was the biggest concern was this was a recently renovated room. And this is the key point for management. If this is the renovated standard of sound insulation then it needs an urgent upgrade. Issue 2 DrainsEvery morning in every room we moved to there was a morning ritual to be followed. Put shampoo on the floor turn on the shower and RUN. The reason being the smell from the drains was absolutely putrid and truly gut wrenching. I have stayed in volcanic areas with lighter smells. In the final room it was so strong that it bordered on toxic. After 5 minutes or so the smell dissipated and you could enter the cubicle. In New Zealand we have S and P bends that lock away the smells. I struggle to believe these rooms have these. Again as the last room was recently renovated there is a serious issue here that needs to be addressed. Issue 3This issue sounds a bit lame compared to the previous 3 but it did present an issue to my friend. In rooms 1 and 3 there was a substantial smell of mould. You kind of expect some degree of this in a humid country but in room 2 the issue was so extreme that my friends nose streamed whenever he entered the room and ONLY then. We purchased nasal spray to counteract this to a degree. Issues 4 and 5What he is still writing. Yes sorry. Minor issues I guess. There always seemed to be bugs in our room. The cleaners sprayed each morning and we sprayed each night before leaving for dinner. Always bugs. Room 3 door did not lock properly on the side that was never opened. We wedged the outside chair against it and hoped no one would notice. We informed Reception of the issue. Issue 6 and 7More of a comment really. Conventions are great money spinners but not when it means that a large portion of the recreation area is removed from guest use in one case for two days. Live singers are great but does the volume have to be so loud that even at a distance guests have no choice but to listen. Even the architectural convention was quieter. In summary Decide if you are a hotel OR a convention centre. Create rooms with excellent sound insulation through ceilings AND walls. Sort out the drainsYou have a truly beautiful resort with excellent staff I really love it but it desperately needs YOUR urgent attention to these really fundamental details.", "offset": [5848, 5970], "date": "2019-08-20 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 21, "uid": "fb2ca147-977e-4d58-9b2d-0d4ebd60a7af", "sentence": "end of kuta area. you might want to consider the traffic to reach the hotel. you need to pass all the hectic coast road into this hotel. and that the only way to get into the hotel. but aside from the traffic you can always walk into one of the popular mall which is beachwalk that relatively close from the hotel and across from the main entrance street already the beach. so if u decide to stay and just walk to enjoy kuta area this might be the best place for you.", "offset": [182, 373], "date": "2019-10-20 00:00:00", "cpt": "2", "category": "entertainment"}]}
