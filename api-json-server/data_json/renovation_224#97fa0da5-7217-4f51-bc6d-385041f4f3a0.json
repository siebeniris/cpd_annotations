I assume the beach is public but I still think they should hire someone f t to collect garbage on the beach immediately outside the hotel. Otherwise staff was quite friendly.

This is not my first trip to Conrad Bali but my last 5 or so visits were very very early days. The hotel has not stood the test of time and its condition is very poor considering the newer offering so close. I visited this property on my last trip in Feb 2016 to have a look at the Conrad Suites and Club most of the shops on the walkway were closed and the tennis courts and club were deserted and in need of upkeep. The restaurant across well what used to be one was also closed and empty. I made a reservation direct with the hotel on Monday 7th of Nov for the 10th to the 14th and was highly recommended I did not book Suites as there is construction to the entry 2nd level. I booked a Resort Garden view on a sale price 40 off US 135 I think. When I arrived the check in was ok I dislike being pointed out the facts in a sarcastic was. Oh check in is 3PM but the room is ready now there is a charge for the internet but as H member for you its complimentary. I know they are trying to point out benefits but I travel enough to know this thanks who these days does not provide WiFi to the hotel members SPG IHG Hyat. I arrived at my room 302 the room has not been renovated since my last visits some years ago. The bedside light was not working I had a shower and the door would not close so all the water hit the door and ran down on the floor. The towels had a strong dryer smell and left me smelling sour when I used them. I rang to complain as I was not happy and my call was not returned for 45 mins when I had to go to reception. Sir we can move you to another room this was not acceptable as that room was in the same state no reno I asked the receptionist was was the last renovation completed she replied we have never completed and renovation to the property or rooms since opening. I requested a Conrad Suite as this is what I wanted to book in the first place my request was flatly denied. I returned to my room to wait for a room change. 2 hours later I had to return to reception as I was still waiting. The staff were playing Pokemon at the desk in my view he laughed. The Duty Manager then entered into the conversation and I requested a room move to Suites that s not part of the deal Sir neither is the room you have sold me I said. I had to push for a Resort Suite which he accepted and finally upgraded me I had also requested to check out and they explained there would be a nights charge as a penalty for an early check out I pre paid the room at check in not in advance mind you. I moved into what would have been a nice suite some 10 years ago but now looked very dated. I will not to into all the details of my stay but after breakfast I requested to check out I paid for 3 nights I have had enough they again insisted on charging me another night as a penalty OMG here we go again after some 15 mins back and forth he finally agreed to have me check out and a refund would be proceeded that day mind you not on the spot In have to wait for accounts to process this request eventually this was down in the PM of the same day.

I have stayed at this hotel ca 20 times since it opened in 203 and it has been one of my favourites since then. However while it was top of the line back then time has somewhat catched up and its age is starting to show. The last few times in Bali I have stayed at other hotels like Laguna and Westin so now it is probably four years since I was at Conrad. I still like the large swimming pool area great if you want to get some exercise. Also the lobby bar is great with a fantastic view over the pool and the sea. If you stay in the new suites part of the hotel or if you are Hhonors Gold or Diamond member which I got the feeling many guests were you get access to free afternoon tea and also prediner drinks with canapes at either the lobby bar or the lounge \u2013 a nice touch. On the downside the rooms are starting to show their age. Our oceanfront room had a 15cm gap at the bottom of the balcony doors so we had to put a towel there otherwise the door would bang onto the wall when the wind was blowing. Also the rooms are lacking insulation. At the oceanfront room the sound from the people playing in the pool was palpable. The same goes for when people are passing your front door and talking. Our kids room had a bad smell in it but the room was swiftly changed and the kids were happy with the new one. At the moment we are on our 5th day out of 9 and we have had to rekey our keys 5 times already. And no \u2013 I do not put them next to my mobile. One thing which really annoyed me and many other guests is that since my last trip they have ring fenced an area at the main pool with ca 25 sun chairs. These are available at 2500 IDR tax ca USD EUR 22 per person and day. You get premium water. and some snacks. WhyThere is already a premium section at the hotel Conrad suites with its own pool and secluded area so guests who want privacy can book there. To fence off an area at the main pool just causes annoyance when sun chairs are in short supply. Two final notes \u2013 why does it have to take 15 20 minutes to get four drinks from the bar when it is almost empty. Every day we had to wait endlessly at both lunch and at the bar to get our drinks despite the bar being manned with 3 4 people. And it \u2019s 2016 Internet should be free. As a Diamond member I do get it free but otherwise the hotel charges for a very slow Internet. So I vote with my feet and choose another hotel for my next Bali stay.

We had an issue with the fridge when we got to the hotel Ie it would n\u2019t work so they bought another one to the room. The room was lovely but a bit dated and needs a bit of modernisation but the hotel have obviously realised this as one block is being totally renovated at the moment and the other blocks are to follow. The noise of the building work did n\u2019t disturb us at all. Reception staff especially Wilemijn Wilie were very helpful and so friendly. Wilemijn is a credit to the Conrad the concierge staff were also very helpful and friendly. The hotel grounds are beautiful and well maintained the swimming pools are amazing. Yatni n the restaurant is also a credit to the Conrad Hilton as she guided my husband round the gluten free items on the menu looking after his dietary requirements and she was such a nice person. You do n\u2019t have to take water to the pool with you as you are handed glasses of water and cold flannels around the pools when your water is empty you can refill with free water around the pool that has been infused with fruit. Also at midday you are given watermelon on a stick to refresh you. Staff are always smiling and very helpful. There is an excellent supermarket called pepitos if you walk out the hotel turn left and walk for 10 mins and you can buy beer and wine and lots of other stuff at a fraction of the cost of the hotel. If I were a Coeliac I would be so happy to have chosen this hotel I \u2019m not but my husband is and when you Holiday with a Coeliac it is such a relief to know they are being catered for.

I have not stayed at a Hilton Group hotel for a very long time and never at a Conrad. This was a first family holiday for me with my partner and her 5 year old and was specifically booked because of the inclusions for children of this age and because the price was reasonable for the standard of hotel with Bali pretty busy with holiday makers at this time of year. Pick up from the airport was smooth as was check in with no fuss about being early and no waiting for the room. They also upgraded us to a lagoon access deluxe room from the lagoon view room. This was on the shady side of the hotel but actually having wandered around would say it was a good quiet location. The pool is huge so not heated I guess and pretty cold to get into but we had fun and enjoyed the access even though with a 5 year old in tow we had to be careful. We made more use of this than we thought and swam through to the main pool area direct from the room which was fun. The best bit of the beach was the other side of the hotel from us however it was a pleasant walk and easy to access. The drink service at the beach really lacked and required us to walk to the bar to get service. Really think that they should schedule someone to come around every 30 45 minutes or so to check if people enjoying the beach want to order something. The Azure restaurant is close by and it would be relatively easy to organise one would have thought. The room itself was lovely spacious very well thought out with a sofa in front of the TV seperate area for luggage which is something I really like. Bathroom was great with good water pressure and nice hot water. Aircon was very easy to use and effective too. Excellent design. Shame the table by the pool had only one chair would have thought a second would be nice for room service dinners outside. Also the twin beds in the room were somewhat small for one couple and an accompanying child. The child had plenty of space the couple not so much. Housekeeping service was fine with no issues with extra towels and amenities. However on one occasion it took 3 calls to get some fresh towels delivered and on another the gentleman delivering the additional amenities was distinctly grumpy which is not what I would expect from Indonesia or this class of hotel. Breakfast was very good overall and with the temperate weather we were able to enjoy it outside. Range was good and constantly refreshed with good brewed coffee exceptional teas and fresh juices available on request. Certainly would recommend a package that includes breakfast. It will set you up for the rest of the day. We ate in both the hotel restaurants in the evenings. Rin for Japanese was very good with delicious food and Eight Degrees South had lovely beach views and friendly service however the food was a bit lacklustre for the price point. Did not use the gym or the spa this trip so can not review. Like another reviewer we were there when there was a massive wedding on. Given the money they must have spent with the hotel I am not surprised that the party got what they wanted with pumping music one afternoon in particular somewhat spoiling the relaxation of the beach. So as always the key question is would we stay here again and the answer is Yes. Not sure it would be first choice and having read reviews may give the Westin a go next time however overall we really enjoyed our stay and have no significant cause for complaint. What I would say is that the staff whilst clearly trying their best and at times really good have a little way to go in the service element. They clearly work hard and I sense a motivation issue so possibly a top down problem. I can compare with the Sheraton Kuta where staff use your name and without exception and go the extra mile with a smile. This was lacking here. It is a bigger property so the name thing may be a challenge however some of the service lacked true proactivity and was not as slick as elsewhere I have stayed in Indonesia. The potential is certainly there and they seem willing but would be the one area where I would strongly recommend the GM has a look at.", "offset": [2451, 2570], "date": "2019-07-05", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "78fc492d-c257-4db5-b44a-f6f023ad47f6", "sentence": "Impressive Stay.

Having just returned from a month in S E Asia it is time to review the hotels we booked on our Thailand Malaysia and Bali travels. And naturally you start with the best. The Conrad excels there are so many little features that distinguish this hotel from the norm even from other 5 star resorts and additionally it exudes the Hilton brand in all respects with significant quality features that impress. We stayed for 5 days and we will return. The hotel is located on Tanjung Benoa peninsula just north of Nusa Dua and is easily accessible from the airport Legian Seminyak in the west by the toll highway for a mere 1200 IDR by local taxi look for Bluebird. Initially it seemed a little remote but that did not prove to be the case. Here in the east is a totally different beach environment from the west an area of top quality 4 and 5 star resorts with security and spacious grounds local shopping and warangs for dinner easily accessible transport the Bali Collection shopping dining complex which continues to expand all without the hassle of the Kuta world. Email exchanges were easy and responses from the GMs office made booking arrangements and our room allocation straightforward for which we are grateful. At the Conrad when you notice that the management are around the grounds and pools and talking with guests seeing the guest experience manager making contact in the breakfast room the head chef working with his staff each morning in the observable kitchen and conversing with his guests the concierge taking the time to show you attributes of the hotel when you inquire the pool bar staff ensuring all is fine and ensuring you have ice when you want it pool attendants offering chilled watermelon around lunchtime and cold face towels and chilled water without prompting \u2013 you notice the difference and quickly feel at home. Such observations reinforce the impression that this hotel excels delivers on expectations and has a culture that places their guests first. There are features at the Conrad that are immediately apparent once you have checked in and orientate yourself in what is a big complex. The check in was smooth and welcoming not just standing at a reception desk. The service from the porter and familiarisation with the room features was undertaken as a matter of course and that is not always so these days and was helpful for light switches charge points confirming there were two small fridges and indeed two toilets in this ocean view \u2018 apartment \u2019 room and small things like security and how the in room Nespreso capsule coffee machine and the TV remotes work. Our ocean view upper level room 316 was superb both in its d\u00e9cor and amenities and its location was on a corner on the third floor with dual balconies you could always get the sun or shade with views over the beach and back to the pools. The balconies had chairs and a large table. This was not a Conrad Suite with these luxury suites being in another wing of the hotel but ours was a most well appointed and expansive \u2018 apartment style \u2019 with a small entrance area a large fully furnished lounge a huge bedroom an expansive marbled bathroom and a totally separate second toilet hand basin area. Having stayed in many 5 star hotels in S E Asia this room 316 was impressive. The hotel brand obviously has planned its room configuration well. The separate lounge room was modern and tastefully furnished with a sofa and lounge furniture a dining table coffee table and two flat screen TVs and all other amenities with pleasant decor the bedroom had ample storage shelving drawers and dual wardrobes with all you would expect \u2013 safe slippers robes iron spare pillows and pool bags \u2013 with a fantastic super king mattress with mattress topper as requested. The spacious bathroom was modern with a bath dual basins expansive mirrors discrete toilet and first class shower and every quality bathroom requirement and supply items catered for including bath sheets and extra towels. The housekeeping service was of the highest order \u2013 everything totally clean and perhaps one of the better bathrooms we have experienced across the world. And hotels are often judged on the bathrooms and beds. Furthermore hotels are often judged on their breakfasts. Here the Conrad has experience and it knows its guests. The buffet is extensive and importantly is replenished. Inside and outside dining the various nationalities are catered for from European western to cold cuts eggs all ways to Indian to Balinese to Chinese and Japanese breakfasts. Pastries and bakery items and a great fruit and juice selection. The huge choice and quality within these nationality breakfasts I have only encountered previously in the prominent named hotels of Bangkok and Singapore. They serve real coffee will make a breakfast to order with protein and vegetarian options \u2013 burritos eggs Benedict white egg omelettes Balinese \u2013 and an array of Asian special dishes \u2013 breakfast can be a cultural adventure and why not. At times it was crowded and unfortunately some nationalities will not queue rather they impose themselves and it is notable but beyond the hotel \u2019s control. The serving staff are superb and the head chef ensures the guests are looked after by his presence and expertise. Interestingly there were not a lot of children at the hotel despite there being good occupancy. Adults only has merit. Perhaps this was because there were not a number of Australian guests as is so evident across Bali. There were Europeans and certainly a significant Chinese and Japanese presence and a prominent demographic was younger groups of North Asian guests. It was of note for me to find that the Air New Zealand Bali crew choose to stay at the Conrad. Also a Conrad speciality seemed to be weddings and conferences and this is true of many Balinese hotels in this part of the island. The hotel has 296 rooms maybe more and one entire block is being renovated at this time and this is due for completion in December 2019. It was non disruptive for almost all guests but at times the engineering work near the pool when we stayed was irritating. The renovations will ultimately also include a more centralised and revamped lobby which will cut down the walking as the complex is a series of wings and the footprint is large \u2013 probably this is because the rooms all seemed larger than many other 5 star hotel rooms. Surely an impressive feature. The layout is initially confusing but a great site map and signage resolves this very quickly. Corridors have open air light and the hotel is scrupulously serviced and maintained. The Conrad does have club facilities two club areas \u2013 one at the temporary lobby area that will be replaced in due course. This club area admits children but with few children as guests this was no problem. There is the usual club bar with hors d\u2019oeuvres and pleasant service. The second club is adjacent to the Suite complex northern wing area near the Suite \u2019s pool and this is truly an impressive club that at least matches as a venue others in Nusa Dua and Vietnamese beach resorts eg Da Nang and NHa Trang. We did not use this club but I am sure being the Conrad \u2019s elite club the catering would match the venue in ambiance and excellence. The grounds are expansive and with security a priority they provide for a pleasant stay. Without doubt many guests spend their entire holiday at the hotel but it is easy to book travel and excursions away. You can dine in house or easily access local warang on the main street. Surprisingly we did not sight any squirrels whilst there yet they are abundant across Nusa Dua. The pools are a focus for the hotel and what many guests prioritise. The pools are extensive with easy access and there are plenty of excellent sturdy and manoeuvrable sun loungers. The pool attendants do provide service and are pro active with plenty of quality beach towels and drink and food service and they ensure there is no obvious pre booking of loungers. With these pool staff as with others the hotel has an obvious training programme for guests needs. Greeting their guests comes naturally and in return a \u201c suksuma \u201d response will elicit a \u2018 Balinese \u2018 smile and their \u2018 bahasa \u2019 response. Try it you will quickly enjoy the greeting with staff who get to know you. We enjoyed this pool environment which made up for some disappointment with the state of the beach. It is significantly tidal with weed and the need to wear beach shoes. We were told the moon phase meant the tide was at a real low but that was unusual. The sea sport activities did not worry us at all but it is apparent that global changes have impacted on the beach profile and the new sea wall is now necessary. Walking on the paved common pathway to the south towards the blowholes and Nusa Dua is a pleasant experience with other luxury hotels in abundance but as we observed only a few came up to how the Conrad presents. If you intend to venture north from the Conrad we suggest you use the main road way as the immediate beach path access to the north runs out and is in need of the neighbours and councils urgent attention. Using the road allows you to see the local shops and warangs and then there is access to some more pleasant beachfronts. The Conrad does deliver. Our comparison is with several other similar 5 star hotels in Nusa Dua and although it is expensive for a non club room it does offer a lot. It benefits from its brand experience and local management attention and expertise. Invariably if something is to go wrong for your holiday it is a room feature or the service. We had a first class room and excellent service experience without a single hitch so \u2018 suksuma \u2019 Conrad Bali. There are significant Conrad features that will enhance your stay and the planning and the renovations that are underway convinces me that this hotel will become even better come 2020.", "offset": [9730, 9914], "date": "2019-10-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "9151a97c-04c2-49c0-9b74-49e3852e2617", "sentence": "A magnificent return to Conrad Bali.

Where do I even begin. I recently was lucky enough to stay at the Conrad Bali before I even checked in I already got a welcome email asking me for my flight number so they can look up my flight time to ensure my room will be ready and asked if I needed anything in advance so they can make sure I \u2019l have a great stayOnce I arrived I was immediately helped by the front bell desk to carry out luggage all the way to the temporary lobby check in desk. They greeted me with a nice scented cold towel and to my pleasure upgraded me to a lagoon family suiteYudi one of the reservations manager made sure I was taken care of and when I told him how I would love to experience a lagoon suite he did everything he can to make it happen not only was it beautiful it was huge 140sq feet newly renovated. Was greeted by a hand written card and a bowl of fresh fruit to thank me for my loyalty as a diamond memberRom was newly renovated bed was super comfy and the direct access to the pool was amazing. One of the most comfortable and amazing rooms I \u2019ve ever been in. Breakfast we chose to go eat at Suka the main restaurant everyday since the options were larger and wow were we blown away by the service there and the warmth everyone provided for me and my friends. On the 3rd day they remembered me already and had a capacino immediately on the way without me even askingThe many options for pools was also fantastic and the bar at the pool had great drinks and prices for pool side food was very reasonableLastly one of my favorite features nightly was the 5 7pm executive lounge reception. They have a craft cocktail menu that you order from and they were very generous in checking in on your for another drink. There is also a buffet of appetizers you can go get to accompany you drinks. I have to give a huge shout out for Swartini one of the lounge managers she always greeted me with a warm smile and welcomed me back to the lounge and made sure my drinks are full and my stay at the lounge and resort a very pleasant one. I always enjoyed seeing her bright welcoming smile when I go into the lounge every nightOveral from Yudi to Swartini and many other service members at this resort it makes it truely a 5 stars experience and made me want to come back as soon as possible. Also last note is the amazing staff that maintains how clean the ground and pool is everyday for how big the resort is they really put a lot of care and effort and attention to details in everything.
