This hotel only works if you have teenagers and you want them to be able to socialize at night without leaving the property. This hotel accomplishes that goal. Expect nothing else. Our recent stay at the El San Juan was extremely frustrating on so many levels. First there was no wifi or ability to connect to our devices at all. This was a hardship for me because it effectively kept me from conducting any of the business that I had to do. It is all the more frustrating because the hotel charges a Resort Fee which I suppose is for the purpose of providing services. Please note that no services were provided. The general attitude of the staff at this hotel is that they are doing you a big favor by handling your matter or request. All all times the staff prefers to converse amongst themselves to helping customers standing right in front of them. One day I called in order to get the hotel fax number I was transferred between the front desk and the concierge like a ping pong ball. Simple request but no one seemed able or willing to help. One day I lost my key so I went to the front desk. They asked my name and they gave me a key. Never bothered to ask for identification. Wow that is scary. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that check in was 30 pm but we were not able to get into our room until 530 pm We were supposed to have adjoining rooms with friends but were told they could not be adjoining b c one of the rooms had mechanical difficulties. When we were actually allowed to check in we discovered that they were cleaning the other room and there were in fact no mechanical difficulties with that room ever. Bottom line is that the staff tells you whatever they want to in order to get rid of you. No accountability whatsoeover. Oh and the beach is free but they charge 10 per day for umbrellas.

Oh man where do I even begin. We were going to Puerto Rico for our honeymoon and were VERY excited. Well for starters we originally booked a stay here for a few days on our honeymoon and the other half of our stay at the Ponce hotel just to see 2 different parts of Puerto Rico. A week before our trip my husband who is a Diamond Member and stays over 150 days a year at Hiltons called the Honors desk to ask a question about the hotels. The lady he spoke with was VERY friendly and helpful but convinced us to switch our trip to stay the entire week at El San Juan saying Ponce was nt that great. So we decided to take her advice First mistake. First off when we got the the El San Juan to check in it was 1 am as our flight landed at midnight. we had called the hotel and the Honors desk to let them know this ahead of time and when we tried to check in the clerk said our reservation was cancelled for a no show since we showed up so late. Talk about almost freaking out. Well good news she fixed it so no harm there. Then she told us as diamond members we get free breakfast buffet for 2 everyday. Sounds good. Well then she said they do nt have the vouchers like every other hilton we have been to does and to just charge it to our room and they d take it off. This REALLY worried me but we did it anyways. I even called the front desk 2 more times in the week to varify and they said yes it would be taken off. I should have known better. They took off some of the breakfasts but not all and ended up charging our card for the remaining almost 70. so much for free breakfast. On that note a couple of the days I went down to the buffet to grab some breakfast to bring back to our room and have a private breakfast in bed type deal apparently that s not allowed here. I ve done this plenty of times at other hiltons and no problem. Not at this hotel. I was stopped and told its not allowed and I d have to order food to go room service. I explained about the breakfast vouchers credits and was again told it would come off our bill it did not. I love too how they have servers to bring me absolutely nothing as its a BUFFET. all they did was ask how I was and tell me I ca nt bring food to my room and they then asked for a tip. seriously. We are always very generous tippers as we were servers in college but even we know this is absurd. As for the other restaurants in the hotel there s one downstairs with great pizza expensive but good. Service SUPER SLOW. Ordered 1 pizza to go took 45 minutes. Another time we ordered a banana split off their HUGE menu board and the waitress said in a very confused way we do nt have that. then we pointed to the menu board and she said oh uh let me ask. kind of weird. But the food was good. Starbucks good pretty standard. We also ordered a drink in the lobby downstairs by the music we ordered 2 whiskey and sprites 29. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. That was the first and last drink we ordered in there. We tried to go to the casino a few times but the tables were always full and kind of pricey. so after awhile we went to the Embassy Suites down the street to their casino. much cheaper and more relaxed as well as spots open. El San Juan does have a great pool chairs lounges hammocks beach area. etc drinks by the beach also VERY expensive. Chairs are free but umbrellas are 10 each kind of ridiculous for such an expensive hotel. Now on to the room when we checked in we were told the only room they had left was near the elevator even tho when we booked with the Honors Diamond desk we were told we had be far from the elevator. we asked if we could be moved maybe on another day etc and were told there were no rooms at all even tho we were there for 7 days. Then the desk clerk says well i have another room I can move you a little further away its still close but further than the last one we think ok. well that s a small improvement. We get to our room and its literally the room. right in front of the elevator when you open the door. lol i do nt know where the first one was gona be but i don tknow how this is further away. the rooms are clean but so uncomfortable. all tile hard furniture and muggy humid. felt like we were staying in a hospital with cold hard floors. but clean is good. when we booked we were also told we had a balcony we did notwe asked for a fridge and microwave were told we had have both we did not. the hotel does nt even offer microwaves. could never take our leftovers home to reheat definitely a downer and alot of food and money wasted. The worst part about the room the NOISE. We had the loudest room I ve ever stayed in even over crappy small hotels. our neighbors had 2 small babies in their room who cried for several hours a day. We have a child and were on this trip without him as our honeymoon and instead we just listened to 2 other babies crying all night. NOt to mention you could hear every word of your neighbors conversations even talking at normal volumes. Then the elevator noise that was also constant. parties groups etc. we heard them all come and go. SO FUN. Then the band downsairs you could hear the loud bass in our room all night we were on the 9th floor btw. by far the loudest room I ve ever experienced. Another fun thing we enjoyed our room key broke several times. We would come back from an outing tired ready for a nap. and our keys would nt work. We thought maybe we put it by our cellphones so we made apoint of never doing that and every single day of our trip they quit working. We had to get a total of 12 new keys in 6 days. BEYOND annoying and we were never offered a solution even tho we told the front desk multiple times. Just an i m sorry and a new key. The hotel has a policy about dress code no shorts etc after 7 pm i get the reasoing as their lobby turns into what they call a night club kind of a sad version of a night club and they do nt want people looking unpolished i guess. but this is not fair to hotel guests who are not there to go to the night club and are just passing thru to their rooms move your night club or open another door for the hotel guests this is like you are catering to the night lifers and not the hotel guests who are spending alot on their stays. kind of rude. Our stay was so bad and so uncomfortable that we ended up changing our flight on our HONEYMOON and leaving a day early. we were told our last day would be credited back to us and yep you guessed it it never was. we called the Honors desk yesterday as well as the hotel about the breakfast charges and the last day credit and were basically given the runaround and told by the hotel breakfasts not included and sorry. then told shed talk to her manager and call us back in a few days not sure why this takes days to accomplish. but I anticipate we will never hear back. what a disapointment and a ruined trip on what was suppose to be a VERY special trip for us. i 100 do not recommend this hotel. My husband is on another business trip right now in Seattle staying at a Homewod Suites hilton hotel and sent me a pic of his room with the caption amazing room wish this was our trip to Puerto Rico SO SO SO UPSETTING.

We were just at the hotel. I had read the reviews prior to leaving home and came. this close to changing hotels but figured I would take my chance here. It was cheaper getting to the hotel by taxi than anticipated. 10 base 2 airport fee 1 state fee 1 bag. It \u2019s still overpriced when in most other cities the 3 miles would have been covered by a hotel shuttle the policies here stink but not the hotels \u2019 fault directly. I will complement the lobby and grounds for being beautiful. However upon arrival we were immediately met by the protestors \u2019 chants in front of the hotel. They have an entire section of the sidewalk apron blocked off for them to house their tents vehicles etc \u2026 basicaly a base camp so they \u2019re not going away anytime soon. Until hearing their bullhorn and loudspeakers it \u2019s extremely hard to envision the sheer amount of noise they create until experiencing it in person. I will say that some of their chants were actually melodic and not too disturbing however not when heard early in the morning or late at night. The mind blowing thing though is that upon check in I mentioned reading about the protestors on TA the hotel staff 3 different staff members 2 guys in pinstripe jackets 1 girl insisted that the front protestors had simmered down and guaranteed that there were no as in ZERO. protestors on the beach anymore. They even recommended that I submit this review as a revision of the prior ones letting people know this. THIS WAS A LIE. Indeed protestors continue on the beach as I type this. Mind you it \u2019s not 12 hours a day and not at the crack of dawn or late evening. However 100 they still exist and have their tent set up just outside the eastern entrance to the pool area. Luckily we barely heard their noise as I was in a high enough room. Additionally the hotel tried to drown them out by cranking up the music playing around the pool area but that was only successful if staying by the pool closest to the hotel entrance. Bottom line \u2026 protestors continue both in front and in back of the hotel. Construction continues. They \u2019re still working on the new fitness spa area and I \u2019m not sure if that \u2019s the noise we heard but we were awoken the first morning at 9 am by the sounds of drilling or maybe a jackhammer. So much for sleeping in on vacation. The other days it has n\u2019t been as bad though. There is a convention here this week. The attendees are n\u2019t too bad \u2026. a bunch of old men having fun getting drunk by the pool. Some have brought their families but most are flying solo and living it up. They were mostly well behaved and I was n\u2019t too concerned with them being around children. However the pool and bar staff are clearly catering to them as we were left sitting by the pool for at least 10 15 minutes before getting any drink that was ordered. They also dominated the pool area and indoor spaces for several of their events. It was n\u2019t too bad but just something to note. Upon check in we were advised of a Sunday pool party. We were at the pool from 10 1 then 2 4 yesterday and there was n\u2019t a hint of a pool party anywhere to be seen. We were actually looking forward to it but \u2026. While we \u2019re on the pool topic \u2026 chair hogs are in full force. You know \u2026 those people that get up put their towels on the chairs and then disappear for hours. Between the convention folks and the moronic chair hogs it was tough to find a spot. Staff tried to be helpful in pulling extra chairs from cabanas but there \u2019s only so much real estate to cover. The beach area was easier to get a seat as staff would bring out a chair from the stack if one on the beach was n\u2019t available. The only issue with the beach besides the protestors is that the beautiful sand is fine and with the wind it tended to fly in our face quite frequently. The beach area is clean beautiful though. It has many activities in the immediate area for hire jet ski parasail etc \u2026. All in all it has been a decent experience. The hotel is in a nice location for outside food choices Chilis most fast food options and several local fare options as well if not wanting to pay exorbitant hotel prices and a good base camp for excursions to other parts of the island. The only other interesting tidbit \u2026 there are 3 guys here presumably guests but they seem to know much of the staff as they are greeting them with handclasps and bro hugs. Each has a different hair color red blue and brown and one is wearing a court ordered ankle monitoring device.

After a quick 5min taxi ride from the airport we were amazed at the beauty of the lobby. Absolutely gorgeous from floor to ceiling. We were greeted by very friendly staff. From the moment we arrived to 5 days later when we left the staff always made us feel welcome. We stayed in a tower room. The renovations are beautiful but there is no balcony or window that opens. I have never experienced this in the south before. We always enjoy relaxing on the balcony in the mornings but we were not able to do this here. Bed was very comfortable for sleeping but our backs were sore all week. Not sure if it was from the bed or not. Lots of closet space for your clothes and a nice sized fridge to keep your beverages cold. It was a little larger than the average hotel fridge. A C worked great. Room was quiet. Loved that there were upgraded electrical outlets on both sides of the king bed with USB ports every hotel should have these nowadays. Bathroom was small but very clean and great lighting. The hotel is still renovating it is shopping area so only a few restaurants are open. We ate at the Pizzeria one evening. It was pretty good for a meal but I would not rush to go back. Outside there is a pool side restaurant open for breakfast lunch and dinner. Breakfast here is a buffet and it is really good but also quite expensive as a breakfast. We found a little place 5 minute walk away that made a great traditional breakfast for 6. can not remember the name but when you head out front go left a couple places past the Mexican restaurant. Lunch pool side was delicious. Really enjoyed the salads and fish tacos. The menu for this restaurant is offered polside at the quiet pool. The bar pool has a different menu which is refreshing not to have the same thing every day. Love the options. We never ate at the Meat Market. We chose to eat at the neighbouring hotel at the Ruths Chris Steakhouse instead. Pools are lovely. Never had issues finding chairs. Towel service here is by far the best at any hotel I have ever been to. They offer you a white Terry cloth chair cover plus a towel. I have stayed at some really high end resorts and never have I been offered a chair cover. Much more sanitary. No towel cards but they do ask your room number to ensure you are a guest at the hotel. The pool waiters are a fabulous group of staff. Super friendly remember your name and make sure you are taken care of. Drinks are expensive but they are delicious. One of the best Mojitos I have had. The downside of this resort is the protests out front and on the beach. Yes at times they can be noisy but I refused to let it ruin my stay. They can get pretty noisy around the bar pool but it was never constant. Usually about 5 minutes every hour while we were there. It was more annoying the one day that they were running tsunami alarm tests about every 30 minutes. That was not the hotel though so beyond their control. Never made it to the beach.

The staff are undeniably the best characteristic of the hotel they are attentive courteous friendly and gracious. They make your stay 100 better. Also the renovated rooms are a big improvement. I always feel safe in the area. With that said upon arrival we learned two key pieces of information that impacted our stay 1. there is no longer a casino and 2. everywhere you go outside of property lines there are protesters with microphones including about 10 feet from the pool chairs. On the third day of our trip the hotel won a suit against the protesters prohibiting them from using microphones which minimized the disruption however without the music that the hotel blared during the day. they were still relatively loud and annoying. The prices for drinks have almost doubled since the last time we were there which was disappointing especially compared to prices at the Ritz and the Intercon nearby. Part of this iconic hotel is the salsa dancing that happens on weekends. From what I understand the hotel has discouraged locals from coming to dance which was the best part of the night. There was still a crowd on Friday and Saturday but nothing like it used to be. Considering there were only two restaurants open one of which is horrible Marea the drink prices have doubled and you can not walk around the property without listening to protesters they have quite a nerve charging what they did per night for a room. With all of this said they have a lot of work to do to get back on track with this classic hotel. While I do not intend to visit again in the near term I will continue to track their progress and consider returning in the future in years.

It was a bunch of points. around 600 points per night. I now believe that it was the best return on H points that we have ever gotten. We arrived off of the Adventure of the Seas cruise ship at the property around 750AM on Saturday morning. By some miracle we were hoping that possibly one of our rooms might be available. We dropped our bags with the guys out front. Upon entering the hotel we began our check in process with Yaisa. She understood that if possible we would love to get one of our rooms. Since we were staying on points the type of rooms had to be located that matched our point reservation. I had reserved a king room and a 2 queen room. She did some searching and found one of the room types available. We really to have both rooms on the same floor. It looked like that only one of the rooms was ready but she kept looking and found both of our rooms. Yes. Our rooms were 403 a huge king corner room and 421 a nice 2 queen room obviously on the same floor as our king romThe rooms were beautifully finished with top quality furnishings. Our corner room was huge. We found the bathrooms to be very nice. In room fridge and safe. Very comfortable bedding. Nice sized TV that our 3 sons enjoyed. Our room was very quiet. As others have described the pool area was lovely. Very relaxing. The views of the beach also beautiful. Pool personnel were attentive. All of the employees at this hotel were friendly and professional in every way. They made us feel welcomed and appreciated. The hotel has lots of dining choices. We only at at Cana for the breakfast buffet on Sunday morning. We sat out on the open air porch with a view of the pool and ocean. This was the best breakfast buffet that we have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Amazing. The best part for us was that we received 2 complimentary buffets per room. I highly recommend this meal if staying at the hotel. It is around 25 per person and is worth every penny. We had dinner on Saturday night at Lupis Mexican Grill located next door to the hotel. It was delicious. Our stay at this hotel could not have been better. Many times when you leave a cruise ship it is a depressing morning.

Somehow it highlighted every wrinkle in my face.

A centrally located hotel on Isla Verde beach that has sustained the 1958 charm and classic style. Just newly renovated the hotel rooms are brand new several pools restaurants and beach lounge service which was great. Hot tub jets were not working. bummer. You can walk to various restaurants in the area Platos Edith \u2019s Cafe Alambique and several sushi restaurants. My only complaint was the front desk service. I requested a working safe in the room and patio chairs more than once. The one person who helped me with these requests was Lizbeth who was our housekeeper and knew who to call. Rooms were clean with free bottled water mini fridge iron hair dryer and plenty of towels. I found the patio balcony made no sense. It was enclosed with a very tall white fence which did n\u2019t allow for any view. it faced a side alley. Checkin took a long time due to the first day as a Fairmont hotel. It seemed they were understaffed at the front desk because there was normally one maybe two hotel staff there. I \u2019d recommend better customer service given this first class hotel. Entertainment on Saturday night was the best with a live salsa band. Excellent music and atmosphere. The nightclub seemed nice but the Friday night 80s and 90s theme was not played by the DJ.

I also noticed beware that the ocean FRONT villas you can not see the ocean from a first floor unit as it \u2019s blocked by the dunes and or tall bushes.

I stayed at El San Juan Hotel for 3 nights 22 225. My experience was not as good as I always thought it was going to be. I have always wanted to stay at this hotel and thought it was so luxurious and amazing. Never had the chance to stay because in my previous vacations the hotel was booked or something always happened. Well let me tell you that this place is not as luxurious as they want to make it seem. First of all the casino is closed and it has been closed since before hiricane Maria and they do not say anything about it so it was a surprise for me to find out once there that there was no casino. Second the first floor got flooded after a day of rain. The lobby area was slippery and no precautionary measures were taken so guest did not fall. I witnesses a gentleman falling and not even one of the hotel workers approached him to male sure he was ok. Third the hotel does not have 24 hours room service as they advertise. I arrived at 130am and there was nothing open in the hotel to eat not even room service. And fourth no luxury whatsoever this was just an over priced hotel. Oh and let me not forget that they do n\u2019t even offer bell boy service. When I arrived with my two suitcases and my purse I had to bring everything up to my room in the 6thThe service is of because there are some people in the hotel that are super nice like the housekeeper that we had Jose.
