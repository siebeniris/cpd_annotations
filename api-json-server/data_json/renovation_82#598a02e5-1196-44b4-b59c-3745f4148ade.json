Staff are polite and efficient pool area and surrounds are pleasant and relaxing. Breakfast was good with an excellent variety. Gym sports centre located 150 m from hotel was well equipped and clean.

Stayed in Lanai suite the second most expensive in the hotel after moving early from 5 star Wora Bura which was not a good hotel. I was in fact disappointed and let down by them both. Hotel standards are lower in Hua Hin and Cha Am then Bangkok and other Thai destinations. Phuket Krabi and so forth. At Dusit Thani I had a suite with views of ocean but it was in a tired state and around half the staff need proper training not a five star suite experience at all. Club room is not appealing scarce choices and not a pleasant ambiance it felt more like a cafe on a ferry. Will not return to Hua Hin or Cha Am as the islands Phuket and Krabi are much better in terms of general hotel standards and the ocean is much more pleasant. The ocean at Hua Hin is mirky and dark year round. Not a beachside destination. I know that Dusit Thani Hua Hin is nominated for best beach resort in Thailand as well as best family resort. This is a joke there are hundreds of better places might the reason be some political connection. It certainly can not be the quality of the hotel and the beach area swimming is not pleasant. As for service a bit hit and miss. It took four phone calls and call backs to relocate my tv and connect the dvd player. I ordered dvds by phone and twice they got it wrong. Service at restaurant bad and unatentive at club just ok food in general was decent but nothing more. Pool area in need of refurbishment. Staff at pool area again are unatentive. It depends on your expectations I suppose if you are accustomed to Four Seasons you will be let down this is a run of the mill generic hotel. Note that front desk staff actually speak good English many most of the others do not. This was a real pain at times.

This is my second visit. This hotel has been here for some time and since my last visit the rooms have been refurbished to a good and sensible standard. Only downside of a refurb is that the plumbing does not change so the shower flow is just \u201c OK \u201d. Equally the air conditioning seems unable to cool the room lower than about 20C. An electric kettle teapot cups mugs tea and coffee bags milk and sugar are welcome addition in addition to the mini bar. The bed was very comfortable and there was an extensive menu of pillow options. The management show that they actually care about their guest \u2019s welfare as complimentary drinking water is provided. Two bottles daily in the room another two with the turndown service in the evening and chilled bottled water at the pool morning and afternoon is brought around. It is an attractive building with a very large and pleasant lobby and the main restaurant is beautiful \u2013 with lots of glass and a massive chandelier. The four restaurants offer a wide range of cuisines at reasonable prices \u2013 for a quality hotel. They also offered discounts to encourage you to eat with them rather than go into town. Talking of town the hotel is a distance out of the centre of Hua Hin. The good aspect of this is it is quieter and has huge grounds gardens and pool areas compared to hotels in town and there is far less noise and hubris. A walk around the grounds and the large lake with huge fountain and water lilies will take you about 15 minutes. If you are a Swede the Swedish consulate is in an office to the south side of the main hotel \u2013 now that is service. Down side is just that \u2013 you need to get a taxi into town if you want to mix with the masses. A comment on staff behaviour and moral is important. The staff here were all friendly helpful polite and well trained. They even remembered from a previous meal the my wife has a GLUTEN FREE requirement and without asking immediately offered gluten free bread in addition to the standard warm bread basket. TIP. There are two types of lounger at the pools. Both have 6 cm thick cushions and nice fluffy towels are provided. The older loungers are wooden and despite the cushions start feeling uncomfortable if you are at a pool for all day. On the beach and at the beach front newer loungers with man made plastic material covers that flex are FAR more comfortable as the flex and give a little. Another TIP. The hotel has a very sophisticated spa with expensive treatments. Save money AND experience a beach side massage on one of their four beachside beds \u2013 for only 400 baht for 50 minutes. Beachside is a great experience. They often also offer 25 and 30 discounts on these making them an even better bargain. TIP 3. Many guests never spot that there is an additional pool with a swim up bar and much quieter and often empty sun loungers on grass on the north side of the main building accessed by taking the path up the side of the pool boy \u2019s hut. This is my second visit and I can say that I expect to return again.", "offset": [212, 309], "date": "2016-11-30 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "a78b2359-f389-4334-a741-6c7e7bd488e6", "sentence": "Look no further.
