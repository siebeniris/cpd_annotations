I reviewed this hotel about a year ago under remarkably similar circumstances. I went back an reflected on what I said and I had been quite critical on several fronts. Much of it centered around the hotel seeming to be quite empty and the service was several notches below what I would have expected for a 4 star. This time I have to say we found the service excellent on all levels. I had my guard up ready to come up with complaints but the friendly active faces made it all good. Improvements included much more prompt service on arrival baggage valet check in. Baggage delivery was a little slow but adequate. As I said in my previous review I LOVE the trend among some properties toward a single service provider for your pre reserved arrival. This hotel is still stuck in the handoff handoff handoff tip tip tip mode. It was particularly annoying on our departure where the friendly bellman told me at least three times that he would have to leave us for the valet to load our bags. When we made it to the departure area there was no valet in sight AND my car was locked up. This of course ensures that we are going no where until a valet can come load for us and get tipped. LOTS of turf protecting going on and in the end real service suffers. We ate at Crocs loved it and had some excellent libations. Special thanks to Catalina for helping us out and telling us a couple of remarkable stories from Romania. We ordered pizza in one night from a national chain. We had been handed a carry out pizza price from an in house provider and called to get one at 915. Sorry they are closed but room service will bring one for nearly double the price and half the size. We used valet parking and service was mostly very prompt. The pool area is among the best and well kept. The lazy river is a favorite aside from it being a good place for teenage kids to avoid parental oversight. Our room a two queen affair facing the city had a fairly unpleasant view of the vast convention area roof and some city lights in the distance. The golf side is far superior for view. This room 829 seemed larger overall than the king we had on the first trip. We had a small fridge but no microwave. It had all the amenities you expect in the way of coffee service. The bath was very well kept and functioned fine short of a slow drain in the sink. We found plenty of TV choices and climate control was fine. We heard guests upstairs more than I would like. Our neighbor left loudly one morning at 5 but did not cancel his wakeup call for 630. His phone rang several cycles before giving up. In the end you can get this property fairly reliably on the hidden brand online services by selecting the area on the map and hitting 4 star as it is the only one in the area. it is always right around a c note but just like last time between parking and resorts fees et al you will spend north of one six tee in seconds. This is still a good value if you have kids that will take advantage of the pool areas. There is a formal pool area that is clearly designed to discourage kids but it did nothing to discourage insensitive parents from bringing them there. We will definitely return as long as I can catch a price in this range. It is quite convenient to Disney though traffic on I4 can kill that. It is a destination hotel with golf on site and the remarkable resort pool area. There is little to pick from nearby we did Chilis one night and nothing in walking distance. we will hope they can stop the bouncing ball of service people on our next trip.", "offset": [2370, 2429], "date": "2016-03-25", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "7e8df9ee-f264-4281-b68c-3fdff203753e", "sentence": "Awesome hotel and stay.

The massage was great my guy was Tony he was great did a very good massage. After the massage I used the shower awesome with multiple heads plenty of towels shower gear robes lockers slippers razors and everything to take care of yourself. Lots of water and beverages.

They apologized over and over and credited our account with some perks. The housekeeping supervisor came to our door gave plenty of excuses. I like the manner of the front desk manager. W for the fabulous s stuff. The pool lazy restaurant ver water slide and wave pol were outstanding. Lots of levels urge chairs and plenty of unbrelas. 2 hot tubs one by the regular pool and one by the adult pool. We ate at all 4 restaurants. The 2 coife shops were wonderful not over priced and employees were very accommodating. The outdoor restaurant crocs was also god. Waiters and waitresses kept coming around the pool asking if we needed service. Food delicious and again not over priced. The regular restaurant was where we had the buffet breakfast. The lady at the omelette station makes the salsa and pick de galo herself. She was extremely accommodating and friendly. The gotnet jams and hI bey were so fantastic. So we are the freshly baked breads to slice and spread the jams on. Such unique flavors. I wish they sold them. I wish there was not a charge for self parking. 20 per night times 4 nights adds up.

Went to complain and the concierge actually ghosted from his post. We worked in hospitality and understand the difficulties of running a hotel but this level of shoddy service we seldom encounter. Turn down service spotty at best. The room was left filthy and one of the days they showed up at 5 pm as we just came in and were getting ready for the evening event. Rooms probably the most uncomfortable sleep we have ever had a hotel. The whole bed shook anytime either one of us turned waking the other person.

My husband and I stayed at Omni Champions gate 418 421. We enjoyed our first night there. The resort seemed fairly empty. We loved sitting at the bar along with sitting by the fire pit roasting marshmallows. Thursday morning was lovely sitting on our balcony eating breakfast. We then spent the day by the pool. Around 3 pm on Thursday the resort was a totally different place than the day prior. We wanted to leave. There was a large rugby tournament going on across the street and all the teams were staying at this resort. The kids were running wild throughout the resort yelling in the hallways yelling in the rooms next to us at all hours of the night. We complained about the late night noise multiple times and did n\u2019t seem to do any good. We never really saw any parents not sure where they were or even if they knew their children were acting as if they had never been to a nice establishment. Thursday Sunday was a terrible stay because the resort was over crowded by the rugby teams. We sat at the adult pool each day that has a rule 18 y o. The rule was not followed nor enforced so again we had to listen to kids yelling as we were trying to relax. Another issue was there was a DJ blaring music at 9 am on a Saturday across the street at the hotels wedding venue. My husband and I complained about that and the response we received was \u201c it \u2019s not our problem it \u2019s a contracted event we ca n\u2019t do anything about it \u201d.

The good The golf courses were in excellent condition and the practice area was great. Pool areas are really good. The bad I am still fighting over the charges on my bill. Why. Because they changed between the time I booked the stay with a live person online on arrival and then again during the stay and on check out. The people at the front desk had no idea about the rate I had booked with the Omni Resorts reservation people and added an extra charge. Also they did not have a reservation for a second room that I was assured on two separate phones calls with reservations would be made by the resort. On check out my final bill showed a negative balance of 250 which I was told was due to an over charge for something and which I was told would be refunded. It was not. I purchased prepaid greens fees online prior to the trip. On check in and at the course I was given different information as to how that worked resulting in further hassles with my bill. Those were resolved satisfactorily I hope. There was not an indication on the bill of the actual greens fees. but I do not need those types of hassles on vacation. This is an upscale resort. Padraig Harington was giving a demonstration on the practice tee to some Leadbeter golf students and we ran into Megan Rapinoe and some teammates who were there warming up for a match later that night. You would think that they would have these sorts of things figured out. I gave the resort two stars because there are some really good amenities. Absent that I would give them one star. I do not usually write bad reviews. I am an AirBnb owner and I understand how reviews can be often misleading or due to unreasonable expectations. I just felt it necessary to inform both the resort and prospective visitors about my experience. I am sure others have had much better experiences.
