My daughter and I just spent two nights for a girls getaway. We booked a two bedroom suite at a great pre paid rate to have some extra space and peaceful sleeping. We were thrilled by the surprise of having a balcony with a view of the Empire State Building Freedom Tower and the East River. That was such a treat. The suite was large with a living dining area small kitchenette two bedrooms one king one queen and two small but functional bathrooms. We had three large TVs with great channel and in room movie selections. Some wear and tear shows but the rooms were clean. Two lovely members of the cleaning staff a man and woman came to remove the down feather bedding for us which was requested multiple times ahead of our arrival. They were so pleasant and helpful. The woman even noticed a couple of things she touched up from the weekend cleaning crew. We had a breakfast a dinner and late night desserts through room service which were all tasty and delivered quickly by very pleasant staff members as well. Everyone we encountered was warm friendly and polite. They have a complimentary wine bar in the early evening and a little market to grab snacks and drinks from the lobby.

The rooms are dirtyvery musty and old the carpet badly stained. I did not even want to walk on the carpet with my socks on. When we checked in our room had no towels and we were told we would not get them until 5 am the next day. The staff is horribly rude and not accommodating. The room was so warm even after putting the thermostat at 70. When we inquired about it we were told that it was hotel rules not to have the rooms lower than 72. The maintenance man came to replace the filter in the room and when it was removed it looked as if it had not been changed in years. He actually had to get a vacuum cleaner to clean up the floor where all the dirt and grime fell. Parked my vehicle with the valet and when it was returned to me the back quarter panel paint has been eaten through by something that dripped on it for the three days that it was parked with them. Only justification I have received was the parking charges were reversed. This is a brand new vehicle with 300 miles on it that will now need to be repainted.

In summary you can do yourself a favour and book into the Shelburne NYC Afinia. If I am ever back in New York this will be the first place I seek to stay at. If you want a relaxed vibe great service a comfortable clean room all in a central location for exploring New York yet just out of the overly commercialized tourist bustle then stay here. A cool place to stay at when visiting in New York and highly recommended. A bit more detail. We stayed here with our 16 year old daughter between 20th and 27th June 2016. We were greeted warmly and made welcome at reception and given a room on the 14th floor which turned out to be a mini suite with two great queen beds bathroom storage closet with safe and a small kitchenette. Spotlessly clean plenty of windows with a view towards the Chrysler Building. Aircon worked perfectly and windows also opened slightly for fresh air if preferred. The receptionist Andy provided us with a list of local restaurants and also gave us a tourist map which proved invaluable. No pressure to eat in the hotel from the staff just a pleasantly inviting of course we would love to have you. Being on vacation we wanted to try out so many places however we did eat in the hotel one evening and the food was very enjoyable with a good menu. Local restaurants and diners are all great too with a variety of food types and prices to match your many tastes and budgets. We managed to enjoy wine hour a few times in the reception area. Our preference would have been to spend some time in the stunning rooftop bar but we could only visit when the bar was closed due to our daughter being under age. I recommend you go there and in case you are not local remember to take your ID you will be asked for it and wo nt get in without it. WiFi. yes it is free and fast in the reception area of the hotel. So parents can have a wine while teenagers can again contact home base through that interchatweb thing that they do constantlyI must make special mention of the housekeepers. Rooms were immaculate each day and our housekeeper Bibi was a star. She is so pleasant thoughtful and happy. Always smiling she made sure our room was just perfect for us each and every day. Thanks Bibi Shelburne NYC are so lucky to have you on their staff. Location suited us perfectly as we were able to visit all tourist attractions without any problems. A short walk in a pleasant part of NYC to Grand Central and underground lines made getting about easy. We usually walked all the way to Time Square which was only about 15 minutes from Grand Central along 42nd Street. Passing New York Public Library and the gorgeous Bryant Park. Stopping in the park for a relaxing coffee is recommended. There is another subway near the hotel in the opposite direction to Grand Central at Lexington and 33rd. It is a good option if you have been out on the tourist trail and want to get back to Murray Hill area without walking or taking a taxi they can be a touch expensive but not overly so if you are travelling in a group.", "offset": [2631, 2692], "date": "2016-08-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "cd2e1413-2bd1-40a4-b0c6-b9924478ee2a", "sentence": "We went to NYC for a family trip.

It was a beautiful spot with lots of areas to sit and look at the view and relax. The hotel is very close to Grand Central Station and the Empire State Building we took it all in. We also walked to MOMA from the hotel and then on to Central Park and the Met the Theater District is also close by and lots of good choices for restaurants nearby we also tried the French Fry basket 3 kinds of fries at the hotel restaurant Rare looked like a good menu. The rooms are spacious. even ours with just a single Queen bed comfy and clean but a bit worn. mattress was a bit uncomfortable by morning time.
