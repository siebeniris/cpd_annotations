My fiance and I stayed overnight for a short weekend of relaxation and we very much enjoyed our stay. The room was very clean the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice shower instead of a tub which I am not sure it is typical of the rooms because I believe we were in a handicap friendly room but we appreciated it. The pool is nice with cabanas set up around the perimeter it seems as though you can reserve them as well as plenty of seating options. The hotel bar is well stocked and the employees there seemed knowledgeable and friendly. If you do not mind spending a little extra and enjoy watching the sunset you should opt for a room with a view. the sunset over there lake is absolutely gorgeous and the rooms face in the perfect direction to get an awesome view of the sunset over the lake. You will not regret it. The hotel is also in a great location with several restaurants the movie theater and the harbor docks all within a very short walking distance. Book a boat cruise if you have the time. The only reason I am giving the hotel four stars is because I felt that the main hotel staff was being dismissive of us. I know that we look young so we often encounter people treating us as less than because they think we are barely past our teenage years but I assure you that they would be wrong in that assumption. You should always treat all paying customers with equal respect and courtesy and I simply felt like that was not happening. There was also an incident during breakfast where we were largely ignored by the staff until we finally managed to flag down an employee who I am pretty sure was not even actually supposed to be dealing with our table. Even the floor manager ignored us. Overall though the hotel was amazing and I am certain that anyone who actually looks their age will be treated more appropriately than we were.", "offset": [485, 620], "date": "2018-08-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "47276ab5-8c61-47e2-bae7-fed667bee998", "sentence": "Beautiful hotel.

The hotel was fine and the employees were mostly polite and helpful. There is a shopping center and movie theater along with restaurants close by. The lake is nice and the onsite restaurant is OK. Our main issue involved the various parties held at this location. There was absolutely no where to park. When I asked the valets where guests could park I was told to ask the front desk. Really. Go inside and ask where to park. We went to dinner instead assuming things would die down afterward. We were very wrong as it only got worse. The second time I asked valet parking what to do a different gentleman was very helpful. After explaining that I needed to get my young children to sleep in preparation for a swim meet the next day he offered to take my keys and handle it for me. I was so grateful for his kindness.

All of the staff in the restaurant were amazing very attentive and exceeded expectations. Gerardo specifically stood out as well as other helpful staff at the front desk.

We planned my daughters pool party at this hotel specifically due to the location and year round pool. We made the long drive and were only notified at checkin that the pool was closed only after my daughter was excited to look at the pool and was told she could not go look. I made notes specifically at booking to ensure the room was clean and there was hair on the pillows. The hair and dusty my film throughout the room was very obvious and could have been seen with even the smallest amount of detail. The coffee shop was closed an hour after the opening time and the lady just said \u201c sorry just got here \u201d. Side note she smelt heavily of cigarette smoke.

Ate at bar for dinner and had breakfast next two mornings food was really good. Cinemark theatre and other things within walking distance. Temperature was nt that bad like low 60s so I was the only one that seemed to use the pool. During warm weather I bet it fills up early. Good amount of chairs and lounge couches but I would still go down early and claim a spot early when weather gets nicer. what else there is in room dining services but I did nt use.

The room is pretty standard so I do not think the rate was justified. The housekeeping was lacking. We had to ask for the babys Pack n Play even though it was in the reservation. We also had to call for housekeeping when do not disturb was not on our door.

To make matters worse our key had to be reprogramed several time during our overnight stay and even the Hilton Honors ap access did not work.

I do not know if it is the time of year or not but there is absolutely no parking available in the evenings. Also we were told to request late checkout on the morning of departure instead of in advance. Other hotels have allowed me to pay for this in advance so that was different.
