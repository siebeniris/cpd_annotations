I was at a conference at the convention center and this hotel which is just across the street was one of the least expensive recommended by the organizers but still not cheap. I stayed for five nights. Before arrival I tried to contact the hotel to get some information but the general policy is that Hilton hotels do not advertise their direct emails I did not want to phone because I was on a different continent 9 time zones away. I finally manages to convince the chat rep on the Hilton site to give me an email to write to and the hotel never replied. This however was my only complaint and it is about Hilton not this particular hotel. When I arrived check in was fast and efficient. When I asked to be on a low floor one of the reasons I emailed I was told that that meant giving up my upgrade to a premium suite. I agreed and I must say that if my room was a standard the premiums must be out of this world. The room I did get was huge a very big bed a kitchenette and a sitting room with sofas desks fridge microwave coffee maker iron plenty of closet and drawer space. Standard wifi worked fine. Breakfast was nice two things some fresh veggies would have been nice and the staff cleared away the tables too fast I went to get something like more coffee and got back to the table to find it cleared away with someone else already seated. there is a mangers reception every evening with free drinks and snacks.

Clean and spacious. Unfortunately staffing levels seemed inadequate to the number of guests so everything happened really slowly from check in to parking to hospitality. Check in was slow getting a drink at the bar was slow trying to take advantage of the happy hour was glacially slow. The final straw was the parking. Because there is no onsite parking and we were uncertain of the neighborhood we accepted the valet parking option. The valets were incredibly slow delaying us but more than 40 minutes on our departure and they were rude to boot. I am docking the hotel one star for generally slow service and one star for the ineptitude and attitude of the valets who may not be under the hotels direct control but whose treatment of their guests reflects poorly on the hotel.

This is my first ever review but I felt the need to leave this review since this hotel is not cheap and it was not great. We love Embassy Suites we always try to stay there when possible. We love the convenience of the breakfast and Managers Reception. We also love the pool. This was a huge disappointment. The maid service was horrible. They literally did not bother to fold up the hideaway couch that we half folded in they did not empty the trash and they left out all glasses and did not refresh anything. From what we could tell all they did was make the beds We complained 3 days in a row. It did not make a difference. In the end they took 100 off our bill. Big deal. The lines. The breakfast and the Managers Reception had long lines. Breakfast was not as bad but it was not good. The Managers Reception was a joke. The line was literally into the lobby there was only 1 bartender. Make sure you get 2 drinks when you get to the front because the lines do not improve. Parking was 47 a day.
