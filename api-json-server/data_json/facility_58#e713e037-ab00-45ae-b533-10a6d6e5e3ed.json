We did have an incident with theft. My husband and daughter were taking a picture in the lobby and a 15 year old boy tried to steal our backpack and shopping bags they were literally right next to us. We called security and saw the boy and his mom in the lobby. The mom said nothing and was obviously in on it. Security made a report and it was great how they handled the situation. The only reason I am saying this is please do not leave your bags alone for one minute and do not bring anything of value like cameras or money to the beach. We also had some beach hats stolen when they were left at our chairs. My only complaint is outside people tend to use the pool and hot tub. I think the Sheraton could do a better job monitoring who uses the pool. The wrist bands are a good idea but they need someone to enforce the rules.

In Experience Tarnish Our Stay. We stayed here over New Years. Overall the facility and the staff were great but our check in expereince nearly ruined our stay. We booked through a travel agent who suggested since we were in Hawaii island hopping for 10 days thay we should save some money by getting one room with 2 queen beds for my wife 18 and 22 year old kids and myself. Afteral we were not there to stay in our room and we were getting a condo when we got to Kauai. So when we arrived they were understaffed at the check in desk and my wife waited 30 minutes until it was her turn. Then she was told our room only had one king bed. She explained our reservation which was made in July was for 4 adults. She was told they could provide us with a roll away. She explained that was not acceptable. She was told that is why she should not use a thrid party travel agent and should have booked direct and a room for 4 adults is just a request made by the travel agent and did not guarantee 2 beds. By the way our travel agent has booked dozens of rooms at this hotel. Have one of your kids sleep in the king bed with you and the other can sleep on the roll away. There were no other rooms available. We asked to speak to the manager and he said he was the manager. Eventually one of his employees overhead the discussion and said she had a room with 2 queen beds. He seemed reluctant to offer the room but finally relented. The room had an obscured view of the ocean versus what we had reserved but at least we had 2 beds. He was condescending throughout the process and never showed any empathy. I travel a lot and have never had an expereince with a front desk approaching this experience. We contacted our travel agent who contacted the Sheraton. We eventually received a VM apology from guest relations which I think was a weak response for the horrible customer experience we had.

I was so excited to stay at the Sheraton Maui for my Honeymoon. I picked it so that we could enjoy the resort feel and my husband and I could just relax knowing everything was taken care of. We paid more than we would normally pay because we were interested in the amenities a resort provides. I really wanted it to be a special trip for my husband. Our first two days were relatively uneventful but not without hiccups. When we arrived the staff was pleasant but there was no lei or little special treat to make you get into the resort mood that I have experienced at less expensive Hawaiian resorts in the past. I let them know it was our honeymoon and we were n\u2019t even congratulated. We found our room and it was fine except that the AC is either on full blast or not at all. We went down to the pool and enjoyed one of the pool bar restaurants where the waitress was very nice and gave us some great recommendations for places to visit. We did notice as everyone else has mentioned that there were not enough pool chairs at the pool. The next day we noticed a steep decline in service at the restaurants. Our waiter in the morning seemed distracted and missed my husbands order. Finally we would n\u2019t care but we were in a hurry to get to the ferry and could n\u2019t wait for them to cook it for him. The waiter was very nice and offered for him to get whatever he wanted from the buffet but my husband was feeling grumpy and we had to go. The next day we tried to eat at the buffet again and my husband enjoyed his food but they ran out of a lot and had long wait times to replenish it 10 minutes for more oatmeal and no one came to refill our coffee or water which was frustrating because again we were in a relative hurry and the buffet was rather expensive. The next day we skipped breakfast at the hotel and ate off property but we came back to the bar restaurant we had previously enjoyed. This time the staff seemed again distracted no one came to greet us once we did flag someone down and ordered it took a while to get our food and no one came to refill our water or our drinks. The man who was working was covering too many tables which I think was the same issue at the buffet. The entire experience up to this point was not living up to what we expected service was lacking it did n\u2019t feel special and every little thing was an upcharge or a hassle. But we were still ignoring the bad and just enjoying the vacation and Maui in general. The next morning things got much worse. We were up early to take a day tour and noticed a paper posted in the elevator that said there was a work stoppage and that housekeeping service would be effected as well as the restaurants. It was worded in a way that made it seem like services would be slightly impacted and did n\u2019t spell out what was actually about to happen. When we got back from our trip there no more information slipped under our door or left in a message. There was trash left down our hallway and a pile of towels and toiletries on a table near the elevator. What the strike actually meant is that there is no housekeeping service to the rooms you can pick up your own towels though. All the bars and restaurants are closed. They do have a bunch of what appear to be teenagers serving a limited menu of maybe 7 items in one of the buildings and running the buffet. No one from the hotel thought that maybe they should consider people with dietary restrictions when making up their menu. The kids working the room seem nice but burgers in take out containers being served with plastic cutlery is n\u2019t what I signed up for when I paid more to stay at a nice resort. When you come back from a tour you do n\u2019t want to arrange for transportation to other hotels so you can eat somewhere else. The closing of the pool bar saddens us the most because we came here for the pool and planned to spend the last few days of our honeymoon out there enjoying the amenities and relaxing before heading back to work. Tonight they left trash bags by our door without any explanation. Judging from the debris in the hallway I think we are supposed to bundle up dirty towels or maybe the trash and throw it out there. It would be nice if they told us or updated us at all. I went to the desk last night to ask what they were going to do to make this better for the guests and all they offered was to waive the 26 daily resort fee. I feel like this is a good beginning but they act like not having these amenities is n\u2019t really a big deal and that they \u2019re doing us a favor by offering anything. I think that \u2019s BS. People paid more to stay here precisely for the things that are no longer available and the price difference when I was booking between hotels with fewer amenities and this resort was much more than 26 a day. I plan to approach the front desk again tomorrow and will amend this review if they do anything to rectify the situation. I bear no ill will to those on the picket lines.

The rooms are okay but we were concerned by the tiny bugs seen all over the bathroom I realize it is tropical weather and bugs live here but not usually so many in the room and the fact that someone else \u2019s earring was still on the counter when we checked in. There were 2 days we did not receive room service at all and we had to call twice to get extra towels as there are 4 of us but we were routinely left 3 towels. The beds are the MOST uncomfortable thing I \u2019ve slept on. Definitely not Mariot quality we are used to. You had to huddle in the center of the bed hard to do when sharing. because if you moved toward the edge it just collapsed and you would roll off. Kids repeatedly fell out of bed. Lucky I loved Hawaii so much as we were all exhausted from such poor sleep. They advertised all these hotel activities like hula lessons and lawn games. We showed up at the Shaka shack each day and no activities ever happened. When we asked staff they acted bewildered until I showed them the paper everyone is handed at check in with the schedule on it. Then they claimed activities would n\u2019t happen that week. The pool side restaurant is only open until 3 pm so if you think you will lay by the pool until the evening and eat and drink think again. We ordered chairs and an umbrella to be put on the beach first thing. Then you go stand in line for the guys helping set it all up. The line took about 30 min 2 guys setting up dozens of chairs and umbrellas while their manager watched only to get to the front and be told they were out of chairs and umbrellas and we would have to ask for a refund. If they present these in the morning do n\u2019t they know how many chairs they haveThe interior restrooms for lobby spaces and buffet constantly had toilets clogged or were flooding not sure if they were having pipe issues. this was 3 out of 7 days of our stay that most of the bathrooms were not useable. Upon checkout we had 350 worth of spa services on our account that we never went to or booked. Upon investigation they charged someone else \u2019s services to our room. They also charged us 30 a night for parking which was frustrating since we did n\u2019t rent or have a car and only used Uber on the island. Again someone else had charged to our room. This is concerning it is that easy or confusing to charge to the room. GO OVER YOUR BILThe property is beautiful but the service and the amenities are definitely NOT worth what they charge. A great job keeping up the facade but a disappointment once inside.

There has to be a better way for the Sheraton to mange guests who place pool towels out and then never show up. So frustrating since shade is at a premium.
