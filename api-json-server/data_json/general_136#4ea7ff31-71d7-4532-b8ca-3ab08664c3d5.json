This hotel is located in a region with a large number of successful companies including IT companies defense contractors and telecoms providers and from the outside looks the part large building prominent location and prices at the top end of the mid range hotel brands Mariot Hilton etc. It has a lot of amenities including a large lounge area off the main lobby with a bar and a small restaurant where they serve breakfast. It also has a business center fitness room and pool. Overall pretty much what what you might expect. I was disappointed with the charges for incidentals though 3 for a bottle of water provided in my room when many hotels will provide that for free these days room service charges that seemed much higher than normal for this grade of hotel 15 gratuity for a breakfast buffet that might be 10 in a lot of similar hotels. Also I arrived on a Sunday evening after a long drive only to find that the pool is only open for a few hours on a Sunday and closed at 60pm when I had been looking forward to a swim and maybe a soak in the hot tub to unwind. Looking in the hotel information I saw that the pool is only open on other days for relatively limited periods of time too when most hotels I use more typically have the pool open from early morning through to at least 100pm. I also discovered that the wall between my room and the one next to it was paper thin. I could hear conversations that the people next door were having and later that night when they were enjoying each others company so to speak it was so noisy that it kept me awake. The following morning I was woken up by the same people when I think someone jumped onto the bed it slammed into the wall and I actually felt my bed shake. I really do not think the people in the next room were actually being particularly noisy. it was just that the wall was so insubstantial. More what you had expect in a low budget motel than a brand like Hyat. Having made those comments overall the hotel was not terrible just less than I had expected given the location and the star rating. If you are there for work and you need to be close to one of the local companies it is probably a reasonable option but I would shop around and see what else is on offer before making the booking.", "offset": [1767, 1856], "date": "2015-08-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "a504ebfd-1c1e-4348-8939-ecb64e4c7b0b", "sentence": "Not your average Hyat.

Also annoying is that we booked for 3 adults and 1 child and they could not find us a room with 2 double beds and could only offer a king bed with a pull out sofa bed. We checked 4 pm so I can not believe they are out of rooms. The reason I was given is the they have a wedding and are full but that should not be my problem. The pool is decent with a few toys for kids that is a nice touch. Front desk service is what u would expect except the roller bed they promised never came.

I booked at the Hyat Regency Fairfax on a staycation for my birthday and was instantly upgraded to a suite which was a great way to start my stay. The room was at the end of the hotel which has a cool wrap around window providing a unique room shape that I really enjoyed. The lobby faces the restaurant bar area which has a nice open plan and a very high ceiling creating a sense of grandeur that most hotels in this 3 class do not have. The beds were very comfy and had ample down pillows. Soaps and other such amenities were from KenetMD very nice. Shower had excellent water pressure and the room itself was immaculately clean. There was a safe iron ironing board and a fridge stocked with the usual beverages. The WiFi was 100 free in rooms and it worked great. They do have an ultra high speed option for 5 for business travelers who need better download speeds which is totally reasonable but the average person will do just fine with the free service. There are plenty of stores and food within walking distance although nothing too fancy. The area itself is peaceful and well presented. What really stood out was the staff particularly Bianca at the front desk. She is awesome. I felt like a family guest because of her warm service. I checked in at 3 pm and came down to the lobby at around 1030 and Bianca was still there. It was amazing that she remembered me after checking in people for hours on end and gave me a little birthday treat on the house. that is the kind of thing that ensures a return visit. If I had to suggest a couple of improvements1. The entrance is odd. it is very narrow and the passageway from the door to the front desk passes by the elevators on the way making for an awkward colliding of guests in the cramped hallway. There was no doorman or anyone at all by the front door to welcome guests to the hotel. Not the best first impresion2. The spa was out of order while I was there spa being the hot tub. I spoke to the lifeguard and it had been out of order for over a week. I love a good hot tub dip when I stay at hotels and so it was disappointing that they had neglected to fix an advertised amenity for so long3. There were a relatively small offering of channels on the TV and the first few were so fuzzy they were pretty un watchable. Very non HD in general felt like a 1990s TV experience.
