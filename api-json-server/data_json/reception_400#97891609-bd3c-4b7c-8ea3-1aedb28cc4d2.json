However the hotel was very large and beautiful on the inside. I loved the large teepee floor lamps in the lobby and the color scheme throughout. It had a very warm feeling. There were also a couple of nice courtyards with seating including one that contained one of the pools. The hotel had a barber a coffee and pastry stand and a full scale restaurant as you would expect for this caliber of hotel. The restaurant provided good service but the quality of the food was just \u201c OK\u201d. The hotel housed several pools both indoor and outdoor. We decided not to use the facilities due to the number of kids in all the pools. Each floor had a large central seating area next to the elevators. There were four hallways to the rooms that radiated out from there. The rooms were very large. I really liked the entry into the room with the table next to the door to lay down keys and wallet. The placement of the table made it appear a little more grand. The room had a significantly large sized sofa. The bed was very comfortable. The tiled and partially glassed in shower stall was a classy touch. No door to close and you just walked into it. Very nice and modern hardware in the shower and vanity. The TV reception was good. They offered a number of channels with a mixture of HD and analog reception. The wifi signal was somewhat weak. We asked for a refrigerator to keep sodas in and were accommodated. The hotel is located adjacent to Expressway 53 major shopping and numerous restaurants representing all price points.", "offset": [478, 558], "date": "2015-07-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a0e0f75b-d35b-4173-8c11-1e03b5f105a3", "sentence": "Good choice in the Chicago suburbs for business and leisure travelers.

Trouble started at check in. I reserved prepaid for 2 rooms for 2 nights. Matthew could only find 1 room until I looked up the confirmation noticed one room had a middle initial one did not. he then found the second room. When I booked these rooms months ago I requested a rolaway bed adjoining rooms. Mathew told us that the hotel was oversold he could not accommodate our requests. He said if they had received our requests they would have accommodated us or contacted us of the situation. Hotelscom was contacted. This was very inconvenient. I requested the rolaway because I have 3 kids as a result my son had to sleep on the floor. The adjoining rooms were because we needed to be downtown Chicago early for a convention. Our friends were going to be adjoining so they would be with the kids. As a result my friend had to come over early stay with my kids. Neither party seemed to care that they put us in a stressful situation. They both blamed each other. They did not offer us a discount coupon or even a coffee. If I would not have already prepaid this I would have left. We made the best of a bad situation but we will not be back. I guess when you spend over 500 you are not appreciated as a valued customer. Bad customer service from both companies. The hotel was also understaffed for being full. There were dirty dishes on the outdoor tables for days multiple garbage cans were overflowing onto the ground. The only nice feature was the outdoor pool.", "offset": [1241, 1282], "date": "2017-06-09", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "5aa2991a-5ebb-4d58-b0f9-d38b69c714ac", "sentence": "does not live up to the Regency name. I guess I associate Hyat Regency as one of the more upscale names in the Hyat line up. but this facility did not quite meet those expectations. First off the hotel is practically hidden with no signage and is only 4 or 5 stories tall so it is barely visible and you could drive right by without realizing you passed a Hyat or any major hotelThe lobby is airy but without any significant design theme or cohesiveness. Just sort of cold with furniture arranged in the middle and sort of placed haphazardly heading to the conference rooms. The conference area seemed modern and well kept. There was a restaurant bar in the lobby and a snack bar but I did not see a gift shop. Avis had an office in the lobby as well. The rest of the facility is very tired looking. Furniture is very low end in both the rooms and the public areas. Color scheme was out of the 1980s. We booked a Jr suite which had the feeling of a large motel room. The first room reeked of cigarette smoke and the front desk moved us to another room which smelled better just the mildest hint of cigarettes. The first room had an alcove with no door as a closet the second just had an armoire. The bathrooms are very small with just enough room to squeeze in and shut the door. Thr sink countertop is made of river stones encased in Lucite which may work better in a setting that is more rural or outdoorsy. There was no tub just a shower with a glass wall stretching half way. You have to reach into the shower and get hit with cold water when turning it on. There was no shaving mirror. Everything was clean ish but old and tired looking. The bed was comfortable but could have used a few more pillows. There were 2 flat screens tvs ample lighting and outlets to charge all electrical devices. Hallway noise was not noticeable but the adjacent room could be heard easily. Climate controls varied a little in the two rooms. The first had a fan that could be controlled separately from the temperature but the second room only had temp control. There was a safe and a dorm fridge in the room. The fridge sat by itself on the floor like it would in a dorm and made quite a bit of noise. The safe was in a cabinet as you would expect. The staff was helpful which got them 3 stars otherwise I would have given it 2Overal this property was a poor value and was not inexpensive.

My son wanted to go to LEGO Discovery Center so we decided to get a hotel room because it is at least an hour out from where we live. When I booked the room I intended to book it from Saturday to Sunday however I made the mistake and booked it from Sunday to Monday. On Saturday when I realized the mistake I called guest Services and even though they were busy due to Mecam Auto Show and a youth sports team without hesitation they made the change. Our room was on the lower level When we entered the room it had a slight stint of mildew but was appeared clean. As I mentioned earlier there was a kids sports team and for some reason the coaches nor the parents could seem to keep the kids under control they allowed them to roam and play in the halls which was very disruptive. After my first call to the front desk they quickly moved us to another floor. The second room was great the floor was nice and quiet room was clean and it smelled great. As far as the overall hotel upon arrival you notice the hotel for its modern beauty. They have a indoor and out door pool. The hotel also has dinning options as well. The rooms have modern decor with coffee essentials safe tv etc. I do n\u2019t know if other rooms offer fridge and microwave but mines did not. The bathrooms were very small if you open the door you ca n\u2019t Acess the shower you have to keep door close to get in and out. Checking in and out was quick.

The staff was super helpful and did not seem at all annoyed with the fact that I clearly do not stay in hotels very often and as such ask a lot of annoying questions. They also put a huge effort into staying environmentally friendly giving you discounts on appetizers and free coffee if you make them do less laundry. The whole place is incredibly clean and chic without being overpowering. The views are nt the greatest but given how awesome everything else was I am not terribly heartbroken about it.

If you are unfortunate enough to get a room directly over the pavilion I hope you like loud party music well into the evening.
