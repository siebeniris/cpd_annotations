It is difficult to find another hotel with better location than Radison Blu Royal Viking in Stockholm. Next to the Central Station with immediate access to the Metro train and Airport Express train. Our worry was the size of the room which few guests had complained. However the interior of the room was well planned. The thin closet functioning mini bar with complimentary coffee tray and safety box were well placed. The work desk with chair and sofa are suitable for multi function. Being a businessman hotel the location does come first with even slightly less generous in space. We stayed for 5 nights and coped with the limited space but also appreciate the well designed room and furnishing.

The hotel is right next to Grand Central train station so you can take the Arlanda Express from the airport assuming you can manage your luggage on the train and get off right at the hotel which makes it convenient and more economical in travel. Taxi rides are expensive. The hotel is located in a 5 minute walking distance to old town. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops on the block and in walking distance. The breakfast is a little pricey but it has a lot of variations to offer all of them good. The main issue or inconvenience was or still is the elevator. They have two elevators down and are in the process of being replaced. We were told it takes months to get them delivered and installed. Just allow time for getting the elevator with luggage. The check in staff and front desk were all very friendly and helpful. The skybar has a great view but service is a little slow when crowded. The first floor bar lounge was comfortable and pleasant.

There are a lot of things to say about this hotel after spending a weekend here but all in all i have to say i m disapointed in many ways. I will try to explain why. First of all the staff is not very serviceminded in my opinion. I feel a bit like i m disturbing them like at the reception when i checked in the lady at the desk was talking to her colegue and not even giving me acknowledge of my existence until she was ready. Annoying. A small nod or a smile would have helped. The car park. they have som sort of consierge service so they just take your car and park it. You sign a receipt but none verify the car for damage. I am not comfortable with that so i chose to photo all of my car before they parked it for me. What definately was not good was that it took 25. minutes for them to fetch my car when i checked out. The breakfast. it was good and what you expect from a hotel like this. What i did nt like was that the scrambled eggs were made from powder the bacon was more or less boiled useless tools in the cereal bags and very crowded in rush hour. The logistics of the breakfast was not very well thought through meaning everybody was walking aroung. and when its hundreds of people there. I guess you get the picture. The rooms and the beds were good nice and clean. And I have to give credit to the cleaning staff they really were service minded and smiling whenever you met them. The best thing about this hotel is the location its dead center of the city right next to the central station. Very good starting point for any activity. So if we come back a weekend to Stockholm this hotel will be on the list of hotels we could stay at but not at the very top of that list.", "offset": [1311, 1425], "date": "2018-10-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "61e5d46c-3ebb-4447-bd33-0e46024a3946", "sentence": "Good.

The service was poor too. Sometiemes when I called the receprion no one picked up until I gave up.
