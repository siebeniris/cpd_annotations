My partner an I stayed at the cosmopolitan the last week of October and what an amazing time we had. When we first arrived and checked in staff were very helpful and friendly. We went straight up to the room and just wow we had a one bedroom terrace with fountain view. It had a kitchen area lounge area a desk a big comfy bed two TVs toilet in separate room sinks and big mirror shower and the Japanese spa where you could see the fountains out the window then the balcony where you could see the Belagio fountains and it was just incredible. The amount of pictures I have of the fountains is crazy just because it was that good. On the 2nd night our safe broke and someone came straight up to fix it the next day. Only one pool was open so we went down to that but because of all the other buildings cover it up it was freezing so we just got back into the jacuzi which was much nicer. I loved the hotel so much because it is so sparkly the chandelier bar was my fav then the sparkly car and I loved the shoe you could get in that was ace. It was so funny aswel coz on our 1st day we went for a wander around the hotel in the morning about 8 am and everyone was still out from the night before but that is just Vegas for you. The hotel is that big we did not even see it all which means we will have to come back again. I had room service one night and the foods lovely and they have a little cafe bar in the lobby too which had a variety of food to choose from and the ladys were lovely there. This hotel is very much aimed at the younger generation I think so I loved it. The bartenders were very good too and very friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others I can not wait to re visit in the future.", "offset": [750, 921], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "a2532e52-42fe-436c-ac90-06b54c584d08", "sentence": "Beautiful hotel and classy However it was ridiculously priced. 24 for a one ounce margarita by the pool 78 for 4 cans of corona charged us 400 extra for an extra person and a 250 smoking fee.

After staying in 12 hotels in Vegas in the last 6 years Cosmopolitan is the best choice for me Just a Short Disclaimer I am not a High Roller and not a Major Suite guy Location It has the best location there is going out to the strip directly 2 4 m and not like some hotels 10 20 min to get to the strip and it has all the major hotels close to it and liked bridge to Planet Hollywood and Crystal \u2019s mall that are connected to the ARIA Reception. Well it \u2019s a premium hotel so in every hotel on the check in time and weekends it \u2019s crowded Service was always kind professional only one time the room was not ready and I waited 45min for it to be cleaned but was same like Belagio Wyn and others just normal when you go out at 12 and check in at 2 When available always get upgraded to a nicer room Rooms. There is a lot of complaints about the room cleaning to be honest I have stayed in 7 different rooms and 3 different types of room levels all of them was clean towels were ok I always call for more towels because I like to shower before and after the pool when I come back and act always I get 2 4 more towels even if I leave the room they are waiting on the bed Noise. Vegas will be Vegas what can you do the Belagio fountains has a major noise but it is what it is and I like it you can hear it over the Belagio it self and other hotels around it in the summer you can hear the Marquee club music but the force everybody in around 130am do n\u2019t think the noise is different from the Paris hotel party \u2019s or another club that are Semi outside and 50 of the hotels has outside party \u2019s or music Strangers It \u2019s true that the Cosmo does not have security to check for room keys in the elevators but you do need a key to operate the elevators and I did n\u2019t see anyone wondering in the floors they have security patrols there also in the other hand friends that come to visit in other hotels you have to go down and get them personally so I say 5050 on this one. Maybe it \u2019s just luck but In the 5 times I was there and multi orders for different rooms everything was ok. Clean kind staff got everything that I wanted and lot \u2019s more like free tickets and casino money to play and I am not a high roller or a major suite guy that you would say Ah that \u2019s why I even took my time for telling the manager of the front desk about kind and good help I got from there staff. Restaurants. Ben to all of them great food not cheap but definitely awesome View From most of the rooms you have a great view to the strip and Belagio fountains the best view in Vegas but like every hotel it \u2019s extra to get a better view I was in many hotels in a nice upgraded room that has a view to nothing. So to make a long story short if you like high level modern and chick place to be this is the place for you Been there for Pleasure Family and Business If you like quite more mature old environment I suggest the heavy hotels which are great like Belagio wyn or even spa resort like Elara and Vdara been in all of them they are great but not the style I am looking for.", "offset": [884, 1253], "date": "2015-01-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "24106a8b-06da-40ef-a5fb-eb37b40915a7", "sentence": "Perfect Fun Chic and Young.

Living room had an L shaped couch large flatscren even a wet bar that was stocked with lasers to tell if we took anything out of it to bill us. I enjoyed my stay the only complaint would be that I did not receive a free buffet pass like I did the last time I stayed at the Cosmo. apparently they have removed that from the Platinum benefits.

The hotel pools have fake palm trees which is completely tacky and only one or two cocktail waitresses on staff. This time of year only one of the three pools is open and I understand that we got lucky with 78 degrees however the pool was not very nice regardless. Moreover the restaurants are hard to get into and the Japanese restaurant we tried was only ok. I had some uni niguiri miso wakeme salad and a lobster roll eh. The only good thing about the hotel was the cafe va bene which serves Ily cafe and has good pastries bagels fruit gelato.

Having stayed at The Aria for the prior week before a 2 night stay at the Cosmo i was initially worried that i had made a bad choice by only selecting this hotel for 2 nights. Let me start by saying that i made the right decision. Aria is 10 times better than the Cosmo. If the Cosmo did nt have the Terrace Fountain View rooms it would get 2 stars from me. My reasoning behind this1. Pools big walking distance between towers2. Small Pols3. Freezing cold pool water4. Small and inadequete fitness centre in the east tower5. Strange taps turn left and one turns right in sink shower bathMany escalators big casino but not quite sure what the property is trying to be. It has a weird vibe and although clean trendy and nice it is just a miss for me personally. Aria has the automatic ipad system for the blinds and everything else. Aria has a MASSIVE pool area with 3 pools hundreds of chairs all in one place near a starbucks and juice place a massive gym. Cosmo has no automation in the room is very very pricey two pools in two towers which are both TINY only around 200 chairs at the pool for two towers with probably 1000 people in them and a really poor gym in the east tower. This is what you should do Stay at the aria for a few nights then cosmo for 2 nights and you will see what i mean.

I thought the Cosmo and I were really going to click but sadly it was not meant to be. There are really only a few positives about staying here. It is in a central location especially if like us you are seeing a show at Planet Hollywood next door which has great direct access via an elevated walkway. Another is that there are some really unique places to eat drink here even if they are few and far between. Holsteins has monster shakes The Chandelier bar has the famous mouth numbing Verbana cocktail hidden menu item and Egslut for breakfast. And lastly but most importantly the rooms are out of this world. We had the One Bedroom Terrace with a Fountain View. The room was huge with a seperate sitting area large bathroom with a jacuzi and a huge terrace that overlooked the entire strip. I loved that it came with robes which not all Vegas hotels do and the housekeeping were really great with any requests we had for extra shampoo etc. We were at the 59th floor and I dare you to find me a better more elevated unobstructed view of the strip at any other hotel. It does n\u2019t get much beterThe room very nearly made me want to give this hotel a great rating but there were too many pesky little negatives that kept bringing down my opinion of this hotel compared to others. While I loved the restaurants I wish there were a bit more quick options like Egslut. Sometimes you do n\u2019t have a reservation so you ca n\u2019t visit the restaurants on level 3 and you do n\u2019t want a sit down place like Holsteins. I also was not a fan of the crowd at this hotel. We had to pass by club Marquee a lot to get to the elevators for our room because most of the things we did were on level 2. You get a very messy drunk loud gathering of people at all hours around there and there are no security guards by the elevators so anyone can just follow you up. There were a lot of trashed women making a bee line for the bathroom to hurl and a lot of loud drunk men that made the walk to our room just gross. There was also a constant reek of Marajuana on our balcony. Smoke all you want especially in a common area like the Casino just not by me and my private room. The fart smell from the joint totally ruins the ambiance. My husband and I have stayed at 5 hotels along the strip at this point including the Cosmo and all of them being 4 Star or higher establishments. I thought for the price and the look of th place this would top them all but sadly it has some weaknesses. The staff were super nice and the room was unforgettable. However my husband and I found ourselves constantly wanting to walk to other hotels to spend our time eating gambling. etc instead of staying on our property.
