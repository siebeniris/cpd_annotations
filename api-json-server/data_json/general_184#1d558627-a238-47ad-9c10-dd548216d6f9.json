We stayed two nights in the FCC we had a suite and a deluxe room. the suite was lovely the deluxe room good too. there are few things that could be improved. the first one is that outside our Suite the cleaner parked her trolley so from 630 am you could hear her. Out suite Palm sugar also the first day when we arrived the room was lovely with candles fruit flowes there were not plates or knifes or folks to eat the fruit the second day never replaced the burn candles for new ones just little tea lights and when we eventually aked for a knife and used the little saucers for the fruit it took the stall 16 hours to remove it. we actually had to ring reception as we were getting flies and mosies around it. the funny thing is that lots and lots of staff members keep passing and seeing it on the porch but nobody was actually taking it away. The hotel has lots and lots of charm we loved the location and their restaurant I just wished that for what they charge they paid more atencion to detail. Our children deluxe room was good but once your towels were wet there was no where to hang them. little things like that.

And the bar and restaurant are very relaxing in the evening with the wonderful fcc style hemingway special cocktail in your hand. This small hotel has its charm. On the lesser side a few aspects about the room are to be improved. First of all the curtains could not be opened which meant you had no daylight entering. The breakfast although romservice is free of charge and extremely punctual is not great. The great exception were however the eggs benedict delicious. Although perhaps a nice idea to have the tv speakers installed above the bed to simulate surround sound it sounded simply poorly.

The FCC came recommended by a colleague but having been disappointed by the Phnom Penh branch days earlier I dialled down my expectations for this one. I need not have. it was absolutely flawless. The room was large comfortable stylishly decorated with a nice outdoor seating area out front too. At night the staff would light scented oil burners outside which made it wonderfully atmospheric. It was clean and comfortable and the staff could not have done more to help. We were eager to see as much of the ruins as possible. That meant we did not ever have the hotel breakfast but fortunately they offer a room deliver option for those leaving early to catch sunrise very much apreciatedThe pool area looked nice although the pool was small. Reliably good wifi was appreciated though. And an excellent bar. The only real downer for us was that as we were more focused on seeing Angkor we barely spent any time in the hotel which was a bit of a waste on reflection I wish we had stayed somewhere less swanky and saved a bit of cash. But if you are looking to take Siem Reap at a more relaxed pace I would definitely recommend FCOne small area for improvement the locks on the doors are not exactly robust they could easy be opened without a key.

I have been travelling to Cambodia for 15 years now and have made over 20 trips to Siem Reap in that time. Always wanted to try the FCC so stayed there for 13 nights this trip. What a disapointmentRom was small and cramped. For the price charged you would expect something more spacious. Room was always full of mosquitos. We had to spray insecticide often and wear insect repellant inside the room when going to bed. Large gap above and below door was letting mosquitos in. Would expect this in a 10 guesthouse not in a 100 hotel. Door lock was flimsy and insecure. If you have the curtains open to let the sunshine in everyone can see into your room. Housekeeping let themselves into our room at 830pm one night WITHOUT knocking and seemed surprised to find us there. She made a hasty retreat. All a bit suspicious. Wi Fi was so intermittent and slow as to be next to useless. I am a securities trader so need internet access to make a living. Not acceptable FCSwiming pool is in need of rendering painting. Looks like a relic from the 1970s. Water stopped on two occasions when we were showering. Security at front of house are arrogant impolite and unprofessional. If that is not enough read on for our biggest issue with FCC. Our two year old daughter took seriously ill. We asked for a doctor to be called. FCC reception said they could not do that. What type of supposedly reputable hotel does not have a medical contact in case of emergencyWe made our way to the International Hospital and spent the night there by our daughters bedside. Arrived back at FCC following afternoon in an ambulance which delivered us to FCC reception in full view of staff. Given the fact that we had been absent overnight you would think that this would have elicited an inquiry from FCC management reception but nothing. Not one single inquiry if we were ok. Clearly FCC are not overly concerned about their guests. Pathetic. The only positive we can say about FCC Angkor is that the food was very very good. Excellent breakfast. Restaurant staff were friendly polite and competent. We were also given a late check out which we much appreciated. We really wanted to enjoy our stay here and it was to be one of the highlights of our trip but were just disappointed. This place appears to have management and training issues that need attending to. Maybe it was a great place a decade ago. Now it is overpriced over rated and definitely not recommended.

The FCC Angkor is a fantastic hotel. The rooms are large clean and tastefully decorated the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly it is walking distance from the centre of Siem Reap and facilities such as the hotel pool and wifi are flawless. The only downside for us was that because we wanted to explore every inch of Angkor Wat we were leaving the hotel before sunrise and returning after dark and we were basically just sleeping thereAs we were taking an early morning tuk tuk to the temple complex each day the hotel delivered a breakfast box to our room which arrived around 30mins before our departure. I have had breakfast boxes before. which have been largely disappointing when compared to the food available in hotel restaurants but the morning meals delivered to us in FCC Angkor were tasty and generous and set us up for a hard day exploring Angkors amazing ruins.

The hotel is a bit out of the way from the centre of town which is not a bad thing unles you want to stay up all night but there are always tuk tuk drivers ready to take you into town. The restaurant was OK breakfast is included but the dinner we had there was not great and was rather overpriced. Most of the extra services laundry mini bar tours. here are insanely priced which is pretty much the standard for hotels but it still annoys me. The rooms seemed to have been designed for looks rather than practicality ie the louvre bathroom door that was surely installed to complete a look as no normal person would chose to have an open door into a bathroom so as to allow free movement of sound and air from a space which is entirely likely and was occupied often by those with inevitable travel bugs. Our room could have used an upgrade of various bits and pieces like the torn wall hangings that just made everything look a bit dated.
