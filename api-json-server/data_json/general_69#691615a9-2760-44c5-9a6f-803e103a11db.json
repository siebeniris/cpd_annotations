My husband and I stayed at The Beverly Hills Hotel in May for our anniversary celebration. It was very relaxing and comfortable and the service was superb. We stayed in the main building and although the room was small it was recently remodeled and very nice. My husband liked all the high tech upgrades. We loved The Polo Lounge. You can dine on the patio or inside under the green and white stripes. The Fountain Coffee Room is another great choice with old fashioned counter seating. Sandwiches salads and delicious looking desserts etc. are served. It was a fun place. The grounds are lush and green filled with palm trees. A lovely arbor leads down to the pool. The Cabana Caf\u00e9 is there for polside drinks or dining. The hotel is minutes from Rodeo Drive Hollywood and West Hollywood. It is about 45 minutes to Malibu and 30 minutes to Santa Monica for ocean beaches.

We were on a trip organised to celebrate our 25th wedding aniversary. After our long trans atlantic trip we were tired and needed some 5 star pampering. We just had to stay at the Beverlyhils hotel.

The entrance to the foyer has been photographed a million times and we like the thousands before us just had to get a snap taken at the hotels entrance. You feel very special entering this hotel as it is steeped in so much hollywood history. the front desk staff were wonderful they had upgraded our room and supplied a chilled bottle of champagne I am sure our travek agent tipped them ofour room was large sumpteous with a private patio area. every comfort is here. On our 3 day stop over we made a point of eating in the legendary Polo Lounge. The service was perfect the food rich but lovely. the atmosphere was also great. when you decide to stay at such a prestiges hotel you can not worry about the price For those who want to know a two course meal for my wife and I including a 20 tip cocktails and a bottle of wine came to 410. we would pay it again just to have experienced this lounge. The weather in Los angeles was not great when we were there so we did not have the opertunity to sit by the pool. We used our time visit the cities sights and also to do a little shopping. In the evening we just relaxed in our room or patio.

I was also given a late check out of 20pm on my day of departure well after the 120pm check out time.

I first read about this hotel as a child in a drab Irish housing estate in the 1970s. I imagined it to be an almost heavenly place of colour glamour and excess and 45 years later I made it there and it exceed all my expectations. Just sitting in the garden sipping a coffee and listening to the birdsong is worth the room rate. We had a deluxe room with balcony and I do recommend going for a room with outdoor space to take advantage of the great climate. You must have the chocolate souffle. I was very naughty and had one delivered every night as a bedtime snack and the McCarthy salad. The bar is so nice with great views and less well known and therefore quieter than the other areas of the hotel. Ask them to make you the cocktail from their sister hotel The Bel Air Monroes Passion.

The suites have great pictures and floor plans but it is not easy to pick a room category with the lack of pictures.
