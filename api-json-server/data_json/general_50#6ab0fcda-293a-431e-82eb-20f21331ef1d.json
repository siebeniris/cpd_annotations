We stayed in the Savoy for 4 days with our children. We were booked into a suite room 208. there is a small kitchenette and a microwave. Clean rooms and a big bathroom. There was construction going on right next door but we were not in the room most if the time so it did not bother us. Pools were also great ample polside seating lounge provided the others do not wake up at 5 am to drape their towels over the chairs I find this really irritating but it seems to be the same everywhere throughout the world. Direct beach access and it is really nice to get there in the morning to enjoy the quiet time before it fills up. The Savoy also provides chairs umbrellas and towels on the beach. can not comment on food as we did not eat at the restaurant. Resort fees are at 12 per day.

We recently stayed at The Savoy hotel for just one night before going on a trip to Cuba. The hotel was great right on South Beach but on a semi private section without all the craziness that starts just a block away. Beautiful room great breakfast and an all around great experience that will have us coming back for a longer stay soon. My wife has a travel pillow that she brings with her. We forgot to pack the pillow not realizing this until we got to Cuba. Once we returned to the US and had internet access again I contacted the Savoy and they were holding the pillow for us. The took care of shipping it back to us via FedEx despite the fact that FedEx messed up the pickup process on multiple times. The Savoy staff was great to work with in persevering through the FedEx travails. So this was a small matter that all hotels would likely have taken care of but the Savoy staff did so efficiently and effortlessly.

Used the heated pool a lot and swam in the ocean. Jose M delivering drinks and food to our beach lounge chairs was the icing on the cake. We did not eat at the restaurant wish we had with our experience at local restaurants. Check out was quick and they ordered our cab and showed up on time. We had a pool view and a safe in the room. Only cons while a double sink is great it took away any remaining counter space. Shower water pressure was weak. Wish the foot board was not wider than the bed.

Very Pricey. This 3story boutique hotel is right on the beach. Depending on your room a great view of the ocean and pool area. It is on the quieter end of Ocean Drive. The exterior is a great example of 1930s Art Deco architecture. We were 3 people so opted for the suite with living room and kitchenette. On check in we were given a room that over looked the parking lot and a bit of the ocean. Not a great room at all and certainly not worth the price. We were moved the next day to a corner room 324 which was lovely. It was a one bedroom with queen sized bed and a sizable living room with a pull out sofa. The corner room has 3 balconies. They are small and really meant for 2 people. This hotel does not deal well with a 3rd person in the room. The washroom was quite small but do able. The kitchen was handy to have as we enjoyed a couple of take out meals to have on the balcony. Admittedly we moved the living room furniture around to make the most of the view. It was lovely but in my opinion not worth the money.

The Savoy was about what I expected based on other reviews. Keep in mind there are some fake positive reviews for this hotel check out those with no previous TA reviews. The two best things about the Savoy are the pool and the beach. The hotel has direct beach access which is a rarity in SoBe. The beach is large and clean. Previous reviews indicated chairs umbrellas were included in resort fee but we were only allowed two beach chairs per room and a basic beach umbrella was 20. The two lovely pools are located in a really nice courtyard setting. One heated to a normal pool temp and the other much warmer which was really nice. The hotel was booked but the pool never felt crowded and there were always chairs available a significantly better situation than our stay at the much pricier Key Biscayne Ritz last year where every one of the hundreds of pool chairs were saved by 80 AM. Pool service was good especially Felipe food and drinks good but not great. The Savoys location is ideal being south of 5th so just a short walk to the action on Ocean Drive but much quieter. As others have said the hotel itself is in need of a renovation. Our room was clean enough and sheets and linens were decent but there was definitely room for improvement. Also we were in the north building and the elevator was quite sketchy no certificate of inspection since November 2015. so we took to using the stairs.

I had asked for a king bed but only got a queen so i did not get a good night sleep with my child squeezing between my husband and I Beds also were not that comfortable. I also did not like that they put a hold of 75 per day on your card. Quite a large amount to put on hold especially when you are already in a location which is very expensive. Now the Pros great location. You have direct beach access and it is a bit more private and isolated compared to other areas in the beach.
