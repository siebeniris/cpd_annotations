There are four golf courses. We played two of them. They are both well kept and with a variety of challenges. I was surprised that we were not given a sleeve of balls at either course. My main problem is with the restaurants. The casual restaurant 8212 Wine Bar and Grill had a good atmosphere and good wait staff. I ordered grilled redfish over shrimp. Though it was cooked well it was crusted with so much salt that I found it hard to eat. When we asked about dress for the more upscale restaurant Hill Country Dining Room. we were told though jackets were not required shorts and sandals were not allowed. We dressed accordingly and watched as people were seated in shorts and sandals. The waiters prepare the drinks instead of a bartender but ours did not know how to make a dirty martini did not ask brought the wrong thing and then did not know the difference between a snifter and a martini glass. They claim to be known for their exceptional quality steaks. Perhaps but two were ordered medium but were served well done. And all the steaks were crusted with so much salt that I could not eat it and I generally like extra salt. In a time when people are trying to be health conscious it is hard to imagine that much over salting on everything. I must say that I had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert and it was the Best I have ever had so at least the meal ended on a high note. The next morning the Valet gave very poor directions to a place only two miles away. He said it is right there on the left. But he failed to mention the name of the place with a great big sign where we needed to make a turn. We had to ask at the fire station down the road. We generally look forward to staying with Omni but this one was not the quality we have come to expect and were disappointed.", "offset": [999, 1059], "date": "2015-04-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "f6026e83-08d2-43ae-b4d4-bd9949cc88b3", "sentence": "Great stay at Omni Barton Creek Resort.

We were here for a golf vacation in February. The facility is top notch and the golf courses are high quality with something to challenge golfers at every level. The resort had guests on vacation as well as a wide variety of events so every day there was a different group on site. Our package included breakfast which I recommend since there are few shops restaurants close by. We did not have dinner at the restaurant but breakfast offerings and service were excellent as was room service. The fitness facility was exceptional. I have never seen such a wide array of new machines. Trainers and classes were available and there are indoor and outdoor pools. If you want to see Austin you will drive 20 30 minutes each way. If you are not into the golf tennis or spa thing this probably is not an ideal choice. The countryside is fabulous but it is in a residential area not in the centre of Austins nightlife. We liked the quiet but some folks might not. You MUST have a car or you will be isolated. I agree with other reviewers that some infrastructure could use updating but probably any well established facility could do with the same. Our room was very well kept and comfortable. I agree with other reviewers that many of the employees are younger 18 25 but we found them cordial service oriented pleasant and genuine. Skip the valet parking which is expensive. Self parking is free. Book your golf well in advance since members of the country club have access to the hotel associated courses.

I have had the pleasure of staying at some amazing hotel properties St Regis Aspen St Regis Monarch Beach Waldorf Astoria Orlando Ritz Carlton San Juan amongst other high end hotels and I have also stayed at Hyats Hiltons and Alofts Indigo Hotels and Embassy Suites. While I absolutely love the St Regis and Starwod brand of hotels I continue to stay open minded and low maintenance during my stays. When I had previously thought of the Omni Barton Creek I was imagining an amazing resort. The entrance to the resort and golf courses looked amazing however I would seen be extremely disappointed. It was a ridiculously disappointing stay and I do not foresee another stay there. My family and I stayed two adults and our 4 year old for three days at Omni Barton Creek July 2016. When we pulled up our valet Ken was very welcoming and helpful. We were given room 215 with two queen beds. The room itself was fine. It could use some updating but overall it was spacious. I immediately noticed the high cement wall where the balcony was. That wall was not a great sight to see especially since we could not look over it and see anything. Ken was helpful and suggested we go back to the front desk to see if we could change rooms. My husband did just that and unfortunately no rooms were available. We stood on chairs and looked to see what was on the other side of the wall it was the roof. Knowing what was on the other side made me feel somewhat better and we just decided to stick it out. My husband shut the balcony door and the handle came completely off. He called the front desk and maintenance came within five minutes to fix it. My son and I decided to go swim at the pool. Finding the pool was a little difficult but a staff member walking by kindly helped us out. She was very helpful and walked us to the door directly. The pool was a decent size with a nice view of the hill country. It was windy and the water was a little chilly but refreshing. The pool was clean and there was a bar you could walk up to. Again I do think the resort needs to be updated. You would expect the pool area to be bigger. Chairs need to be updated as well as the side tables not urgent by any means. just something I noticed. Staff members work at the bar and occasionally frequent the pool to ask if you need anything. There are white towels available at the pool. I was surprised they did not have beach towels and staff setting up the towels for you but again not a big deal. We swam headed back to the room to shower and headed to dinner. After dinner in downtown Austin we came back to the room. At approximately 1030 pm I was laying in bed my husband was watching tv and my son was putting a toy on the bedside table between both beds he was just about to lay down to sleep. All of a sudden he yelled out that there was an ant on the table. My husband and I both looked and sure enough there was an ant \u2026 and then there were more. There was a bunch of sugar ants on the bedside table. My husband immediately called the front desk and they said they would have maintenance to our room to spray the ants. While waiting for maintenance we decided to check the beds and sure enough there were ants on the beds. That was all it took for my husband to go down to the front desk and ask to be moved out of the room. We were NOT going to sleep with ants on the beds. At the lobby the front desk staff was icy. We are not sure if they were panicked about our situation or if they just did not want to be bothered. Regardless they were not sensitive to the situation. Imagine if this had happened at the St Regis. They would have been extremely kind and apologetic. This seemed more of a hassle to the front desk staff which annoyed us even more. The front desk staff informed us that they were upgrading us the Villas which was a little bit off property but that we could take the Omni shuttle. Ken the valet we previously had helped us again with our luggage and he was so apologetic and so concerned. My husband and I can not figure out why our valet could be this way but not the front desk staff ridiculous. The front desk staff said that we would be moving to 2823 Villa 28 and that it had two queens. We take the shuttle to the villa. It is now 120 pm moving rooms with all our luggage in our pajamas and a very tired four year old. Frustrating. We get to the villa unlock the room. and of course it is one king sized bed. My husband and I just looked at each other in disbelief. The Omini could not even get this right. Our valet offered to call the front desk for us but nobody answered and he was once again so apologetic concerned and accommodating. Back on the shuttle bus and to the front desk my husband goes. We waited for another 15 20 minutes and finally received the keys to 282 the room next door. The room had two queen beds. Talk about frustrating. The villa room had a few dead bugs in it and some carpet stains but nothing to be too concerned about. It had a large bathroom with closet but was missing a desk. The balcony area was nice. We were able to take the shuttle easily back to the main part of the resort and the shuttle arrived quickly to pick us up. There was nobody in our villa and I wish we had access to the living and kitchen area but we did not and at that point we could have cared less. I really could not wait to leave this resort. There was construction at the villa next to us but it did not bother us too much as we were up by 8 am anyway. The villas are quiet and the street is dark there were deer in the front yard. Do I feel that the villas were an upgrade. Absolutely not. There were live ants in our room and on the beds we were moved to the incorrect room and did not even settle into the new room until after midnight. Should I give kudos to the hotel for moving our rooms. My apologies but no. Moving rooms was exactly what they should have done and should have offered the FIRST time instead of sending maintenance to spray. I took a quick picture of the bedside table after killing a bunch of ants and they were still coming from the crevices of the table. I also took video of them crawling around. Overall the staff we encountered walking around and the Valet staff were fantastic. The front desk staff were disappointing. There is a level of customer service that this resort is missing. It would have been nice for a manager or SOMEONE to contact us to just check on us or even inquire if everything was okay but nobody did. EXTREMELY disappointing. it is little things like this that can go such a long way. We have stayed at less expensive hotels and have been treated much much better.

Ask for champagne when you register. it is there but it is not on their automatic response. The bar is cool. Fastest service of anyone all weekend. The rooms are nice but older. you will get lost in the poorly marked hallways but sooner or later you will find your rooms. Of the three rooms we got only mine facing the golf course and pool seemed to have the best view. We did not have a balcony which would have been nicer but that was not an automatic either. The dining room downstairs was ok. Check menu first to see if you want it. Though the waiters were nice slow slow slow was the issue. Those poor underpaid workers work as if they are underpaid. The breakfast buffet was not really worth the money. Same buffet every morning. And it went all that. Omelet bar was good but everything else is ho hum. I did not play golf but I am guessing that if you are going for golf that is who would give the A rating. People had weddings there but I would not want that venue. There was a small restaurant with a balcony which was good. But under staffed. Speaking of which there is NO where to read a book quietly. The lobby is too loud the pool is crawling with kids and there is people everywhere else you had think you could go. All I wanted was a rocking chair on some balcony outside. The gym was good. There was an indoor pool which was ok. The nature walk is a joke bring stable shoes it is treacherous. The min golf course is like the one in my backyard. The massage was awesome though. there is a sauna and wet room that were not working there was a hot tub that was too hot and not relaxing since people were constantly walking through since it was on the only walkway. The tranquility room is funny. it is got some couches facing windows to a lit rock wall. I was waiting for it to turn into a peep show. It could have actually been better if there was more light so that maybe I could have read that stupid book I brought to read during my weekend spa getaway. Whew. Did I help at all. there is an HEB grocery store and fridge in the room if you want. The bathroom was nice. I stole cupcakes that were only meant for a kids decorating bar in the lobby but come on. it is sugar in a public area and it was calling my name. I had go back to this place if it were worth my while but I am not gon na lie. Lake Austin Resort was way better and prettier and I actually read a book there.

Arrived to our room it smelled of mildew did nt seem to be dusted. Next day I inquired about the putting greens to take my daughter front desk agent had to call make several calls to inform me they were closed. I then asked about the so call trails. no trails btw just golf cart sidewalks. The lady rudely ignored me and answered the phone while i was speaking to her. I said well i guess we just wander she seemed annoyed and said Yeah. Pools were whatever staff at the pool bar were mediocre and not friendly. staff walking around were nice though. Returned to the room that evening it smelled foul like sewage NOT like a newly renovated room. Do nt try ordering a simple coffee at the coffee bar service is awful they forgot our drinks the first time then the second day the coffee was sour and burnt.

First the positives. This golf resort and spa is built on 400 acres of gorgeous Austin hill country. There are multiple swimming pools including an infinity pool which were filled with families. The entire hotel is newly renovated as of May 2019. If you enjoy a workout while on vacation or away for business the new fitness center is simply spectacular. All new equipment with spacious areas for mat work and weights. Great selection of exercise bikes including interactive Pelotons. There is an indoor lap pool and track which is especially nice in steamy Texas summers. The room was fine and bed was comfortable. Now the Negatives. When I checked in the girl working the front desk seemed a bit clueless. And sure enough when I got to my room a good 10 minute walk my electronic key card did n\u2019t work. I tried to call front desk but no answer so had to walk back. They fixed it but no offer for a free drink for the inconvenience. She was also rude to the doorman who seemed to have a learning disability. The coffee shop closed at 6 pm and they do n\u2019t have any sundries mostly junk food and gifts. I needed a decongestant which was not stocked. A hotel this remote should have something like the Mariot Courtyard 24 hour mini mart. My bathroom had bunch of centipedes. Not all the restaurants were open yet. The food at Crenshaw \u2019s was good especially the burger and brisket sandwich. The restaurant near the pool had small tapas type menu. The fish tacos were ok but the chicken tacos were not very good chicken was very dry and not much flavor. Bobs steakhouse on the property was like a Ruth Chris. Very good but also very expensive.

Recently stayed two nights for a conference. First the positives. The hotel itself looks great and they did a great job with the renovation. The common areas all have a high class feel. The rooms themselves feel updated and were clean always important. Food at the conference was very good sometimes at these things you know you are eating low quality food and this was not that. I did not play golf but from talking to everyone who did they were quite impressed with the courses. I do have four negatives to point out though. First and this is minor on the first night I had turn down service. I came back and beds were pulled down tv on for me etc. The second night I did not. I do not particularly care about turn down service but think if holding out as a high class resort it should be consistent. Second is the wifi. Perhaps it is because I stayed toward the end of a hall but I found it to be very slow. When trying to watch NFL highlights from ESPN the video would buffer constantly. Moving my phone to cellular fixed it all. Third at night I wanted to walk out to the fire pits. I went downstairs and exited the doors which seemed right in front of the fire pit. It led me to a fenced in balcony slightly above the fire pits. I assume it was part of the restaurant right there which was closed. This was an issue because when I tried to get back inside there were no handles on the doors to get back in and all doors to the restaurant were also locked. I waited several minutes before another guest walked by and had to tap on glass to get her to open the door from the inside to let me in. Fourth and finally the elevator. My room was in the Oak tower I believe. Monday after lunch around 1245. I was to take it back to the conference. It took around five minutes from the time the button was pressed until it came. Another guest and I stepped on and the doors closed. Elevator did not move. Then there were several jerky start and stop motions going down. A repair man was on the elevator radioing someone else noting that the elevator was still doing it and whatever he did did not work. He then radioed that the other man might have to go manually crank the doors open since guests were on the elevator. Roughly 4 5 minutes later the elevator got one floor down to the lobby and opened itself. Why let guests on this elevator if it is being serviced for not working correctly. This seems like a major safety issue to me. So all in all the hotel looks great and is nicely renovated but think the little things add up to make this a mediocre stay.", "offset": [1060, 1113], "date": "2019-09-24", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 32, "uid": "b0737bb1-b59f-49fd-be92-6c2764401323", "sentence": "Corporate Event Disappointing Service Do not recommend. Gave property two stars only because the hotel update is tasteful. Started at checkin at 3 and rooms were not ready Headed to the bar waited a 12 hour for a table to be cleared. Then some of our guests were given double rooms mine was next to the loud electrical room. We contracted and paid for Deluxe King rooms for our event. That becomes a reflection on us as a company. Then the Front Desk said well we are really booked up so we do n\u2019t have anything we will check and call you back. Waited half hour for a call back no call back. Guess they thought we would just \u201c go away \u201d so headed to front desk again another clerk said we do n\u2019t have anything. I said this is not what we paid for and magically another King room became available. Guess you have to press hard on getting what you pay for at the Omni Barton that was an unfortunate experience. New room has what appears to be ink stains on sheets but otherwise clean. The event dinner the food was ok the large breakfast room used for dinner seemed like an after thought location too big and bright for a 50 person dinner. Felt like being in a cafeteria not what is wanted for a corporate event. Conference room feels cramped. For such a nicely renovated property really need to work on service and organization for corporate events. We would not recommend this property for Corporate Events based on our what we experienced.

Relaxing stay. I was a little hesitant to book a stay here based on the comments from mid last year about operational issues. I must say they seem to have gotten their wheels well oiled by year end overall operations and the staff were great. This is my second time staying at the Omni Barton Creek the first time was a couple years back before the renovations were underway. I must say I am highly impressed with the transformation looks entirely different. From the tastefully designed landscaping to an interior flushed with natural tones woody earthy accents and beautiful floral themed artwork. I really can not believe I have raving reviews for an Omni brand because I have had terrible experiences with Omni in the past and have kept well away from their hotels because of that. Barton Creek may change my mind. The rooms were clean and spacious comes with a mini fridge a safe modern rainfall shower I had a west facing room great for catching the sunset. During check in I asked to be relocated to the new tower based on comments on here it is the closest to the front concierge and just steps away from the spa. The spa was the highlight of my stay a very well done facility clean relaxing and with highly skilled therapists. One thing to note is that you will be charged a mandatory service fee at 20 of your services I was a little confused if that was an applied tip or if I needed to include gratuity but the receipt did not include an option for that. The resort seemed pretty empty which I liked but I can see this quickly becoming a Texas favourite in the near future. There is typically a schedule of activities each day especially if you are into health and fitness beware that most of them come with an additional charge so ask about those charges as the cost is not listed on the sheet. They have a full guym with weights and cardio machines and serves a a health club also for non guests. There are several restaurants in the hotel most were closed I guess due to low volume of guests post holiday season. I had a little situation at the breakfast restaurant but the hostess handled it all professionally and even compd my breakfast. One complaint is that there was not a buffet breakfast I wished we were told that during checking I was really looking forward to that. Also they could do a better job with the jogging trail there is so much beauty within the grounds that a road side jogging trail just seems like an after thought and is just unsafe. Also it would be great for a hotel with an earthy themed design to have a recycling policy there is way too much paper and recyclables being tossed in trash.
