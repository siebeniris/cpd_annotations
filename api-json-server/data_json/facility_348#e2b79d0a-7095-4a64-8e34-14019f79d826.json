Dramatic remodel of an iffy hotel into a trendy sleep spot. Rooms are impeccably done in urban industrial chic and the staff is super friendly. Great location near downtown Detroit with free secured parking. Free wifi. Great attention to detail. Please note that the hotel is open during renovation. I did not hear any construction noise or even see workers but parts of the hotel are not finished so do not be alarmed if you want into the back door and find the stench of old hotel or a grumpy elevator. The guest rooms lobby and gym are completely finished. I find walking through the unfinished hallway for a few steps is a great reminder of how far the hotel has come. The hotel offers bicycles to rent but the price is fairly high. There is nothing within walking distance of the hotel but it is a very close drive to downtown Detroit mid town and Canada. The only food offered was snacks for sale in the lobby but the plans show a future restaurant.

This is a hard review to write as I am perplexed by all of the good reviews. I had checked all the reviews prior to going so was surprised by our experience. The industrial vibe is a tribute to Detroit is great history but it is not very comfortable. The polished concrete floors were cracked and some areas were not well kept. The rugs were thin. Very glad slippers were provided. The lighting was not relaxing and the paint job was poor. Bathroom was small with little shelf space. I could have gotten past the design but not the noise level the walls at least on the 3rd floor are paper thin. We could hear our neighbors very clearly at one point when our lights were out I was wondering if the neighbors were actually in our room because I could hear the conversation so clearly. One could also hear every shower toilet flush tv channel etc worst night of sleep ever. The Detroit Foundation Hotel also has an industrial feel to it but it is so much classier and more comfortable. I am also trying to figure out where the friendly desk staff are that were so well noted in the other reviews. We arrived at 240 pm and were told that our room would not be ready until at least 330 pm when I asked about check in at 30 pm the desk worker said that they were busy. I find it hard to believe that if check out was at 10 am that not one room was clean and ready to go at 240 pm it just did not add up unles a slew of people checked in early or stayed over or something. Also we had to ask to leave our luggage while waiting for the room the clerk did not offer to take it. None of the desk workers actually greeted us ever and upon check out their attitude was like see ya. I had to ask for a receipt she emailed it to me but I did not get to see it. so I asked if she could at the very least tell me the total that was charged. Gesh. The area of the hotel seemed safe but not a lot was going on around us. I felt so far away from Downtown. We stay in the D three to four times a year and now know that paying a little more to stay downtown is the better more comfortable option. I noticed the bikes that must have been for rent but the desk staff did not offer any information about the hotel or ways to possibly enjoy the stay. We did visit the bar and the drinks were excelent I recommend the Touch of Grey. The food was good but pricey for small portions we had the green eggs ham and pork jowels. Bartender was very friendly. We had reservations for dinner but the dining room was not very cozy so opted to sit at the bar. We saw plenty of housekeeping staff in the hallways and they were very friendly and greeted us as we passed through. It was actually a housekeeper that directed us to an elevator closer to our room the front desk staff did not give us any guidance.

This hotel is amazingThere is a gated area to park your vehicle which felt safe and there was plenty of room for our large vehicle. The designs inside were really cool as well.

This made us feel at home in our rooms which were tucked away behind walls had plenty of amenities and were very comfortable. Everything was immaculately clean. The shower was very nice and was in a separate room from the sink area which was nice since there were 4 of us and it is often a struggle sharing a bathroom. There were robes and slippers and a guide to Detroit as well which was really cool. The staff here was also AMAZING. They were so friendly to us seemed happy to help and even chatted with us for a bit which made us feel at home. Same with the staff of the coffee shop and the restaurant. The barista was amazing.

Another huge deciding factor when renting here was that their parking lot has a lockable gate so our van and all our band equipment was safe. The room itself was immaculately clean.
