We were extremely disappointed with this hotel and although we were booked for six nights we left after the first night in fact we would have left immediately we saw our room if other hotel rooms were available in San Diego. We had booked two club rooms but on arrival were told they were not available but agreed to give us two junior suites which were an upgrade on standard rooms. These rooms were filthy with very stained and sticky carpets work tops in bathroom and bedroom were sticky and had chewing gum on some of the surfaces. The furniture was dated and the desk was very chipped white melamine or Formica. Our keys we were advised would allow us into the club lounge but did not work. We knocked for entry and what a shock a converted bedroom with five tables which had seen better days. It was so crowded that we did not stay although the staff member in attendance was very pleasant. The hotel staff throughout were very pleasant and helpful and indeed the duty manager we spoke to agreed that the club room standard was very poor. She had recently transferred from another Hyat and admitted that she was shocked at the poor standard of this hotel. She advised that we would get a full refund but that I would need to do this through Expedia and then the next morning I was given and paid a bill for parking charges resort fee and taxes. expensive overnight stay.

Stayed Nov 2013We arrived in warm San Diego after freezing New York so we were already loving it regardless. The girl at reception was wonderful and friendly. She gave us a map of the grounds and showed us where everything was. Was happy to have a chat and nothing was any trouble. The parking is excellent. Plenty of spots and pretty close by to all rooms. We had a standard king room which was not part of the tower. The room itself was huge but it did have a damp smell like it had been flooded and the carpets needed replacing. With the air con on it went away but once you came back after it had been closed up for the day it was just as bad. This was the only downside to the room itself. Very quiet was not disturbed at all. Pool area looked awesome but we did not have time to try it out. Little shop on site was great as you could pick up snacks drinks and souvenirs. Our first night we had dinner at the restaurant The Red Marlin. Our waiter was excellent and recommended their version of the clam chowder. We have been raving about it ever since. The steak and wine was also beautiful along with the desert dinner could not be faulted. Breakfast however was a slightly different story. The food was great but the staff not so good. When we got there we were not asked where we wanted to be seated we were asked the night before ie inside or outside and it was not busy or anything. Then it took forever for anyone to come and take our order. We also wanted to get more drinks but once our food and initial drinks were given to us we were never approached again. We ended up getting up and going to the desk to sign our check. Apart from this though it could not be faulted.

The property A resort layout with a tower low rise bungalow buildings and additional rooms over the reception building. The property is on the marina and that is quite lovely. You may see beautiful sunsets. The grounds are nice but the signage could use some work a few felt it maze like. Note that without a car you are pretty much stuck. San Diego is a small city and you can be places fairly quickly but you need a car. The rooms have been recently renovated to a modern aesthetic. It is nice but a bit underwhelming. The rooms Hm I switched out of my original bungalow room not wanting to be on the ground floor facing towards the street and more importantly concerned about the musty smell in the room. Others in our group were in these rooms and every one of them smelled musty. Fortunately I was able to get another room in the tower. No musty smell and a higher floor. Someone needs to take a serious look into these rooms. Any time you are by the water you can have a bit of dampness but it can be corrected. One person found a room air filter of some sort in her room. Just what was being filteredThe rooms in the tower seemed to be much better and were relatively quiet. The bed was very comfortable and things did seem clean. The bath had a walk in shower which is a preference and the modern design was very nice in the bath. Lighting was great. Water pressure was a bit low but with Californias water issues I am not surprised not concerned. Amenities. The wifi which was part of our room package was good. There is a gym but you have to walk out to the Marina to access it. it is a nice walk but some were put off by having to go outside and to another building to work out. It is small but sufficient. Food A restaurant and bar are onsite. Decent food not inexpensive. Within a short walk is an Einsteins bagel place and a Fish and Chips place. Fine dining they are not. And they close early. If it is late and you do not have a car you are stuck. There is also a pool in the middle of the property though it is shielded by a wall and plantings. A nice touch is a fire pit art which you can sit and watch the sun set. Parking. Self parking can be dicey as almost an entire lot is taken up by an event tent. I do not know if this is permanent but it meant searching for spaces on two nights. Plus if there is an event like a wedding you may be parking on the street while attendees use guest parking.

It was surprising to only have 1 roll for a 2 night stay. We loved the view from the room and leaving the sliding door open to experience the fresh ocean breeze however we had a near by guest whom was smoking throughout the weekend. Having 3 children with asthma made the smoking and extra unfortunate experience. The pool was awesome and our children loved the slides and the bottomless kids cups.

We made the most of the vacation we waited many months for and loved the memories we shared however I was hoping for some further compassion and problem solving from the front desk staff when I provided my concerns to them.

This was unequivocally the biggest waste of money I have ever spent on a high end hotel Room. This hotel is a great area. Perfect setting and very good looking from the exterior. My family and I have stayed in this area previously but never at this hotel and we will not be returning. First the 320 per night convenience fee added to your room is understandable because of the area but did not provide any convenience while staying there. Secondly we had the displeasure of staying in one of the Tower rooms which was directly behind an elevator. Throughout the day and night we heard the elevator climb and drop while the devices hardware tapped against the cinder block wall. Finally and this blew my mind this hotel charged the steepest overnight parking fee I have ever experienced. 37 a night is asinine. Yes this is a very popular area and yes I am understanding that the Hotel needs to make money based on that popular location but it was outrageous. Furthermore the parking gates were left up for the majority of our stay and when I went to the Concierge to complain and ask for an explanation why guests had to pay for parking when it was not enforced the gentleman responded Sorry the hotel across the street charges this much for parking as well. All guests have to pay and they could not do anything for me. So he basically said tough luck Sucker and be on your way.

As a Hyat member I am truly disappointed by the room and service I was given while there. I have been coming to this Hyat at least once a year since my husband and I got married there 17 yrs. ago and now we come with our kids. We have always had an amazing room in the tower and have enjoyed relaxing by the pool. This time I was given an old room near the reservation desk. 12 the size of tower rooms no balcony and a terrible mildewy smell. When I complained I was told that they were booked and that was the standard room when I used my points. What. So as a member when I use my credit card to get points I am given the crapiest room. What is the point of being a member then. I left my stuff out by the pool on 2 lounge chairs for about an hour and when I came back all my stuff was gone. It took me almost 12 an hour to locate my stuff and then was shown to my stuff by a very rude employee telling me that I was not allowed to leave my stuff out there. So this is how your guests are treated. Then we wound up having to seat at a table in the back the rest of the day so I did not get the relaxation I had anticipated. We sat there for more than 12 an hour waiting for someone to come take our order and then we found out that the waitresses were the ones also making the drinks. What the hell is that about. The Hyat can not afford a bartender. The entire time we were there our key never worked getting in and out of the parking lot which was a pain.

This is probably the hardest review I have ever written there were horrible aspects and very nice elements. I \u2019l start with the bad. They are trained to lie. Our check in and first night were horrible. I literally thought about going back home. At check in we were told we were being upgraded from a standard room to a room in the towers. A few keystrokes later and \u201c I \u2019m sorry the room is already filled. I can upgrade you to a patio room with a private fire pit. \u201dDon\u2019t do it. That is a room that looks at a wall. We were moved to room 1982 which had a horrible smell. My wife thinks it was smoke cover up or mold I described it as musky. Either way I woke up the next morning with a headache and she had an itchy mouth. Before we unpacked I went back to get the room changed. I spoke to the same man who checked me in. I listened as he helped the customer in font of me \u201c I will be upgrading you from a standard room to the tower \u201d except they were able to check into that room. I voiced the complaint about our room and was told that they were sold out and I could not be moved. I replied \u201c you just upgraded the person in front of me from a standard to the tower give me their standard room \u201d to which I was told the room was already taken somehow he knew that without looking. He said he would talk to a manager and walked away he came back and said housekeeping will come in with a machine they have actually a can of aerosol. Through much complaint and press through and being told that a manager was being consulted twice although we never saw one we finally were able to secure a changed room on the next day. It was a horrible night and I really just wanted to leave.

The move to the new room was handled with the efficiency of a five star hotel. We were placed on the 17th floor of the tower. We had a beautiful room that did not stink. The rest of the trip was excellent utilizing the enjoyable features of the resort. We had one issue of no hot water one morning. It took them an hour or so to figure out why and get it fixed. They were very professional about it and gave us a complimentary breakfast for our inconvenience. The grounds are very nice the pool and jacuzi were nice and the waterways around the facility are very enjoyable and relaxing. I rated this a three as I really do n\u2019t know what to rate. The first day was a one or less and the remainder of the trip would have been a five. As a takeaway I would never go back. The way the hotel is laid out unles you are in the tower its not worth staying there. I know I would have left early if we had to stay in the first room the whole trip even if it did n\u2019t stink.
