This was a great resort my family stayed here this past weekend and were treated wonderfully. We pulled up to valet and had a bellman unload the vehicle then I found a great parking spot in self parking which is free. Check in was easy the front desk person was pleasant and gave us a map of the property. The bellman took us to the room and along the way pointed out things out the window to help us find our way around. The room was very clean spacious the tv was HUGE and the bathroom had a separate tub and shower. Throughout the stay if we passed an employee they would stop what they were doing and greet us. That is a sign of excellent management. During our stay we went to the water park and loved it we ate at the sports bar which has giant tvs everywhere we used Starbucks constantly and I enjoyed walking my one year old daughter around the convention center area because of the artwork on the walls and ceiling. The ONLY issue we encountered was when I called for a bellman to assist with our bags for checkout the agent who answered the phone said the bellman would be up momentarily. So I ran to self parking and waited for my wife to text that they were loading the bags so I could pull into valet to load. I ended up sitting in the vehicle with my four year old son for twenty minutes. I finally gave up and told her to cancel the bellman assistance then we ran back upstairs to get our bags ourselves. The bellman showed up right when we reached the 5th floor even after we called to cancel so we ran back down and pulled the vehicle up. The phone operator should have given us a correct ETA instead of saying momentarily.

We were having so much fun that we did not want to leave because the facilities at this hotel spoiled us to no endThe Waterpark for one was such a blast that we went there every single day. If only the weather were a bit warmer this time of year but it was still a blast and we enjoyed the lazy river the most out of all facilities at the waterpark. Great for families and includes slides the lazy river a large pool and a kidie area for the little ones. it is absolutely amazing for a hotel to have a water park of this size. The rooms were comfortable and included a mini fridge and a huge 60 TV with Netflix and other streaming aps for movies you have on your device. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly including the room service staff to the valet and front deskOur favorite places to grab breakfast was the Crooked Branch with their breakfast grab n go specialty. Room service food left something to be desired but was not terrible just not our favorite. One of our favorite restaurants on site at the property was 18 Oaks. By far the best food we have had and we only wished that they delivered food to the rooms because their steaks seafood and desserts were impeccable. Please amend your rules so that 18 Oaks can deliver room service food and we would give this hotel 10 starsThis Mariot hotel also included an amazing fitness center game room with arcade games and prize claw games and plenty of walking space to get some fresh air along with a huge golf course.

We have stayed at this property many times and have enjoyed it however we observed a dangerous situation on our final night. On Sunday evening of our stay families were playing on the golf course hole directly across from the back of the hotel. A golfer who we later learned was a golf pro for the property teed off with approximately thirty people on the golf course. Fortunately he did not hit a small child. We then observed a father of one of the children walk to the tee and get into a screaming match with the golf pro. The families should not have been on the golf course but there is no excuse for anyone much less an employee of the JW Mariot for teeing off and putting families at risk. The hotel is fortunate that the golf pros ball struck no one and a lawsuit did not follow. The property should have something more than signs to keep families off the course. The parents also have a responsibility but putting up a fence or something like that will reduce the likelihood of injury. We did report this to staff right after we observed it and also to the front desk during check out. Aside from this unfortunate event we had a positive stay. The JW Mariot is an expensive property so to save money we recommend. Use self park valet parking is undoubtedly convenient but the cost adds up. We did not leave the property once in the three days we stayed there so it would not been worth the extra cost for us to valet park. Bring your food eating on the property is ridiculously expensive. We brought a Yeti cooler and between that and the in room refrigerator we were able to eat breakfast and lunch and save money. You can use the restaurant delivery service of your choice and have food delivered to the front of the property. This is another way to save money. We did eat at Cibolo Moon and agreed that we would never eat here again. The value is not there the dinner buffet is 30 a person and the quality of food is mediocre. We knew better as we have eaten at Cibolo Moon on previous stays but unfortunately for us we decided to try it once again. We also had inferior service which did not help the experience. We also ate at 18 Oaks and had a positive experience. The meal and drinks were expensive but the quality of the food and service was appropriate for the cost. We enjoyed the whiskey tasting that we did as well. We would eat at 18 Oaks again. We used the Kids Club 6 10pm babysitting event the night we ate at 18 Oaks. Kids Club had a pirate theme and our children enjoyed it. We would use this again it was money well spent for four hours of an adult dinner with no children.", "offset": [1058, 1157], "date": "2019-06-07", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "22c576f5-cc2c-449e-8c07-973807c636af", "sentence": "Alitle pricey but very relaxing experience.

Beautiful resort fabulous staff amazing food. The Cibolo Moon is to die for. For those quesadilla lovers out there you have got to try the Smoked Chicken QuesadilaThis was supposed to have been a relaxing vacation. it WAS NOT. We were awoke each morning with construction on the room next to us I was in room 6386. It sounded like they were coming through the wall. the wall was literally shaking. When I called the service desk they informed me there was a water leak and construction was taking place next to me. The second morning we were awoke to even more disturbing noise. sawing hammering drilling and loud conversation. but this time it was coming from right outside my door. When I opened my door there were 4 employees tearing up the wall see pics. When I asked if they could keep it down the reply was we are working. After I said I will be calling the front desk for the 2nd time and halfway of walking back into my room someone mouthed off it is 930 in the morning. When I walked back out to inform them that I was on vacation and would like to sleep in they each gave me a disgusted look. Totally unacceptable. After speaking to the front desk she offered me a 50 credit. A 50 credit off a 116 bill. No not that much of a credit at all for a non relaxing vacation. Also I was overcharged each night for my room. I booked through Bokingcom but when I arrived they did not have my reservation. Thankfully they were able to get me a room but they did not accept the price Booking gave me. Beware of overcharging for food and drinks. My daughter ordered a virgin Pina Colada. We were charged a 6 liquor fee for each one see pic. After questioning this fee I was informed it was for the use of the bar. Can anyone say what the. We ordered chips and guacamole at the Velocity bar. The cost on the menu was 10 but we were charged 13. This place is a total ripof.

We stayed at this resort as part of a conference group. We chose to do self parking free as opposed to the expensive daily valet charge. We were greeting warmly by the valets and bellmen however the lady that checked us in while polite was not as friendly. She gave us our keys but not really any other information. Our room was adequate and clean. We found most of the staff to be helpful and friendly though some more than others. The grounds were well kept and we enjoyed the pool area though the music was quite loud if you sat remotely near a speaker. The lazy river could have used a bit of attention as it had quite a bit of debris in it and along the edge. The food served during the conference was very good and well done both in preparation presentation. We also really enjoyed the Cibolo Moon restaurant and had excellent service and food there as well. We had planned to stay an extra night after our conference ended as our children were joining us. When I went down to get our new room assignment we had asked for adjoining rooms. we discovered a huge mistake that had occurred upon our check in. We should have been assigned our adjoining room which our key card during the conference did not open upon check in. This was arranged by our company and was a huge suite with a living area and a giant balcony not to mention a bottle of champagnes welcome note and a very nice gift from the company. Instead we were placed in the basic room which we had reserved ourselves for our children. for one additional night When we discovered the huge mistake I spoke to two different receptionist about it but neither seemed bothered by it and certainly did not apologize for this giant mistake. We had been in the wrong room for 4 nights. If our children had not joined us which they normally do not we would have checked out never having known our expensive gifts were left behind in a spacious much nicer room which we would have never entered. The second blemish happened on the same day. We called the desk to ask if they could arrange a cab for us for 6 people. They said they could and asked for our time of departure. When we came down there was a compact car waiting which we naturally assumed was not for our group. After waiting a few minutes we asked the bellman if he knew anything about our car he did not. At this point I went inside to find out what was going on as we were now concerned with making our reservation on time. The receptionist had to ask around then said that the cab company did not have a car large enough to accommodate us. They had known this and never bothered to let us know. Then they stated they could get them to send another car but it would be about 20 minutes before it arrived too late for our reservation. I ended up leaving the receptionist desk VERY exasperated. we split up 3 took the cab he had been kind enough to wait while we tried to figure this out and called an Uber ourselves to pick up the rest of our group which arrived within minutes. Again their mistake but no one seemed concerned or apologetic. Overall we enjoyed this property and the amenities and our kids certainly enjoyed the water park. Had it not been for the two incidents it would have been a very nice trip. However the lack of apologies more so than the incidents themselves left us with bit of a soured outlook.", "offset": [1533, 1730], "date": "2020-01-27", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}]}
