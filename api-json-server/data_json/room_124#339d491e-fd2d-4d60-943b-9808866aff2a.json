I am not generally one to leave bad reviews for anyone as I know it could have devastating effects on businesses and jobs but after being in contact with the hotel three times with not even a call back as promised I feel it is time to put in a review to show future guests what to expect. We booked here for our anniversary expecting one of the best hotels in Manchester. The hotel itself is in a perfect location and quite luxurious but there is room for improvement amongst the staff and the level of the guest experience given. Our first incident was on the day of arrival my wife had booked balloons chocolate strawberries a card and for a surprise on our anniversary. 30 minutes prior to our arrival time she was sent an email stating the foil balloons she ordered could be sourced and were to be substituted these turned out to be cheep balloons that looked similar to ones bought from a pound shop dangling on a length of string over the bed. The arrival drinks were not there on our arrival either and had to ring room service to fetch them up for us. I personally had a similar experience as I ordered balloons to be delivered to the hotel from a third party. This was discussed with the hotel and it was agreed that they would be set out whilst we were out on the day of our anniversary. I had an email stating the balloons were delivered to the hotel and signed for before 9 am. We left and returned to our room on numerous occasions during the day and each time I was expecting this surprise for my wife. When we returned around 530 I took it that they were not going to be brought up so I contacted the reception to ask where they were. I was first told they had not arrived but when I told them they had been signed for and the name of the signature they looked into it more. After 45 minutes the parcel was brought to the room still packaged I would have certainly of expected the balloons to be unpacked as this is what was agreed and it certainly did not have the effect I was looking for. Our main concern during our stay is that we were stopped from going to our room at 11 pm because of an error caused by the checking in staff. We checked in online and was told to go to the reception to collect our keys this we did and got on with our stay. On our final night we went to the lift only to find out our card was inactive and we could not use it. We went to the reception to have the card reset. We were then told that a debit or credit card had not been added to our account at the check in stage. I was then told I would have to pay the balance on my account which totalled \u00a3 579 and then I would have to pay \u00a3 195 for the final night in the morning when I checked out. Bearing in mind our stay was \u00a3 420 total and we only had one breakfast \u00a3 40 spa treatment of \u00a3 130 and with no drinks or other meals charged to the rooms I challenged this and asked for a breakdown only to be told this was not possible. I am sure that not being given a breakdown or itemised bill whilst being asked to pay a balance is illegal. I paid the amount asked so we could return to our room to sleep. I asked if my key card had been blocked knowing I would have to visit the reception I was told this was not the case and I had probably kept the card near my phone this I suspected was not the case as I kept the card in my wallet in my pocket with my phone in the other. My suspicions turned out to be correct as when we finally returned to our room I checked our spare key that had not been out of the wallet it was given to us in and also did not work. Basically I then felt we had been bullied into visiting the reception late at night to correct a mistake that had been made during our check in. When we checked out the amount of our bill was rectified by the receptionist who asked how we enjoyed our stay. I told her about the events the previous night and she said someone would call us regarding this. Two days went by after our departure with no contact so I rang to discuss this with a manager only to be told they were busy and would call me back later in the evening this did not happen. I left in another day to ring back again and this time I get through to a manager who said he was shocked at the way we were treat and would investigate this and get back to me. Over a week has passed now and I have not had the courtesy of a call back at all. I find this horrifying that a hotel with the standards it boasts disregards their guests in this way. I personally think that they are too busy looking after the more famous of guests to be bothered with the more normal of guests the have staying with them but who are they to judge who get a decent amount of service during their stay and who does not.", "offset": [982, 1091], "date": "2017-11-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "66d3f67f-64b0-4401-ad46-30fa542d5c7b", "sentence": "Dreadful welcome at reception.

The primary purpose of a hotel is to provide somewhere for people to sleep when away from home with emphasis on sleep. Now I had a room with a constant low humming noise most often in hotels associated with a large air compressor somewhere close by. it is not the air conditioning heat vent because that could be switched on and off. A bit like being next to a bee hive but far louder. The bed it is dangerous why. because it has solid wood hard edged overhangs sticking out under the mattress in just the right position to bang your leg and I did as did many others I spoke to.

And it must be a mass hallucination too given the number of other people telling me about their similar experience. This hotel may score highly on a paper based assessment of facilities but when it comes down to the basics it is a 2 star experience for hundreds of guests as is reflected in the 500 who have given it a poor or terrible rating. The true measure of service quality is how you deal properly with those 500 and it is not by silly platitudes and responses hoping they will return with no indication that you will actually address the issues.", "offset": [141, 271], "date": "2019-10-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}]}
