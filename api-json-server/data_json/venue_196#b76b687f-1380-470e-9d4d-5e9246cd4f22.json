If you are considering booking this hotel for a formal event reception party or wedding do not. Thank me later. I did not know it then but I had the unfortunate experience of having the Bethesda Hyat Regency as host to my weekend nuptials this past Friday. The service was subpar the care and attention to paying customer abhorent and the over all quality of the staff and management extremely disappointing. Where do I beginOverboking. The Hotel double booked the complimentary bridal suite that I booked over a year ago. I was put into a subpar room and tried to compensate by decorating but it lacked the honeymoon vibe the presidential suite had. I was also promised the outside terrace would be completed construction by the time my wedding came around only to tell me about the overboked suite and incomplete terrace the day of my tasting without warning. Also I was assured and contracted that my husband would be place in the governors suite but was not. My husband and his groomsmen were forced to squeeze into a regular sized room to prepare when we had booked and expected a full suite. To make up for the mixup overboking disappointment my matron of honor and I were promised reduced rate and some compensation on food and beverages but when we checked out we were fully charged for all food and drinks. I do not know why the workers here insist on making promises and assurances to patrons that they dishonor. InfuriatingThe hotel overboked our rooms so guests who had reserved rooms on the block were not honored the wedding rate. Also they booked another event during my evening wedding without informing me. The way I discovered it was due to the unethical and sinister actions of the designated event organizer. After I scheduled for my event designer to come to the hotel to decorate in the morning to allot sufficient time for her to get the ceremony and reception room ready Hyat Regency put in a call behind my back and without my permission and told her to come at a much later time. Why. Because I later discovered they booked another event in the same room the time I set up to decorate for my wedding. This was an utter disaster. My wedding guests had to scramble to help the event designer set up and barely got things set up in time. HorificMy matron of honor checked into a room only to discover it was occupied by another hotel guest at the time. How embarrassing and horrible it would have been had she entered the room when those guests were not decently dressed or engaged in personal activity. Inadequate Wedding SuportGuests coming into the hotel lobby were not greeted by hotel staff or any signage letting them know the wedding would be taking place in an upstairs ballroom accessible by elevator. Many guests wandered around aimlessly and no one at the hotel staff bothered to step in and offer assistance or guidance. In fact there was no on site hotel liason to assist the wedding party as we agreed there would be when we booked this hotel. When I inquired about one we were told that there would be not assistant after all and it was all on us and my personal coordinators. I have been in weddings that took place in hotels and am well aware that traditionally there is usually a designated hotel staffer for events. It is almost unheard of that we had none and given the location and reputation of this particular chain and hotel we were shocked at the level of callousness and absence of care and attentiveness paid to our event. Event InadequaciesNeither the reception hall or the dinner hall was set up as agreed upon during early planning with hotel staff. In addition. We were n\u2019t able to rehearse in the actual ceremony space again as promised and contracted. The practice room that was provided was not set up staged to mirror the actual ceremony space which certainly caused confusion amongst my wedding party. Oh and did I mention that we were charged for complimentary upgrades that was included in my wedding package such as the uplights and draping. The catering staff had no clue what was on the menu and asked me the bride. the day of what to serve. I could not imagine more could go wrong but boy was I mistaken. Some of the appetizers and entrees came out cold. Appetizers were even served on NAPKINS. Guests were told certain paid for appetizers were all done when they should not have been done so early into the cocktail hour. Meanwhile random patrons were walking aimlessly through my cocktail hour space to get to another event meeting. One guest had pre ordered a pescatarian meal for herself and husband but both were served a meal with chicken on the side and when the guest informed the server she said flatly we only have orders for 5 fish dishes and essentially told this guest she will be forced to eat what she gets. Meanwhile another guest with a fish allergy was served a meal containing fish. How backwards and ineptLosing marriage licenseFinaly one of the bridesmaids held up the folder and envelope containing my marriage license and announced prior to the ceremony to a room full of members of the bridal party that she was carefully placing in a particular drawer. She then demonstrated her actions because she wanted more witnesses to her placing the license away. Between then and when we returned to the room to have the officiant sign the marriage certificate it had disappeared. We are still not sure if one of the cleaning staff absconded with it purposefully or threw it away casually and recklessly. Something so important and necessary for the start of my life with my new husband. Gone. Did I tell you this was a disaster of a hotel or what. Please please. Save yourself the headache heartache and grief and do not book this hotel for your event. I do not know why or how one hotel could be so tremendously and significantly disappointing but the Hyat Regency Bethesda managed to win the award for the worse ever. They almost ruined my big day but fortunately for me I took things in stride and with my friends managed every hiccup but no one should have to go through what I went through with these people. EVER.

So far so good. Our 3rd floor room was attractive clean and pleasant. Unfortunately the beds were extremely hard. This is an issue that can be a deal breaker for me so I was very disappointed. All of the pillows were the same flat but very squishy style. For some reason the clock between the beds would sound its alarm every night at 12 midnight despite the fact that the alarm was \u201c off \u201d. It would sound for several seconds then turn itself off. I could also hear the clock in a neighboring room doing the same thing. Two even more problematic issues were the fact that the wi fi was n\u2019t working correctly in our room. My iPhone worked fine but my husband \u2019s iPhone could not connect to the wi fi at all and the connection on my iPad would switch in and out rapidly so proved useless. Oddly all three devices picked up the wi fi in the lobby downstairs just fine. My biggest problem however was the noise. Our room was one of the rooms bordering the atrium. Even though we were on the 3rd floor we could hear the sounds from the lobby until very late. The atrium acts like a funnel for any noises coming from downstairs. Every wedding party every group of late night drinkers every meeting of conference attendees had a built in megaphone as the atrium blasted their noise up through the hotel levels. It kept me awake for many hours every single night of our stay.
