I would not be so bad if not for 2 major issues. I planned these vacations for a long time and chose this hotel primarily because it has good reviews and included the breakfast and airport shuttle. My greatest disappointment is the breakfast. It was literally horrible. Cheapest juice a poor Bagel and tasteless coffee. after second breakfast in this place I said enough and I decided to go to other places. I ended up paying for my breakfast but at least I got the breakfast. second issue One day before leaving I ask for the shuttle I had flight at 10 AM I was told that they can only provide the shuttle starting. 9 am and if I need it earlier I have to pay it myself. So I ended up again to pay for what supposed to be included. In brief for hotel that included breakfast and shuttle I had to pay for breakfast and for the shuttle.

The VIP club passes were useless we were charged 30 per person for club entry. Breakfast consisted of only toast or bagels. The airport transportation was unavailable for our flights so we had to pay for taxi both ways. The limited complimentary happy hour only consisted of gin or vodka. The hotel pool was dirty.
