Had numberous issues with this hotel. TRULY disapointing experience for my daughter and myself1. Truly surpised that this hotel does NOT NOT provide heated pool at all It was a gorgeous day and the water was FREEZING. Was truly shocked that this hotel decided to be cheap and not have heated pool for their guests. The pool deck area was FULL of kids and people but very few people went swimming because of the COLD FREEZING water. 2. Their valet parking. what a mess. defintely not a smooth operation I see too many staff people standing around and cars needs to be parked. I actually witnessed a car pulled up and asked for bellman cart The Guy in red jacket said Ok and took out his walke talkie and asked for someone to help this person HE actually STOOD STILL waiting for this other bellman to come to help this person. I have ALWAYS seen at other hotels that first person that car contacted helps imeditaly without calling someone and standing doing nothing took about 9 minuites for the person to come yes i did time this because I did NOT like what I saw. thus causing long wait to get in hotel. 3 Truly HATED the restaurant breakfast service The waitress had zero patience. I was eating a bagel with lox in my hand this server came to me asking if I had any voucher etc I nodded yes and proceed to eat this LADY stood there waiting for me saying hm can I have it. That was absoutely RUDE of her. so I had to put down the bagel and take out the voucher and give it to her. I went back to eating the bagel she came right back. I did nt even finish the bagel and she insisted that I fill out the check right now and stood there waiting. so I AGAIN put down the bagel and filled out AND ON PURPOSELY GAVE THIS RUDE WAITRESS ABOSUTELY ZERO TIP. I found this truly an offensive experience. Other hotels always WAIT but this waitress UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH 4. I had a gorgeous view suite room and when I pulled out the sofa bed It was NOT made at all unlike other hotels where they always have it premade. I had to call downstairs and wait for 30 MINUITES for someone to come up and make the bed. UGH forcing my 9 year old girl who was already TIRED to wait even longer to be able to go to bed. 5. I had called the hotel in advance and arranged with someone to make sure the room type was requested. GUESS WHAT when I came to check in The front desk had disgred that persons arrangement and gave me a very different room than expected. I did NOT like having to come back down to deal with room change. 6. the bellman at the hotel is extremely RUDE. I have never encountered a rude bellman before in ANY highly ranked hotels. HOW was he rude. he absoutely refused to allow my girl to ride on the cart even though after asking him to let her he refused. He went up to my room then we had to go back down for correct room This time I would nt let him get the cart and allowed my girl to ride the cart and I manually pushed the cart all the way to my room while this BELLMAN walked aside refusing to help in any way because I wanted my girl to enjoy the moments. what an arrogant rude bellman. last year Orlando World Mariot bellmans had allowed that and made it enjoyable there was no problem along with all the other hotels including Las Vegas JW Mariot. UGH UGH did NOT enjoy his atudte at all 7. Their hotel room wifi. SUCKS extremely slow even though I had signed up for premium plan.

When we arrived there was a mix up with the scheduling and payment of our rooms and we sat and waited for hours 5 12 to be exact. I asked to speak with the MOD twice by 2 different desk staff and nothing. Having a disability and needing some where to take my medication at certain times of the day is of the utmost importance to me. but as a guest here at this hotel did not make me feel like my concerns were important. So once the matter was resolved and we finally got our room I was even more disappointed with the visible DUST coving the telephones night stand and desk. I had to wipe down the room before I could do anything. I would like to know when the concerns of a dissatisfied guest became so unimportant. If it was not for the fact I am so far away from homePA.

For the second year in a row my wife and I decided to do an overnight at the Tampa Mariot Waterside for the Chanelside fireworks. We arrived early around 1 pm and knew our room would not be ready but wanted to guarantee we would be having a balcony room on a high floor facing fireworks. No problem. Our friends from The Villages had their room all ready for them. We drove around to Clearwater Beach had lunch at Whiskey Joes and returned to the hotel. What a mess. The hotel valet service was swamped with incoming andoutgoing cars blocking the reception area and a limo bus was blocking their driveway. We finally got to the valet dropped off the car and found a line of at least 100 people checking into the hotel. I went to a side area said I had already checked in and just needed my key. No problem and received a 50 voucher just for having a nice smile after the day the desk clerk had with other guests. The hotel was booked to capacity. The lobby was crowded and noisy. However the room was very nice great bed nice bathroom with a wonderful showerhead and nice balcony. Only negative was that someone on a floor directly over us was smoking cigarettes and tossing the still burning butts over the rail. A couple landed on our balcony. Management did nothing to find out who was smoking in a no smoking hotel.

I would have rated the Tampa Mariot good instead of average if that rating was available. But I just could not quite give the very good rating. it is not that it is a bad hotel. But if it was not located along a river in a warm climate it would have blended in with hundreds of other chain hotels. But there is something to be said for the consistency of the Mariot brand. I was attending a conference at the hotel and was booked for five nights. I arrived fairly early in the morning after a red eye from Seattle. I checked in via the Mariot ap which is a quirky bit of software in the shuttle on the way to the hotel from the airport. It is only about a 15 minute ride. It was clear at first where I should go to to retrieve my key having checked via the ap so I approached the front desk. The desk staff person was very friendly. She was able to get me early check in and handed me my keys to a room on the 5th floor. Normally I prefer higher floors but after experiencing the painfully slow elevators at the hotel I ended up being grateful to be on the lower floor. I ended up simply taking the stairs down to the work out and pool level on the third floor the entire stay. I had a standard room with two queen beds. Again I prefer a single King but after flying all night I was grateful just to have a bed. I was pleased to see I had also ended up with a balcony. Though the room faced downtown and not the river so there was not much to see other than the adjacent hockey arena and the streetcar. Also the balcony looked as though it had not been hosed down in months. All the grime from the adjacent rooftop and street was obvious. The balcony was also a bit noisy especially when there was a game being played at the sports arena. The room was simple and comfortable. There was minimal art which I always find a let down. I appreciate when room decor offers something to break up the monotony. The desk space was fine. There was a small refrigerator and a safe. As a Mariot rewards member I got free WiFi but if you are not a member you pay. There is free WiFi in the conference areas restaurants and lobby though. The bathroom was small with a tiny tub. The hotel offered an option of forgoing having housekeeping service your room for one to three days in exchange for Mariot reward points so I opted in. I actually like not having to worry about housekeeping knocking on the door. The only downside was having to conserve towels. I did note that the trash can had not been emptied before I checked in. I assume this was because I had early check in but it was annoying. The room was quiet. I did not hear a lot of street noise or noise from the hallway. Ice and soda machines were located down the hall. The hotel does have a nice workout room located next to the outdoor pool on the third floor. The workout room had all the standard machines and weights and each machine has a television attached. The pool is spacious with lots of lounge chairs. The hotel has two restaurants a waterside grille and a sports bar. You can also get some service at the pool. I ate at both restaurants. The grill was difficult to get into for dinner and I discovered the menu was not that different from the sports bar. Prices at both restaurants were quite reasonable for hotel food. I liked the casual atmosphere of the sports bar though it was quite noisy with large televisions playing various sporting events. The food was fine and the portions generous. I made the mistake of ordering pulled pork nachos my last night there and was shocked at how large the platter was. I ended up taking the leftovers to my room for a late night snack. I did order room service one night. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety and the reasonable prices. It came quickly but instead of a room service tray it came in a caryout bag. The room service person just handed it to me and I did not even have to sign for it. I was actually relieved because I always feel awkward when the room service people wheel in a big cart and tray and you have that moment when they have you sign the receipt and never really know whether to add an additional tip. The meeting space was standard hotel conference space. The opening reception included appetizers and an open bar. The appetizers were ok but nothing special. Although the open bars included a full selection of alcohol I was surprise when I tried to order a bourbon rocks and was told that I could have anything on the rocks without a mixer. Not sure what that was all about so I just had wine. I did note that there were several other conferences going on at the hotel at the same time and it did get confusing at times figuring out which was mine. The hotel is located on a nice riverwalk that is perfect for a walk or run. There are some shops and restaurants nearby. I was surprised and amused to see a sign along the walk warning of alligators. I checked out of my room the same way I checked in via the Mariot ap. It was a breeze. All said and done the Tampa Mariot Waterside is a fine hotel. I just think it could refresh its rooms and decor a bit.", "offset": [3590, 3656], "date": "2017-03-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "9d680215-0654-4496-ad8e-190a64e76692", "sentence": "Excelant view of the bay and riverwalk.

I am a bonafide hotel snob. I only stay in the nicest possible hotels and as such have stayed in a number of 4 and 5 star hotels in my lifetime. I took my wife to Tampa for an Andrea Boceli concert and we stayed at the Westshore Grand which is just a decent hotel in a lousy location because we could not get a room at the Mariot Waterside in Tampa as it was fully booked. We were fortunate enough to stay at the Mariot Waterside the following night and it absolutely exceeded our expectations. Per usual with the Mariot brand the staff was super friendly and warm and we felt right at home. We both commented many times how we wished we could stay another night. The location is fantastic being walking distance from Amalie Arena and a number of very delicious restaurants and the sunset view of the waterway and the bay from the room terrace was beautiful. The lobby is elegant and beautifully designed and provides that initial sense of opulence that I have come to enjoy when staying at a luxury hotel. The rooms leave nothing to be desired. Once again the Mariot has thought of everything. The beds are clean and very comfortable and we slept well. We could even log into our Netflix account from the room TV. Being that we do not really watch any television that was a nice bonus. The pool area is very nicely appointed with couples \u2019 chairs that come complete with sunshades and a full bar. The concierge breakfast was delicious and the buffet was full of food that was sourced locally and an omelette and waffle station. The chef perfectly cooked my sunny side up eggs. I have only one very minor area that might be improved here. First while the bartender was a super nice guy the margaritas at the pool bar were some of the worst I have ever had. Being in Tampa you will hear some traffic noise whilst on your hotel room balcony but it was by no means offensive to us. We will absolutely positively be back to the Mariot Waterside in Tampa and we hope to be able to bring our children along as there is simply so much to do in Tampa.

My wife young daughter and I arrived at this hotel a few days earlier than originally intended due to a really bad experience at another hotel at Clearwater Beach. Although not a beach hotel as we would have preferred we have no regrets whatsoever about staying at The Tampa Mariot Waterside Hotel Marina for 6 nights during the tail end of our Florida vacation during late March and early April 2018The location is very pleasant and well situated with really nice views overlooking the Marina and one of the waterways on one side whilst on another side there are pleasant views over the pool and another adjoining waterway. there is an abundance of restaurants and other amenities also in view in close proximity. You can walk down to the boats and along the waterway should you wish to. Something we found a very pleasant experience a warm evening. It is more a business hotel than a holiday hotel and so you may get a Conference or two going on whilst staying there. We can not really comment on that as we were there over Easter and so it was not a problem to us. It is very well placed for major concert and sports event venues. The staff could not have been more helpful both on Check In and at all times afterwards. The initial room we were offered was one of their Stay Well Balcony Double Queen rooms on the 15th floor overlooking the pool and the water. It was clean very nicely decorated and very comfortable. For us though with an active young daughter it was just a little too small for a 6 night stay and so with the assistance of the extremely helpful front desk staff we moved to a beautiful King Suite on the 18th floor. This room was delightful with plenty of space two separate sunny balconies overlooking the Marina and a made up bed for our daughter in the lounge area c w with her own 55 TV. The room service is very good and not overpriced. The Concierge Lounge on the 24th floor really is Excellent. There is live entertainment regularly in the main hotel lobby area. Valet parking is on a par with other hotels of this class with very friendly staff. The only area that we feel could have been improved on during our stay was the Waterside Grill restaurant where we felt that the menu was somewhat restricted and the table service very slow. and it certainly was not busy when we ate there. This was certainly what prevented us from dining there more than just the once. The Champions Sports Bar is great very laid back and with a good atmosphere. The Pool Bar Grill is excellent as is the whole pool area. All in all we enjoyed our stay very much at this hotel and it would be fair to say that all of us were a little sad to leave.
