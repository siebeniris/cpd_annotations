But we had a breeze from the ocean. If you go to Key West and want a nice well maintained beach this is it. No other place on the island we saw had such a beautiful beach view. They have beach attendants who bring complimentary umbrellas and chairs. Fruit and water at the stand as well. After Duval St we could not wait to get back to the serenity of this place.

We went downstairs to see if they could accommodate us and they were unable to give us a room with a tub. We decided to get a bite to eat at Spencer \u2019s before unpacking and the food was served cold. After a long day of traveling we expected a hot meal at the very least especially for the price.

They went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. It was perfect. We decided to give the restaurant another shot since it was late and we were starving at that point. We had a much better experience and the food was great this time. But we should n\u2019t have to complain to get great service at a hotel of this status.

An absolutely terrible experience we went for 7 days which was way too long. Rooms were disgraceful. Our shower had mould in corners and leaked constant complaints never dealt with. Even took photos on dirtiness. The chairs in room were filthy old suncream stains and room with a view. That was a joke our room showed us other balconies and that was after they convinced us to upgrade. So over priced also paid upfront before leaving AUS. Provided voucher that travel agent gave and then they charged to our Visa card without authorisation. Currently have a fraudulent claim with bank and Key West Police Department. Yes pictures do look nice but beach is very very small area. There is not enough area for guests and they only provide a certain number of umbrellas on beach area so if you can not get one its very hot sitting in the sun. Beach water was also very unclear and next to a hotel that allowed pets so not kidding there was animal faeces that would float on by. Pool area also very small and overcrowded and difficult to get a shaded area to sit. We chose not to eat in restaurant due to the high cost of meals so can not comment on that quality. We would walk down to the street to restaurants to eat. Hotel room also did not come with a fridge so that is an upgrade. Our decision to go there was based on reviews and the pictures but please reconsider as this review is a genuine one for concern if anyone was to book and go there with the same expectation we had. That was a clean room view and lovely beach. We were so disappointed and also outraged by their lack of service and respect and using our card without authority. Most staff have English as a second language so communication is difficult and pool area staff are young kids having a summer job so there is not particularly good service. They also mentioned going to their hotel next door which is not next door. You have to use a side access and walk down a street to another side access and they do not even have a beach all it is 2 pools with sand they have placed around the area and there is no access onto what they call the beach because it is all rock area and water was quite stagnant and smelly. There are many better areas to stay if you want to go to Key West for a tropical beach forget it. You can do a day trip to Key West from Miami and see everything and you would b e glad you did not stay. Most of Key West is mangrove swamp area.

When we booked a \u201c Waldorf resort \u201d for our Christmas vacation there was a certain expectation. It was not met. Upon check in I was told there were no available upgrades or even other rooms at or below our rate. The front exterior is very plain and might as well have been the Best Western up the street. The lobby is equally unimpressive. Walking through and along the pool is nice. But you end up walking past the backside of the outdoor bar. Not that charming to see racks of glasses or the exposed tanks for carbonation. The courtyard is nice. A bocce court and life size chess board are encircled by the plain white exterior of the rooms and balconies. The pool is nice. Not huge. But serviceable and nicely close to the beach. But the beach. OH. The beach. It \u2019s a really nice size especially considering that Key West is n\u2019t really known as a beach destination. But if it were actually cleaned of the small mountains of seaweed daily it would be useable. Unfortunately it is n\u2019t. And the nice views are ruined by it. Let \u2019s go to the room. When we got to it after check in there was the fragrance of a room that had not been aired out in a while. We went to put the kids \u2019 drinks in the refrigerator and it was hot and had mold in it. The staff was very accommodating and apologetic. There was a new refrigerator in no time at all. We went to the pool for a little while. Came back and opened the fridge and everything in it was warm and sweating. Called again. This time while we were out to dinner they came and found that the electrical outlet was bad. Is there another room in which all the electric services are working. \u201c. No. Not for the length of your stay. There \u2019s nothing we can do \u201d. So we stayed in a room with a gaping not really cleaned hole under the counter and a refrigerator buzzing in the living area. The room was on a semi corner. But seemed like an afterthought not that the builder forgot that they were supposed to put a room there. Awkwardly structured. We walked in to see a wall. Turn and see the counter sink foul fridge. Gonaround the corner and there \u2019s the stained couch. And the less than glamorous bed. The bathroom has a large void when walking in that I suppose is meant to hang and dry bathing suits. Why anyone would need 30 square feet to dry clothes is beyond my comprehension. There were cracked tiles and chewed up wall corners. The transition from the shower to the bathroom is cracked throughout and wobbles. But the air conditioner is loud. We found a nail in the rug. May have been from a repair done to the window or sliding door to the balcony. The balcony is small. Looks out over some nice trees just do n\u2019t look down. It \u2019s nothing but a broken down shed a dumpster and the service area for laundry. Do n\u2019t look up because you \u2019l worry the crown molding may continue to flake off or just fall. The service at the pool and the food from the restaurant were very good. We \u2019d have loved to try the restaurant \u2019s Christmas Eve \u201c 7 fishes \u201d dinner. But were told they had no tables. We went to the sister property \u201c Casa Marina \u201d and immediately wished we \u2019d booked there. WOW. What a dramatic difference and what a beautiful set up. After eating there and walking back to the Reach we went for a swim and noticed plenty of empty tables at the restaurant. It was then that I realized that we were able to just walk right on to the property through a gate with no locks. After noticing this I started to pay more attention to the security of the Reach. There is none. There \u2019s nothing to stop a person from walking off the street and into the parking garage using an elevator or stairs and going up to any room. There \u2019s nothing to stop anyone from doing the same and going right to the pool beach or common areas. At one point I \u2019d left the room to get snacks. When I came back my wife said that someone had knocked on the door offering a clear bag of shampoos. It was 915pm. We have two children in the room. When I asked the front desk if it was normal I was told \u201c no \u201d. But given no apology After asking to speak to the general manager I was told that my message would be relayed and I would be contacted. I never was. The gate that leads from a public alley off of a public street to the resort \u2019s \u201c private beach \u201d has no lock and no way of locking. Just come on in. To sum up.

The Reach is located right next to the Southern Most Point. A few steps from the hotel starts Duval street which is only a mile long. Great location. The Reach has the only natural sand beach with ocean access along with a pool. This is a big draw since most of the resorts only have pools or beach chairs on decks docks with no sand or beach access. But the Reach is not cheap and for the price you will need to decide early on what is most important to you on your vacation before you commit to paying the price. We could have easily taken two other vacations to more luxurious resorts with better service for what we paid for just 5 days at the Reach even with a wedding rate discount. The rooms are average even after the upgrades and I have a better bed with more luxurious bedding at home. The bathrobes are nice but do not expect slippers with it. And be prepared to go to the local CVS to buy bottled water and anything else you need. Everything in the resort store is highly overpriced. The staff is very courteous but the service itself is average. The Reach markets amenities that you would expect to be included for the price you pay but the amenities either do not exist or are not high quality. The service on the beach and the pool need improvement. Again the staff is accommodating but more staff is needed. The bar does not open until 130AMeven though everywhere else on Duval street serves alcoholic drinks at 7AM. Beach and pool drink service is very slow. There are service buttons on the umbrella poles but I do not believe they work. We tried multiple times to use the buttons on different days but even after waiting 15 minutes or more the waiter did not show so we went to the bar ourselves. The staff walked around with Popsicles once a day at the beach and pool but never once was I offered a chilled eucalyptus towel which is marketed on the Daily Resort Fee Inclusions. The daily resort fee is 45Repairs and upgrades are still in process so keep that in mind. They are doing their best to update everything so expect to see and hear repairs being done during your stay.
