My husband and I were really looking forward to our babymon staycation. I had heard so many great things read positive reviews and it was recommended by a co worker. Maybe my expectations were set too high. The short of the long is that in my opinion if golfing is not your thing this is not the resort for you. Their hospitality is very much lacking and things that seem like second nature at other hotels are an afterthought if a thought at all. Property is very much outdated and there is not a whole lot to do. For more specific details feel free to continue reading. From the moment we arrived we were met with a cold and unpleasant attitude. It took a good 30 to 45 seconds for us to even be acknowledged by the front desk staff after I said under my breath is anyone going to acknowledge us. Odd thing was that when another gentlemen of caucasian descent came in after us he was immediately and warmly greeted. My husband black and I hispanic immediately caught on to this without needing to say anything to one another. We were checked in and gave passes to explore the property since our room was not ready we arrived 30min early so that is fair. We were told we would get a call when our room was ready but when it had reached our check in time of 4 pm we had yet to receive a call. We walked back and arrived 5 past 4 and our room still was not ready. The front desk representative was neither helpful nor apologetic that our room was not ready. She responded only with we will call you when it is ready and it is only 5min past your check in time. There was no effort on her part to see what the issue was or to try to expedite the process. None of this said hospitality or warmness by any stretch of the imagination. Finally one of the other front desk reps who perhaps overhead decided to change our room when it got closer to 430pm and our original room still was not ready. We appreciated this a lot. We tried to move on and not let this ruin our stay and made the most of the rest of the time. The rooms were fine there was nothing really wrong with them but the property as a whole seemed to be a little outdated. We were on our way out the room the next morning when housekeeping came by and so they skipped us and we thought they were going to come back. They never did. If golfing is not your thing there is not a whole lot left to do. If you are a family there is a large playground and one of the pools has a slide and kidie area that is perfect for you but for couples that perhaps do not want to golf and want to do something other then hangout by the pools all day there are not a lot of options. There is mini golf basketball and shuffleboard. We were excited about these activities until we arrived. All three of these things were tiny outdated and not well kept. The basketball court looked like one at an old abandoned park mini golf was really rough around the edges with holes missing labels and lanes on top of one another. We played two rounds and made the most of it. On our last day on the property the cherry on top of our stay was being asked for identification at one of the pools shortly after we arrived. We were the only ones there and the security officer on duty said he received a call about that gates being locked even though he did not check all the gates upon arrival. The officer said but while I am here can I see your resort passes. We did not question him but again we both got a sinking feeling and wondered why our presence was questioned. Security to get onto the property is really tight and everyone inside had already presented proper documentation. I am not the type of person to make something about race but too many things happened even in addition to what I wrote here that left me wondering. Maybe it was not we did encounter some friendly staff along the way but some obvious things did occur that left us with doubt and feeling unwelcome.", "offset": [3096, 3238], "date": "2018-07-21", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "cf02e6af-a7d5-4d8e-a719-895663bd3217", "sentence": "Beautiful Resort. Super Smelly Room and a bit run down. My Husband and I and some friends stayed at Inisbrok last weekend for a special event. First let me say the positives. Everyone that works at the resort was lovely. Extremely friendly and polite and they went out of their way to make you feel welcome. The bed was super comfortable and the Lochnes pool was delightful and relaxing. Now here is the negatives. The room we were put in was the in the Merion building. The damp moldy musty stench the minute you opened the main door to the building is over powering. Our room was so damp and musty that our carpet was damp. It was so gross and I honestly felt like no one should be put into this building. I had dizzy spells and a headache the whole time I was in the room from breathing in whatever it was that was making the room smell so badly. it is just really really unhealthy to breathe that in. The other bad part is you can not control the AC so every time I tried to crack the AC down to dry out the room it would automatically go back up to 75. I know they have plans to remodel but they should have never ever let it get this bad. The other negative was the lounges at the pool. They were filthy and stained. My Husband was wearing a white long sleeved sun shirt which was white and I had to stain stick the arms and the whole back of his shirt to get all the dirt out. it is just poor management to have crappy dirty lounges out at such a beautiful resort. The last negative is some of the obnoxious golfers with the big mouths and the endless drinking. I know members are what keeps this place in business. However my Husband and I are local and we were considering joining Inisbrok. after witnessing this behavior the entire time we were there we said NO WAY. I mentioned to our server at dinner on Friday evening about the table 5 feet away from us that the man was yelling was drunk and obnoxious. Our server just had the attitude of Yeah I know. the next day I was trying to buy some water and some Yahoo was acting like I was not even in line at the pool bar yelling at the girl who was behind the counter that he was a member and he wanted his drinks. Sure enough she waited on this rude guy. just too much for me. I can not stand obnoxious pretentious behavior. The girl behind the counter should of politely asked the man to wait his turn. But I am sure she was uncomfortable and was intimidated by him. He was just a jerk. Like I said it is a beautiful resort and the food was pricey but delicious.
