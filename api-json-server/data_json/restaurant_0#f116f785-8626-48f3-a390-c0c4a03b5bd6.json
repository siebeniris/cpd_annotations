They had a package that covered the one night stay parking our truck there while we went on our cruise and shuttle to from cruise port. In actuality we did not even use the shuttle because it was only about 12 mile walk to the cruise port. We found it easier to just walk with our rolling luggage so we did not have to wait on a shuttle. It was a very safe location and we felt safe walking there even in the middle of the night. When we returned from our cruise we just walked back got our truck and took off versus the people parked at the cruise terminal that had to fight traffic coming going. Also when we compared pricing to parking at the cruise terminal the entire time the hotel was a great deal. The truck was perfectly fine and everything inside secure while we were gone. As for the hotel itself our room layout was very nice with separate sleeping and living areas. The staff was VERY nice. They actually did not have air conditioning while we were there but they offered alternate lodging if needed since they were not going to be able to get it fixed that night. They truly did all that they could in that situation. They sent out advanced notice before we arrived to ensure we were aware of that situation. Honestly it was not that bad. The free breakfast was incredible. This was not the standard free continental breakfast. This had plenty of choices with many hot dishes including an omelette station This will definitely be our standard place to stay in Tampa when cruising.", "offset": [1449, 1601], "date": "2015-01-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "4d7c67bb-2c9c-4db6-b84e-27f409326d0f", "sentence": "Convenient location to convention center.

On a Sunday morning they were jackhamering the whole place is a mess. The staff at the front desk while checking in about 8 at night was courteous and efficient. When trying to check out the next day there was a wait for a luggage cart we were fine waiting but a total of 2hrs later and still no cart. I called downstairs to make sure they had requested one for me the lady said there is a long wait and you are on the list with an annoyed tone. I asked if she could tell me about how many pl were ahead of me on the list she said No I can not. I do not have access to the list. I will put you in again. And she ended the call. It was extremely rude. I also would like to ask how she knew I was on the list if she could not see the list. It turned out a ship had been delayed for boarding at port and they got swamped. But instead of telling us that so we could plan our time accordingly and find an alternate way to get all of our stuff downstairs in multiple trips on the slowest elevators I have ever had the displeasure of using she let us hang around waiting for two hours. By the time we finally left the hotel it was 1 of the clock. Check out was at 11. The construction was extremely loud and and continued even on a Sunday. Bc of the construction the breakfast area was moves to a small conference room on the second floor. IT WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST BREAKFAST I HAVE EVER HAD. The only things we could all agree on being semi edible were the potatoes covered in ketchup the prepackaged yogurt and the coffee. The only reason I left two stars was for the other staff that was not the front desk. The cleaning crew and bellboys once he got a break to come assist with our stuff.

The entire ground floor is gone and the lobby is a set of fold up tables on the second floor. Adding to my frustration was intermittent internet even when I paid extra for the \u201c high speed \u201d version and a shower that took 10 15 min to warm up. The only saving grace was the breakfast. If you like pastries and protein there is a lot to choose from and it is cooked well.

On a good note the hotel is convenient to Amalie Arena. However check in was extremely slow. There was one individual working the desk and the line was quite long. In fact we observed this same situation many times throughout our stay. We were not offered our amenity of water and chocolate and had to ask about it. The elevators here are a disaster. Only one of the two works next to the check in desk and the three that do work are very slow. In addition they are obviously not programmed correctly as the ones that did work were just not right. When we say they were slow we mean that we often waited 10 minutes for the elevator to arrive and then of course it stopped on almost every floor. This is completely unacceptable. The fitness center is small with only five cardio machines 2 treadmills 2 elipticals and one bike. We had a bayview room and we have stayed at this property before. The rooms have been partially renovated but do not let this fool you. The bathroom had an old toilet seat the door had chipped paint and the floor tile was cracked. It was not nice and fully renovated by any means. On the plus side they did replace the televisions the furniture was alright and there are a lot of outlets. However overall we were unimpressed with the room renovation. The bedroom had what appeared to be a small table with a mirror on it which could be used as a vanity however the lighting was horrible so it could not serve that purpose. The room did not feel like it had undergone an extensive renovation by any means. The lobby area where you enter was filled with large tables that seated 8 10 with a few tables scattered throughout for four. This area was used for the breakfast and evening presentations along with the area behind it that had long tables that again seated large groups. This is an awful setup and we are hoping that in completing their renovation of this area they consider the guest experience and set up smaller tables. There was one small couch off to the side where you could sit but nothing else besides the tables. Forcing people to sit at large tables with other hotel guests and only having minimal other options is really unacceptable. There should at least be tables of 2 and more tables of 4 set up so guests can enjoy their own friends and family in the morning and evening. Further not offering any other seating area ie couches and chairs while guests wait for their rooms to be ready is also unbelievable. These large group tables are really inappropriate and if this is what is being offered as their final renovation it is quite disappointing. The evening presentation is really poor and included pretzels crackers hummus chips and salsa. We are not sure why veggies and dip are not included but again this was unsatisfactory. Breakfast was significantly better although the setup needs improvement. The valet area in the front is a nightmare. There are two separate lanes but it did not appear that there was any directing and we were stuck behind a car in the lane that was supposed to be moving. We were told that valet was the only option but after checking around we found out you can overnight park in the convention center garage. It is much easier to park yourself and walk over to the hotel and costs less than the hotels daily parking fee. We were unimpressed with the room renovation and while the hotel is still undergoing renovation it needs significant improvement in many areas.", "offset": [1672, 1817], "date": "2019-01-21", "cpt": "1", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "327e05ec-ed8a-494f-8468-ba33e50b5e86", "sentence": "Missed chance at renovating.

Housekeeping had also failed to clean the bath portion of the shower as it was cover in sandy dirt. The front counter staff at check in insured me I only needed one slip for breakfast as I had booked a room for 4 at breakfast time I was treated as though we were trying to steal breakfast because I only had one slip. The breakfast buffet was over half empty the entire time we attempted to make a plate. Separately from the hotel but still their problem is the valet. This is the most disorganized valet system I \u2019ve ever seen. I ended up having to replace a year old battery because my door was left ajar and the battery was dead this could have been a security risk as well as a extra cost to me.
