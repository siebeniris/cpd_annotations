We stayed here for the first time for one night with two small dogs on Wednesday. We were looking for a dog friendly hotel just north of Jacksonville and found this place listed on bringfidocom. We read all the reviews along with several on tripadvisor before booking. Our usual routine. Aside from 1 review we only review lodging. Pulling up were were pleased with the modern look. The location was good. Relatively easy to find using our gps. Lots of options nearby for dining shopping fuel. The parking lot was empty out back aside from 2 vehicles so we parked there and were able to walk next door to Outback Steakhouse for dinner. Our room was not on the top floor nor the end as requested. We are very light sleepers. The room was small and had a sleek sparse feel but good for travelers and particularly those needing only a nights stay. The lobby and lobby bar were very cool looking but we did not get to try it as the menu was very limited so we walked next door. There is a lounge fireplace that you can also see and feel in the modern seating area next to the pool. Smokers were utilizing it occasionally as they hotel is smoke free thank goodness. Music was being pumped out there too. There were plenty of grassy area for walking the pups and the landscaping out back and near the pool area was very cool. More about the room yes small but the king size bed was comfy. However the pillows looked cool as they were nice and long but the linens were very scratchy and the pillows turned out to not be comfy leaving both my husband and I with headaches the next am Also around 245 am a heavy footed stomper started making noise on the floor above us. They continued the rest of the night and I laid there with earplugs and our ocean sleep track playing until we finally got up in the morning. People can be so rude. We never heard any other dogs. The bathroom was interesting and sort of cool. There is a light wall with a frosted glass panel that emits or received light from the bedroom. The shower and toilet area can be closed off with a giant mirrored door which gives privacy to those showering and a awesome mirror to those dressing or putting on makeup. One corner of the shower had black mildew running down the seam. Also because its only a shower no tub or spigot turning on the water is interesting. In order to not get wet you have to first take your hand and turn the shower head into the wall away from you then turn the water on all the way so it gets hot. You will get a little wet but not as much if you do not turn the shower head away. Other than the mildew and shower head placement its a big open modern shower. I like it that they place shampoo and body wash in the dispensers. less waste and better for the environment in bulk. OH. if you stay more than one night and do not use housekeeping they give you 5 to use at the bar or extra stay points. cool. Other than that the only bad thing was the coffee prep station was not very clean. I hesitated to use the coffee maker. There was a stir stick left by someone too. The plastic on the cups was torn and there was soap smeared on them. We did not watch any tv because we were tired from the drive but it was a nice big tv easily viewable from the bed. The bed lighting was muted enough for reading but not glaring. It was sort of romantic. The window blinds were great for keeping out the morning sun andor parking lot lights at night. I would give this place a try again. However I want to know why we could not have received an end room or a top floor room to help with noise. Maybe checking in at 7 pm on a Wednesday is too late to get requests. Some places only place dogs on certain floors but that should be stated on the website. It is about 2 hours from here to Savannah. A straight shot pretty much.

Upon arrival at the hotel the girl whom checked us in was a little courteous but very short and not welcoming. We get room 317 at first and head up to that. Open the door to disgusting carpet a room that smelt as if it had just been smoked in and a scratched up headboard that was flaking off on to the pillows. I moved the blanket back to find a hair on the sheets and it looked as it the top blankets were just straightened up to look as if the room had been taken care of. We checked in so late due to being at a wedding hence our reasoning of needing this room that we really did not feel like walking down to the lobby to try to get another room. When I went into the bathroom area where the shower and toilet are located it had a used bar of soap in it and at that point I decided we needed to change rooms contemplated hotels completely. Calling the front desk she stated she would send room service to my room to clean it I told her nicely that we wanted to be moved because we were exhausted and did not feel like waiting around for them to complete it. After being on hold for about 4 minutes she switches us to room 517 we walked in and it reached of bleach to the point that it was nauseating. It was a little bit cleaner but there was still a scratched and peeling headboard random long scratch marks all over the wells and gross tiles that needed to be scrubbed badly in the bathroom. We got to the point of just staying to sleep and as soon as we could get up to do our drive we would leave. Upon checking out our welcome bag from our wedding was not in the room and the girl I asked for it was annoyed that I asked if I could please have it.

I understood however I wanted the front desk person to understand that we were going to need to now check in late about midnight. She noted our reservation. When we returned at 130pm we checked in went to our room and was surprised that it was not a king size bed. instead it was a double.

I must say I was very pleased with everything about our stay. We have been members of the Mariot rewards program for years and love their hotels.

Some Mariot properties charge as 750 to 200 per night. It \u2019s always been my least favorite thing about Mariot properties before Aloft. I would suggest that the Mariot properties that are not in the premium category get more in line with the pricing in the industry.
