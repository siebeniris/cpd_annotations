Just returned from the most amazing 6 day stay at Fiesta Americana. Honestly I do not know how one could find anything bad to say. Check in went smooth it was barely 5 minutes we asked for a room with a balcony and that is what we got. We paid for a Garden View but our room was looking outwards the pool and ocean which was perfect to me. The pool was great and it was heated. I know reviews before I left said it was not but they changed it. Food The breakfast buffet was good. Had something for everyone. Bacon pancakes waffles cereal yogurt eggs anyway fruit etc. There are a lot of options out by the pool. One stand has fish tacos and seafood. Another with American food like burgers fries chesesticks. One with different varieties of pizzas. The Italian restaurant has the longest wait. We put our name in and were not called for 2 hours so hung out by the bar. It was not bad but was not my favorite. The Asian restaurant was my favorite by far. The Indonesian Satay and Spring Rolls were great appetizers. Still drooling thinking about them. The steakhouse opened our second day there. We did not eat there. It was 48 USD per person. Entertainment. There is always something going on and the staff really tries to get everyone involved. There was volleyball on the beach water aerobics dancing by the pool yoga etc. Each night they had some sort of show in the conference room. My favorite was the Michael Jackson one. Make sure you bring a few drinks with. The lobby each night would have a singer. Every singer was great and such good entertainment. I love live musicOnce it hits 130 the lobby starts to die down. There are trips that Chris one of the workers was setting up to take you to a club each night Coco Bongo etc for extra money. The room was more than fine to me. Comfy stocked fridge extra pillows. Yes shower and toilet were basically touching but who cares. you are barely in your room. We did not turn the tv on once. We were brought fresh towels daily along with toiletries. We did a couples massage on The beach. 1 word. AMAZING. I think this is a great hotel for all ages. I traveled with my boyfriend and we are in our 20s and had a blast. There were families college spring breakers couples solo adults and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Hats off to all the amazing workers they truly make the trip. They were so great and did everything to make your trip memorable. I actually miss seeing them everyday straight for 6 days. They are so hard working and always were fixing up something at the resort.

This was by far one of the best all inclusive resort experiences I have had and I have been to many. I have never had better gourmet food at a resort before this one. Staff were amazingly attentive and professional. Selection of restaurants both inside and outside were sufficient. Pools were just cool enough in the morning to be refreshing and warm enough in the afternoon to enjoy but not feel that you are in a bathtub. Lounge chairs went early in the day but we were up by 6 anyway and enjoyed watching the sunrise on our loungers. We had a malfunction with our ceiling fan when we arrived but someone arrived to fix it within 12 an hour. We also had a sewer smell in our room. They came immediately and sprayed but we found out later that that seems to be a problem not just in our room but in other areas of Cancun. We had Just a Drop with us and found that a few drops down the floor drain along with water every other day made the odour disappear. The general store is not very general. It has almost no toiletries and absolutely no medicinal products of any kind. We chose to travel light with just carry on luggage and thought that we would buy things if we needed them. There was apparently a drug store just down the street within walking distance. Also they only sell cigars by the box. Finally they do not accept US cash so we had to make our small purchases with a credit card. Luckily we were travelling with two cards because one did not work for some reason. We could not get wifi in the room and I was having trouble with my iPad but they had several computers in the general store that you can use for free. Remember to either know or bring all your passwords and usernames because I could not get onto my hotmail account. I think it wanted to verify who I was as I was not using it from home but the screen was in Spanish so I could not read the prompts it was asking. We saw a lot of people slipping every day by the pool because the stonework gets slippery when wet. We slipped as well but learned to walk like 90year old people so that we would not fall. We realized late in the trip that neither one of us had any tread on our sandals so be mindful of that. There were several people in wheelchairs and with braces on their legs. On the first two nights we almost gave up on the entertainment because it was poor quality and in the lobby where the acoustics were extremely poor. Luckily we did not give up because the rest of the week the performances were highly entertaining and in one of their halls. We were there during spring break and you could not get near the swim up bar in the afternoon but that did not spoil our vacation as we do not like sitting slightly out of the water in the shade anyway. We had to sleep in separate double beds as there were no Queens or Kings. That was annoying. Also we did not want to face a garden so we paid 60 plus for an oceanfront. The view was beautiful but we ended up not using the balcony as much as we thought we would. We would definitely go back if we were the type of people to repeat our vacations but we are not. We like to experience other places. We would highly recommend this resort.", "offset": [2272, 2420], "date": "2015-03-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "6f6fc6a8-4a24-4069-a666-89f00c72fa50", "sentence": "Great family vacation.

This is a good hotel but has a lot of potential to be better. I visited this hotel with my brother for my birthday and stayed in a partial view room. Although it was a partial view it was very giving and allowed to us to enjoy the view with a juliet balcony. Rooms. The rooms were a bit outdated for my liking. Although they were spacious the bathroom was way too small. The bathrooms have the commode and shower enclosed with the sink being outside. The bathroom width is as big as the commode plus the tub next to it if that makes sense. Wifi was terrible in the rooms but who needs wifi in the room when you are on vacation. The lobby had excellent wifi connections. Grounds. The grounds were kept very clean and the staff would even clean up the beach by burying the seaweed daily. I do hope they consider putting up some umbrellas on the beach as it is impossible to lay in the sun without getting burned. They have a few huts that are against the wall but those can only accommodate a fraction of their guests. My only complaint was that the dishes from room service took days to get cleaned up. Since the rooms are in an outdoor courtyard the birds were having a field day. We also noticed ants in our room probably due to this same reason. Staff. It amazes me to this day how hard the staff worked to get things done. It really made me think twice about complaining about work when I got back. They really hustle and try to accommodate everyone. Please tip them generously and also consider doing so for the house keeping staff. The lobby bar gets pretty busy in the evenings so I had suggest you stick with one bartender. Take care of him and I promise he will take care of you. I had my drinks ready for me just by walking up to the bar and making eye contact. A little goes a long way. Food I have mixed feeling about this category. The breakfast to die for. I still cry in the mornings because I miss it so much. They have their cervicheria with an ocean view that has fried whole fish shrimp tacos and fish tacos that are sinful because they are THAT good. Get there early there is limited seating. The grill by the pool that opens at 12 is a great place to catch a cheeseburger and some fries. The hotel also has a pizzeria type of restaurant that has great food with a great ambiance at night. Very limited seating though. The buffet was really a hit or miss. Unfortunately for us it was more of a miss than a hit on most days. I live in Texas so I held them to high standard for their Mexican restaurant but I was not impressed. The last night we were there we both had sushi and we both ended up getting sick the next few days. It did not even taste right to begin with though. Entertainment. The hotel provides something different every night for the guests ranging from karaoke a live band and even a fire show. The entertainment was ok I have been to other all inclusive resorts that offer better. I also wish that it lasted longer than it did. They do provide care for children and seem to do well with them in their rooms with a projector games and even gaming consoles. My form of entertainment was working out in their gym which is in the spa. It is not a full size gym but offers some good machines to use. They also have dumbbells ranging up to 50 lb. The only downfall it is not air conditioned. You can rent boogie boards from the life guard or the hotel themselves. At the time we went they had red flags up and would not allow us to rent them. Currents are strong and waves get pretty crazy. Not California crazy but they will take you down. The hotel plays the towel game. That means get up early and place your towels on some chairs. I HIGHLY recommend putting something other than just your towel on there because people WILL move them if they are unoccupied for some time. I did come to realize that a lot of people never even show up after putting their towels down. The shopping center La Isla is a 5 min ride down the street with the bus that will cost you 1. You can also go down to the center of cancun on the bus in about 15 min.

Couple pros and cons here and ill be straightforward. My wife and I showed up and during the check. in they had our room all screwed up. They try to put us in a room with two queens and no balcony. Then we told them we signed up for a King with a balcony. He looked in the system and he said they do have one room available for a King but it does not have a balcony. So we settled with that. Sure enough we get to our room and it is a King but it does have a balcony also. Seemed really unorganized and did nt start the trip off right. The rooms are nice but it would be cool if they could incorporate wireless connection for internet. Water and Sand were really nice. There is a limited amount of tiki huts. There was seaweed all over the beach though. Not sure if it was the time of year but it was covered. Do nt plan on getting a umbrella with shade by the pool during the day unles you wake up at 7 in the morning. The alcohol was watered down. My wife weighs all of 115 lbs and rarely drinks. When i see her downing her 5th mojito and she ca nt catch a buzz that s not a good sign. We had our doubts. We went to the bar and ordered a vodka and water to figure it out. We watched him pour almost half vodka and then fill it with water. We took a drink and it literally tasted like regular water with a hint of lime. It was ridiculous. Beer and cokes had a flat taste to them as well. Make sure your hotel bottle water in your fridge is a new bottle everytime. We went to grab the two bottles and they both had the seal broken already and were filled un evenly. You do the math. The food options are better during the day than the restaurants at night. We stayed for 7 days and went to each restaurant once and that was enough. Thanks god for the Grill and La Cevicheria. Food is solid. I may be knitpicking a little here. The smoothy bar is legit toi literally laughed at the Entertainment at night. It was a complete joke. We get there and find out that the actual theater was under construction and shut down. So they piled everybody awkwardly in the hotel lobby to have the entertainment. There is no room for seating and the entertainment itself was brutal. I actually hope that it was un organized and they through stuff together. The coffee is horrible in that little coffee shop they have. But definitely get the FROYO they have in there. Chichen Itza. A little advice on this. DO NOT LET THE TOUR GUIDES sell you on buying Mayan Art at the shop during lunch time. Its a scam. They kept telling us how authentic everything is and how you need to spend money there. Wait until you get to ChichenItza to buy anything you need. Tshirts hats art watever it is you want. They have Vendors all over the place willing to sell you the same exact stuff for half the price. But other than that the excursion was well worth it.

I recently stayed at the Fiesta Americana in Cabo for a wedding in the family. There was lots of great food drinks activities like water volleyball and Zumba at the pool and family fun. It really is nice when you can all stay on the resort for most of the trip and have a great timeWe did take some off resort trips like diving and deep sea fishing but we mostly stayed on site for the whole 6 day vacation. There are quite a few restaurants to visit and they are all pretty great food. The Italian restaurant is elegant and refined the steak house is very good and there is great Mexican Food place as well. I enjoyed the resort restaurants and I always felt like I was actually going to a restaurant instead of a cafeteria. There are like 9 of them and they each have their own menus desserts and design. The creme brule at the steakhouse was not the same dessert as the Italian restaurant each place is a different experience. I have traveled to Mexico a few times now but mostly to somewhere on the Yukatan side Cabo is a lot of fun. There is great diving the water is not nearly as clear as the Caribbean but we saw a white tipped shark within 10 minutes of our first dive and there were plenty of seals trumpet fish and wildlife deep sea fishing horse back riding tours glass bottom boat tours and so many different cultural experiences parades and festivals to enjoy. Overall I had a great time. I would go back again and staying at an all inclusive resort like Fiesta Americana is great because all you really NEED to bring is tip money. everything else is waiting for you. They had food entertaining shows events the beach activities pools swim up bars and cocktail restaurants. No need to plan everything out either because they can do that for you once you are there. However it was VERY hot and humid in August of 2015. It felt like summer in Atlanta where taking a shower did not cool me off much. The air conditioning was not really working very well. for the whole resort. The only place I could find respite from the heat was in the wine cooler a perfect 17 degrees C Nowhere else. Not my room any of the restaurants or even the pool because the pool water would heat up to 88 degrees. It felt like a sauna everywhere I went. I heard it was exceptionally hot this year in particular but I do not understand the lack of AC. I think even the Holiday Inn Express had air conditioning. Even hotels in British Columbia have AC. So that did not make sense and put a bit of a damper on the whole experience. What always lifted me back up at this resort and the reason I would go back was the staff. Everyone was very accommodating seemed to enjoy their jobs and tried to learn what I liked. I especially appreciate Israel Castilo and Carlos Santos Lozano. Israel anticipated needs suggested food and drinks that I liked rushed to keep me hydrated fed and I was always well taken care off when he was our server at the pool. Carlos was the Mexican version of Tom Cruise in the movie cocktails. He was always ready with any kind of drink you asked for. He made new ones after I told him what I liked including a mint julep twist some new margarita flavors and something like a peach lemon drop that was not too sweet you probably do not believe me but it is possible for a whisky drinker to enjoy a vodka cocktail that is not too sweet. Great great service. This would have been a four star place with AC in every restaurant and room. I live Mexico but I have to be able to cool off somewhere.

My wife and I have been to many all inclusive resorts and never had a bad time but this was the best. It started with check in. By reading other reviews we knew there was on going construction but were upgraded from ocean view to ocean front to move us further from the construction. During the day you can go on the many excursions offered relax at the beautiful beach with soft white sand and turquoise waters or sit around or in the multi tiered pool complete with kids area waterfalls volley ball and of course swim up bar. If you like to drink you are never far from a bar stocked with top shelf liquor. Not sure what to drink a bartender or waiter will surprise you and we were never disappointed. If you like to eat this is the place. Breakfast buffet in two restaurants or get the 24 hour room service. For lunch there is a pizza oven a healthy option of wonderful wraps a grill with burgers dogs chicken fries onion rings nachos or chicken nuggets the fish shack with fantastic fish tacos shrimp cocktail and more and there is the daily feast that is set up in the pool area we tried the steak and pork kabobs and papaya. For dinner there is a buffet that always has plenty of options or four sit down options. The Italian restaurant could hold it is own in any major city.

Charming place that most people are not aware of.", "offset": [1362, 1447], "date": "2017-02-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "e2a2c1f0-5d4d-49b5-a67d-b7c44658034d", "sentence": "Amazing resort for the price. We booked this resort on a discount travel website just a month before visiting. I know you are always taking a chance doing this however after reading the reviews we decided to go for it. We did buy trip insurance just in case. From arriving at the resort which is only about 15 minutes from the airport until leaving we were very impressed. Our first impression of the lobby was wow. The Christmas tree presents and some decorations were still up making it look very festive. People came immediately to help with our bags which is wonderful after a long trip. Tanya took care of checking us in and answered all our questions. At first she was going to have to put our family of 4 on two separate floors. We were sharing some items in our suitcases so it was not very convenient. However we reluctantly agreed when she promised to be able to put us on the same floor the following day. Finally she found that she could upgrade one of our rooms to partial ocean view which was fantastic because our college age girls have never seen the beautiful Caribbean water before. This way they had a beautiful view right out their door and we would be on the same floor. That was so thoughtful and a wonderful start to our trip. Our rooms were just fine above average. The beds were very comfortable. I am not sure where to start with all that I could say about resort. For casual meals we loved the fish tacos at the CEVICHER\u00cdA. They were wonderful and fresh and the wonderful servers were so friendly. The nachos with the pico and the guacamole at the Grill were great. We had those many days. And we are not huge drinkers but the pina coladas and wine hubby had and such were great. We tried many of the restaurants except the Asian and the Sushi however the Mexican restaurant was our favorite. Each time we went the food was wonderful. Now I am not a food snob but even the food presentation was beautiful. If you ordered the caesar salad the romaine lettuce was stacked in a lovely arranged way with a large onion slice wrapped around it. Dressing was on the side. So unique and creative. And tasty. What made it even more delightful was the different types of live music from a man playing a harp to authentic sounding Mexican singers with beautiful voices. The shows at night ranged from good to great. The fire show was great. The circus show was quite good but not really circus y more like various creative things people did. For example there was a couple doing a roller skating segment where they would do tricks. He would pick her up swing her around etc almost like couples ice skating show. It was good. After the shows sometimes we would wander to the teen room which is right beside the auditorium where most of the shows were held. Eduardo is in charge of the teen room. He is so friendly and kind. It was also a nice room to have to hang out and play air hockey pool or video games. There were various other things to do during the day like dance lessons pool aerobics etc or of course you could do nothing at all. One day we carved out pineapples and made faces on them. Then a drink was made and poured into our pineapples to drink out of them. That was very neat. Also I should say that the beach was wide and beautiful. There were many workers keeping it constantly clean the same could be said for the pool. The only tiny thing I could say I did not care for was that when we were checked in we were introduced to someone who showed us where things were and explained things about the resort. Apparently he is also there to entice you to do their timeshare breakfast with them to get certain free gifts and reduced spa services. So every time we saw him he would ask if we were ready to do our tour. We just politely said No but it got a little old. But other than that we LOVED the smaller feel of the resort the very friendly people who go out of their way to help you or to offer you a drink. We have already recommended this place to some friends who are considering going here this summer. And we would happily go back when we could.", "offset": [2127, 2285], "date": "2017-02-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "ec7c5d8d-b356-444c-a2f5-17b1ff3e9c23", "sentence": "Great Summer Vacation. Throughout my familys stay we were greeted by very friendly employees who offered personalized service. From the bartenders and waiters Felix and Eric to the entertainment staff Fredy Uriel Ury Xavier Adrian and Israel our time there was great.

Almost every day there was cross fit exercising zumba water aerobics dances at the pool polside games volleyball with the entertainment staff games in the teen lounge with Fredy and other guests and shows every night. One of the best must dos was releasing some baby sea turtles into the ocean at night. We also met many amazing people from all over. Some were from other parts in the US from Cleveland Austin and Chicago and some were from France and Mexico. The food was fantastic at every restaurant we ate at. The buffet changed everyday and provided a variety of food. The Italian restaurant was awesome the duck and salmon were especially good and the desserts were delicious.

Having holidayed in Cancun a couple times in the past being in need of some sunshine we decided to see what was available a slate booking and Chosen Fiesta America as it looked good value for money maybe a little big seemed to have a nice outlook from most of the rooms. We checked out a couple of reviews from well travelled Trippers on this site and away we went. I think the clue is in the name Fiesta Americana and probably should be left to the Americans as they made up most of the inhabitants. On arrival you rise up the escalator to a big soya area and it does look impressive. Good first impression checking in went smoothly and off we went to find our room with a sea view although we did not have a balcony just a rail you could see the sea from the side but had a great view of the pools etc. We were so tired that on the first night we ordered room service but this never turned up but they sent us some champagne and chocolate coated strawberries later in the week which went down well so forgiven. Our first full day and it was like going back to the eighties when the germans use to reserve all the Sunbeds there were only three beds left by 80am. Then I thought oh no here we go. it did not get any better on day 2 so we went for a Luna bed between the pool and the beach which cam with a couple of sunbeams. The sunbeams everywhere were hard plastic and really I think in future I would a place based on what type of sunbeams they have because they should not be in a 4 5 star resort. We paid 40 dollars plus for a bed per day so booked it for week and had Diego and Angel look after us which they did very well and change our impression a bit. The point is that we should not have book a special when there are clear signs up around the pool saying no one is allowed to reserve a subbed but the staff are so eager to make your stay enjoyable it is not enforced. I think holidaymakers should take some of the rap for that one. The pool bars serve us Tanqueray gin all day which was nice as normally you get non branded spirits the waiters and bar staff around all the bars were great at serving you quickly and made some fine tasting cocktails. We even had a Bali bed one which came with wine lobster gerviche and a free 30 min massage plus cool tools which we thought was worth it. You had a great view over the beach and sea which our daughter loved to go wave every day and my partner enjoined sunning herself. Around the pool area there are a number of little eating shacks that serve a variety of food I was pleased to see a healthy eating shack which served wraps and salads etc. There were also 2 restaurants immediately by the pool and 2 bars with another down on the beach so you will not be thirsty for long. The Booking system for the evening Restaurants was a bit of a farce and they really need to look at different options as the one they have does NOT work. I did complain because everyone knows if you do not feed children before 730 they fall asleep especially our 7yr old. Whilst the booking system is a shambles we found good variety of food from Breakfast to Dinner although it did feel like you were in dining hall at times. The food was more than above average and the staff for me turned this from being a poor place to being average to good. The room was spacious enough for us as a 3 and was well maintained during our stay although the mini fridge was a poor offering and might swell not be there. You were given 50 a day to spend in most places but unfortunately we could not use it for our Sunbed but would could use it for wine at dinner which was a positive. I think the wine list is changing and the average bottle is a poor offering for my palette. There was a well organised programme for you get involved in and I think the daytime entertainments went down really well the team worked hard to make it great fun in the pool. All in All if you want a flop and drop this is a good place as long as you do not mind too many Americans god bless them no wonder they ended with DTWe also dined in the ItalianaverageMexicanaverage Steak restaurantGod. The restaurant right next to the pool Good Breakfast Restaurant Buffet Fayre Good Overall Rating should be Good as better than average and we have stayed at 3 different resorts in Cancun. Staff Service Excellent Note We only found cash point on the morning of leaving otherwise the staff would have more tips. You could not get any from reception which I found strange.

We decided to stay here after cancelling 2 other new resort openings which was receiving not so stellar reviews. We had 9 nights and when we first arrived I was concerned about 9 nights. Layout arrive at lower area considered basement and escalators take you to the lobby where the sign in is to your left coming off the escalators with the main bar directly in front of you. To the left of main bar is a walkway where you \u2019l find the wedding office the gift shop which also has a small capucino and cream frappe machine with small bites the ice cream donut crepe area the kids club very small. and it dead ends to the spa gym area. To the right off the escalators and from the main bar is a walkway to where you \u2019l find the Italian restaurant steakhouse and then the Mexican restaurant. Straight ahead and down a slight ramp is the buffet dining area. The main bar also has a sushi area inside it as well as an area to where you can walk outside. Once outside there is an upper infinity pool area where you \u2019l also find an area where they make pizzas. Down the path is the larger pool with a swim up bar and another bar above it. The restaurant attached was closed and did not appear to be in the process of opening anytime soon. As you walk around towards the kids water slide area is the fish taco seafood eating area. Between the fish seafood area and the pool bar is a grill area for burgers dogs nachos fries and a bit more. Food The food areas by the grill are open during the day along with the buffet but the 3 restaurants Mexican Italian and steak are only open in the evenings. The steakhouse requires reservations to be made in person only the day before between 2 and 3 pm. Our last night the buffet had Asian theme for dinner and I was served raw chicken so while the fried rice was good I did n\u2019t touch the chicken. Pool. Unfortunately for a full day the main pool was so low water was n\u2019t even going through the filters and the water was getting gross and very cloudy. They did n\u2019t close it. I reported it to management manager was in a meeting and was told they were working to fix it. It was n\u2019t working properly until the next day. I was also told someone puked in it 2 days earlier and they did n\u2019t close it. We stayed out of the bottom pool for about 2 days due to how dirty it was. The upper pool on the day following the lower pool being low was also so low it was n\u2019t hitting filters nor was water flowing over the side for the \u201c infinity \u201d effect. Sickness. I developed a gastro issue on the 7th night which continued for about 8 hours. We met people who had members of their party also get sick one had been sick since We d through sat when they were leaving and the other person developed some type of ear problem both saw on site doctors is my understanding. I had taken antibiotics with me in case travelers diarrhea developed and had started taken it that evening. My husband came home with it. More on the food The buffet options were small so I was very thankful they had the grill and seafood area as my husband ate at the seafood area and I ate either pizza or fries. I did enjoy the Asian menu the buffet has at night if you do n\u2019t want the buffet so I was thankful for that as the buffet was hit or miss for me. Mostly miss. The restaurants are very small. The food was mediocre with fairly limited options. I will say the swim up pool bar was just a big ole party every single day with the entertainment staff cranking music all day from around 10 am until late afternoon. The beach was nice and while there was seaweed it was n\u2019t a large amount except the few days bad weather was in the area. It did keep me out of the ocean though. I\u2019m just not a fan of having it wrapping around me so I just stayed out. At the bottom of the stairs leaving the property to get on to the beach are guys who stand there ALL day to sell cigars and other things. They is literally someone there ALL THE TIME who will yell up at you when you walk by the top of the stairs. They did n\u2019t bother us too bad just always thereRoms. It was n\u2019t anything special as it was about the size of a regular hotel room. So merely FYI be prepared. We did NOT have a balcony but loved our view of the \u201c lagoon \u201d as we were on the 8th floor. Caution as our room was HOT. We had the air checked a few times and finally got a fan. We heard others complaining about the temp in their rooms as well. It made sleeping difficult. I will say the room did appear clean and the beds were very comfortable. We had an issue daily with wash clothes though. We were a family of 3 yet would be left only 2 wash clothes daily and had no conditioner when we arrived. I bet we called almost daily to ask for wash clothes and conditioner shampoo or soap. One day we did n\u2019t have any wash clothes. I never understood that. Mini fridge. Be advised if you ask for additional items in your fridge you would be charged for it. So if you call and request additional soda or beer you \u2019ve then exceeded your \u201c daily allotment \u201d and will be charged. We hardly used our items and honestly I got a bit paranoid about taking anything out of it. Alcohol If you want a name brand ask for it. Otherwise you \u2019l get the cheaper. They do NOT have Bailey \u2019s or Kahlua brands but generic versions. TIP. Bring your own cup glass for drinks. They do have straws but at one point my husband got a beer and he could n\u2019t drink it was the cup stunk too bad. I regret not remembering to bring my own. The best thing this place has going for it is the staff. Probably the friendliest group of people I \u2019ve ever encountered at any resort. They make this placeThings they can do better 1 pool cleanliness. The pool would be great if only they spent more time cleaning it. There are a ton of people in it and not enough done to keep it maintained. There was a lot of \u201c stuff \u201d floating on top of the water and in the pool. Honestly it was gross and you either had to not think too much about it or just not go in it. Those were the only 2 options. 2 Grounds. Again this goes with pool. It \u2019s unfortunate that people go on vacation and tend to be rude neglecting to pick up after themselves. I guess they think they can trash the place. While the staff has a huge job picking up after the slobs there \u2019s still more that needs to be done with trash broken glass etc. which we saw. I will say the bathroom by the pool bar while only 3 stalls always seemed to be clean. Also it \u2019s time the umbrellas were replaced or repaired as each one we used had something broken on it. We rigged it but. just saying. Teen club located in the front of the resort considered the back of the resort if from the pool area and in an area that we did n\u2019t care for. While they claim to open at 3 we went at 3 on our second day and waited around the place was deserted. It would have been a prime target for bad things to happen if someone wanted it to as it was creepy. We did n\u2019t like the location AT ALL as it seemed far from all other things. We did not allow our child to come or go on his own nor did let let him stay long when he did go. The staff who was there did not interact with the kids at all FYI. Summary. While we made it through the 9 nights and enjoyed it I would say this is a resort for less nights. It definitely had a party vibe to it which we could do without but it \u2019s not like would deter us either. It \u2019s close to the airport so transport is pretty quick. Also the only places to get any air conditioning is the restaurants and gift shop. We are returning to Cancun in Nov but have chosen a different resort and we are NOT thinking of booking this one for our return. So while I ca n\u2019t completely knock it I ca n\u2019t rave about it either. Again the staff makes this place and why it even got an \u201c average \u201d. I will say the food was a bit better than Hyat Ziva rooms were cleaner as well but it ca n\u2019t touch the food at Hotel Xcaret with a ten foot pole as it had the best food of any AI I \u2019ve ever stayed at thus far.", "offset": [3403, 3568], "date": "2019-07-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "entertainment"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "55aee56c-1ca4-481e-a3a7-6061de5f11a1", "sentence": "Best vacation yet.
