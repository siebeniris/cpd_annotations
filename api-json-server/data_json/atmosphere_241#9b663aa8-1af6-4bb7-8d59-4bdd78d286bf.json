We love the sound of the ocean off the beach and do not care if we can sit near it. so for us it was ok that their beach in front of the hotel was crowded and narrow. There is a sandy area around the pool that sits up on the cliffs so we can feel the breeze and walk on sand and hear the ocean w the option for a salt free splash at the pool perfect. However the layout of the pool is ridiculous. If you are in the sandy non beach front you really can not get to the pool unles you go back to the beach bar. And while the pool is fairly large w multiple levels an infinity ending you can not walk around the pool there are 2 access points in my opinion plus one off the small path from the fitness area. Plus the end of the infinity pool is leaking ALOT which made it easy to use this overflow for washing off your feet. Based on the menu and prices we knew better than to dine here plus the reviews helped sway our decisions but we did grab a few cocktails at the main beach bar mixed experiences here. First time we had very quick attentive service next time I had to ask for the menu and after handing it to me she walked away from the bar. literally. no one there to take my order for 5 minutes. we walked to the second bar by the lobby no one there either. This is at around 130 in the am Needless to say we started bringing our own cocktails to the pool. The manager reception for Honors members was nice and they mgt genuinely cares and takes pride in their property. Karen at the executive floor greeted us by name after one visit always with a smile and compliment and so much happiness she was just awesome. We did receive an upgrade at check. in once I inquired about access to the Honors floor which was a very nice pleasant surprise. Other than the beach bar snafu I did not experience any poor service by reception or hospitality. The grounds are really spread out which would be fine if they had a nicely groomed accessible path but to go between the beaches you view the VERY neglected mini golf and what appeared to be dormitory housing. Paths are not maintained and had weeds as well. Resort was not at all crowded few children so it was nice for relaxing around the pool. Easy drive to the airport we rented a car to avoid the shuttle hassle and taxi cost. See my review of Prins for more on that. Excellent choice We walked to Pirate Bay and Tomatoes for dinner a few times. Great pizza at Tomatoes. The casino at the Hilton is super small and run down also but seemed to stay very busy w the local folks. Tip you will need to goto the fitness room to get your beach towel. Cocktails in the executive lounge are very reasonable. Snacks are limited and some people seem to treat this as their dinner so go early. If you face the ocean the bar below and any bands will be heard in your room. which is nice when you are sitting on your deck but not nice when the bass is thumping at 1 am.", "offset": [1825, 1922], "date": "2015-01-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "23b5d89a-c2bf-423f-b8dd-46718387b7c3", "sentence": "Possibly Worst Hilton ever.

The Good. The staff was so friendly and helpful they are what I will remember most about this hotel. There is beautiful landscaping a nice beach area and large pool. When we were checking in we saw several staff members opening boxes full of new patio furnishings. The hotel ground level is open air and the breeze flows through nicely keeping things cooler. The Italian restaurant was very good. The view from our 3rd floor ocean side room was really nice. The bad Aside from the new patio furnishings we saw being put out this looks like an old hotel. The blue paint on the exterior brings memories of OLD Las Vegas back in the 60s. I could not believe it was a Hilton. After checking in we went right up to the rooms. While the room appeared clean and the bathroom fixtures were modern the smell of mold when first walking into the room was immediate and strong. Sometimes that is normal in a humid climate until you can open it up and get air circulating but this did not go away unfortunately. I even smelled it again when unpacking my clothes from the luggage. We only stayed here one night on our way back to the states. If we were staying longer I would have had to check into another place mainly because the room was not fresh. I do not care about exterior paint so much as a room I am comfortable sleeping in. I do like the Hilton hotels usually and in fairness it appeared they were working on it but there is a lot that needs to be done of they want people to be comfortable paying over 200 night to stay there for a basic kind bed room w ocean view. I wish this hotel good luck with their upgrades. Considering the top shelf staff they have there is potential for this place to be a big competitor later on.

We were there April 2015. I was so hyped about hearing excellent reviews about curacao period. Let me say from the airport to the Hilton was disappointing in itself. Not lush and green as was expected. As soon as I stepped into the Hilton I felt like I was taken back to the 50s. The hotel needs to be severely updated painted plumbing and need I say MOLD. When you get there ask for the fourth floor or higher. Ask for the ocean view cause then you will get a parking lot view above the casino very noisy. We had ocean view which was a little sliver of the ocean hardly ocean view. The wading pool for children looked nasty and the big pool which is closer to the Mariot needs big time help. The Hilton is far away from anything so if your planning a trip there rent a car. Curacao does have hidden gems but do your research first. If you want to be on the water the Hilton is not the place for you. Hilton shares the Mariot right next door but I would hardly call it a nice view. Staff were pleasant but not efficient. Food is highly expensive go out into town and eat across the famous floating bridge. Curacao all in all is not worth your money. We explored every section and inch of the island. When we got back we complained to the Hilton and got some free vouchers but I can safely say I will never stay at another Hilton anywhere again.

Travelers Beware At check in our reservations were completely wrong. We reserved and prepaid for 2 rooms with guaranteed ocean view. We were told we were scheduled for one room only no ocean view. Note I had in hand the printed reservation with verification. After a long check in process and arguing because the old adage the customer is right does not exist at the Hilton even with verification. We received one ocean view room and one standard room that was to be vacated 2 days early. We asked for a refund of the extra cost that was required for the ocean view room and were again told no. I would have never paid for this breakfast the cheese and meats were warm jam was aged cut fruit under supplied and an average grill for omelets. Moreover there was not enough glasses for juice or water for all the tables so you would have to wait until a table was completed to get a drink. To clear the tables the staff would dusk the scraps over the edge of the deck where you were eating. This caused you to be flocked by birds and stray cats disease and gross. Our rooms were old worn molded and dated in decor. We did not even receive a desk chair. The beds were hard with ill fitting sheets. The shower was sealed with molded chalking. There was minimal to no lighting. Was carpet appeared to be right out of the 70s as the entire hotel appeared to not have had any updates at all since the 70s. We could not get towels regularly due to laundry not being done. You were not given enough towels for the number of people in your room. You were not even given one wash daily due to low count. One of our travelers requested laundry service and was charged for laundry service upon receiving his laundry back dirty. The workout facility was on the fringe of unsafe. Treadmills would hesitate while you were running causing one to trip. The yoga room was dirty. The spa was never open per the hours. The childrens activities were pathetic at best. The putt putt course was constructed out of rusted metal welded together with no grass. Health hazard for young kids. There was only one ball for the entire resort. One hole did not even have a hole. The kidie pool was brown from not being cleaned. The standard pool had a dead bird in it for 2 days and was cloudy from not being cleaned. It was not sanity to enter any of the pools. The children activity corner or daycare center could only be described as a death trap layer in filth. The beach was completely misrepresented as well. It was small and dirty. It was not raked the entire 8 days we were there. There was one person to offer pol beach service to all guest on selected days. It was not recommended to use the service as an average drink wait was 45 minutes. Pathetic. However it was a 15 30 minute wait for a drink at either of the two bars for any type of drink. The bartenders would actually get your drink carry it with them as they cleaned the other side of the bar and deliver it to you when they were done warm by then. Please keep in mind we had small children with us so 15 30 minutes for a water juice or pop led to unpleasant kids and impatience. The minimal food wait experienced was 45 minutes for one order of fries and chicken nuggets. The staff was unpleasant rude and disrespectful in general. Even with the horrendous service and facilities friendly staff could have made a huge difference. No one asked how things were or how our day was or could they get you something else. Rather we listen to how unhappy they were with the Hilton. We had to track them down for each drink. They would not open up another table at the casino when one was full for you to play. I have traveled the world and stayed in some amazing locations. This was not the first third world country we have vacationed to yet it is the first place that we have attempted to leave early or find other accommodations. It is also the first place that we were required to leave the resort daily to receive a decent meal cold drinks and friendly people. The entire resort was under staffed lazy unfriendly and flat despicable. This resort should be an embarrassment to the Hilton chain. I would not recommend anyone to stay in a Hilton based on what we experienced. The only thing this hotel had going for it was our cleaning lady Joy. she did her best with the little Hilton provided her.

It says two private beaches and two pools but there is really only one of each. Again though it worked for our group just fine. The staff was very friendly and willing to help whenever needed. Most of them spoke English very well. We ate at the bar several nights and the staff there was good. Prices are a little high but to be expected with a resort. The same bartender Remy was there every night and he was so friendly and could tell that both him and the entire staff worked very hard. The location was good. The taxis around the island are pretty expensive so you are most likely better off renting a car and the hotel provides free parking. A taxi ride downtown was around 40 one way and if you are going somewhere everyday that surely adds up as it did for us. Lastly the maids were great.

So we called Expedia explained our situation and they made a very disappointing experience into a wonderful one by booking us into the Hilton Cura\u00e7ao.

The trip did start out a little rocky when we arrived. We arrived at 4 pm and was told that our room was not ready yet. They asked us to wait in the Reef Club lounge which did allow us to have free food and drinks while we wait. Even though we did not want to spend the first few hours waiting for our room it helped that Mariot took care of us in terms of food and drinks. Got our room around 6 pm which was probably the worst part of our trip. Considering that was the worst part we had a great trip because of the employees. The hotel is still in training mood but I have no doubt that this hotel will be the best on the island once they get fully staffed and trained. It was visible that the management staff was working hard to get all of their team members where they need to be. Every issue I had was resolved by the hotel. I do have to give a huge shout out to Kurt the manager of the restaurant. He was very professional and genuinely wanted to get our honest feedback on our experience there. He was very transparent with some of the issues they were facing and made us realize they are all trying their best. His transparency made me feel like the hotel truly was striving to do their best but it will take a little time. Also the chocolate cobbler desert was the best desert we have had on the island. Even if you do not eat dinner there do get the dessert. Thanks for a great experience KurtThe pool and beach service got better each day. We did order two burgers cooked medium and one came back pretty rare. Luckily the burgers were big enough that we were able to split the one. When I informed the server that one of the burgers was not cooked well enough they ended up not charging us for either one. Thanks for taking care of that for us. Finally I have to say that the best part of our stay was hanging in the lobby bar with the best bar tenders on the island. Nick Jay Jay and FrantJesko were phenomenal. They made such great connections with the guests and they are amazing at what they do. Nick has great managerial skills. One guest came up to the BAR and it was obvious he should not have another drink. Nic was very professional and was able to ensure the guest did not get a drink but at the same time did not make the inebriated guest upset. Well done. FrankJesko was also an awesome mixoligist. We were drinking old fashioneds and he ended up making us some many unique versions of them. All of these guys made the evenings very enjoyable. Just a great crew to hang out with in the evenings. Overall the resort is still in training mode but the service on the last day was a great improvement from the first day. Shout out to the management team for that.

We stayed at this fabulous resort in March 2016 for the first time. It then closed shortly after for extensive renovations. We have been patiently waiting for it to reopen just returned after a 5day stay. Upon check in we were given bottled water which was nice but missed the beer greeting. Check in was slow but because of being an Elite member we were upgraded to oceanfront room 291. Lobby is beautifully done bar decor stunning views still of the ocean. Nash was very friendly as he accompanied us to our room with our luggage. Lobby area should have visible chilled dispensers with infused water cups for guest consumption. This was missed as it was offered before. The rooms are very modernly decorated the shower is wonderful. Overall maid service was great timely. Missed the Board Room beach bar but understand it is still going to be rebuilt. It is essential for beach sunset goers. Missed the swings. Food beverage service on the beach was very poor. One day we had our flag up the whole day no one came although there was a server all around us. Huge drawback. So we went to the Salty Iguana pool bar made friends with David Gerniel who took good care of us. Both guys were super friendly made the best drinks. The beach area is nice but cleanup needs to be made in the sand where the Board Room was torn down. Lots of remnants in the sand. Our favorite server from 2016 Cerita was back ready to serve with a gracious accommodating smile. She is such a hard worker makes sure you are happy. She went above beyond to get Oreo cookies to make my girls their favorite ice cream drink called the Cookie Monster that is no longer offered on the menu. Both pools are clean water is clear. The new infinity pool is in a good location a luxurious addition to the main pool. What makes this Mariot stand out is the spectacular views of the ocean from every point of the hotel. The closeness of the pools to the ocean ca n\u2019t be beat. Just steps away. And the beach area is perfect for snorkeling. Salty Iguana has great food. Room service needs improvement. We called three times one night but nobody answered. The little shop that offers gelato was already closed at 90 so there needs to be more options for later evening desserts or light food. Robes were missed on the room. Please offer robes again. And bottled water in the room. A few Mariot niceties that are being missed. A couple cabanas at the pool to rent would be a nice option as well preferable at the infinity pool since it \u2019s adult oriented. Sunsets are gorgeous can be seen right from the oceanfront rooms. I\u2019m hoping in a few more months the young staff will be trained to be more service oriented. An employee should always greet a guest when walking by or ask if they need anything. In most situations this was the case. But not all. Some did n\u2019t even make eye contact but this should not stop you from visiting this quaint charming property. We will be back as soon as we can.
