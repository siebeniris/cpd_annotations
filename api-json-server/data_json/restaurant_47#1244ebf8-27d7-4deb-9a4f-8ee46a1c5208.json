The viceroy is one of my personal favourite places to stay in LA. Right next to the beach near the hot shops and restaurants of Main Street close to the Santa Monica pier and the 3rd st promenade shopping it is ideal for anyone. Zjana sp. in the restaurant is a fantastic service and always remembers us and what our favourite coffee cold pressed juice selection and omletes are. She makes us feel very special. Last visit I finally got a chance to borrow a Linus bike and rode up and down the boardwalk along the ocean all the way into Venice beach. Such a highlightThe beds are very comfortable good sound protection from the street and the pool of you want it. On Thursday and Friday nights the lobby and pool area turn into a fun evening out with plenty of beautiful people a DJ and delish cocktails. Love this hotel and highly recommend to all.

This was deliberately by far the nicest place I stayed at the end of a month travelling in places that do not have good hotels. I wanted to treat myself to a few nights of luxury before heading home. On the whole it was very good. it is really stylish and looks beautiful particularly if you have an ocean view. Front of house bar and room service staff were all very friendly and helpful. Contrary to some other reviews my impression was that they could not do enough for you including giving me a room at 9 am when I arrived from an overnight flight. obviously that is subject to availability but I was very grateful for it. The bed were really comfortable in particular the pillows which I am fussy about. The minibar was well stocked drinks at the bar were tasty I did not eat and the concierge was helpful. I also really liked that the windows in the room opened. That is much nicer than a hermetically sealed environment in my view. Finally the location is great. Only a block away from the beach and 10 minutes walk from the pier. I also can not remember the last time I stayed somewhere with so many restaurants I wanted to try within walking distance. I am a big fan of Santa Monica. There were just a few nit picky points that stop me from giving it 5 stars. First although the sound proofing between rooms is great it is not so good at the doors. I could hear housekeeping in the morning from about half 8 I was sleeping in due to jet lag and could even hear if room service knocked at a nearby door. Obviously no hotel can control the odd guest talking loudly in the corridors but my impression was that this was worse than that. Also although my experience of the customer service was that they were more than helpful the odd point of detail falls through the cracks. For example I emailed with a query when I booked and never received a response the minibar is not refilled every day. Finally there are not any tea and coffee making facilities in the room. When I called down for tea it arrived in about 10 minutes which is really fast but I personally prefer just to be able to make a drink when I want one. On the whole though very nice. I will definitely consider it again when I am next in LA.", "offset": [340, 417], "date": "2017-08-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "ec73ac92-40b7-4b99-9bb7-a119833c10a1", "sentence": "comfortable boutique hotel at the beach.

There was no pressure to utilize the service of the hotel porter and we did not. There is a service fee which at first seemed unfair until we borrowed bicycles to ride along the beach paths.

They go above and beyond to make sure their human and furry visitors are taken care of. The rooms and facilities are stylish and well maintained. Thoughtful touches like pet bowls placemats and beds take your stay to the next level.

When I enquired about the morning yoga sessions that were advertised I was told they were not running this week.
