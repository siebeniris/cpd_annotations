I have to agree with the poster below the service at this Ritz left a lot to be desired. We checked into the Ritz this past Friday for our 16th wedding anniversary. We are Mariot Gold Members and we had booked the room using loyalty points. We have received far better customer service at the Westin just down the street and redeeming our points for the Westin instead of the Ritz would have been a much better value. To say that we received poor customer service is an understatement. Not a single thing went well from check in until check out. Here were the isues1. Poor Communication Our room was understandably not ready upon early check in at 2 pm. We happily stored our bags and were told we would get a text when the room was ready. Though check in was officially at 4 we were told it would likely be earlier but not guaranteed. By 345 we had not heard anything so we went back to see if the room was ready only to be told that it had been ready for a while. We did not complain about not being notified as promised. There was no acknowledgement or apology that we had not been contacted. 2 Inability to use mobile key and no explanation At check in I asked if we had been assigned a mobile key. The person who checked us in told us no you had to request this in advance. to which I replied I did through the ap earlier today. We did not receive a response as to why we could not be assigned a mobile key. No acknowledgment as to why no explanation no apology. 3. No explanation of Gold Member benefits. No recognition at all. When I asked what the benefits at this hotel were I was simply handed a card that described the benefits. Also I realized after checking out that we were not provided with the 500 point welcome gift we were entitled to. Again no acknowledgment of member status no apology for not explaining the benefits. 4. Poor information. Next we asked if there was a house car as many Ritz Carlton \u2019s have. She said yes and I asked how far does it travel we have a 515pm reservation at Alinea. She said \u201c oh that should be fine since we routinely recommend that restaurant \u201d. I said \u201c great I assume it \u2019s first come first served \u201d. She replied \u201c yes but call down 15 minutes before and I \u2019m sure the concierge will accommodate you \u201d. See more below. 5. Poor Follow Through. When our room was ready we were given our keys and were told that our bags were already in the room. By now it was 4 pm so we went upstairs to our room to get ready for our 515pm dinner reservation but our bags were not actually present. We called down and were told that they would be sent up. No acknowledgment of the mistaken information. 20 minutes later still no bags. We were getting anxious because we had no bags and no ability to get ready for our dinner reservation. So I called back again. The woman who answered was very rude did not attempt to pronounce my name correctly and simply said the bag was \u201c in queue \u201d. I mentioned that we were going to be late for dinner if we did not have the bags soon and asked if I could simply come down to get the bag. I was told she could not reach the bellman. Then she interrupted me while I was speaking and said \u201c hold on hold on hold on the bell man told me it would be up shortly \u201d. I thanked her and it arrived shortly thereafter but not once did we receive an apology for the miscomunications or delays6. Further poor service When we were finally ready we called down to the Concierge to see about getting the house car as it was suggested that we do. But no answer. So we went downstairs around 450pm and asked the concierge if the house car was available. She then stated that the car was not available until 530pm. When we mentioned what we were told at check in instead of simply apologizing for the misinformation we were provided the Concierge simply said \u201c the car is first come first served calling down would not have mattered \u201d. So we easily took an Uber instead7 Unfulfilled requests. The next day we used the ap to request some services we requested them in the morning before we left for the day. By 6 pm upon our return the services had not been fulfilled. We called the front desk to have the services fulfilled. We did not receive any kind of acknowledgement that the requests had gone unnoticed. 8 The safe was not working so we called down to the front desk. The safe was fixed while we were out but we were left an odd note that said essentially the safe has been fixed next time do not call us call X8. Poor last impression. On the day we checked out I went to the front desk to drop off the keys. We were never even asked how our stay was 9. No follow up. I find it best to communicate during our stay. So we emailed the general manager and guest relations on day one and still to this day have not heard anything back. 10. Prior indicator Prior to our arrival my husband had been communicating with the Concierge in advance of our stay to have a special surprise waiting for me in the room for our anniversary. There was some initial communication saying that XYZ could be accomplished and my husband sent an email back saying exactly what he wanted. Luckily the surprise was waiting but he had never actually received a response back indicating that the plan was confirmed and would be executed. While none of the instances I describe above seem like a huge deal in and of itself lumping all of these things together within the first two hours of our arrival and into the stay for the weekend provided for a poor first impression and is not indicative of the level of service we would hope to receive at the Ritz. In retrospect I would have saved our loyalty points and redeemed them at a different hotel. Next time we will stay at the Westin down the street.", "offset": [2185, 2286], "date": "2018-10-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "38f506f7-548d-4c96-955d-0ca5124791fe", "sentence": "My first greeting to the hotel was one that I would expect from a Ritz property with the doorman letting the front desk know that I was coming up to check in after asking for my name.

Unfortunately booking through Expedia leaves you for no room for anything other than the most basic of basic rooms at this property which is still a nice room but expect the worst of views and no upgrade options. Everything outside of the niceness of the room left me felt underwhelmed and not special as I would expect from a Ritz property.

So with that said there were numerous items that never happened or I had to call down several times throughout my visit.

They looked irritated when I asked questions. Secondly I asked for robes extra pillows to be delivered prior to arrival never happened why do you have this service if you do not follow through. Thirdly I asked for the Candy Cart to be at 4 pm CST Saturday I arranged my schedule around this with the kids they never showed. I called at 430pm CST and they said they forgot again why do you have this service and get kids excited then to be let down. Fourthly we tried to rent a movie Saturday night the system was locked at the front desk but the Ritz team could not figure this out sent an engineering to our room we waited 45 minutes and they said it was the front desks issue and they would fix another 30 minutes. Also I asked for turndown service Saturday and again it was not done. Lastly when I got my folio I saw the movie was charged that we never rented erroneous liquor was on the folio why would I have that we had club level. Overall this Ritz is not a 5star hotel the staff needs training knowledge of the property and how to at least meet the customers expectation I am not asking for exceeding which one would expect at the Ritz and level of pricing of the accommodations.

The air vent right above the bed can not be turned off. The small touches so definitive of the Ritz seemed missing. The valet area and entrance was a bit cluttered and disorganized. We were on the 29th floor and the view of the lake was splendid. However when you look at the room decor and furniture they were cold and too impersonal.

So usually when I stay at a Ritz Carlton I expect a more refined experience which is what their brand is all about. To be clear I have stayed here many times in the last 6 months. I am traveling to Chicago for work for a contract I am on. There is a lot of reason I did not give them a 4star review one of them being how they handle situations and cleaning the rooms. OH BOY. Lobby. The lobby is nice and large and very clean. The staff when checking can be friendly but other times they can be very unhelpful and not welcoming it really is a crap shoot. The restaurant is located in the lobby along with a bar and a little coffee counter. Food The food at the restaurant is pretty good but the waiter we had was extremely snobby. When we were asking him about the menu he acted as if he was better than us and how dare we take up his time. I was not happy which ruined my entire experience and why I only at there once. The truffle Mash potatoes were underwhelming. Room the rooms are nice but pretty generic in all honesty. They have good views of the lake if you get on the right side of the building and they are spacious and clean. The beds are very comfortable but as stated the rooms are pretty basic in my opinion compared to other Ritz. Room Service Is again ok not great. I ordered this a lot and again it was 5050. The staff was most the time very rude and again acted as though I was bothering them. Cleaning. This is where I really had an issue. I would come back and sheets would not be changed hair was still in the sink the floor was never vacuumed one time I even came in and the iron board with trash and empty glasses with trash were still everywhere but the bed was made. This was my biggest complaint and the management just could not ever get this taken care of. Staff. Overall the staff and management were not great. After I had told them I would be there every other week for 6 months they gave me an ok rate but then each time I actually tried to book a room I received different information and most the time in a very rude manner. In closing the experience on multiple occasions were not that great especially as a Platinum Elite. I really hope they get their act together at some point.

When you book at a Ritz Carlton property there s a certain level of quality and service that goes along with the reservation. Especially when you re booking a room for just shy of a thousand dollars a night in a city like Chicago it does nt seem unreasonable to expect a little bit of wow to be associated with the experience. I can say that there definitely was a wow associated with my experience but it was nt of the positive variety. The bland nature of the overall experience started with the valet parking which at least when I arrived was somewhat disorganized with one attendant trying to run to make everything work and not a lot of supporting staff to assist with bags or anything else. Following a trip up the elevator to checkin the process was fine though it took a long time on account of not being able to find keys to program for the room. The only negative mark during checkin was the 4 or 5 staff members standing in a group by the second checkin desk laughing and making fun of one another. It was nt disturbing in the sense of the jokes being crass or off color but again Ritz Carlton professionalism was lacking or at least not up to the level of prestige i d expect for such a brand. The real disappointment and the part of the stay that was supposed to be the pinacle of the experience was the room. I had chosen a suite which was on the 30th floor with great views of Lake Michigan and downtown Chicago. The room was large and did have those epicaly wonderful views that were desired but the furniture was barely enough to fill portions of the room and the room finishes were lacking any level of opulence and were generally out dated. It s like the took the same furniture that was in a much smaller room and threw it into a multi room suite without any consideration for the floor space being more than double that of a standard room. The bathroom was nothing special and had a shower head that seemed like it came out of a Hampton Inn in the 1980 s with water pressure akin to a firehose and no ability to make the spray more enjoyable to use. The only real positive in the furnishings side was the bed what an incredibly comfortable bed. All in all the visit was just disappointing. Nothing was particularly bad but nothing was really good either especially for the price that was paid. If I was staying at a Courtyard hotel in a city and had the experience I had I would be writing a positive review. But I was nt staying at a lower level hotel I paid for the Ritz Carlton experience like I had had received at a few other properties and frankly I did not receive it.
