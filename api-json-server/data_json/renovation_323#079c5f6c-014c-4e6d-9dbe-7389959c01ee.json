During the time they were renovating the restaurant so the rooms were 99 per night. What a steal. I did have some housekeeping issues with the room I was in. There was a small chicken bone on the floor and a small hairbrush on the side of the bed on the floor. Oh yeah the small roach on the wall as well crawled out of the vent. So once the cleaning lady actually vacuums the floor and the rooms get exterminated they would be pretty much perfect. The rooms are a comfortable size and the bathroom was very nice. I did not spend much time in the hotel other than sleeping nor did I get to check out the facilities. But other than the cleaning issues I enjoyed my stay here. it is a chic looking hotel in the middle of Midtown not far from Downtown Buckhead Lenox Mall Walmart. Very convenient location suitable for travelers wanting to catch a game or hit the town. There is no parking other than Valet which is 25per night and the Internet and Free Local Domestic Calls is 15per night so add that to your budget. Location. Room Cleanliness. Cost for Valet Internet. WIFI should be offered. Excellent location nearby Georgia Dome and Lenox Mall.", "offset": [96, 179], "date": "2015-01-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "e4d694c0-7d7c-4487-9b10-fda4c4720107", "sentence": "Needs help. We were here to attend the Gift Show which is downtown so this is not within walking distance. There was a bus service to the mart and the hotel has a driver that will take you within 2 miles of the hotel. First come first serve. The restaurant is being renovated and they do offer free coffee in the morning. Our room was just ok. The bathroom door did not close all the way or lock. There is a glass window in the bathroom so every time you turned on the light it lit up the room. The most disappointing aspect of this hotel was the housekeeping. There was one day they did not even make up our room. They never gave us new drinking glasses and did not replace our towels everyday. It took 2 days to get an extra trash can in the room. There are not enough hooks to hang towels cosmetic bags etc. They also need more plugs to charge electronics in convenient places. The lighting in the room is terrible and the makeup mirror in the bathroom needs lights. I am a loyal Mariot member but I would not stay here again unles I absolutely had to.

We got to the hotel Friday evening for check in the main entrance was a little backed up with cars but we pulled in pretty fast. We were greeted and advised of the overpriced 30 valet fee per night so we decided to use the parking facility two blocks over. The valet team and bellman were very friendly. We checked in pretty straight forward and was not assigned a room with a city view like we hoped but we were able to upgrade for 10 so not bad at all and the view was worth it. Maryum checked us in and was very friendly she asked if we were celebrating anything and we casually mentioned our first anniversary not thinking anything of it. We got our keys and were on our way to the 18th floor woho. The bellman walked with us and brought up our luggage very shortly after we got to the room. I forgot his name and it sucks because I wanted to mention him he was so friendly and asked if we had any questions and he was funny too. He also always said hello when we were coming and going super pleasant. For the room the view definitely was the cherry. We had a perfect view with the biltmore to the left and the stadium to he right and the skyline right In front. Room 1803 was clean well appointed great toiletries and nice and spacious. The bathroom has really dim lighting that I wish was brighter for make up reasons but no major complaints. The TV offered 40 channels which is rare and there was cute sitting area with a mini couch. The restaurant was still under renovations but in room dining was available. On Saturday we were surprised by a knock on the door thinking it was housekeeping we were prepared to ask for 30 mins to get out the door but it was actually a lovely gentlemen waiting with an ice bucket full of not one but two bottles of champagne and two glasses. Maryum had sent them and wishes for a happy anniversary we were so surprised and flattered. Thank you so much this was such an expected treat that really made our day. Cynthia who did housekeeping for our room also left a sweet happy anniversary note and did a great job with servicing the room. We loved the music in the elevator it changed according to time of day and we loved the safety feature of putting your card in to push for your floor. Our floor was pretty quiet even though a lot of battle of the bands attendees stayed here the only time we heard noise was in the lobby and there was good soundproofing between the bedroom but not in the bathroom vents I heard the entire conversation lol. The hotel is located in a great area close to publix restaurants etc. All in all we had a great weekend getaway we enjoyed our celebration stay cation and will definitely return.", "offset": [1510, 1586], "date": "2015-01-27", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "8b11a353-949e-4399-b5cd-ba580dedb4c8", "sentence": "Refreshing.

I have stayed at this hotel about 10 times over the past 20 years usually for a Georgia Tech game. When I checked in I was automatically upgraded to a Deluxe King room as a Platinum member.

Tamara at the front desk searched available rooms and was able to transfer us to a corner suite that was just perfect. The remodeled rooms are well done although some of the artwork is a bit weirdOn both mornings our group of eight had breakfast in the hotels Community Smith restaurant.

I had the buffet which was of very good quality. I was not happy with the service that followed either therefore I did not leave a tip but instead of her asking me if all OK or how was my breakfast she made faces not professional at all. I did not ask for her name my receipt is not well printed maybe \u201c Mahale \u201d but anyway there were only two ladies who worked at 645am on 16 Nov It is a shame because I had higher expectations by Renaissance.
