My star rating is relative to the cost to stay here at the time of booking which was 200 nt. If it had cost less I would give it a 3 star rating. I stayed here for five nights last month. Pros. It was conveniently located right across the street from my destination within walking distance of restaurants etc. The bed was clean comfy. The bathroom was clean. The service was good. Free shuttle. Free bottle of water. Free business center printer. Cons. The carpeting EVERYWHERE. The pool view rooms. Charging for wifi. With the exception of the lobby area all of the carpeting here was utterly disgusting. It was quite visibly stained to hl in both the corridors and the rooms. I found this surprising and off putting. Even if you have your carpets professionally deep cleaned every day if there are visible stains the carpet still gives off the impression of being dirty and uncared for. That being said I have two words for Sheraton Clayton hard floors. If you can not be bothered to remove the stains from your carpeting try replacing the carpeting with hard flooring and calling it a day. That I have stayed in cheapy motels that had nicer carpeting than this Sheraton hotel is simply a disgrace. Add to that my lovely pool view room. My first night having gotten in late I was unaware of the full magic of my room. We checked in dropped off our things and then went out to eat which is apparently a startling concept in Clayton that people would actually want to go out to eat after 9 pm on a Sunday per the hotels staff reaction when we asked if anything nearby was open. Getting back I drew my curtains and took in my view of the indoor pool. It being a view that did not actually go outside was bad yes but if it had at least been a view of a PRETTY indoor pool maybe it would not have been so bad. This however was not the case. I want you to picture your schools pool and combine it with the YMCAs pool and you will get some idea of the loveliness of this view. Needless to say it was downright utilitarian and depressing. There was ZERO effort made to make the pool area look nice. It was almost as though the pool was an ill conceived half hearted afterthought that no one really wanted to be bothered with. Hl I have been in stairwells that had more visual appeal than this pool. It was like being stuck in a basement or a box. On the plus side I was able to get moved from this room on the 5th floor to the 8th and thus could actually open my window and look outside at buildings. Still whether I have a spectacular landscape view or not I like to at least be able to get some natural light every day. This new room served that purpose. I had guesstimate that the pool view rooms are on the 5th 4th floors perhaps even the 3rd. If for some reason you stay here AVOID those rooms. Lastly they charge for wifi. Who still does that anymore. The Sheraton Clayton. that is who. However they do have a business center with free internet connected computers and a printer downstairs. Still if you are doing a private transaction you probably do not want to be using a public computer for such a purpose. As for the so called free breakfast buffet there was none. When I asked the front desk staff they directed me to the restaurant where there was a buffet but it was not free. No idea where these other people who claimed they got free breakfast got it from.

We have only dished out three 1 star ratings for hotels. The Clayton Sheraton has receive 2 of the 3 poor ratings. The last time we stayed here was about 3 years ago. Once again we were in town for a swim meet and this was our official team hotel. Our past experiences were not very good and this stay was about the same. we will have to ask the team to make arrangements at the other hotel close by where we had much better experiences. Even though we booked a room with double beds the gal at check in mentioned she did not think she had any and would have to look hard to see if they had one. Judging by the parking garage we do not think this place was 100 full. but we rolled with it. Thank goodness the clerk found us a double seemingly in the block of rooms reserved by the swim club. She also forgot to code our room keys to work in the parking garage. Customer service fail as usual. Now that we can move on from the lobby you will typically have long waits for the elevators. There are only two. The rooms in this hotel are small. Be prepared for tight fits in the room and bathroom. It appears that the rooms have had mild updates since we stayed her last. Clean but cramped. The beds are full sized not doubles so be prepared for tight sleeping arrangements too if brining the family. There are no refrigerators or microwaves. Bring a big cooler if you need it. Somewhere between Friday night and Saturday morning the AC stopped working well. Housekeeping was disappointing as well. We took off at 10 am for a swim meet. When we returned after 445 that afternoon nothing had been done in the room. We left for dinner and an excursion thinking housekeeping might have just been running late. We got back to the room at 930 that evening and the room had not been touched. It sounds like other families on our team had similar struggles. Internet wifi comes at a cost of 99 per day for a few devices. I can not even remember the last time we paid for wifi at a hotel or resort. Somehow I thought being a Starwod member got us wifi but apparently not here.

Otherwise due to the volume of guests the pool area reminded me of a dog grooming salon without the dogs. Families bring in picnic supplies and park there all day.

I have stayed at a lot of hotels and this by far was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Sorry for the length of this but I want to share my experience. My family of 5 myself my 2 grown sons my grown daughter and my young daughter reserved 2 rooms a couple of weeks ago online. I reserved adjoining rooms so we could be close. with 2 queen beds in each room with 1 roll away bed. I even called the hotel a few days prior to verify everything. I was told everything was in order. When we checked in I was told there are no adjoining rooms with queen beds and the rooms with queen beds can not have roll away beds. So they put us in 2 rooms down the hall away from each other. When we saw how far away the rooms were. i said no way. So I went back to the front desk and told them I needed an adjoining room. So I would take the one that was one king and 2 queens with a roll away bed in the king room. So we went to the second set of rooms with all our stuff. they gave us 2 king rooms. I called them again saying my sons are not going to share a bed. And I am not spending 450 on this hotel stay so one of my kids can sleep on the floor. They told me to find another hotel that would accommodate my families needs. By this point everyone is upset and exhausted from the long trip. I am trying to Google other hotels. They called me again saying they found an adjoining room with 2 sets of queen beds. So they do have them. But no roll away beds allowed in those rooms. So we made due and lugged our stuff to the 3rd set of rooms. The first night we went to the pool and there were no towels so we used our room towels. The next night we went to the pool. still no towels. I called the front desk requesting towels for the pool. I was told the hotel was out of towels and that guests have to use their room towels. I told them I already used our room towels the night before at the pool. They said it was not their problem. So my family did not have towels to shower with. When we checked out I spoke privately with the manager because I was not trying to create a scene. They did give us free breakfast and refunded me one night stay. I was very disappointed in this hotel. It was huge and really nice. But the rooms are super small and there is no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms.
