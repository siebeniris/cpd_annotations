This hotel is very nice and the location for the price was great. However I had a few complaints that would probably prevent me from staying there again. First you have no choice but to valet the car which adds 30 to the cost of the stay and I had to wait for my car. I would much rather have parked myself. When you add 30 to the price there are better options elsewhere. Second the internet did not work and I had to be transferred to a call center in India to get it to work and then you only get a limited amount of time without having to pay for premium internet.

She explained that we took the sign down when we left for the day at 2PM. this was a 4 night stay. He told her that if the sign was out when they go through to clean that is it they can not keep on checking.

My sister in law booked the room for us for a nearby family wedding. I did not bother to check on it and assumed that she had done her due diligence. Upon arrival the hotel looked good and the room turned out to be clean and comfortable. But a it was hard to find drove by it once. small signage and the structure is offset from the main roadb. the sound of closing doors banging shut echoed up and down the hallway at late hours not conducive to a good nights sleep. andc compulsory valet parking at 33 per day tipsI feel that managements approach to offset good deals on rates by employing exorbitant parking fees is deceptive. There is no free parking option. You must use valet service and your car is parked in open space. There are two issues that I noted. The first is that there is a long row of parking spots marked 20 minutes only apparently designed to facilitate checking in. Many of those spots had autos parked there and did not move all day. Second there is a large paid lot adjacent to the hotel which gives the impression of being part of the nearby office complex. A large NO HOTEL PARKING sign fronts the entrance. But guess where the attendants park your car. Many are parked in that lot. And people park in the 20 minute row and walk over into the office building. So office people park in hotel free 20 minute space and hotel people pay 33 per day for valet parking and their cars are parked in what would appear to be office parking lot space. No enforcement was observed. The word deceptive continues to come to mind. The parking lot attendants were very cordial and responsive. You want to tip them as they deserve it. So now you are up to around 40 per day to cover parking. Add that number to your good deal and it is no longer such a good deal. Conclusion. I would neither stay there again nor recommend it to others because of managements apparent philosophy of raising funds to offset rate deals via their approach to parking autos.
