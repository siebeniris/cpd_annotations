And three times many years ago. This used to be a great classy hotel. it is not anymore. It took an hour to check in. First room I got was also given to someone else. So we BOTH had been checked onto the same room. Unreal. Room 2 they gave me was not fit for anyone. Room 3 was ok but it took over 25 minutes of waiting. But waiting for am hour at the desk was a great opportunity to stand by the check in desk hearing all the other stories of others having check in problems. Once in the hotel my keys had to be reprogramed daily without reason. There are only two elevators in the main building one was broken the entire time with again no explanation and no one working on it. Thus the delays getting to room or to lobby were significant. The food. Not great. The term mystery meat came to mind when eating the banquet lunches provided the group I was with. And when I checked out I reviewed the bill to find that there were two additional charges on my bil each for over 140. Thus my bill was more than 300 more than it should have been. I challenged the charges which were for rental of banquet rooms. Without apology the charges were removed. Yes Without apology. The first time someone on staff said thank you was as I left was stepped into the cab tipping the attendant helping me with luggage. Up till then no one ever said gee thanks for being here. The good news is that the hotel is on a small beach had a nice small pool and is well located. This hotel used to be great. I was looking forward to visiting it again. My friends in San Juan questioned why I was staying at this hotel and have me other places priced comparably to stay. After this visit I encourage the management of the hotel to get its service together please. it is a hotel that is resting on its great location and history.

I just checked in after a long day at work. After reading most of the reviews I have come to the conclusion the reviews are all true about the service in this hotel. The prices are of a 5 star hotel but the service is as close to a Motel 6. I just came in to my room just wanting to take a shower and there is a used bar soap with hairs in the shower. I added the picture. I thought no big deal I will just remove it. Then I looked down to the toilet seat and it has this bright yellow stains of still fresh pee from someone else definitely not mine. This place has become a disgusting place to stay. This is not the first time and I just had it. I did not even bother calling the lobby where they have robots there just asking for money for everything you ask. The resort fee is 24 and change per day there is a tax on the resort fee and there is a tax on the room fee. One would think after all these taxes and fees I have to pay just to stay here the Caribe Hilton should have enough personnel to clean the rooms properly and to perfection. There is no excuse clean the rooms we are paying you a lot of money so get it done. Your customers would really appreciate it. I know the Sheraton across the street has much nicer and definitely much cleaner rooms than here. This is not what I would expect from a Hilton hotel. This is a run down place if it was not for the view. This is just an old run down place with nothing to offer. do not complain later why people are going to the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. I am done with you Caribe Hilton. By the way I come down to PR every three weeks. I know you do not care. This needs to voiced out there more and more.

I do not like writing reviews and especially not bad ones but because the issue was so severe and life threatening I think it is important that future visitors are well prepared. I am just going to jump right into the issue. My mother was having an asthma attack when we were in the room. Her chest was tightening up and having shortness of breath. Ok she has asthma but she forgot her inhaler in the states so you can imagine the thoughts going through my head as she was trying to stay calm and concentrate on breathing. The minute I saw it coming on I called the emergency line on the hotels room phone. When I spoke to the gentleman he said we do not have any medical professionals here I will call the doctor to come and I said ok do you have any portable breathing equipment. and he said no. Ok we will wait for the doctor. I call back maybe 10 minutes later and ask how much long on the doctor he said he does not know and he will find out. He calls back and says he is about 15 to 20 minutes away and that it will be a 150 dollar charge. I said that is fine. Then we hung up again. I called back another 10 minutes later asking how much long because my mother is getting worse. He said let me call again. The man then said I am speaking to my supervisor and we are calling the ambulance. I said it does not matter I just need whoever can get here the quickest he said yes madam. Ok another 5 10 minutes pass and I call again and he says he does not know how much longer but they are on the way. I said ok. About 10 minutes pass this point we hear a knock on the door. I look out and it is two men I open and say are one of you the doctor and they say no we are supervisors and the ambulance is on the way. I said ok what is taking so long it is been almost an hour now and my mother can barely breathe. They then say we just want to let you know there will be a charge for the doctor or ambulance to come. At this point I am infuriated because my mother can not breathe no ambulance or doctor is in sight and these HILTON REPRESENTATIVES are bringing up money which I already agreed to on the phone. But what if I did not have the money would they just let my mother die on their property. I call my aunt who is a nurse and ask what should I do. She told me to get a wheelchair and just take a taxi. I call the supervisors out of the room and tell them how this is unacceptable and they are standing doing nothing and I need a wheel chair to get her to the emergency room. Then another manager gets off the elevator and I am explaining that we are waiting on the ambulance and he says there is no ambulance on the way there is none in the area to come ARE YOU KIDDING ME. At this point it is been at least an hour and a half and we end up driving her to the emergency room. I could not believe the lack of urgency and the lack of care this prestigious hotel showed. there is no way they were trained for this but what about humanity. it is like they did not care and had no solutions for MY MOTHER NOT BREATHING. And getting help. What if this was your 54 year old mother not breathing and the staff not only kept bringing up charge but did not even have a doctor or ambulance coming when they kept saying they did. I knew about this hotel because it is the hotel my company uses for our layovers but after this I have to share my story with them because it is not safe. Asthma kills. And I am just so thankful my mother survived it. The hotel is beautiful but the thought of going back scares me because if it was a heart attack or stroke or anything more severe nothing would have been done until it was too late.", "offset": [243, 306], "date": "2016-01-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "f327e6db-645a-43e3-ad79-a89b97593ee5", "sentence": "Good Hotel Gone Bad. The hotel had okay service at check in and at restaurants. The hotel lobby and grounds appeared to be well kept and clean. Prior to arrival we paid extra for an ocean front room with balcony. At arrival we found the carpet in the room to be wet and it appeared that it was not vacuumed. The rooms are not upgraded and have a musty smell stains on carpet and walls and extremely poor housekeeping. We did not use the balcony due to a horrible view of roof and screeching noises from a belt that was lose on an air handling unit. We inquired about the view and sound when the bellman arrived with our luggage but were dismissed. I have stayed at the hotel previously on business and enjoyed the stay however the hotel rooms are now run down and are not kept in satisfactory sanitary condition. While talking to 2 other hotel guests staying in 2 different rooms we learned that they had both experienced red bumps hives on their skin. One of the guests indicated that the hotel deep cleaned their room and sprayed for ants. The other guest had switched their return flight to avoid having to stay an additional night.

My family of 5 kids ages 101 and 19. stayed at the Caribe jan 28feb 3. We stayed on the 8th floor with partial view double queens 2 rooms. Both rooms were very nice. They had new carpet linens curtains and simple furnishings. Each of our rooms had a small friday no microwave in a built in cabinet with a small countertop area. This was enough for us to prepare sandwiches on and store our snacks. The bathroom were decent. Not as nice as other hilton resort bathrooms i ve seen but nice. One thing that did not meet our liking was the bathroom door. They are on a track and roll shut. In both of our rooms these doors had a tendency to roll open a few inches. Kind of inconvenient when your in the shower or on the toilet. If you fuss with it and get it set just right and wait to see if it is going to roll open you may be able to get it set just right. All in all you learn to deal with it. As Hilton Honors Diamond members we were issued coupons for breakfast down stairs. Though we had 2 rooms we recieve 1 coupon for the diamond member and 1 for a guest for each night of stay. We did not get 2 coupons for each room booked per night stayed. The coupons are good for 2 of their restaurants down stairs. One of them offered a variety of breads and fruits free with the coupons. The Palmeras offered a full breakfast with everything including meats eggs potatoes pancakes waffles omelettes cheeses fruits oatmeal and beverage for 12 per adult and 10 per child. They allow you to use 2 coupons at a time. We ate here twice and decided to use our coupons at quiznos for free breakfast sandwiches. You can also use them at starbucks for a muffin or pastry and coffee. The resort was very nice. We traveled with another family with 2 very small children. This resort was the perfect setting tot acomodate our variety of ages. There was a nice toddler pool with plenty of seating around it. on the other side of fhe toddler pool was another pool so we could set our chairs between the two and both families were comfortable. There are pools around the bar a main pool above the toddler pool and other main pool as well as 2 hot tubs behind the swim up bar. There is a starbucks stand between the beach and pools that seems tot be only open weekends however there is also a starbucks inside the hotel. They will check for your room key and look in any bag you have as you enter and leave the pool area. You can get towels at the towel stand they will put a wrist band on you and you will not have to show your room key again with the wrist band. each day is a different color. the beach area is very nice. the towel hut guys will dig and put up an umbrella for you free of charge just ask. The water is clear. and they have a wooden circular platform deck over the water with beds surrounding it also free. put your towels out on chairs before 9 and you will be ok. weekends maybe earlier. Do nt be suprised if new comers take your chair assuming hilton laid out towels on the chairs and those with a new towel are open for them. Its vacation more chairs will open. Their is a overlook deck to peer at the water. Atlantico bar grl has great food. I ordered a grilled cheese and it came with a large order of fries. I think was around 5. Also tried their grilled chicken sandwich with fries enough for 2. It was good and was around 15. They do nt take cash it gets charged to your room and billed at check out. Drinks anywhere at the resort were around 15 for a clear plastic cup outside. At the inside bar happy hour offered nightly from 5 7 or 730 somewhere in that time frame drinks were 650. Live music plays each night at 830. We found it too loud even a distance away in the lobby. Across the street we found a fantastic little indoor outdoor pizza place called paola pizza express. amazing pizza and prices. 2 large pizzas 2 orders of garlic knots were around 48. My only complaint for Hilton in general is they put a hold on our card which we knew. But we did nt expect a hold for each room. One hold was for 450 for 6 night and the other for our 2nd room was 300 for 4 nights for a total of 750. Being we did nt each at the Caribe much it was money tied up. If you have a company card to secure your room with give them your personal card at check out for incidentals. Hilton if you are going to treat each room the same guest books as seperate and put a hold on each then please take care of your diamond members and issue 2 breakfast coupons for each room likewise. All in all a great resort. We enjoyed our week with you and the kids loved the pools beach beach toys at the hut the peacocks ducks etc. We found staff very friendly.

I am only rating the Caribe Hilton as very good because of the location and the rooms. The location is great front the standpoint of the seclusion and the calmer protected beach than you will find anywhere else in the Condado area. The pool and swim up bar area is a nice perk. But because the hotel off by itself it is about a 5 minute Uber to either Old Town San Juan or Condado although if you are a walker it is only about 20 minutes to Condado over the bridge but not that easy to get to. There are quite a few dining options in the hotel however to keep you there if you wanted to including Mortons Steakhouse my favorite. ate there 3 times Caribar snacks sandwiches pizza outside bar same as caribar Lolas Puerto Rican Rustica Italian Mojitos Puerto Rican Fusion a little ice cream shop a full service Starbucks and probably something I am forgeting. Across the street is the Mercado which apparently has some food stalls and a Fogo de Chau. Try the Tripelta Sandwich at the bar you will not be disappointed. The rooms in the Beach wing where we stayed are definitely the most conveniently located right off the lobby nearest the pool and restaurants but were part of the original hotel in the 1950s are therefore are a little on the smaller side but definitely not tiny. They have been updated since Hurricane Maria and were perfectly fine just not worthy of an excellent rating. The balconies are tiny. The higher rooms have better views of course but you are either looking at the beach view which is of Condado mostly or whatever the other side is called overlooking the lagoon pool area. Either is probably fine. The staff are wonderful friendly and accommodating. The swim up bar staff were the best and provided great entertainment. If you are sat elsewhere outside it probably takes a while to get service however as they only seemed to have 1 floating bartender at a time away from the main areas. We did not have any problems with the room being serviced or having fresh towels etc. They only change the bedding every 2 or 3 days which is pretty common now and perfectly acceptable if you shower before bed like a civilized person would after a long day at the beach pool town. For your first time to PR this would be a good choice. If you like to hang in town probably stay in Old San Juan if you like a mix of beach pool exploring without a car then maybe Condado or this hotel has a good mix but definitely need to Uber most places. One complain I did have is Uber can drop you off at the lobby but apparently hotel management is in some sort of racket with the Taxi drivers so Uber can not pick you up in the lobby only on the street outside of the property which is only a 3 minute walk but still a minor inconvenience if it is raining.", "offset": [50, 136], "date": "2019-12-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}]}
