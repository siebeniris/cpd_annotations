There is great Rock and Pop memorabilia on the walls like any traditional Hard Rock but I do appreciate the memorabilia of the New Jersey famous singers. The wifi is excellent in our hotel room. Very fast and no need of any special codes to access it. Our room was nice Eating steak at Roberts is great a little pricey but great food.

My complaint is that overall service was really slow. When we asked for more towels we had to call a few times and waited for a long time. After 12 am our next door was making a lot of noise so we called the desk to complain. Nothing happened and they bacame noisier so we called the desk again. After about 20 minutes when the noise was settled a security came and started banging our door not the one who made the noise and he ended up waking my kids up.

But we were woken up again around 1h30 AM by front desk who seemed confused as to the room number we were in. And then later on followed by the people in the room in front of us yelling and cursing at 4 am. Needless to say no sleep before a long drive. The next morning we went to the front desk to inquire about the issue and asked for either a complimentary night since we were not about to drive for 89 hours without sleep. The hotel refused and refused to credit us for the sleepless night. They also could not figure out what happened and how we were booked in 2 rooms at the same time. We had to take an extra night elsewhere at our cost. For that reason service is zero in my opinion. The most basic service a hotel is supposed to provide is ability to sleep in the room you paid for. Instead it is the hotel staff that prevented me from sleeping that night.

Although the shower was glass enclosed it leaked a puddle of water on the floor even with the shower door securely closed tight. we had to soak up the water with towels each time we used the shower.
