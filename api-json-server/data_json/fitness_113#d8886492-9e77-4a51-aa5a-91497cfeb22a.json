I enjoy staying in boutique properties but it is always hit or miss with the level of friendliness. I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service and friendliness of the staff. it is not the place you bring your kids but it has a great vibe for a weekend with your significant other. The hotel is definitely close to shopping and good restaurants. The gym is rather small but most people are not there for the gym.

I stayed here on a business trip to LA for 2 nights. The rooms are clean and of nice design and quiet. I also liked the quality of the shampoos and soap and the bed was really comfortable. The breakfast was good and ok hotel price if enjoyed in the restaurant. If you order it to your room it becomes exortionate. We paid 120 USD for breakfast as we were having a breakfast meeting in the room so not to recommend. The bar and pool area has a very hip ambience and you will see a lot of beautiful people there. The gym was small lacked a proper bike only one eliptical training machine and substandard gym equipment. Also during one of the evenings we saw excessively intoxicated people in the lobby one of which fell face down on the concrete floor. That also set the mood back a little.

Ok so this place is great. A while back I used to live in LA so I do not have too much trouble choosing hotels in la la. Overall the location is great but make a note on what your preferred activities are. If it is primarily eating drinking going out kind of stuff the stretch through Hollywood to Beverly Hills area is probably your cup of tea. If you are looking at more activities based stuff and hitting the beaches and boardwalks you are going to be better off sticking Venice or Santa Monica or stay away from the tourist areas and hit somewhere like Manhattan Beach or so. A lot of folks might say to stay down at Anaheim or some such if you are planning the Disneyland trip but it is pretty difficult to get anywhere else and you will almost certainly end up stuck on the 5 half the time. So with these things in mind we chose the Mondrian in West Hollywood. it is an amazing location and quick to get to most places we wanted to go we went plenty of places from downtown to Silverlake over to Burbank think WB and Universal Studio City and down to Venice Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach and all were reasonable drives. keep in mind LA is spread out so do not expect anything to be really less than a 20 minute drive. And of course we spent a bit of time in West Hollywood Hollywood and Beverly Hills. Coffee is around the corner and the good old Saddle Ranch is across the road and Mels just down the road. Sadly the House of Blues next door is shut down but places like the Rainbow Room Viper Room. The Whiskey etc are all very close. Other going out places stretch a little from West Hollywood but still not too far. For example the Burgundy Room is still only 5 10 minutes away. And there is always the Skybar within the Mondrian itself pricey but still good free entry with your room keyThe service is exceptional and the staff are amazingly friendly which is great. The rooms tend to be spacious but are somewhat varied depending which particular one you get. Everyone is always helpful and you will really have a good time there. Now the bad. Thirty eight dollars for valet. I kind of suspected this going in as most of the hotels in WeHo tend to charge heavily for parking because your options are limited. There is parking across the road and a block east but it is 10 min with no in out privileges so you will probably pay at least the same. Having said that if you are going to spend a lot of time just walking around in the area or taking Uber it would probably be a viable option. Overall we had a great time there and would definitely stay again. Highly recommended.", "offset": [380, 613], "date": "2015-11-04", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "c3217cb5-811e-466b-b6cd-aca5c2348130", "sentence": "Stay anywhere else. The hotel pool is amazing and that is it is biggest selling point. The toilets in our rooms clogged 3 times and their policy for a security deposit is ridiculous. The service here is actually horrific and for being bellmen and waitresses they sure have an ego like the celebrities they may have served questioning that nowFor 4 nights we paid 150 and they required a 200 per night deposit. 80 that I was not expecting on vacation I should have looked further into their security deposit policy. can I call my husband and use his card while I am on a girls trip. Absolutely not they needed it now and only a card that was present. Keith a front desk assistant in a poorly fitting Macys button down made sure to say this IS a nice hotel as some sort of explanation for the annoyance. Laughable because I have stayed at their other nice hotel in South Beach 10 times where they actually are nice. unfortunately the level of service at The Shore Club Miami does not carry over to the west coast. Wish I would have known that beforehand. So after the initial awkwardness we get to our room can not wait to get a drink go straight to the pool. We are gracious attractive 30 year old professional women. you had think we came in with begging mugs out clinking coins in the bottom the way the staff behaves. We are the only group of 7 girls and there are 3 other people at the pool at 2 pm on a Friday. We are from NYC we know about hotel pool prices we are excited and thirsty. FIRST ROUND we order 200 worth of drinks and pitchers and they card each and everyone of us and before they will even bring us one drink they need one card which they authorize at that moment. Great next round same exact order they literally come back and ID every single one of us that is twice within an hour. We are soaking wet all getting in and out of the pool to get our IDs again no apologies just a rude cocktail waitress still only 3 other people at the pool and then us 7 girls. They must have been so worried about the IDs that they screwed up the exact order we had before and had to remake 2 pitchers. But really. You have 80 security deposit on my room you have a credit card you have my ID you can not bring me a receipt at the end of my drinks like every other place on planet earth. I swear I was going to walk down to the Best Western with one more clogged toilet or I apologetic IDing no really it is down the street. that is how horrible these people were. Its not even the IDing I respect and understand that it is like the waitress that forgets your order and you have told her 3 times. You know she saw you know she is your waitress and she just keeps screwing up and you are being made to feel like you are not speaking English. I will not even keep going but this happened the next day as well I had to have my husband call and complain that they were ruining my trip and they did leave us alone after that. do not stay here go during the day for the pool.", "offset": [2291, 2427], "date": "2016-06-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "57d39bb3-c3c6-4b61-9a17-0d89b9de9b0c", "sentence": "Beautiful hotel.

After having 2 wonderful stays in Mondrian London UK we decided to book the sister hotel in Los Angeles. Our experience was very different in this hotel. Our greeting at the hotel was indifferent and nobody directed us to where we would have to check in when entering the hotel. Normally it is very obvious but to the right was an empty desk and to the left was a counter that resembled a lost luggage counter. After no direction from anyone we discovered that the counter to the left was in fact the check in desk. After this was the elevators. There were 3 that could be available but all were tiny for a group of people to share never mind if you had luggage to bring in with you. Studio room was very spacious but had the signature cream net curtains hanging EVERYWHERE like the lobby which was not crisp and fresh looking instead tired and dirty. Valet parking was very expensive and also there was a charge for WiFi in this hotel. We did use the hotel pool but you have to be quick to get to the prime sunbathing spots as the space itself is not as big as you would expect for a hotel this size. One night that we did visit the bar at the pool which was catering for a party crowd we found the woman serving us to be very unfriendly and rude. After seeing the smart modern uniforms in the London Mondrian we were surprised to see that the LA staff had an ultra casual unfitted beige colour of trousers and sports jacket to wear. Not what you would expect from one of the most fashionably unique places as Los Angeles and for a hotel of this standard. Upon check out we were surprised to have a State Tax applied to our bill even though we had paid at the time of booking through an internet travel agent. When we questioned this we were just told that it was a compulsory tax in California.
