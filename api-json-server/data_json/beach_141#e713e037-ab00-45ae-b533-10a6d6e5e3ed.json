I had stayed further along Kanapali Beach on a previous trip and loved the hotel and area but the hotel was fully booked and this one was nearby. On arrival following a long flight delay reception staff were very nice. I decided to upgrade our standard room to one of the rooms on the edge of the cliff. And we were not disappointed. We were taken in a small golf cart from reception up to the building where our room was located. The porter took our luggage to the room and not only showed us the room but spent 10 minutes with us looking over the map of Maui explaining the best places to go. He was an avid boarder and swimmer so was able to tell us the best areas to see the marine life and best places to swim. Although rooms were expensive the room we had was in a very quiet area away from the beach but the view was spectacular. It was dark enough to have a good view of the night sky and we could see all the way over to neighbouring islands Molokai. We were also there during the whale season and had spectacular sights of many many whales during our one week trip. We had access to the concierge club for free food and drink and various times of the day. The breakfast was good but dinner was limited. And although drink was free the club area was only open for a couple of hours. Access to the beach was quick and easy and the hotel grounds were beautifully kept. I agree with some other reviews regarding the hotel being a little tired here and there but it did not detract from the overall beauty of the grounds and surrounding scenery.

I guess you really can not beat a hotel directly on a Maui beach. There is a nice gift shop Lamonts on the property as well as a great restaurant for breakfast buffets. We enjoyed the buffet five mornings in a row. There is also a lounge for drinks appetizers and some limited dishes and desserts. There are several options on site for dinner but we were not able to get into the Tepanyaki place too popular. The Cliff Dive Bar was decent but not an alternative for a high end restaurant. The hotel however is less than a mile away from Roys a fine dining establishment. Also the hotel is a close walk to Whalers Village a submarine tour luaus and dinner cruises. The cliff diving takes place nightly right by the property. I have a few nits to pick first and biggest the toilet was not in working order when we arrived. They sent someone to fix it reasonably promptly. But that was a problem. No outlet by bed for my phone charger. I had to leave it charging across the room. The concierge was supposed to try to get me into the Tepanyaki restaurant but he did not call me as promised on my cell phone. Another concierge said the original concierge had left me a message on my hotel phone. That was untrue. There was another concierge who was more helpful and set up ziplining and a dinner cruise for us. Only problem is she could have highlighted that the dinner cruise was a barefoot cruse where you do not want to wear nice clothes because you get wet knee deep getting into the boat. The hotel is very pricey compared to condos and even some other hotels but you do get some pretty good amenities here. And you can not beat the view. We had an ocean view room.

My wife and I spent 8 nights in Tower 4 and we had an AMAZING stay. We needed a vacation and Maui never disappoints. The first 4 nights we stayed in an oceanfront King room on the 4th floor.

It \u2019s so cool to watch the cliff divers jump from Black Rock and watching the people on the beach enjoying the ocean right from our room. The grounds are something out of a dream. Palm Trees Ocean views a beautiful beach. Everything you would expect visiting an island paradise is there at the Sheraton in Kanapali. Nothing is out of place. It \u2019s too perfect. It \u2019s pricey. 25 dollar resort fees each day. 22 bucks to park your rental car or 31 to have it Valet\u2019d not including tip for Valet. It \u2019s the price you pay for staying in paradise. I \u2019m guessing the resort fees cover the grounds maintenance and Internet which worked great. The Pool was great. It \u2019s quite large. There is what they call a lagoon that you just kind of cruise around and float. It never seems too congested which is great. The lounge chairs get swooped up quickly throughout the day but you can find a pair occasionally. We did n\u2019t eat too much at the resort but when we did we enjoyed it. Again expect to pay resort prices. The location of the resort is great in my opinion. Close enough to Lahaina. Private enough from many tourists staying in Kanapali.

I stayed at Sheraton Maui with my fiancee husband on our elopement honeymoon getaway. Sheraton Maui is a great location nicely landscaped on a beautiful beach and it is just a short gorgeous walk to Whalers Village for shopping and dining we enjoyed this convenience many times during our stay. This review will seem a little harsh compared to the four stars I gave. that is because its a great resort however I could not help but compare it to the resort that I stayed at last time I was in Maui which is why I have a few more negative comments I would had I never been to Maui before. The newly remodeled rooms were nice but a little bare as if they had forgotten a to hang up the last few pieces of art. House keeping was good although a little inconsistent with towels sometimes not replacing any hand towels or wash cloths. We stayed in an ocean front room in a great location with an amazing view however the rail on the lanai is thick and can block the gorgeous view if you do not position yourself strategically. Kanapali beach is a great beach and we loved the convenience of having snorkeling on site. We ate at Mai Tai Bar Cliff Rock and Rock Salt 2x. I enjoyed both meals at Rock Salt but I found Mai Tai Bar and Cliff Rock to be over priced and under whelming. The gym is nice and well equipped however I was disappointed that there were no exercise classes offered. I loved the convenience of the on site Black Rock Spa and I booked a few services there. I had a great massage worth it and a mediocre mani pedi definitely not worth the price on two different days with different aestheticians. My fiancee commented that even he could have done a better job on my nails. The spa has a nice atmosphere and some of the rooms have openings to the outside so you do not feel too closed off from the beautiful Maui atmosphere. Beware of the Aloha Welcome. We thought that this would be an information session on the large resort. Not so. They just try to sell you a a tour and or time share of other nearby Sheraton resorts. I have only been to Maui one other time and I stayed at the Royal Lahaina. It costs about 150 less per night the rooms are nicer the property is nicer and the beach is quieter. My then fiancee stayed there the night before we got married and I was pleased to find out that they still offer free yoga classes first thing in the morning on Mondays and Fridays.

Where is the fruit platter and pot of coffee. Called room service and they told me they do nt have platter of fruit or a pot of coffee but yet I had spoken to 3 people who said it would be right up including the manager.

Well that was just the room service now it \u2019s evening we are settling in and decide to move to our balcony. Sunset and view were amazing but thought kind of weird for the balcony to have planters with no plants in them but dirt and covered with old bark. Now sun has set as we are conversing on our lanai on 4th floor of building 3 we spot roaches crawling out of the bark and right onto our lanai. This was not just one roach we had about 10 12. We jumped up ran inside and called front desk. They apologized and sent maintenance up with a commercial grade spray can. He told us shut your balcony door the smell is strong while I kill the roaches and we did. He killed the roaches and left them on balcony. We thought that is just too weird so we called maintenance once again to come back and dispose of the dead roaches. Then go to take a shower and find small roaches the type that multiply in our bathroom and entrance way on walls and tile. Once again call manager and front desk they sent up another maintenance man and sprayed inside now. We called the manager Paul and told him the smell was strong and they did nothing that night to change our rooms. Long story short I paid for a lanai double ocean view and was charged 3k for room with cockroaches inside and exterior balcony. We lived out of our suitcases and had to spray 4 times during our vacation. We contacted Mariot Corporate once we returned and they said that the 500 dollar compensation is sufficient.

I am surprised i have to write a review on a public forum during my stay. I never review properties until I finished my stay. I am currently staying here and reserved a ocean view suite. Reservation was done 3 4 months in advance Imp later and we chose chose this property over other Mariot other brand properties due to a recommendations. Between points and cash I am paying 80 a night. This is for our 5th anniversary and I hiped up the resort to my spouse and I am regretting my choices. I try to not let small issues bother me but it \u2019s like death by 1000 cuts where several issues is making this stay pretty disappointing. First I am titanium elite member and at this location that does n\u2019t mean much as there are \u201c 30 elite members currently staying \u201d. Do n\u2019t count on using upgrade nights. It will be denied. So much for guaranteed upgrades from Mariot. Since we booked several months in advance we were hoping on the \u201c delux ocean front suites \u201d which have the best views. Essentially no rooms are available and upgrade requests are denied. Besides that no early checkin no room request preferences are honored Ie away from elevator etc. Late checkout is not guaranteed. Parking is taken care of for titanium so it \u2019s nice. But there is still 30 day resort fees regardless you use the services it covers. These DOES NOT include beach chairs and umbrella rentals which are another 60 a day. Just go down the street and there are rentals for 50 an entire week. you just have to drag them over to the beachSecond Property is still under construction since I booked it a few months ago I have checked in to see when it would be competed. Kept hearing Nov 2019. Today is Nov 26th and it \u2019s no where near complete. You will run into the construction workers with hard hats in the elevator. just not a expected view on a resort. Customer service is lack luster. If you ask for service there are prompt but there is no welcoming feeling at this resort. It \u2019s \u201c let me do my job and do n\u2019t bother me \u201d. Every thing from valet to bar service is the same. As other guests mentioned the WiFi is terrible. My 1 bar Mobile LET is faster. They have a complimentary photography session on the beach. But guess what their agreement with the photographer fell through it seems and the service is not offered. But still advertised. I had to make several calls to find this info. They were not apologetic about. Just a \u201c this is how it is\u201d. Now to my primary issue ignoring all others I booked an ocean view suite and per the pictures on Mariot website it looked like a full ocean view. Did my research on TripAdvisor other sites and confirmed the same. After the room upgrade request denial debacle we check in the room and what do we get a view of the breakfast area and some construction. It \u2019s not a full beach view but partial. I can sit here and argue the semantics of the beach view description but we essentially ended up with little or no beach view from majority of the room. the way the room is designed unles you stay to a corner of the room you do n\u2019t see the beach or black rock. Neither from living room not from the bed room. The curtains do it fold to the side completely so it blocks 13 of the beach view. I can post pics if I were n\u2019t on mobileIn addition to the view there are other issues. 1. broken TV in the living room of the suite. One of the previous guests must have thrown something at the TV and screen is broken. So we ca n\u2019t sit and enjoy the TV nor the beach view. There is no solution for it yet. In other hotels I stayed the AV person is sent out to immediately replace the TV or have some other arrangements. 2. Smallest balcony compared to other buildings rooms. This suite is located at the corner of the building thus has the small balcony due to architecture choices. Ca n\u2019t sit there and stretch my legs. 3 ft depth. Back to the wall and knee to the wall. Ca n\u2019t even enjoy the sunset from balcony due to the space issue. It \u2019s wide but that \u2019s besides the pointWhat am I paying the 80 a night for. I have had significant better stays at other resorts and regretting choosing this resort for my 5th anniversary. The biggest issue i have is the lack of response regarding the issues above. If they were accommodating I would n\u2019t be here writing the review. It \u2019s ridiculous that I has to follow up several times and still have n\u2019t received a response. \u201c Customer service manager will contact you \u201d is all I got. We have n\u2019t explored rest of the resort and wonder what other disappointments we will encounter. Disappointing and Regret might be few good words that would describe my stay so far.

My friend and I wanted to have a nice resort day on the beach that was different than the hotel we were staying at in Kanapali. When I called they said they do not let non hotel guests use the pool but do rent out private beach chairs and umbrellas for the day. We were excited to have a nice day on the beach and being avid travelers from Europe beach chairs umbrella rentals usually come with service. NOT at the Sheraton. They only want MONEY. They charged us 6250 for two chairs and umbrella only to 4 pm and REFUSED to give us the two beach towels to go on the chairs. They asked us to buy towels. How ridiculous and crude. On top of this they did not have drink food service on the beach to those chairs nor the use of real bathroom and showers for guests using the beach. It was in fact an establishment where none of the staff helped you or each other claiming each service were independent businesses of each other beach rentals restaurant spa all \u00ab independent \u00bb and we had to go and ask ourselves for everything. This is by no means a good day experience or even a nice resort stick to the Ritz Carlton 15 min away which treated us like real clients they cared about.
