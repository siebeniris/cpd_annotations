We had originally planned on spending two days in Breck but plans were cancelled. I was able to get a room for this hotel. While we requested a King they gave us a King Handicapped accessible. I felt bad because I hope no one else needed it though I would have gladly changed if they needed us to. The hotel is right on the corner and even better there is a Starbucks there too also attached was a nice little boutique that sold hats scarves accessories that were nicely priced. The Rialto cafe is also attached to the building. I like the fact that you need your room key to access the elevators the hotel is very clean and worth the price of the rooms. our room had a microwave coffee maker and fridge which was great because my daughter had altitude sickness so bringing food in for a day was easy for us to reheat so she could eat. The front desk staff was wonderful with suggestions for her being sick. They brought up a humidifier for her as well so she could breathe easier. they really took good care of us and it was truly appreciated. The location of this place is great not only did they have two places for food and coffee around the corner from there is the bauer and sams3. There is valet parking on premises There is a little food pantry for drinks snacks and toiletries if needed. I like the fact that they are green. You can get extra mariot points if you skip getting towels fresh every day. A lot of hotels are now doing that. I do nt mind it at all. Location is right on the mall so you are within walking distance of many places. Its also nice for uber pick ups since its on the corner. Will definately stay there again. Handicap rooms are alright the bathrooms are large the shower has a bench that folds down from the wall which is large too.

Stayed at the Courtyard Denver Downtown as part of a large choral festival taking place in Denver in July 2016. The hotel is a nice low rise property located right downtown on the 16th street mall a pedestrian mall that is actually used by pedestrians. We arrived at a ridiculous hour of the morning after a terrible flight delay and the staff quickly got us checked in so that we could go to our room and collapse from exhaustion. Bed was firm and comfortable and bed linens were nice crisp white sheets with comfy pillows. The room was a comfortable temperature and felt SUPER airy thanks to the very high ceilings and the large windows. I would not want to let the sun bake in all day with the curtains drawn though. Air conditioning was pretty quiet and did not intrude. The bathroom was nice as well a separate vanity area from the bathtub and toilet area which can make two people getting ready a bit easier to manage. One quibble about the bathtub my partner found it a bit slippery and we both noticed the slope downwards toward the drain was more than we were used to. There were plenty of towels and the hotel provided a mini hair dryer and some nice soaps and the like. Our room had a microwave which we did not use so can not say anything about and a bar fridge that we did use. There were two bottles of Fiji water on the counter which would have cost 6 a crack if we had opened them. that is INSANE. We just bought some water to put in the fridge. The location of the hotel as others have pointed out is really great. We were a short walk from the Denver Performing Arts Centre a slightly longer walk to the state capitol the civic centre convention centre and other attractions. The hotel has a small business centre in the main lobby that is easy to use a small store with snacks and the like with typical hotel markups and a small boutique my partner did some shopping in. The hotel restaurant is the Rialto with great happy hour offers. Breakfasts are very tasty but more pricey than I want to pay finger food specials during happy hour are a much better deal. When we left for the airport we simply jumped on one of the free busses that travel the 16th Street Mall went to Union Station and took the light rail to the airport. at 9 per person to get to the airport you can not do better.

We have been staying at this Mariot for 5 years due to our son going to college in Denver. This Mariot location has been bringing us back each year. In the past year we have visited several times. From the first visit5 years ago we could smell a sewer smell when coming into the hotel lobby from the valet parking area. My husband and I both commented on this and asked the front desk about it after the 3rd night of our stay. They acted like they had never smelt this smell. Last year we came during the spring and the City of Denver was working under the street in front of the hotel. The work went on for the few days we were visiting and I thought to myself I wonder if they are working on the sewer I asked the front desk but they said they had no idea what they were working on. So now its this year April and we have come for our sons musical performance. Again the smell is in the lobby went to work out at the gym one morning and was blasted with the sewer smell SO strong that I had to leave within 10 minutes it was so bad. Upon our departure I addressed this issue on the review card left in our room regarding our stay. Told them what I have written above and got an email from the front desk manager Stephanie who wanted me to call email her regarding this issue. For over two weeks I have called and emailed her with no response. Called today and was told by another employee that the building is old and the sewer pipes are old. Well does this mean that all these years the raw sewage is leaking under this buildingWhy would Mariot not address this issue with the city immediately. We have been Platinum Members with Mariot for 12 years. It is our fault we have continued to stay at this location but in past years it was only the lobby that had this awful smell. We are returning to Denver tomorrow for our last visit our son graduates on Saturday I had made reservations over 6 months ago. After our experience in April I tried to find another hotel or Airbnb to rent but due to graduation most places are filled.
