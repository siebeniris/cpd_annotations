Just back from visiting Mauritius for the first time and this wonderful hotel right away let it be said that the staff are it is main asset with no complaints or quibbles from our two week stay. Always difficult to pick out persons but in the bar area Ravi and Selman always there to attend to you and top you up with Nivesh Banyan restaurant manager being extremely helpful one evening in the Kitchen restaurant with arranging for an alternative dish one evening for my wife as it was a theme night with very good indian food and indianesian food but not for my wife. A nice touch not experienced before anywhere. The hotel itself is very well laid out with easy access to all the rooms and amenities should the elements change and keeping dry is paramount but no problem as all rooms have brollys at hand and have comfortable bed and large bathroom with plenty storage. The watersports are extensive with most free. The excellent facilities with Spa and sauna rooms jacuzis plunge pools and the professional masuers as we had our first Balinese massage together highly recomended. The other nice touchs are the free phone home red telephone box with instant clear connection and the free ice cream van above the beach. As said staff are A1 and next is the excellent food cooked and presented well in the Abalone al acarte and good choice buffet hot and cold in the Kitchen with theme nights for those that like the great indian and indonesian food. Now comes the entertainment side which could not be faulted with something for everyone nightly with a variety of bands and music that will have you tapping away or on your feet. During the day by the bar around the pools or on the beach there is always someone to bring you a drink or snack. can not forget the very helpful Sandep office manager and David his assistant who we spent afternoons chatting to in the coffee bar about the islands past and present history. So Mauritius Lux Grand Gaube was a wonderful experience that we would highly recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing or energetic and dancing the night away holiday.

We visited LG last year in Sept Oct for 10 days on A I basis and based on that experience which was the most relaxing and enjoyable holiday we have ever had we felt that we just had to return and for longer as everything about it is truly paradise. This time we stayed for 15 days and still did not want to leave believe me this place is infectious. From the moment we arrived we felt we were welcomed back and regarded as friends rather than guests a personal touch which is sadly lacking in the majority of hotels now a days. So nice to see all the same staff again the majority of whom have been here for many years which in itself is testament to the hotel. They clearly enjoy working here and take great pride and satisfaction from ensuring your stay is everything you would want it to be. I can only reiterate the many positive comments posted about the idyllic location the tranquillity and ambience created within the hotel the quality of the rooms and hotel facilities the excellent restaurant food and of course the quality of overall service and attention to detail that is provided by all. Nothing is too much trouble here. All combine to ensure you will have a very relaxing enjoyable and memorable stayI do not like to single out staff for praise as in the case of LG all staff are tremendous and contribute as a team to ensure you have a memorable experience and I thank them all for this but I feel compelled to mention a few who I had like to give a special thanks to Management Brice Stephan who are always visible and take time out to meet greet speak and importantly listen to guests Front office David one of the most helpful people you are ever likely to meet nothing is too much trouble and it is almost like he wants you to ask for something so he can oblige. Beach. Oh La La the famous Redo much has been said of him in reviews and it is all spot on he is extremely courteous and friendly and is a font of knowledge and will go out of his way to assist I have never seen someone who takes so much pride in their work ensuring his beach and beds etc are always pristine. Thanks for our daily chat Redo. Although there are several covering different areas Kumar Kamlesh covered the area we decided to sit at on the beach and I thank them for their very attentive drinks service which was very much appreciated and enjoyed. Restaurants Daniel Abalone Jean Philipe Beach and Diren Kitchen ensured the smooth running and that all food was excellently prepared and presented and again nothing was too much trouble in terms of varying dishes or accommodating dietary requirements which the various chefs were more than happy to do. Thanks to all for providing some memorable meals which I am missing very much. Lux Coffee Satish thanks for smiling face every morning and all your wonderful coffees coffee just does not taste the same at home anymoreSpa Sun Jesica and all other therapists thanks for making our Spa experiences so wonderfulHousekeping Kevina thanks for your attention to detail when cleaning our room and for the beautiful towel floral art you artistically created Main Bar last but by no means least to all staff at the bar with special mention to Anil Ropesh Ravi and Vijay sorry can not remember others names too many GTs. we spent and enjoyed every single night here. Our glasses were never empty and it was always a pleasure being greeted by you all. I apologise if my thanks to staff appears lengthy but this is what makes this place. If you are looking for a relaxing holiday in a quality hotel with excellent service then look no further this is the place for you. We will certainly be returning again next year as I can not fault anything.

During our stay the hotel staff were always polite courteous and helpful in every way as nothing was too much trouble which made all our guest feel very special and are still raving about it. The hotel is in a stunning location and does give the feel that you are in paradise. The grounds are well maintained and always clean. There are several private beaches which were busy but we managed to find spots near the Bar area and were serviced by Kamlesh who looked after us for drinks and food. The wedding arrangements 4 days were all handled and coordinated by the hotel planner beautiful and always smiling Lovena and her team. They did an absolute fantastic job from catering which was just amazing credit to the Chef to converting the Spirit Lounge into an Arabic Moroccan theme to arranging the floating podium for the bride and groom to get married on. Our thanks go to Sebastian for the DJ and technical work he carried out during those days. All in all credit and our praise goes to all the staff that worked so hard during those days in making the couples dream wedding come true.

The hotel offers a good range of water sports which we made to good use and enjoyed it very much. The hotel itself is modern looking with great facilities free wifi throughout the hotel complex and in the rooms.

I spent a long time researching for my retirement holiday and the Lux Grande Gaube delivered in buckets. As soon as we arrived the staff could not do enough for us and this carried on throughout our stay. They were courteous professional and polite in a warm and friendly way. I would like to highlight one particular member of staff VINESH the Restaurant Manager of the Banyan restaurant who I can not thank enough for making our stay very special. The resort itself is well laid out and the gardens and beach are kept impeccably. There is a beach Manager who ensures everything is kept tidy and organised and he should be commended for his almost OCD approach in tucking people \u2019s towels in a tidy and military fashion. The Banyan restaurant is only open during the day but was my favourite for lunch with some superb ribs and also various seafood dishes. In the evening you have 3 restaurants to choose from. My favourite The Beach managed by Jean Philipe who I now class a friend is a thatched covered raised veranda style restaurant overlooking the bay a very romantic setting. The Abalone restaurant is set on a decked area on the beach with some tables on the beach. This serves mainly superb seafood. The Kitchen is the main restaurant serving buffet food of a very high standard. The food was never repetitive and we always had a great choice. The bar also served food during the day with excellent chicken tika panini \u2019s and club sandwiches along with other great comfort food. The water sports were top drawer with paddle boarding hobi cats kayaks and best of all water ski ing all free if you go all inclusive. The water sport \u2019s staff led by Lyndsay made sure the equipment was well maintained and ready for guests at a moment \u2019s notice. I went water ski ing every day sometimes twice. For those who have never skied excellent instruction was given by staff members like Dylan who got most people up ski ing during their stay. How much would that have cost me at any other hotelIf you are going to Grand Bay take the local bus. Catch it at the end of the drive it \u2019s an experience. If not barter with the taxi drivers you can get a return for about 400 rupees About \u00a3 8A must during your stay is walking with lions an unforgettable experience. Do n\u2019t waste your time trying to film it enjoy the 40 minute walk and take it all in. The whole thing is photographed and videoed by a staff member and you can buy a memory stick for \u00a3 30 at the end with some amazing pictures and a video of the walk set to music. I can recommend this hotel without hesitation where ALL staff members treat you like a friend nothing is too much and all the little touches made this one of the best holidays I \u2019ve ever had. When speaking with passengers on the plane home who had stayed at other hotels on Mauritius they were almost envious at the level of service and amenities available at Lux Grand Gaube and when we told them how much we paid it was only a few hundred pounds per person difference. Finally if you are going to Mauritius then pay that bit extra to stay in a hotel like the Lux Grande Gaube. If you do stay here go all inclusive. I spoke with some residents who went half board and it ended up costing them a LOT more. September was a good time to go aprox. 27 degrees everyday with wind but the beaches are sheltered unlike some other hotels. Note from my wife ladies take a pashmina or shawl for the evening just to take the wind off your bare shoulders. If you do go to the Lux Grand Gaube you will have a great time especially if you like good food water sports and excellent service.

The Lux Grand Gaube Hotel is a lovely resort as a whole with lovely staff and great atmosphere. However there were some things that we were disappointed about which I have listed below. We had to move to a second room in the middle of our stay because one day the door mechanism suddenly stopped working we had to get out from the backdoor which did not lock and the staff spent several hours but still could not fix the door. So we were told that we had to move to a new room which was rather inconvenient as we had everything laid out for our stay at the hotel for a total of 8 nights. Anyway we did the move so that was that. The second day in our second room we had no hot water in the evening when we needed to shower. The repairmen were quick to show up and tried to fix the hot water but took over an hour to do so. It was after 11 pm and we were given the option to move to another room that was not affected by the hot water outage. We did not take up the option because it was stressful to have to move rooms again. So we asked for a vacant room that had working hot showers just to use the showers and then went back to our occupied room. The staff apologised for the inconvenience but the experience was really not pleasant to have to worry and move around just to get a shower near midnightWhen we contacted the hotel about our experience a manager immediately spoke to us to try to understand and apologise for putting us through the trouble. We were offered a free massage session each late checkout for our room on our last day and part of our final bill was reduced as well. Although the experience was not 100 seeing that the staff there helping as much as they can to make up for the disappointment made our stay at the Grand Gaube near 5 starOther notes There is a wide coverage of wifi which we could even get signal while kayaking near the beach. but the speed and connection was very average as the connection was cut from time to time and one had to forget and reconect.", "offset": [0, 109], "date": "2019-11-16", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "f0fd5b7e-f679-4991-b0de-0cc3e6bdeb6e", "sentence": "A Very Special Place. As repeat guests Lux Grand Gaube is a very special place for us. This hotel benefits from a great location stunning gardens stunning rooms and stunning decor. With not a hair out of place everywhere is spotlessly clean and furnishings and fitments offer a calming blend of colour co ordination and is very aesthetically pleasing. The recent complete refurbishment has ensured that this is a very beautiful resort. Equally beautiful are the team members who are its backbone and make it happen. From arrival to departure each and everyone is warm and welcoming friendly and helpful and turn themselves inside out to ensure that your stay is one that stands out from all others and one that you will want to repeat. Nothing is too much trouble and it seems that it is within their nature to be able to create such a harmonious atmosphere. The Reception Concierge and Front Office teams followed the friendly and efficient theme always smiling always helpful with seemingly time available for pleasant conversation when passing. Too many names to single out for excellent service but as we have known David Anabele Elena Koshna Logan and Frederick from past encounters it was a delight to re connect with these wonderful people and indeed with their colleagues. The Cafe Lux girls were pure delight too and not a day passed without a jovial greeting from them when on our way to the Palm Court Restaurant. Our very spacious Ocean Junior Suite on the second floor offered great views immediately across the gardens to the ocean beyond and we were delighted with Pravesh who serviced our room daily with super efficiency. A vast selection of ultra quality food choices in all restaurants was always available. Thanks to Dominik the Exec. Chef and Depuck and their teams they have thought of every food item imaginable to incorporate within their daily menus and to suit all nationalities. All dishes often cooked specifically to order were seriously exceptional and offered not only a feast for the stomach but a feast for the eyes too. So good. Supported by excellent and friendly waiters namely a few Jean Philipe Raj Ramasay Ajay Rishi and Purgun and particularly Dhiren overall in charge our dining experiences were always ones to savour and we enjoyed them all. Bodrum Blue the Turkish restaurant set in its unique location on the rocks above the beach was probably our favourite a la carte venue super food and super service and thanks to Dhiren we sampled some truly tasty dishes. With beautiful views across the bay blissful mornings were idled away on the Banyan Beach the quieter of the two main beaches where the service offered by a relatively new recruit Mevin a very personable young man was faultless. It was noticeable that he worked extremely hard all day laying towels on beach loungers providing ice cold drinks and refreshments as required and then the same in reverse at the end of the day. He never stopped working. We first met Augustine Tina when she worked as Restaurant Receptionist many years ago. She now works in Room Service and therefore not a guest facing role but she always seeks us out and it is a pleasure to pass the time of day with her. Lastly but certainly not least mention has to be made of Sandep Front Office Manager who always sets the ball rolling for our visits. A firs class link man who never falters in arrangements made on our behalf and we are always so grateful that we came to know him many years. 100 reliable. As usual we did not want to return home but all good things have to end. We hope to return for another vacation at Lux Grand Gaube in 2020.", "offset": [736, 858], "date": "2019-11-21", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "3aa2850a-4152-409a-9274-0ea558ebd96c", "sentence": "Exceptional location service and food. We are regular guests and each time we visit the staff make it very special and an exceptional experience. This holiday was no exception. The grounds are now fully developed following the renovation and you feel you are truly in a tropical ocean paradise. The welcome by Sandep and Elena is very warm and genuine and Sandep Front of House Manager can be relied upon for delivering 100 what we asked for before and during our stay. The hotel drive and reception area takes you into a special place with a truly memorable beach and ocean view. We stayed in a Junior Suite with great views quiet and very comfortable. Very clean and we were all inclusive so the mini fridge was well stocked with our preferred drinks. There have been several changes of staff but we still knew quite a number and the new staff had clearly had the LUX customer training experience. It is extremely difficult to single out individual although some gave us truly exceptional and memorable experiences. On the beach Redo continues to provide 7star service supported by Ankush Veer Savesh and Anop. On Banyan beach Kumar provides a real quality service with his own Vanilla milk shake recipe. The 5 restaurants all have their own character in superb locations with excellent food to suit all tastes and preferences. Dominic is head Chef and apart from doing an excellent job is always available to talk to guests and ensure all personal tastes are catered for. Thank you to Nicolas the FB Manager for making our whole stay truly memorable and especially for our last night dinner on the beach. Yaser runs Beach Rouge which has one of the best locations in the world with incredible efficiency and warmth. The food is delicious with great service from Yaser and his team with Madhvi David and Hassam looking after us particularly well. An extra special mention for Ashwin who looked after us in several restaurants and who anticipated our needs. And to Dhiren who ensured we were always well looked after wherever we were. Palm Court for breakfast and dinner always delivers on food variety and quality. It was great to see Jean Philipe again and he made us feel very special supported by Ramsamy and Ricardo. At the Banyan which is an unusual restaurant literally under a huge banyan tree we were very well looked after by Dokham ably supported by Shyam. Bodrum is the Turkish Restaurant on the rocks overlooking the bay and whether we were eating or having sundowner drinks we were very well looked after by Pergum and Pascal. The bar staff again were superb with great service and cocktails. Oomthat was always on hand to look after us with Ashwan and cocktails before and after dinner are not to be missed. The entertainment as always was varied and enjoyable although the bar furniture restricts views of the beach sea bar and stage which is easily remedied. And lastly Vishnu who looks after the Gin Bar makes fascinating and very interesting gin cocktails with over 100 type of gin. It would be good to see this bar adjacent or close to the main bar so more guests would use it.", "offset": [754, 899], "date": "2019-11-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "4faae3aa-5322-46db-a41f-de657c13083c", "sentence": "I had a very great experience with my wife. the main resturent was amazing and I can say they had the best buffet I ever tried.

We love Lux resorts having previously stayed at Belle Mare and South Ari Atoll but this time it did not quite deliver to the level we have come to expect. There were lots of positives beautiful setting beautiful hotel facilities Lux extras like the Barista class Marios nature walk foam party on the beach and pool party and excellent quality food everywhere including the buffet. Inti is outstanding and some members of staff really stood out Emanuel serving in the pool area Nuha in Cafe Lux and Nilesh in Inti in particular. But what did not quite hit the mark this time unfortunately. Restaurants. We were told on arrival that due to a large party being booked into the hotel Bodrum Blue was going to be closed for 8 out of 10 days of our stay as they would be using it for all meals we were offered an increased discount off Inti as an apology but this was very disappointing as we had paid for the all inclusive package. It became more of an issue the further we got into the holiday as Beach Rouge service was poor and it did not feel as special a restaurant as the Beach Rouge at Belle Mare and our first experience at Creole Smokehouse was not enjoyable as bats were dropping fruit onto the table which meant it was not relaxing or enjoyable and we were not keen to go back. We did eventually go back and sat at a table in the centre which was a better experience but it is very casual and not somewhere we had want to eat that often in the evening. Bodrum Blue is the nicest restaurant setting as we discovered when we could finally go and the fact it was not available at lunch or dinner felt very limiting. Increasing the discount at Inti did not make up for missing out on an included restaurant for 8 days at lunch and dinner. After complaining we were given a complimentary meal at Inti which was fantastic but we were disappointed that the hotel were not more proactive in addressing the reduced offering for full board and all inclusive customers during that period. Service there was a distinct lack of staff around the pool during the day with there generally seeming to be just one person usually Emanuel who did his best and remembered what we generally ordered etc but as it seemed he was working alone in that area it was a long wait for food drinks orders and service. We have been used to plenty of staff in pool areas with Lux previously regularly being asked if we need anything glasses being cleaned etc. In the restaurants there were similar waits for food having to chase drinks orders multiple times and courses being brought out when plates from previous courses had not been cleaned from the tables long waits for hot drinks in the buffet at breakfast lack of cutlery and long waits for the table to be cleared. We are aware that there was a big religious festival on the island during our stay and understand this may have caused staffing issues but the hotel needs to be able to manage this and prepare for it. We also felt that maybe staff were re allocated from their usual roles to focus on the large group party as service and standards did improve in our last couple of days after they had left and it seemed like the right people were working in the right restaurants. Whilst i understand these are not necessarily usual circumstances we paid for the Lux experience and do not feel we got that this time. Housekeeping. very hit and miss they did not come back if we were in our room getting ready for dinner when they first came around which was often so we had many days where our room was not done. My parents were in another room and they experienced a similar lack of service and frequently had to ask for water to be replaced because housekeeping had not done it. In previous Lux experiences housekeeping went above and beyond especially for the children making towel animals on their bed etc and we experienced none of that here. The beach pool it is a beautiful setting around the bay but the sand is not as nice as in other parts of the island and it lacks the option for a nice long walk along the beach. Also the pool loungers were not padded so not as comfortable and many around the family pool were torn with the material coming away from the frame. We still love Lux but this was the first time that we had frustrations and some disappointments. The restaurant experience in the last two days did improve so we presume it was a case of lack of staff and staff working in unfamiliar areas but at this level the resort and management should prepare for staff being off and the impact on the rest of guests if they are going to accept large group bookings.", "offset": [1312, 1486], "date": "2020-03-15", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}]}
