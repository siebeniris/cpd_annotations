Chicagos downtown hotel market is dominated by giants. What can a small boutique hotel like the Talbot do to stand out amongst the skyscraping corporate behemoths. They provide a great location and the kind of personalized service that makes guests feel like visiting royalty. The Talbot does this in spades. In our case the service started well before our arrival for a six night stay. Chef Concierge Roana Baxter corresponded with me via email recommending dining and activities. By the time we arrived she had secured dinner reservations at some of the areas top restaurants. Unknown to my wife and me Roana advised the restaurants that my wife and I had been married only a few days before. All of the restaurants d by greeted us with a special welcome ranging from complimentary champagne to free desserts. We were in contact with Roana throughout our stay and she was a wonderful resource providing advice and making arrangements. Her recommendations were spot on. Roana was our main concierge contact but Tim and Gene who also provide concierge service at the Talbot were also very friendly and helpful when Roana was not available. This is an exceptional group of concierges. The professionalism and high standards of the concierge desk are shared by the entire staff of the Talbot Hotel. From the doormen and front desk personnel Alicia in particular to the housekeeping staff everyone at the Talbot was unfailingly polite and eager to please. We were greeted by name whenever we entered or left the building. The rooms are cleaned and fresh towels provided every day. I could go on but I am sure you get the picture. Our room one bedroom suite in the 12th floor was very large. The comfortable sunny sitting room had three large windows. The bathrooms are large with both a tub and a shower stall and two vanities. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The hotels Gold Coast location is without rival. It is only a couple blocks away from shopping on Michigan Ave. and dining nightlife on Rush Street. Myriad Other attractions are within easy walking distance as well. Bottom line is we have nothing but positive things to say about our stay at the Talbot. We are already planning a return visit for our 1st Anniversary next August. One final note. This is boutique hotel with old world charm sensibility and d\u00e9cor. The Talbot may not be your cup of tea if you are seeking a slick hip to cool for school vibe.

We talk to people surf the web and frequent travel sites looking for fun interesting places new experiences and all at a good value. Jackpot on this one.

Bathroom stocked with Jonathan Alder items hair shampoo soap etc. Metal covers on the toilet paper holders to cut sheets for you. Towels literally six feet tall with an appropriate width. Night slippers. Bed turned down at night. Piece of chocolate on the OMG so soft pillows. Robe. Keurig coffee maker. The attention to detail was remarkable. The room cleaning staff was 24 x 7. For us a good thing. Room service staff I swear were waiting outside the door they were so fast. Again 24 x 7. Add the rest of the staff desk clerks the door men Dwayne especially and the concierges Tim especially. and you have an unbeatable team. Dwayne gave us the layout of the land speech about the hotel and nearby places like Walgrens and a small grocery store Potashs. Tim moved our Chicago experience from good to great. Ever go somewhere ask for help and end up at all the tourist places and paying way more than you wanted or expected. Tim presented the option of tourist or value. One example traveling from place to place. Sure you can take a cab and spend 35 to get from point A to point B. But if you have a little extra time 15 minutes take the bus for 250. Another example instead of paying 25 to go the observation deck of the Hancock building take the elevator to the 96 floor restaurant and bar. Windows all the way around. Similar view and free.

The Talbot staff was fantastic they were able to get me into 2 rooms right away and offered complementary drinks at the bar after hearing about our awful travel. They even offered to receive my lost luggage for me so I would not have to sit and wait for it all day. The hotel was extremely clean and the serviced was excellent during my entire stay. I defiantly will be staying here again.", "offset": [156, 252], "date": "2019-01-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "d31925c4-7d98-462c-9b60-6b0018095ec0", "sentence": "Wonderful stay.

The lovely receptionist said they were a gift to us to welcome us to their country. That was such a lovely gesture. We also were given a drinks voucher each on arrival to have a drink in their bar on them. What a lovely friendly and welcoming hotel.

We walked to The Taste to the Architectural River Tour Blue Chicago Club. There was Bigs Cigar Bar just a few blocks away. Bring your own beverage if choice and sit in the patio and share a cigar from their great selection. I love being able to walk everywhere on vacation. Never needed a car. The service was personal and Profesional. Great combination. Great restaurants in area but honestly when we just could n\u2019t go any more the restaurant in the hotel was amazing. Beautiful inside and outside seating. Wanted to go back the second we returned home. We will return again and again. The only reason I gave them a 4 on value is because I did n\u2019t think it was cheap but it was worth every cent.", "offset": [438, 538], "date": "2019-07-18", "cpt": "3", "category": "room"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "bec6b1d2-f7be-4064-9f90-6cdcc022c8be", "sentence": "Perfect stay in Chicago.
