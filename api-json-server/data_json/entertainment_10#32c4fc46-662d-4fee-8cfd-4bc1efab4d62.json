The rooms were generally clean comfortable and cool. The reception foyer is impressive the 2 restaurants are very good the pool is refreshing and the staff are very helpful.

I often stay at the Double Tree by Hilton in Alice largely because of the fantastic restaurant Hanumans downstairs. I stayed there for two nights on my last trip and then left and came back for a night later in the week. Upon check in where I waited over 10 mins in a line I was told sorry we have doubled booked your room and the hotel is full we had a computer glitch and the last people to check in will be booked into another hotel. I am not sure this was the actual case as the person before me was checked in I had a cheap rate as I booked months ago. It seems that Double Tree can not get it right. whether it is the ill repair of the rooms or the service at reception. If you want assurance of hassle free acomodation in Alice then go with the Quest best rooms and awesome staff no restaurant or Laseters where the rooms and staff are also consistent. I have found both Quest and Laseters to be consistently good. Hanumans restaurant downstairs which is separate to the hotel.

We stayed for 2 nights. We had a lot of luggage and asked at check in if they had a trolley for us to get it to our room. No trolley and no offer to help I am 74 and my wife is 68. We found a trolley ourselves saw a lady bringing one back and loaded our luggage. We then had to look for elevators which in my experience are usually in the lobby. Not here. So back to front desk to ask them. Our room was OK but a bit tired and the desklight did not work because it was not plugged in and there was no socket to plug it into. There was a foodie supplement about restaurants in our room but they were all in Darwin not much use in Alice Springs. No hotel service book containing information about local sights facilities doctors dentists etc. Amazing. There is a hop on hop off bus stop right outside the hotel but nobody at reception had any clue about route frequency etc. We were there on a Sunday when there was a street market in town but nobody saw fit to mention it. The staff were pleasant enough but we had to drag every bit of information out of them. It was like pulling teeth. We decided that as they so obviously did not care about us we would not have any meals in the hotel and this proved a good decision. We walked up to the cafe in Botanical Gardens for breakfast both days very good and cooked to order and to Lasaters Casino down the road for dinner both days unpretentious but also godWe happened to see the duty manager in reception one day and mentioned our issues to him. He was apologetic and gave us a free drink coupon which we used in the bar but it is really not good enough. Also there is loads of land but the car park is small and fills up completely at night.

Both have pros and cons but Doubletree tends to recognise Hilton Honors membership and status so this tends to be my go to. Doubletree is a decent hotel by Australian standards I had give a 35 by NT standards a solid 4 star. You can look forward to the traditional Doubletree cookie on checkin. it is a decently spacious hotel with nice swimming pool spa and other facilities. The rooms are decent I have stayed in most of them but the suite is massive and great for families living room dining room kitchen etc. The top 3rd floor in every building is reserved for Hilton Honors members. it is recommended you get a mountain view which is great to look at during sunrise sunset. The rooms are a little dated but still clean and no issues. I am not a fan of bathtub showers and most rooms seem to have these. Included amenities include tea coffee milk. Hilton Honor members get 2 free bottles of water every day which is great. Staff are generally friendly there is even a peacock which wanders the grounds. In terms of dining there is a small handful of options. I notice since my last visit they have redecorated the Saltbush restaurant area with blue backlighting that improves the ambiance. The star though is Hanumans restaurant a fusion Thai Chinese Indian restaurant part of a small chain with the main restaurant in Darwin. I dine here every time I am in Alice Springs regardless of whether I am staying at the Doubletree. Though Hanumans is separately owned you can charge the bill to your room. While you can order takeaway as well they will not deliver to your room which would have been a nice touch. maybe something Doubletree can look into. Protip If you are a Hilton Honors member charge Hanuman dining to your room as you can accrue Hilton points.
