Stayed here for four nights over New Years feeling ripped off is the best way to describe this experience. Yes like others I accepted that you are paying for the convenience of the location and having stayed at another neighborhood hotel on my last visit I enjoyed being able to walk to the parks but what you pay for and what you get are totally apart. You pay for a seven star hotel two rooms with carparks views cost us over 1000 per night. you get no minibar no nice toiletries cheap toilet paper taps that were missing pieces dirty sideboards had to wipe up a water mark and the towel was black. Got a lovely turndown once over the four nights. Check in was fine but the girl seeing my family of five with teenage children elected to give us a room with bunk beds and a rolaway as opposed to discussing the queen queen option. My son could not fit the bunk and every time he moved the beds creaked as he hit against them poor kid he spent the whole night apologising. Needless to say we got limited sleep and I was at reception just after 630am looking for a room change. Hilda was super helpful but adding a room meant my nightly room bill went up to over 1000 plus we lost any potential view unles you enjoy a carpark. But really the bad experience is the food and beverage service. After a long day at the park we decided to have room service dinner. I called them at about 715pm to discover the wait time was two hours. The staff member explained it is their busiest week etc etc SO PUT MORE STAFF ON. they know it is busy it happens every year and people do not walk in to this hotel they would have known their expected occupancy months ago. Okay I thought it is dinner time I get everyone wants to eat so we grabbed a pizza from Downtown Disney had to do that as EVERY SINGLE RESTAURANT IN DOWNTOWN also had a two hour wait. Next night tried again for room service this time at 6 pm no luck this time the wait was 90 minutes. Again forced to head down to Downtown Disney and grab a table there again the location pays off as at least we could wait in the hotel not outside in the 8degre weather like others. Final straw was returning from the park after Midnight on New Years. Just wanted a bottle of water. the shop was closing so they directed me to the bar the queue was a mile long everyone trying to get cocktails I spoke to a waiter in the bar and said I just wanted water he shrugged pointed to the line and told me to queue FOR A BOTTLE OF WATER which given the price they charge should be in the rooms minibar or at least available in the room for purchase. Went back past the shop where a staff member was going to assist we got chatting and she said I was lucky the wait for room service was only two hours when I had called she had heard it was four hours another time. Bear in mind here I am paying over 1000 per night and so is everyone else. The staff member directed me to the vending machines great idea thanks of course I had come to reception with some cash and my room card which you can use everywhere to charge more and more to your room. I needed it to get into the room with the vending machine but what a surprise the vending machine only takes credit card so back through the rabbit warren to my room to get my credit card and repeat the process all for a bottle of water. Wanted a quick breakfast on our last morning but realised the only buffet restaurant the hotel has for breakfast is character dining so could not get a table. Gave room service a final try HURAY only a 40 minute wait ordered breakfast it arrived close at least an hour after ordering but hey who cares. it was not 90 minutes right. woho for the Grand Californian. Server said sorry for the delay we are really busy. again refer previous point PUT MORE STAFF ON. Final Disney experience called the bellman for help with our luggage 45 minute delay hope that is okay. NO of course it is not. I am paying 1000 a night and expect a little bit more service for my cash. The hotel did manage to deliver one thing on time our hotel accounts were under our door when we woke up on our last morning proves what others have said it is all about the dollar nothing about service to customers. do not be fooled Disneyland may well be the happiest place on earth but if you have stayed at the Grand Californian it would have to be to get the sour taste of being ripped off at every turn out of your mouth.

Our family had a few nights at the grand Californian in late January 2015 and had a mixed experience. On the plus side breakfast at Storytellers Cafe was fantastic and access to the parks is good. However you can just book breakfast and get the same park access if you stay at the other Disney hotels albeit with a slightly longer walk. Unfortunately the service is not good enough at this price point. We started in a cramped premium room with a view of grizzly mountain but were kept awake by chainsaws and trucks beeping as the park was being renovated and the power was also out from 12 am to 5 am. That was probably just unlucky however the service we received when we tried to move was not up to scratch and the room we subsequently moved to had a strange dripping noise coming from the pipes. We also asked guest services to book a shuttle for us to the airport they suggested and booked a taxi for us. Which then did not come at the arranged time and when we asked them to follow up they said we should just go to the taxi rank and take the next available car. We were a family of five travelling to LAX to fly to Australia and were not impressed.

We decided toy stay at the the Grand Californian because of the wonderful experience with Disney properties in the past and felt it would be well worth the cost to stay at the Grand Californian because of how impressed we had been with Disney before. We were very disappointed at the Grand Californian. They seemed understaffed for starters. There was a long wait at registration. There was consistently a long wait every time we picked up the phone for the front desk the bell hop the valet etc. so much so that we gave up trying and just would walk downstairs to get what we wanted. We actually heard a repetitive recording every time we picked up the phone for help. It was often over 10 minutes before we would hear an actual person pick up the phone. When we finally reached an actual person the wait for what we asked for was so long we gave up on that too. The decor of the room definitely needed updating. We took the kids to LA earlier this year to sight see and visit Universal Studios Hollywood etc. They actually liked the Westin Bonaventure better than the Disneys Grand Californian in Disneyland.

I had such high hopes for my most recent stay at a Disneyland property and everything leading up to the stay was great booking making changes etc but after all was said and done I was pretty disappointed in the experience. When you pay so much for a hotel especially at Disneyland you expect to have a magical experience. I had say this trip was anything but magical it was standard. We decided on the Grand Californian because it was so close to the parks and we were taking our son for his 1st trip to disney and wanted it to be special. A couple of friends were coming with us so we had some requirements for the room for sure. At check in we were told the room style we needed was not available until our second night so we would have to change rooms. With a baby and four adults this is not a fun easy task so we were unhappy. Also I expected them at check in to acknowledge it being my sons first visit. nothing. We were told our room would be ready within the hour but after nearly an hour and a half we check on the status and requested a better room. This time we got it but again had to wait nearly another hour to get into the room. The bell staff was great however and brought our massive amounts of luggage to our room promptly. The room was fine but did not really have as much disney spirit as I had hoped for but it met all our needs. During our stay the housekeeping service was great. we surely gave them a run for their money and they were clearly up to the challenge. This was great. Also during our stay one person in our party lost his ticket. The hotel concierge and front desk staff were completely incompetent in helping us. How do they not know what can be done. In fact they made us feel so bad and in the end seemed like nothing could be done. This was far from the truth. After going to the help desk at disneyland they replaced his ticket no problem. There was no hassle and it was pretty easy. how does the hotel staff not know the policy procedureLastly I left an important item in the room but knew exactly where. It took several days for the staff to get it and send it back. I am happy they did but it seemed like things could have moved a bit quicker. When you stay at the Grand Californian you are really paying for the convenience of the location. I thought we would be getting a truly magical disney experience but it did not turn out that way. do not get me wrong I loved being so close to the parks. it really helped but in the future I would pay less and stay at Paradise Pier have stayed before or the Disneyland Hotel.

You are paying for being in the park the convenience and the service. The resort overall is beautiful very well done Craftsman especially the lobby and pool area which are pretty impressive. However that said I think it is still very expensive for the tiny rooms you get. It is great if you are not on a budget do not have too high expectations about the room itself and are paying merely for the convenience of staying at the park. Hotel guests have earlier entry to the park and their own entrance awesome if you want to get into the park before the masses hit the rides first skip the lines. I think perhaps they should lighten up the rooms a bit to make it appear larger or possibly use smaller scaled non bed furniture some mirrors just a thought. The Disney theme is very subtle and only on a few pieces in the room such as a framed picture and the shower curtain. You pay extra roughly 200 250 extra per day to get concierge premium club level which also includes a room with snacks salad finger foods drinks and beer wine and also a view of the pool park etc. The view is great if you want to watch the fireworks when you are tired at night after visiting the park and away from the crowds. Again convenience you are paying to be closest to the parks and Downtown Disney. your oasis when you want to rest or retreat away from the crowds every so often.

The staff were helpful however we could not get our room until 430pm on check in day we needed to go out at 530 to a hockey match so ended up rushing and hanging about waiting for the room after a long journey we arrived at 130 perhaps naively expecting a room as at other cheaper places on our vacation this had not been an issue. On the last day our flight was not until 930pm having been at the park I asked about showers and was told I could use a shower at the pool area. What I was not told was that there was ONE shower only and there was a family of 7 also using it. So I had a cold shower next to the pool it was raining before an overnight transatlantic flight. Something really needs to be done about this in Europe you can usually use a complimentary room for an hour or at least decent communal shower. The pool area looked lovely but unfortunately on the two occasions we tried to use it there were NO sunbeds available. We sat on a wall. Perhaps a quiet pool linked to the vacation club needs to be added as the pool was not really fit for purpose for the size of the hotel.

I know over the course of about 5 international long distance phone calls that I asked them to keep the tickets at the desk since we could not pick up the tickets elsewhere. Of course. Disneys team sent the tickets to my sisters house someone signed for them. we do not know who. So here we were sitting at the hotel front desk with no Disneyland tickets. Our VIP tour was in 30 minutes. We had to argue with people at the front desk to tell them that Disney reservations made the mistake not us. then after they finally issues some complimentary 1 day tickets we had 2 days at Disneyland I called the reservation team on my mobile phone while waiting at the front desk and they issued replacement tickets for us. The frustrating issue was that they wanted us to purchase new tickets about 1000 worth of tickets then when we go to my sisters home where they incorrectly sent the tickets. they wanted us to ship them back to get the refund but I was not about to do this given that I did not know who signed for the tickets.

Dirty towels and cups were not picked up often so they were just laying around. My waitress got my order wrong and she did not offer to fix it. On a again bad customer service.

Perhaps I was influenced by the terrible stay I had just experienced in Vegas but this hotel really did impress me. It was not what you would call luxurious but everything was just as it should be.

No matter how you refer to them every one I came into contact with was friendly asked how everything was offered directions or was just overall very helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable. It was equipped with a refrigerator and a coffee maker which are always appreciated when I am traveling. I can not comment on the restaurants as I was not able to utilize them during my brief stay. I did however order room service and I was very impressed. As a matter of fact I ordered from the childrens menu as I was not looking for huge portions. The salmon I got was perfectly cooked not overcooked as I have often experienced in other hotels and served with steamed brocolini rice and fruit. Again most impressed by the food and the service. It does take a bit of time for the valet to retrieve your car so I had suggest calling at least 10 minutes before you need to have it available. Again even the wait I experienced while waiting for my car was pleasant due to conversation with the valet staff. The toiletries provided were also a nice touch I am guessing that full sized versions might be available in the spa which was another amenity I did not have the opportunity to check out.

Its been about 3 months since I stayed at this hotel and just have been too busy to leave this review after exhausting myself after weeks of trying to just speak to someone who cared and never actually getting that satisfaction. To save time I am just going to post the email I wrote on June 7th. Hello I was a recent guest at the hotel staying in room 33. I wanted to address some concerns I had with my stay. I did try on four occasions to address the various issues but none seemed to be taken seriously. I am hoping that on this 5th try that someone shows some type of concern. I am going to just jump ahead to the most concerning part of my stay and one that needs to be fixed ASAP before another guest gets injured. On the morning of June 5th as I was getting ready to leave for my conference I went to latch the slider and my pinky finger was sliced on a piece of deteriorated metal that was on the stationary part of the lock. It took me nearly 15 minutes to get the bleeding to stop. At around 8 AM I proceeded down to the desk and told them about what had happened and showed the pictures of the device that injured me. I told her it was just a pinky and it would be fine but never would want a child to cut themselves on this. She assured me it would be fixed. She handed me a few bandaids to cover the wound and I went out for the day. When I returned I noticed that it still was not replaced. I went to down to speak to a manager. This was around 6PM. She took my room number and name and apologized. I went out for the evening. upon my return at 130 still not fixed. I saw a QR option on the TV to leave a comment. I used that and left a comment yet again no one got back to me or addressed me. At this point I am more annoyed for the lack of concern than anything else. These rooms as you are well aware go for 70 plus a night. There is no reason to have such a deteriorated piece of equipment in room like this. While my injury was minor I do nt think anyone should expect to be injured in anyway while staying in hotel due to faulty or unkept equipment. Please fix that lock ASAP to ensure no one gets injured going forward. I do have photos and video to support anything you may need from me. Now that that is out of the way I do want to complement Madison at the Front Desk. She was always great in both interactions I had with her. Great asset. And lastly I am a huge Disney fan and while I have stayed at DH and AKL in orlando I have never stayed at GCH. I Was so excited to finally stay. The first few days did not disappoint. However the night of the 4th I had to discover for myself that Grad nights pump bass throbbing music until 2 AM. When I called down to the desk she just said yeah its grad night How are we as guest suppose to know what that is and how that would impact our sleep. I found the night of the 5th would be the same. Again the lack of concern or remedy was just mind boggling to me. Like we just needed to put up with it. I think this could easily be resolved by letting guests know what s going on and offering earplugs as hotels in major cities often do. To make us just put up with it was really not what i have ever come to expect from Disney. I really do hope that what I have shared with you today does not fall on deaf ears as I feel I wasted my time the first 4 attempts at resolving guest service issues during my stay. After this email I did not hear anything for over a week. I sent another and I finally got a call from some customer service rep who gave the basic generic apologies. I doubt they ever fixed it and they certainly did not even bother to offer anything for the injury or trouble. I just think that a company this large charging this amount of money could have had the GM or someone with some type of authority assure me that that lock was replaced.", "offset": [1055, 1191], "date": "2019-09-04", "cpt": "3", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 39, "uid": "6b7ec201-684e-4638-b9f9-0914af4079ba", "sentence": "Short trip only spent two nights.
