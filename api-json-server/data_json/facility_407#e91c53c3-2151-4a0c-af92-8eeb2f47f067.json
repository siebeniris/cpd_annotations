My family and another family 7 in total stayed at this resort from August 11 2017 through August 13 2017 in room 706. We paid a total of 54880 for two nights including fees and taxes. I was mostly happy with my stay and would stay here again. We checked in around 4 pm without any problems. There was ample parking and the lobby area was very nicely decorated and clean. I very much liked the numerous luggage racks available to transport items up to your room. I was not expecting that. The price of the hotel was excellent compared with similar hotels we were looking at on the east coat and gulf coast. Numerous restaurants shops and a major grocery store are just a few minutes away. The suite itself was very spacious and clean. We were a total of 4 adults and 3 children yet we never felt crowded. There was one master suite with a connecting bathroom and jacuzi tub. There was also a smaller room with two twin beds that we pushed together. We were a family of four sleeping in the smaller room but the beds were not big enough so I slept on the pull out sofa in the living room. That bed was not the most comfortable but what you would expect. The resort did provide extra blankets and pillows in the closet for that purpose. The suite came with a lot of amenities like a washer dryer small kitchen stocked with plates utensils glasses cookware etc. They also provided free laundry detergent dishwashing soap soaps but interestingly no shampoo in the bathrooms. There was a nice living room area with a large flat screen and numerous channel options dining table two couches and a loveseat. The balcony was also spacious and clean. There was easy access to the beach which was kept clean. We very much enjoyed the pool area which was kept clean and the water was very warm. I could not tell if they heated the pool but it seemed like they did because it had just rained and was cloudy all day when we arrived. We expcted the water to be cold but it was warm. There were always lounge chairs available. I was also impressed with the towel service. They had a machine that you opened with your room key and took as many towels as you liked. The towels were embedded with chips and would record when you returned them at a later date. I never saw a towel service machine like that before. We found that very convenient. Be careful though because they charge 25 for an unreturned towel. The hot tub was spacious with very strong jets. It was hot but not too hot. I also liked that they kept the pool area open until 130 pm. There was a very nice and well equipped gym that we did not use. My children also very much liked the game room and childrens play area which is a larger version of the play area in Chick Fil A restaurants. Be forewarned about the game room. A lot of those games of chance are scams or otherwise extremely difficult to play. The game which is labeled \u201c A Winner Every Time \u201d is a game to pick up candy with dual claws. The last 3 times we saw it played it did not pick up any candy. It was actually a \u201c Loser Every Time \u201d. The other claw games are just as bad. We dined at the Azteca Mexican restaurant for my birthday meal which was very good. The prices seemed a little high in my opinion but not too bad. Service was very good and quick. If you are wondering why I did not give this resort 5 circles it is primarily due to their ridiculous and absurd check out time of 10 am. there is a general rule I have learned over my lifetime of travels the earlier the check out time the less the hotel cares that you enjoy your stay. When you check in they give you a paper warning that they STRICTLY enforce this 10 am check out time. If you do not check out by 10 am you are assessed a 100 fine. It was sad that we could not sleep in and enjoy the resort a little bit more on our last day but instead were in a rush to escape a 100 fine. The management of this resort should seriously consider advancing the check out time to generate more good will. I heard other guests complaining about the check out time as well. Also when I check out at other hotels I usually just leave. Fortunately I asked if I had to do anything and I did have to sign some paper. Not sure if that would have cost me had I not done so. Overall I was pleased with the resort and the price we paid. We would stay here again.

The resort is out on the peninsula so it is almost an hour from Orlando airport \u2013 but very easy drive. The entire staff is just wonderful extremely friendly and accommodating. The unit was well kept fully stocked kitchen with plenty of dishes pots pans and accessories. They provided dish laundry detergent some coffee soap TP and paper towels. You could exchange any towel linen on any day down in the Lobby awesome feature. They also have a midweek tidy where they would swap out your towels and replenish all paper products. The bathrooms are HUGE and bedrooms provide plenty of drawer and closet space. There is a safe in Master BR. Free WiFi and parking. WiFi is a little weak in some places. The pool was great always enough chairs even with such a large resort and the activities were good too. Bingo Trivia Water aerobics etc. The pool is open 8AM to 130PM which is awesome. Many days they have live music as well. They provided pool towels again in the Lobby with your room key. Unfortunately we never got to try the restaurant but the Tiki hut at the pool was great for cocktails and some fod. and Erin is awesome. The resort even has its own Movie Theater with popcorn and a huge game room. The tennis courts basketball court and Hot Tub are all on the roof of the covered parking. We even got to see a Rocket launch from our Balcony. The resort is on the Beach and you can walk miles in either direction. You do need to pay to rent beach lounges andor umbrellas. Up the street is Ron Jon \u2019s open 247 ask desk for coupon and it \u2019s just a short drive to numerous restaurants Cape Canaveral Kennedy Space Center or WDW an hour away. We like to walk and you can get to many restaurants within 2 miles of resort. Atlantic Ave has great with sidewalks on both sides of the street. There are great Happy Hours. our favorite being Coconuts on the Beach South of the resort. They even provide a free shuttle. The Sand Bar Sports Grill is also great and a perfect place to catch a game on TV. There is not a ton to do outside of the Resort in Cocoa Beach without jumping in your car.

The hot tub is up some stairs over the parking garage located next to the pool. The beach is a decent walk most of it covered in sand. The beach can get a bit crowded at certain times of the day. This resort is nice but my husband and I are not huge fans of the size. The rooms are nice I think they have been updated at least the room we stayed in. You are not guaranteed an ocean view room. Being a big resort also means the pool can overflow with people at certain times. do not expect good WiFi. I know you are on vacation but there are some days where you are not going to be at the beach or the pool all day long or into the night and you want to watch a simple YouTube video. The internet kept disconnecting and saying there was no internet access. Mark was very helpful he did try coming to our room 2 days in a row to try to help us fix the WiFi to no avail.

There is free parking. The beach area is nice but lacks chairs for your use unles you rent them when we were there no one was manning the rental station so you could not get a chair if you even wanted to pay for it. This hotel is a time share environment which has its pros and cons. We witnessed numerous tours being given all chalked full of masked hard sell sales pitches. The location is nice. There is a restaurant onsite and a pool bar. Prices are more reasonable than many other resorts I have been to. The rooms were clean. There was a fair bit of noise that could be heard coming from both inside and outside of the suite. The doors are thin and do not block much noise from the inner hallway even when the door is shut. There is a game room with pool and some video games. There is an outdoor shuffleboard and ping pong table. There are some sand toys for kids available on the boardwalk area.
