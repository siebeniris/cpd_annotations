This was our first trip to Bora Bora but we had over the years many other stays in Four Seasons resorts and to summarize the stay we can say that Bora Bora is amazing and totally worth we never experienced the ocean the way we did so clean and bright with amazing fauna and flora. However when compared with any other Four Seasons resorts or other luxury resorts this was a sub standard stay for several reasons listed below. Guest Room. we did stay at room 428. Lagoon View. my problems with the room started with the way it was sold to us quiet area nice lagoon view to what end up being the reality very noisy room in the evening terrible to sleep with boats from service areas and employees running all over from 10 pm to past midnight they actually come with the engine disengaged until close to the room and them turn it on there making it even worse. View is associated with that in the evening there is a very strong light coming from the services maintenance area probably to guide the boats and during the day we see that huge maintenance services area right in front of us. The problems might happen in most 40s rooms with Lagoon view so my advice is stay away from those rooms. On top of those issues they are very far from everywhere in the hotel and if you do not like to walk we actually to like so this was not the problem for us is definitively a waste of your time and money. We stayed at hotel for 7 nights we booked through a preferred partner and we were very disappointed with the actual room we got far from everywhere 1 km from breakfast and promised priority on golf carts transportation not actually held true noisy and in a place that is very difficult to find anything we would not like to look at we had direct view to the back of the hotel with Maintenance services etc. During our stay 3 we took part in 3 events and nothing memorable came out of them. Events Polynesian night was a disaster for us we arrived in the room 7PM and we asked about the show that was happening the same night and would not happen until the other week and concierge was very accommodating have dinner booked at 8 show informed to start 815. We arrived earlier to have time to eat and we were place in a communal table seating backwards to stage. Food came in at 8 show started at 805 and we backwards should decide whether eat or watch we could not see the food as the place was dark and once we moved to see the show we blocked other peoples view so we finally decided to leave earlier and ask for room service. Events New Year should have been better planned dinner was at 8 from buffet so basically everyone had eaten by 90930 and if not would have cold food or so. Problem being that music with DJ did not start until 11 so there were nothing really to do to hang around our daughter got tired and we went back to the room and end up watching the St Regis fireworks as we were far from the hotel fireworks one of the farthest rooms in the complexEvents Movie Burger night movie planned to start at 80 printed in the newsletter and in the table plate holder but actually started before 730 so as we booked for 730 we got with movie already ongoing and having trouble to eat as people there were watching the movie and we could not speak and have already lost its beginingRegarding food there are 3 restaurants not always working at same time with limited options for all meals considering we are in a island with not many places to go if you do not want to eat at hotel often items in the menu already limited not available making it hard to stay 7 days as we did without getting bored on having to eat same food over and over again. Quality of the food is good and the deserts very good. Pool needs to be refinished there is a major hole in the pool floor where the pebbles are gone and several places where is too rough we have same type of finish in our pool at home and know that the one at hotel is already aged and due for replacementBeach the larger and best beaches are in front of the villas but they are reserved and unles you are staying there you have to use the small beach close to the pool which has a very nice service and small beautiful island just in front but when into the water has to deal with small pieces of reefs like rocks under the water making it hard to walk when in the water. The bright side is that Bora Bora is amazing and all the different excursions we did were great the service providers the hotel have are pretty good Pure Snorkeling with Christophe Pictures tour with Vincent Wake boarding with Alban and Helicopter with Chrstopher are all worth it. Concierge did a pretty good job supporting us and organizing those trips. Spa is actually very good and we recommend the 80 minutes massage rather than 50 doing both we could really see the different impact they have on you and although more expensive the cost is worth it. Hotel grounds are very beautiful and well maintained. We really liked the lagoon with the reefs and fishes with a marine biologist on site. Concluding we will definitively be back to Bora Bora which deserves a 5 star but not to Four Seasons and we do expect that other Four Seasons experiences do not repeat this one which is bottom in the list of FS resorts we already stayed Koh Samui and Lankawi being the top ones for us. The evaluation is based on previous experiences we had at other luxury resorts and compared to that the hotel itself is below what we had already enjoyed in other places. This was compensated by the place we were Bora Bora is an amazing vacation destination and has lots to do if you like water ocean and outdoors.", "offset": [1445, 1851], "date": "2016-01-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "0ede7479-0677-4ccc-bc4a-cbffd89cf9a8", "sentence": "Nice Stay but Rocky Start. Generally speaking we had a really nice stay here but things were a bit shaky the first couple of days stayed for 5 nights. and when unfortunately when compared to the other resort Four Seasons we have also experienced Maldives Kuda Hura Jackson Hole Maui this location just does not earn the Excellent rating all the others do. Relatively speaking I think they suffer from more disorganization and lesser attention to detail. I will start with the things we noticed that could use improvement some of these may seem very minor but put it all together it is reflective of the level of organization and attention to detail the staff are either extremely nice or extremely stoic. the breakfast staff on the first morning in particular did not leave a pleasant taste pun intended. they had a huff puff. what do you want sigh. attitude when you could even finally get their attention which is a big shock compared to the consistent bend over backwards atitutude at other FS locations and really we are not high maintenance and are very willing to take care of most things on our own. it is just nice to have good service which is why we choose FS most of the time in the first place the breakfast is supposed to go until 130am so we were told when we arrived but they start packing up everything right at 1am now the New Years Eve dinner was by far the biggest miscomunication we had during our stay. while trying to figure out what to do for NYE the concierge told us that the only options were the NYE dinner celebration that they organize or room service. He also said that as a courtesy they already reserved all guests for the NYE dinner but you could cancel beforehand. Since it was our honeymoon and we had already mentally imagined spending it alone and quietly we later called them to tell them. At this point a different person told us that the organized dinner was mandatory. to be fair think this was a language thing and that we had already paid for it. to the tune of US 350 per person. After much time trying to get to the bottom of it and speaking to a few more of the staff we found out that the NYE dinner was actually already part of the pre payment for the rooms but at this time we had not seen any type of itemized bill and was basically just part of the whole room fee if you stay here over that time period. Needless to say we were very unpleasantly surprised. They said that there should have been email communication about it to all guests prior to pre payment. I will gratefully say that they then were nice and dutiful enough to check through their communication history with us and they did not find any notice to us. They acknowledged the missed communication and sorted out the issue very painlessly from there on out their nightly flier of next day activities had the wrong day of week listed at the top once or twice and the one about NYE said bid adieu to 2014. we were there in Dec 2015 found a few dead cockroaches thankfully small and none alive probably due to their nightly pest control spray and if you leave the deck doors open for more than 2 seconds there is an influx of at least 100 fruit fly looking things flying in I totally get that insects are normal and they can not control it completely but based on our stay in the Maldives I think the FS Kuda Hura does a better job this is indirect but I did overhear another guest at front desk noting that he had just waited 15hrs for his dinner at the BQ night which is something that has never happened to him beforeOn the positive side the things that we really appreciated were everyone we encountered at front desk and concierge desk were very helpful in sorting out issues especially with the NYE debacle above and helping to plan activities the spa is amazing. it is bi level so has very tall ceilings and is one of the nicest in architectural design that I have seen the therapists definitely know what they are doing Sunset Bar has great food of course pricey but less overpriced than Ari Moana from what we could tell we did not even bother trying it since we figured we could do the likes of Eleven Madison or almost Per Se for the same amount there are very nice guest facilities you can use the spa facilities even if you do not have an appointment the watersport center has a lot of options and the tennis courts are very well maintainedAnother thing to note and this is not necessarily good or bad just depends on your preference. is that it is not a resort with an intimate feel the overwater bungalows are quite close together and there are a lot of them. definitely feels less quiet than Maldives Kuda Hura and more like Maui with the large resort feel. Again this ultimately is a beautiful property in an amazing location but they just need to work on the details a bit more.", "offset": [850, 1106], "date": "2016-01-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "342216e9-7bb8-4bb8-894c-c3b2495dc4f1", "sentence": "I would give them 10 out of 5 if I could. 5 years ago we stayed at the St Regis Resort in Bora Bora. We enjoyed our experience there but thought we would try another resort this time since it is not like we would return to Bora Bora over and over again. We stayed at this resort for 6 nights in a 2 bedroom overwater bungalow with a private plunge pool rooms 101 and 103. It was amazing everything you would expect from Four Seasons. The property itself did not seem as big as the St Regis but it has everything you need. I did miss the bicycles that they had at the St Regis. would recommend Four Seasons get some for their guests. The grounds are very clean and the service is exquisite. Our bungalow was huge 2 huge one bedroom huts each with it is own living room bedroom bathroom with large tub and separate shower 2 sinks. The tub overlooks the ocean. The 2 huts are connected with a huge deck which houses 2 platforms that you can access the lagoon directly and a private plunge pool. The great thing about the separate huts is that if you come with another family you each have the privacy of the stand alone huts but can visit each other without leaving your hut walk across the deck and you can visit the other family. The deck also has space for dining lounging and sunbathing. Inside the hut you have everything you need and it is just like a luxury hotel. The beds and duvets are very very comfortable. The restaurants are all of high quality. The food was better than what we had at the St Regis. Not cheap though. so be prepared to pay lots. Cocktails are about 23 USD each. Room service was great and was reasonably priced surprisinglyLots of activities on the resort. There is a lagoon for snorkeling a separate lagoon for SUP and kayaks. there is a beautiful little island right off the main beach that you can paddle or walk to and can have a romantic dinner for 2 on that little island. Service at the Four Seasons is second to none. Every staff member we encountered had a smile on their face and always greeted us with a friendly hello. We travelled with 3 seniors this time and they were always available to help them wherever we were on the resort. One day my elderly father slipped and fell at one of the lagoons. He did not hurt himself much just a little coral scrape. We took him back to our bungalow to tend to his minor injury but on the way we ran into a staff member who offered to help wheel his wheelchair back. We said we were fine and proceeded back to our hut. No sooner had we arrived in our bungalow we got a knock on the door it was a staff member from security with a first aid bag. He said he got a call from the staff member who saw us at the lagoon and notified him that there was a minor incident. The security member helped me clean up my dads wounds gave me more first aid supplies and said we could call them 247 every staff member at the resort was trained in first aid and they are ready to help anytime. I was so impressed that they came as quickly as they did and seemed to care so much. I can not say enough about the service of every member at this resort. I would return in a heartbeat. it is not cheap but it is worth every penny. You are in paradise with the blue lagoon water a beautiful huge hut over the water with first class amenities and service. can not ask for more. The only constructive criticism I would give is that parts of our deck was a bit run down. The bungalows could probably do with a reno but I have nothing but great praise for the Four Seasons Resort in Bora Bora.", "offset": [3423, 3544], "date": "2016-05-17 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "d5512d69-dcb3-4e3d-ac9c-e62ed1476939", "sentence": "Wonderful.

This is a true luxury tropical hotel. The rooms are spacious well appointed and well maintained. My wife mentioned several times that whoever designed the rooms seems to have thought of every little detail. Our Deluxe overwater bungalow with mountain view was wonderful. Divided into three separate areas the suite was very usable. The back deck which ran the entire length of the suite was an excellent place to relax and enjoy the view of the lagoon and the mountains. From the moment that we were met at the airport all members of the Four Seasons staff that we encountered were outstanding. This may be the best best trained hotel staff that we have experienced in all of our travels. They were efficient engaging and eager to please. From the very first encounter in the hotel lobby it seemed like every staff member knew our last name and greeted us cheerfully by name. This was true of maintenance staff housekeeping and restaurant personnel. The manager Mr Chen is a hands on administrator who has done a marvelous job with his staff. The buffet breakfast that was included in our reservation was very good every day. The staff is very helpful and they try to make the buffet an incredible experience and a different experience each day. We took most of our meals both lunch and dinners at the to oceanside grills. The food was always expertly prepared and the staff was very very friendly. Like a lot of large hotels in French Polynesia the hotel is designed to meet all of your needs and would like you to stay on campus for your entire vacation. There is a daily water shuttle that goes to the shopping areas in Bora Bora but frankly that activity is subtly discouraged by staff. The hotel provides a number of water activities that are accessible to the guests. Sadly the state of the coral in the area is deteriorated to the extent that snorkeling was not productive. When we were in Bora Bora 20 years ago the snorkeling was incredible the fish were bountiful and the multi colored coral was gorgeous. For whatever the reason this is no longer true along this motu in Bora Bora. The hotel has started a coral growth project at the end of one of its lagoons and there is a collection of fish who inhabit that small area. Still this would not be a location to go to if snorkeling was your main objective for the vacation. Other than that the grounds and surrounding views are some of the most beautiful we have seen.", "offset": [907, 980], "date": "2017-01-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "a361d629-2530-41ad-a947-88bf25879ba2", "sentence": "Third Time Always a Charm. The Four Seasons Bora Bora always amazes me with their level of service and graciousness. My wife and I just came back from FS Bora Bora and we are so happy to have visited again. We visited FS Bora Bora in 2010 and 2012. We travel often and try to go to new places and resorts but there is a reason why we chose this resort for the third time. We arrived early in morning from Papeete at around 830am. Check in was easy and we were then brought the to breakfast buffet which was included in our stay. The buffet was good. There was a selection of eggs cheese bacon hash browns some Chinese breakfast items and fruit. We were offered juices and coffee as we sat down. Of course we ordered our vacation mimosas. If you wanted a specific egg dish Eggs Benedict poached eggs sunny side up etc. or waffles pancakes you would have to order from your waitress. You can even order \u201c green \u201d drinks. Everyone was very nice here and we even saw some staff that was there 5 years ago. We originally booked a beach view overwater bungalow room 304 but because I booked with my AMEX card through fine hotels and resorts we were upgraded to a mountain view room Room 215. Our new room would n\u2019t be ready until 3 pm or later but we were allowed to use our original room to freshen up after our red eye flight. They said just to leave things packed and they would have it in our other room when it was ready. After breakfast it was off to the beach. The beach had soft white sand with plenty of beach chairs. I \u2019m not sure how full the resort but the resort never felt full. The first few steps into the water were a little rocky with some old coral and shells. But after about three feet it was nothing but soft bottom and shallow bath water for up to 50 feet out. Fare Hoa is their beach bar. Last time we were there they only had the bar but recently they opened up the grill. The food was great. They had some of the freshest fish shrimp and lobster I \u2019ve ever had. And the bar staff was wonderful. Mika was one of the pool beach staff we had known for over 7 years. It was wonderful to see him and his wife Juliana again. Both great happy people. The rest of staff Raymond Heiari Lapoutre Roldolf were all very sweet to us. We also enjoyed the Polynesian show which is held on Mondays. It was a fun show. The tables are family style with food shared among the table. A cocktail and unlimited wine was available. It was a fun show with fire dancing and getting to know some of the other guests. My wife and I also enjoyed the spa a few times during our stay. My wife had both a hot stone massage and Polynesian massage during our visits. I had the Polynesian massage a few times. The experiences were wonderful. We even booked the Kahaia suite during our spa visit. It \u2019s a private room where you can have up to a 2hour massage with a facial or body scrub and foot scrub ritual. After the massage you get your own coconut milk bath overlooking a private part of the lagoon. While you get your massage there is a clear glass floor where you can look down at the fish and coral. Vaveahau and Salome were wonderful. Most nights we went to have at least one drink at the Sunset Bar. It does face the sunset as it settles behind the mountain. The cocktails and drinks were good as was the food menu. They have a sushi selection there that was fresh and tasty. Paloma one of the waitresses there was very kind and waited on us there a few times. We also did a private sunset cruise and dinner on a motu. We booked through the resort and were recommended Didier to be our guide. Didier was great. He picked us up at around 530pm in his motorized outrigger and serenaded us with his ukulele while boating toward the sunset. Drinks and beer was provided. We watched the sun go down and then we went to a private motu near the airport. He helped grill our food and even gave us a private fire dance show after dinner. Champagne and wine was included as well. This was definitely one of our highlights of the tripJust to attest the service at Four Seasons one day our bungalow has some plumbing issues to the point that we could n\u2019t stay there. We called over to reception and maintenance came quickly. The manager was called and he profusely apologized for the inconvenience. He asked if we needed help packing and then had another room all made up for us. This all happened within a span of an hour. He even sent us a bottle of wine for the inconvenience. We understand that nothing ever goes perfectly and we are so grateful that we were taken care of quickly. Thank you. Some advice for people who are visiting the first time. Definitely do the shark and ray snorkel. Its loads of fun and the sharks do n\u2019t bother you. The jet ski tour was also fun especially with a stop at the sandbar. Do not worry about what the weather report says. December through February is summer in the southern hemisphere and it is hot and humid as well as rainy. The weather report said it would rain every day. We saw no rain during the day. There were the typical tropical showers that would come through at night. Again the Four Seasons Bora Bora is a wonderful resort with great staff and management. Thank you to everyone including Mari Luis Luigi Angela Noho Heifara and everyone else. We could stay at any of the other resorts on the island but we always come back to this. We will be back.

The Four Seasons Bora Bora is probably the nicest resort my husband and I have stayed at. The people here were so friendly. Everyone. It was so relaxing and peaceful. It was truly Heaven on EarthWe spent 5 nights in a mountain view overwater bungalow. The view was fantastic. The mountain view bungalows are the same as the lagoon views \u2026 but the extra money you pay for the view is worth it. The rooms are just over 1000 square feet and have all the comforts of home with a tropical vibe all wood floors and walls. The main living area has a safe and mini refrigerator stocked with minibar items. We had the items removed from the minibar so we could use the refrigerator for our person use. There is a 42 \u201d. I think. TV in the living area. If you only speak English \u2026 your channels are very limited mostly CN International. My husband was n\u2019t happy about thatThe bathroom has 2 separate counters and sinks a separate shower separate toilet area and large soaking tub. The areas can be closed off. The bedroom had plenty of closet and drawer space and had a TV slightly smaller than the one in the living area. The bed was wonderful. So comfortable. Like sleeping on a cloudWe ate breakfast at the Tere Nui Restaurant each morning. The breakfast was included with our room rate. The buffet was pretty good but I preferred to order from the breakfast menu at no additional fee. I LOVED the Pane Perdu. So much that I had it every morning. I would get either bananas or strawberries or both along with chocolate syrup and whipped cream. Super yummy. Also you could get specialty coffees at no additional cost. We ate dinner at the Sunset Restaurant Bar a couple of times. It is an Asian sushi restaurant and the food was excellent. We attended the Polynesian Show. Unfortunately for us rain was predicted that evening and the show was held inside the Tere Nui Restaurant. I think that really took away from the enjoyment of the show as it was supposed to be on a beach on the lagoon. It would have been so much nicer outdoors. Of course weather is not the resort \u2019s fault. We took the resort \u2019s boat into town two times. Once to go into town to see what was there not much and pick up some snacks. The second time was to go to Bloody Mary \u2019s Restaurant see my review on Bloody Mary \u2019s. The resort does charge for this service. Apparently it was free a year ago. Well \u2026 now it is quite expensive. 250 XPF 22 during the day 4250 XPF 38 during the evening round trip per adult. That was an unpleasant surprise. The WIFI at the resort is great. Excellent reception throughout the resort. I do n\u2019t believe I had any problem at all. It also was free. You could pay for an upgraded plan but when we checked in they told us we would n\u2019t need it unles we were going to download movies. Four Seasons has a great mobile phone ap to use while you are at the resort. You can even check it out before you get there. You can order Room Service schedule a buggy pickup schedule spa treatments request room maintenance just about everything you need. Check it out. It was really usefulOur flight from Bora Bora did n\u2019t leave until around 7 pm and we had to vacate our bungalow at 120 pm as a guest was already booked into our bungalow. We did n\u2019t like not having a \u201c home \u201d for nearly 6 hours but they were able to accommodate us in their \u201c Transit Room \u201d. It was small but had a little living room and a nice bathroom. We really appreciated that we had a place to hang out when we needed to. The resort was totally awesome but even the best can be improved. The one thing we found that needed improvement was the ladders going into the water from the overwater bungalows. Because we are older adults we found it difficult getting into and out of the water from the bungalow. There is a nice wooden ladder going into the water but once it is in the water it becomes metal tubes which are very slippery because of the algae. I understand the metal and algae. But because they were tube shaped and not flat like pool ladders it was very very hard keep your feet on them. Maybe as time goes by the resort will replace the tubes with flatter steps.", "offset": [2918, 3049], "date": "2017-03-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "be4a1d25-bfd2-49bf-baaa-3a10636f0d12", "sentence": "Bora Bora Four Seasons overwater bungalow.

It was a dream come true to stay at the Four Seasons recently for our 20th wedding anniversary. In my view the hotel has the best location in all of Bora Bora. We stayed in an OTW bungalow on the west pontoon with a view of Mt Otemanu. My recommendation is be specific with the type of view you want and how close far you want to be to the pool beach and restaurants. Also the beach and lagoon view bungalows may be more suitable for people who want to be in shallower water. All staff are wonderfully friendly and we never encountered anyone who did not greet us with a genuinely happy Ia orana. Our package included daily breakfast. I thought there was a great selection of food every morning traditional American continental acai bowls and Asian food. I had an outstanding Polynesian massage from Carolyn. Tip you do not have to have a treatment at the spa in order to use the spa facilities such as the steam room and outdoor relaxation pool. Just ask at the spa reception desk. The concierges handled our restaurant reservations and excursion bookings very well. Now even though this property is excellent there is room for improvement and here are some things I think can be improved the golf carts can be a bit of a menace. Some of the staff zoom around in them particularly by the spa and the chapel and while they slow down and allow you to pass there is not a lot of room on the walkways to the pontoons for a golf cart and a person. I am not a big person but even I found it to be a tight squeeze. I understand that golf carts are a necessity for staff and to transport guests with mobility issues so I can not offer a solution to this the food is not up to the standard that I would expect at a Four Seasons. We tried all 3 restaurants and found the Fare Hoa suited us best. The seafood selection for two is outstanding as is the tuna poke and mahi mahi ceviche there were a few things on our final bill that were incorrect and it took several emails to several different people before it was resolved. Given the level of service we enjoyed while we were at the resort we were surprised that management was slow to respond to questions about our bil now to the insect issue. I understand that insects are a reality in tropical paradises and I also realize that spraying is what allows guests to believe that the insects do not exist. We noticed termite shavings in the living room and bathroom on our second day. By the third day they had moved to the bedroom. I will say that management dealt with this quickly by spraying and protecting our bed from the termites. However by the next morning we still had termites. As a result we were upgraded to another OTW bungalow for the balance of our stay. It is unfortunate but it seems that termites are an issue at all the resorts read the reviews of other resorts on TripAdvisor and I thought long and hard about whether this would change my rating of the hotel. One of our tour guides told us that the roofs are covered with pandamus leaves and they have a shelf life of 7 10 years before the termites come. All in all this was a trip of a lifetime and I look forward to returning once the Four Seasons completes a massive renovation.", "offset": [3090, 3216], "date": "2017-07-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "1b2b124d-8099-4d42-8d06-6d932884f06d", "sentence": "One of the largest resorts in Bora Bora.

We did not stay at Four Seasons but just visited for the day to renew our vows here. The whole day was meticulously organised by Ranihei with whom we had been corresponding over a number of months. She is not only really great at her job but also a genuinely lovely and kind person. We arrived early morning and discussed the itinerary with Ranihei after enjoying a Polynesian welcome with leis and drinks. Our son also received a soft toy gift which was a lovely gesture. We had Maya the babysitter look after our son for some of the day and she was fantastic with him. My husband and I then went off to enjoy the amazing spa for a couple of hours. And it truly was the most fantastic spa facility I have ever been to. We felt thoroughly relaxed after our couples massage. Our son then rejoined us for lunch at the Fare Hoa beach restaurant. The food there was very tasty and more competitively priced than at St Regis where we were staying. They also offered free table water which did not happen at St Regis. I then went off to have my hair and make up done while Ranihei had kindly reserved a beach cabana for my husband and son to while away some time. The actual vow renewal was beyond romantic and all the little requests that I had made were accommodated. It was very moving indeed. If I had to criticise anything it would be that my hair was not quite styled the way I had wanted it. I had tried the hair style out with a hair stylist back home so it was not like it would not have been possible. I also feel I could have been advised that there was not enough time to have photos taken in quite as many locations as I had asked for. That way I could have managed my expectations beforehand and prioritised accordingly. However the overall experience was absolutely amazing and I am glad we had our special day here rather than anywhere else. Our son was gifted a ukulele upon departure and yet another soft toy whilst we received shell necklaces. I would thoroughly recommend the Four Seasons as THE place in Bora Bora for a wedding or vow renewal. it is not cheap but the memories are priceless.", "offset": [1191, 1296], "date": "2018-10-22", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "24e16b37-dc71-4c4a-8550-4e5f4d12b4f5", "sentence": "Magical place. As others have reviewed the word magical comes to mind for us after our visit. Bora Bora has been on our bucket list and it lived up to our expectations especially the Four Seasons. For us the service staff really made the trip one of our best trips ever. The notable staff from our trip were many but a few stood out above all. Fanaura and Keoma from the Beach restaurant Cinzia from the Sunset Bar and the entire beach and pool staff were truly top notch. What made it great was that they all knew us well from our daily routines to the quirks of our food preferences or drink preferences. The attention to detail was amazing and they always went out of their way. Others have also noted that if you are staying a bit longer the food options can get hard given that there are only a few options but if you are a fish eater then you have to try the poison cru. no doubt you will end up eating this amazing dish multiple times during your stay. A few tips from our trip. If you do not like to walk more than 15 minutes try to get the bungalows closer to the restaurants I think East but the bungalows in the 100 20s. Also if you want to jump off your bungalow get rooms that are a bit further out as the water is deeper. If you have little ones and do not want the water too deep but still want to jump in we were in the mid teens 100 rooms and it was perfect roughly 9 12 feet deep and the walk to the restaurants and activity centers was only 5 minutes. We had a mountain view and would highly recommend it it really is an amazing way to greet the day first thing in the morning and see that magical mountain. A few other things we wish we knew ahead of our trip. The resort supplies sunscreen but be careful it can stain lighter swim trunks. You do not need to bring floaties they have plenty for guests and its free however they occasionally run out so if you want to guarantee one just bring one and you can leave it with the resort. Also they provide snorkeling equipment and flippers. The water activity center also provides stand up boards and coral shoes for free as well. Be sure to go check out the lagoon area near the spa and gym. The resort has done an amazing job rebuilding a coral reef located in the interior of the resort with lots of amazing fish for guests to go snorkeling. At the concierge pick up some fish food and bring it and you will see all sorts of amazing fish that will flock you as soon as you get in the water. The concierge was fantastic in helping us book trips outside the resort. We did the snorkeling with fish stingrays and sharks and would highly recommend it to anyone. We were hesitant at first because of the sharks but it is really tame. The sharks are black tips and lemon sharks the process was simple you just let them know what day and you show up at the dock and they take you on your trip and bring you back. The only issue we encountered on the whole trip was the gym. Since I am an early riser maybe its the A C does not kick on till 7 am but it was never on and I could not get it to turn on making the work outs really hot. But it was just a minor minor issue also if you are an exercise person the gym has 2 bikes 4 treadmills free weights and a few machines that are fairly modern and updated.", "offset": [3094, 3265], "date": "2018-12-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "717008bb-dd9a-406e-b13f-90f29ff94374", "sentence": "Four Seasons Bora Bora needs a renovation asap.

Absolutely beautiful. The colors of the sea are unreal and no photos will do justice to the clarity and beauty of the waters surrounding all of Bora Bora motus. From the first greeting at the airport the service personnel was outstanding. They called us by our names after the initial encounter. Our OWB was perfectly situated for us seniors not too far out on the pontoon but with a wonderful private plunge pool and best views of the mountain on the main island. The bungalow was huge 110 sq ft spread out in three rooms living room and bedroom separated by a huge open bathroom. The huge soaking tub had large picture windows with that fabulous mountain view. there were also separate huge shower and WC \u201c rooms \u201d. We enjoyed nightly cocktails bring some liquor on our large terrace after a swim in the lagoon. The bungalow was very clean and serviced twice daily and had all the amenities needed for a pampered stay. We ate lunch every day at the Pool bar restaurant either at tables on the beach or inside roomy and shady cabanas. There were plenty of chaise loungers and cabanas for everyone in the pool areas. The pool service people were the best so friendly and constantly refreshing us with iced water the \u201c house \u201d water is filtered so no need to buy water here. The food was very good and quite reasonable. One just has to look out for racking up huge bills for drinks cocktails are priceyWe partook the Polynesian dinner and show here on Mondays every week and were quite impressed with the quality of food and the free flowing of wines all evening. Everyone \u2019s wine glass was refilled immediately. You eat family style at tables of ten and it was fun to meet fellow guests from different parts of the uSA and the world. We also ate at the beach bar for their BQ night food was okay and very reasonably priced for the buffet. Dessert offerings could be improved. Daily breakfast at Tera Nui Restaurant was outstanding. The crepes were better than ones I \u2019ve had in France. Plenty of food and beverage choices to satisfy any palate. I also appreciated breakfast opening at 630 am for us early risers. We also used the Fitness Center daily. What better way to work out than with magnificent ocean views. Enough machines and other equipment. One can get rides everywhere by golf carts especially since the Spa Fitness Center Complex is on the ocean side of the resort and a bit of a walk from the pontoons.

Loved Bora Bora and certainly aspects of the FS but major failures at the resort. Brief outline of isues1. Bugs in room. Hotel notified. Room sprayed. Smelled like pesticide. 2 of us developed rashes broke out. 2. Terrible food experience at Sunset grill. Over an hour wait for cold undercoked appetizers. Food came out at separate Times. Kids were done eating and left before I even got my lukewarm food. Second visit better. Final visit not good also lukewarm food slow my entree came 15 minutes after everyone else had eaten. Kids had left for movie night. 3. Polynesian diner requested gluten free shellfish allergy meal for daughter. Daughter receives bento box. Staff comes back 5 minutes later after she has eaten part of it and tells her not to eat it and that they made a mistake. Staff Leaves. No one comes back or being her food. I have to hunt down a manager to get her a dish. My food was cold and remaining food at table eaten. 4. Front desk is not friendly. At all. Very disinterested and aloof. Check in experience was awful. We wished we had considered St Regis. 5. Carts are in disrepair and break down. 6. Not nearly enough carts. Wait times 10 20 minutes. 7. Wood on overwater deck is rotting and falling apart in areas8. Spa facilities are very small and dated. Steam room broke off and on. It was either cold or ridiculously hot. Unusable. No dry sauna. Coed hot tub and steam room bizarre for this level of resort. Men \u2019s locker room tiny. Needs complete renovation expansion and modernization. 10. Told I would be contacted by upper management during our stay but no one reached out. 11. Breakfast bufet. Too small for resort size. One person making omelets and waffles for entire resort. Long wait times. 12. Food options are limited. Need a complete overhaul of restaurants and more variety. 13. Resort needs more daily activities. Can be slow when you do n\u2019t get out on water. Look at level of engagement at FS Costa Rica14. About half of cart drivers appeared annoyed and to hate their jobs. The rest were great. I was at four seasons Costa Rica in March. It was spectacular. Pretty much perfect. FS Bora Bora could learn a lot from that property. Additional comments Ca n\u2019t get over the bugs in the rom the spraying resulted in the room smelling for days. Who knows what we were exposed too. The inability to handle gluten and shellfish allergy diet restrictions was hugely difficult and hazardous to guest safety. Our dining experiences were pathetic to be frank. The failure of management to contact us was weak. Shuttle to main island at night was a bit in the scary side. It did not feel safe. My kids did not like it. Positives Pool staff and service great as was room service. Concierge we and spa staff were fantastic. Spa treatment rooms fantastic. Pool area and cabanas great. Amazing unbelievable stunning location and views. The water is unlike anything I have ever seen. Snorkeling and scuba were incredible. Pick up at airport and transport was great. Overwater bungalow was beautiful large well laid out but the bugs. Overall I would return to Bora Bora but would would look into other properties. I know FS can do better.

My husband and I recently spent 4 nights in one of the Mt Otemanu View OWBs without pool and had a lovely stay. The property grounds are amazing and vast with lots of beautiful spaces including various beach options to take in. The restaurants were all very good see seperate reviews. The service was mostly amazing but there were a couple of exceptions to this. At breakfast one morning I asked about ferry shuttle times to Vaitape and was told I needed to see concierge for that. This was not ideal as I did not want to abandon my breakfast table to run along to Concierge which was not nearby. Another member of staff did come along to let me know ferry times which was great. I do understand the difference between wait staff and concierge but some basic enquiries should be able to be addressed by all staff throughout the resort. Breakfasts were good with a great selection at the buffet. The restaurants were all great in terms of food. Service was a bit iffy at Sunset at first and the Pool Bar see seperate reviews. We loved the pool area and the polside service was good except on the one occasion I went up to the bar. As long as we stayed on our loungers and interacted with the very good waiter we got to know we were fine. At the bar where they did not recognise us they were hopeless. I just stood there and was ignored even once all other orders customers were finished with very poor form and totally out of keeping with the service in other restaurants and the resort in general. The pool temp was perfect. We never did ask what it was but I suspect aprox 2829 degrees. it was lovely. The rooms beautiful but getting tired and I can see why they are renovating. The decor is lovely but the revamp is needed from a maintenance perspective as some fittings fixtures furniture are showing their age in regards to wear and tear. When needing transport around the resort the buggies or golf carts were often a little later than ideal. Great that this service is available but sometimes just quicker to walk. I agree with some previous TA reviews that the reception area needs a revamp. I would say the same of some of the public bathromsWe did a couple of excursions. Lagoon Discovery. Denis was a great guide and we both loved it even though I am very conservative in my snorkeling and hubby would have liked to be more adventurous. Denis was brilliant and so was the beautiful lagoon. Jet Ski we did the tour around the BB mainland with lunch at Matira Beach Restaurant incl. The tour and the food at MBR were both amazing. House keeping was mostly great but I did have an issue with getting more face cloths. HK stopped leaving them in the bathroom for some reason and it took about 5 requests from me over 2 days to get more. At one point following a request for more face cloths room service turned up with diet cokes. This was a language barrier issue really frustrating for me but also for them I suspect. We got there in the end. There is a free laundry which was fantastic especially as we were in BB for 8 days. The gym was excellent but needs improved air con. Air con in the rooms was very good and nice and quiet. I did not use the spa so can not comment on that. One of my biggest tips for future guests would be to make the most of the Ap. We communicated with 4S quite a bit pre stay and soon learnt that responses via the Ap were instant vs e mail which could take a few days. I had no language barrier issues with the ap or e mail. Once in the resort my advice would be to keep using the ap rather than picking up the phone. The phones were odd and the language barrier was an issue at times. On the ap no problems at all so do make the most of it. Only negative comment re the ap which some one else has already commented on in their TA review is that on arrival we did not receive the notification via ap that our room was ready. We were supposed to be alerted via the ap but were not. did not bother us however as we were enjoying taking it all in and having a delicious lunch at Fare Hoa. Construction noise was evident at times but minimal. There is no way they will be finished by Oct as currently stated on their websitecanot wait to go back and see how the renovations turned out. I have a couple of other suggestions for 4S re guest comunicationI loved the itinerary print out thank youWhat would have been even better would be a little note about what to take not to take on an excursion left in the guests room night before excursion. As an example we did not know for sure if we could take our mobile phones on the jet ski tour. and when I called to find out it was not all that easy to find out. Weather forecasts for following day left in guests rooms each nightMini bar. the pre mixed cocktails did not have a price. so the mini bar menu price list needs to be updated. One other tip. totally do the Polynesian Dinner show. We would not normally go for this kind of thing but we did and the food was great and so was the entertainment. Highly recommend this and it will be one of the cheaper dining experiences at the resort. The French Restaurant was outrageously expensive we still loved it though. so it was nice to have a cheap option for one of the nights we were there.

The Four Seasons Bora Bora is by far the most beautiful and amazing resort we have ever stayed at. I have never experienced such impeccable hospitality anywhere and that is saying a lot. My husband and I travel frequently and have stayed in some really great 5 star resorts see my other reviews for great places to visit. From the moment we arrived until the very last moment of being on the departure boat we were treated like royalty. The staff is unbelievably friendly and everyone goes above and beyond. We had a few conversations with staff members about how they ended up there and they all shared how happy they were to be there and how they felt the Four Seasons cared about their happiness. That must have a lot to do with their enthusiasm to treat the guests so well. On arrival we were greeted by name no idea how she knew it was us advised our room was ready we arrived prior to their check in time escorted to a golf cart and taken to our over the water bungalow to check in in our room. She showed us around our beautiful room and there was even a bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us in honor of our anniversary. Now that is a way to start off your vacation. The room was beautiful of course. Flawless. Never in my life have I seen water so blue. Everything about the room was pure luxury. Not one single complaint. we were impressed by it all. The food in the restaurants was great room service was great the drinks at the bar were great. The massages were great. The yoga class was great. The concierge was great. The gym was great. We enjoyed five days of bliss. We were even given a late check out upon request since our boat leaving for the airport was not until after 4 pm. This gave us practically a whole extra day of vacation. The resort is undergoing renovations right now so there was a daily resort credit given which was a nice touch. The renovations were not an issue at all. The only bummer for this trip was the wind which can not be helped but it did make it so we could not go swimming off of our balcony. I am sure they would have fixed that if they could have ha. We were there on an off week of weather. Even so the lagoon beach and pool were all swimable and none of them were nearly as windy so it did not take away from our enjoyment at all. It was a nice touch to see the staff waving goodbye to us as our boat departed for the airport. It reminded us of our parents waving goodbye every time we visit. Honestly I can not rave enough about this place. Yes it is crazy expensive I am pretty sure everything is on Bora Bora as they have to bring everything to the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

My wife and I took a vacation here to celebrate our delayed honeymoon 10 years and 3 kids later and it was so much better than we could have ever imagined. We have a few friends who have stayed here and they raved about the experience but even still they undersold it. When I began arranging the trip back in July 2019 I contacted American Express Platinum travel and they informed me that the hotel was undergoing an extensive renovation and would n\u2019t be up to speed until December. This put a hitch in our original plans because we wanted to visit in November. However we pivoted and made the necessary adjustments to visit in December. To us this meant that the resort would be in top form and believe me it wasUpon arriving the hotel picked us up in a boat and whisked us off to the resort. The flight wets the appetite but this boat ride really gets the adventure going. The \u201c only \u201d not positive moment was the check in process. We had to wait a few hours before our room was ready but in the end it was well worth the wait. We stayed in the Otamanu bungalow which resort employees remarked a few times is the best bungalow in the entire resort and it did not disappoint. Once we opened the door any negative feelings about the wait were forgotten quickly because 1 the views were beyond what words can describe and 2part of the set up process was making sure that our room was customized to our liking organized through the four seasons ap before arrival and they even acknowledged our celebration with a hand written card a bottle of champagne and a delicious chocolate treat. I do n\u2019t want to drag this on too much longer but I needed to at least acknowledge the way they made us feel special from the moment we got onto the water transport. So I \u2019l be brief now. The bungalows are incredible. The food at all the restaurants is very very delicious. The breakfast is a real highlight do n\u2019t skip breakfast. But the best part is the service. The Four Seasons brand makes service their core principle and it shows and you genuinely feel it.
