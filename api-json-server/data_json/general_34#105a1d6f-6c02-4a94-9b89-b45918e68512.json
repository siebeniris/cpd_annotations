There are several off site restaurants and shops a short cab ride away. Drove up to Palm Springs one afternoon and it was a 20 minute trip along the mountains.

We checked in tired after a long hot day. They gave us the key to our room and we went up after walking forever to get there as is sometimes the case in these big box hotels. We walked in. Wet towels all over the bathroom floor along with toilet paper toothpaste used soap. An unmade bed with sheets and pillows thrown everywhere. Clearly not a room to have been given to anyone. After half an hour they found us another room on a lower floor with a view of the parking lot instead of our previous view of grassy hills and palms. They were of course. so sorry. but this was the best they could do. The front desk person asked if there was anything else they could do so we could have a great stay. i said yes of course get us the same type of room we were promised but one that was not filthy. This they could not do nor could they think of anything else to make our stay better.

Our goal was to visit Palm Springs and virtually all the good hotel were sold out except this one. It was about a 20 minute or so drive to Palm Springs. The entrance to the hotel is impressive as well as the lobby. Checking in experience though a bit lengthy due to the number of guest checking was acceptable as they had people attend to you during your wait. That was a nice touch. Parking was ok though the structure could use some TLC. The challenge one has going from the parking structure is that there are not good directional signs. We had no clue where to go and went into various dead ends. Eventually we walked across the pool area to get to the building where our room was located. It was a bit of hike doors to stairs were not clearly marked as stairs and hallways were convoluted. Hint do not try to get to the lobby via hallways. Just walk outdoors to get your bearings. We did get a room overlooking the pool. It was a nice room but expected a little more for JW. As noted by other the room furniture and look was a bit dated but not too bad. The food and drinks were fine. Regarding the pool one has to get down and claim it with towels or some personal item as the good lounge chair get taken. We were at the pool at 10 am on Sunday and barely found two chairs in the back. On Saturday the pool bar closes really early and the staff cleaning up really did want you around though the pool was still open. The onsite nightclub has a small dance floor. They had a promotion claiming wear white and the entrance is free. It was a bit disingenuous that there was fine print that you had to be completely in white. The club got really crowded. For those of you that are joggers the grounds look beautiful but you are not allowed to run anywhere on the premises. However you can run on the public sidewalk that is outside and encircles the property which is about a 3 to 4 mile run. The rooms bathroom bed and TV were ok. Unfortunately on our last night pranksters pulled the fire alarm at 2 am in our building. They were caught and we were given a discount which was appreciated. To sum it up the executive staff were great the clean up crews were a bit focused on getting their job done and they let you know it rooms ok. facilities ok and pool great just could be open longer.

Arrived early and we very happy to get a room right away. Pleasant room. nothing exceptional but not disappointing. The bedding had a small tear in the sheets.

Water temperature in shower not hot enough. Another little annoyance and not what one would expect at a hotel like this. The balcony had some plants that were filled with cigarette butts. To management we were in room 4124 go look at the balcony and the shower head. These did not ruin our trip and we did not want to complain but they were little annoyances. Our dining experience was also less than we expected for what we were paying. While the venue was very pleasant especially outside dining the execution was barely adequate. Our first meal lunch outside at Rockwod Grill was a huge disappointment. Service was extremely slow and inefficient. Food quality was poor with mistake after mistake. The first morning there was a 30 minute wait at the Rockwod Grill for buffet breakfast and the hostess was sour. Many people were heading out to the tennis match or had other plans and were very unhappy to have to wait for breakfast. This was particularly annoying because there were many empty tables. How could they not be prepared for a breakfast rush on a busy day tennis tournament. Especially when it is bufetOne of the main reasons we were willing to pay a premium to stay at the JW was the shuttle service to the tournament. Of our 6 shuttle trips back and forth 5 were very positive. Unfortunately on Saturday morning when the bus was scheduled to pick up at the hotel at 1035 there were over 120 people waiting for a bus that did not arrive until 110. Further upsetting us and other hotel guests was the poor handling of this by a hotel representative. This Mariot employee came out and told us that he had no idea when the bus would be arriving that only the first 54 would get on the bus and that would only be if the bus was not carrying other passengers. He made it very clear that none of this was either the responsibility or the fault of the Mariot. He said that there would only be one bus per hour which was contrary to what the bus drivers told us. we were told that if needed buses would be added. We were all left having to figure out other ways to get to the tennis grounds. His attitude was not customer service friendly or helpful. This was more than a little annoyance and we ended up taking an Uber. It was not so much having to pay for the car service but the attitude of the hotel. All in all we had a great trip and did not let any of these little annoyances ruin it. but it did make us decide that next year we will stay at a different hotel where we will be able to receive better value and a better experience.

I want to say that after reading the reviews I was told to be sure to request one of the renovated rooms. As a former Starwod and now Bonvoy gold member about to approach the next level I was very disappointed in the rooms. I asked at check in for one of the renovated rooms. I said I did n\u2019t care about the views. I was assured that we were in a renovated room. We walked in and it did n\u2019t look new but we shrugged it off. Later that night I had to ask them something at the front desk and asked if we were in a renovated room and was told no. The next day we asked to be moved and was. The old beds felt like sleeping on a wooden board. I have no idea how old they were but definitely need to be replaced. The new beds were much better. The problem with the new rooms were the wood or laminate floors on the perimeter of the room carried a lot of residual sound on them from the floors above. Someone was walking on the floors above at 6 am and it was very loud and woke us in our room below. Installing cork would have reduced the sound from the room above. We work in property management and own and operate multiple vacation rentals. I think the hotel is way below the standard for the price they are charging. In addition if Bonvoy is reading this your merger does not offer the same value in awards or value as when it was just Starwod. You are following in the footsteps of the airlines and I \u2019m not sure you may have us as members in the future. In addition we usually receive an email asking us how our stay at the hotels were. No surprise this time that we were n\u2019t sent an opinion request. Maybe they already know and do n\u2019t want to hear it.

This JW Mariot is absolutely amazing. My wife and I stayed here in February for her birthday and in May for mine. We just absolutely loved both of our stays. In February it was busy but not crowded. In May it was definitely crowded especially since it was Memorial Day weekend. But that did not stop us from having a blast. The rooms were newly renovated and they are currently working on finishing the entire resort. There are 2 Championship golf courses on the property. They gave a large pool area for everyone and a smaller more secluded family pool. They have a day spa on the property which has their own pool. Lots of shops and little boutiques. There is also eagle riders which rentsnout motorcycles. There are tons of restaurants on site making it so you never have to leave. They have casual and more formal options. There is also a Starbucks which was just opened as a full store location instead of a kiosk as it was before. They have lots of self parking and a valet option. The staff have always been friendly and knowledgeable. There are so many options in the Palm Springs area but for a few minutes further thisnresort is well worth it. This is an absolute amazing property. In the lobby they have a restaurant bar and even a lake with gondolas running in the evenings. There start in the lobby and go around the large lake surrounding the hotel. There was wind in February which stopped the gondolas and a long line in May. So we will have to come back and visit again. We were both very impressed and we will definitely be back. I highly recommend this property to everyone.

You can tell she cares very deeply for these birds. span pool attendants very attentive printing at business center was expensive but employee was very helpful sunset boat tour was awesome and free. Cons my first room was not the best it was overlooking the mikado restaurant and was kind of smelly from the food cooking and noisy from music at the restaurant. But they quickly moved me to a better room and I had a great stay. So if you are not happy just ask to see another room. waitress at the spa bistro provided very very slow service and was not particularly attentive pools were so hot that it was not possible to swim laps for a workout. It was like swimming in a hot tub. The weather was very hot 16 18 F during the day but as they say it was a dry heat and did n\u2019t slow me down from enjoying the resort.

The pool scene was crazy good thing. That is where we spent most of our days and in fact our kids missed most of the daily activities because they would not get enough of the pool.

The front desk was gracious enough to change my room if I wanted to but then suggested that I take The shortcut to the room which is which indeed was a shortcut and much more pleasant. Would of been nice to of shared the shortcut up front. Second the door to the hall did not close initially and needed to have housekeeping come and apply different types of lubricants to fix.
