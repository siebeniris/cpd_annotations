Arrived for sons wedding and sat on chairs in garden most of which were cobwebed and had to be dusted off first. Staff did not call us through to wedding room until last moment when bride had arrived and was sitting waiting in car. Red carpet used in this room was cheap and easily curled up when walked upon causing difficulty for elderly and children. Food average. The party consisted of nearly 50 and the catering was not able to supply just cooked food. Chicken main course was really dry. Shortcake was hard on desert. Bar in lounge small with mostly one bar staff member. With 100 people at evening celebrations this meant long waits. Cost of drinks at bar were extortionate. Some people brought drinks in their cars because of this overcharging. 1 pint cost \u00a3 450My dry martini and lemonade was \u00a3 650. Glass of wine \u00a3 8. Some people went to supermarket to buy drinks during the evening. Not godStaf could have been happier and more courtious after all this meant big income for the hotel.

Just returned after a wedding at this place. The hotel is dated and I think the furniture curtains and decor look like it has not been updated since the building was built. Our room 105 was the size of a shoebox. The net curtains were filthy and the window frame was rotten. We arrived late evening on a Thursday and having already looked up the hotel we noticed that they did food or room service so decided to eat at the hotel when we arrived. We asked the older gentleman who I presume was the Night Porter first of all for a cocktail off the menu and his blunt reply was we do not serve cocktails after 11 pm not when I am on shift so that got our backs up I then asked if we could order food to be told by the same really happy in his job older gentleman. no the kitchens closed I could probably do a cheese sandwich so we had to order a delivery from a local takeaway. This night porter was rude and unhelpful the total opposite of Nigel I think his name was the barman that was on before could not have been more accommodating. The Reception Staff were polite and helpful. We soon went to bed which was obviously what the night porter was wanting us to do. Breakfast was nothing less than poor and again the lady that served us was miserable and unhelpful. The bread felt stale and was hard the yoghurt with berries and I think it was meant to be granola was also soft and stale. We did not even bother to go to breakfast the second morning in fact we could not wait to check out. Overall food is extremely bland and vastly overpriced drink prices are extortionate. There are no little touches and it feels like your typical chain hotel just wanting your money. Had it not been for staying there for a wedding we would have gone home. There is no way that I would return there vile place. 4 hotel I think not it felt like Fawlty Towers but not amusing.", "offset": [1093, 1176], "date": "2015-10-17 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "3ba0d893-ca4c-46b0-8919-09687213c970", "sentence": "I would like to make a complaint about my stay at this hotel and would request a Full Refund of all monies paid for the following reasonsA double room was booked \u2013. on arrival I was given a room key to room 28 when I got to the room it was a single room \u2013 Not what I booked and paid for. I went back to reception and was told that as the heating was not working and all rooms booked had been reallocated to rooms with heaters and no other rooms were available. I was not given any info about this heating issue or to have the chance to book a hotel elsewhere. On check out there was no apology no enquiry of how my stay had been and no mention of the issues I raise in this complaint. On check in I was told that food was being served only in the bar area as the heating was n\u2019t working however there were heaters in the bar. The room door was not secure and did n\u2019t lock shut and could be just pushed open \u2013 I called reception and that had to be fixed as I had valuables in my room. When ordering my evening meal the barman stated in conversation and I quote \u201c that at first it had n\u2019t been too bad with the heating being off but I thought by now we would have had to close \u201d which suggests to me that at the time of booking the heating was already off. There were only two small electric fan heaters heating the bar area totally inadequate for the size of the room \u2013 I had to sit in my coat as it was too cold without. The Fish Chips and Peas I ordered were n\u2019t much better with the chips almost cold amp mushy peas being mashed up garden peas. The \u00a3 13 price tag in my opinion over the top. None of the staff asked me if the meal was OK they all seemed to be keeping their distance. I arrived at around 6 pm and still at 130 pm I was in my room sat in my coat as the heater too so long to heat the room. The small bathroom \u2013 no hot water out of the taps although the shower did thankfully have hot waterThe toilet was almost unusable the front of it was about 4 inches from the bath which meant no one could get to the front of the toilet.

Your staff were always polite and well mannered. However we found our stay somewhat comical and I have been meaning to email your staff team to make you aware of the events that we experienced during our stay. We stayed in the Burton Upon Trent Mercure Hotel as part of the Burton Brewery Tour Package. It stated as part of our package that we would receive a Free 3 Course Meal on the first night of our arrival. I wanted to bring to your attention that is impossible to have a 3 course meal within the \u00a3 22 per person limit that is set on the menu within this hotel. Naturally as I am well accustomed and experienced within the Catering business I understand the need to set a limit on such offers. But it is physically impossible to have a 3 course meal within this limit therefore I wanted to bring to your attention that your advertising of a Free 3 course meal on our first night of arrival was a falsely advertised. As we sat down for this meal it was very politely explained to us that we could be in for a long wait as the hotel had a large party in another room nicely done and understood. Breakfast on our first morning. Again we were politely told that breakfast could be delayed as the chef was not expecting so many people I am not sure how a chef does not know how many covers to expect in a hotel but again the waiter was very polite and we were in no rush so this was not a problem. However the Waiter was not busy on this morning and therefore I feel there was no excuse for the following. There were no glasses or plates to allow us to help ourselves to toast and juice and there was also a shortage of pastries the breakfast table looked to be very lacking. When our waiter came to take our order we were also informed that the chef did not have time to serve us scrambled eggs bizarre is it not. Especially when we were offered omelet as an alternative. We were also served what I can only presume were tinned mushrooms. And potentially microwaved bacon. So breakfast was Okay at a push certainly not that of a 4 establishment. Our experience of breakfast on the second morning was very similar. Although to be fair there were glasses and plates on the buffet table and we were offered scrambled egg. We were once again warned of a possible delay there was a lack of food available on the buffet table and when we received our long await scrambled eggs they strangely were not seasoned. This just added to the chuckle that we were having about the service within the hotel. We stayed for a very comfortable 2 nights at the Burton Mercure. However as we approached reception to check out the lady receiving us stated You just need to settle your drinks bill. As we checked in we had been asked if we wanted to add a card to our account for any such transactions or if we were going to pas as we go as it were. We selected the pay as you go option. The confusion came from our first night within the hotel. During our not so free 3 course meal we were sharing the dinning room with a large family table. Due to the delay in the service the children on that table had become quite irritable. After experiencing them playing hide and seek throughout our dinner my partner and I asked our waiter if we could retire to our rooms to finish our drinks. He explained to us that this would not be a problem at all. So we settled our meal bill including the drinks and continued upstairs. We can therefore only presume that the receptionist was trying to charge us for a second time for the drinks that were purchased on the first night. Fortunately as we were starting to explain this to her our waiter appeared in the reception area he confirmed the story and the receptionist apologised and we moved on. There are 2 things that would concern me about this if I was the owner of this hotel. Firstly you have a system in place that ensures your guest sign for any drinks that are put onto a rooms bill we did not sign for any drinks so this should have been investigated further before a paying customer was challenged. Secondly the waiter who we are very pleased came to our aid did not know that we had not purchased more drinks during our stay. And I have to say we certainly felt like our privacy had been invaded. We all appreciate the quick clean that your room gets in between your stay but for the cleaners to tell reception incorrectly that you have not been charged for drinks that had been sent to your room. I am presuming it was the cleaners that had this conversation. Otherwise someone else mush have been in the room and wrongly jumper to the same conclusion. I am sure you can appreciate none of the above ruined our stay. We had a clean quiet room and with it an enjoyable stay. However my partner and I had many conversations throughout of visit about how your hotel could achieve the 4s that it is awarded with such shabby service. We wondered when you were given that 4 rating and if you would achieve it again in the near future.", "offset": [3072, 3158], "date": "2016-04-07 15:19:56", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "c1806df9-edec-4554-a9b9-6c76c1dff52e", "sentence": "Truly appalling customer care.

However this did us a favour as the food at the Boot in Repton was so superior to the hotel. Also due to the coach party breakfast service on Saturday was a disaster with items not available and a long wait for those we asked for. The member of staff serving in the bar on Friday night was surly to the point of rudeness. The room was very hot and there was no air conditioning as stated in your hotel description and the controls on the shower were difficult to operate as they were stiff due to age and the non slip service in the bottom of the bath was inadequate.
