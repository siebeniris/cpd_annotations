Stayed here for 10 nights end of June July. A luxury hotel with lots of space to relax. We booked 2 rooms overlooking pool with a sea view. Rooms were lovely and spacious with an enormous bed which was very comfy. Staff were very friendly and always willing to help. We took advantage of the hotels water sports facilities and tried watersking and jet skiing extra cost. Jet skiing was great fun but in hindsight the water was too rough for skiing and their rquipment was not that great either. The foyer and bar area was luxurious and could not be faulted. Service was impeccable as I would expect from a luxury hotel. Cocktails were lovely and always came with free snacks which was a nice touch. Wifi was a bit of a pain you could prepay or access it in the foyer for free 1 hour. Once we accessed the wifi we could use it in our room until the hour was up. Our room was directly above the foyer so I do not know if this would apply to all rooms. Our rep was quite pushy we booked with love holidays and we realised too late that we could have saved a lot of money on excursions elsewhere. We booked a day cruise to Gozo Comino and paid extra to visit caves in a speed boat which was worth the extraBreakfast was included think this is standard in Malta and offered all the usual choices omelettes were nice. We tried different restaurants each night and as a family of two adults 2 teens spent a small fortune on food even with a few budget meals at Burger King and McDonalds. The weather was perfect for me wall to wall sunshine with a lovely cooling breeze. We spent much of the time between the two main pool areas. We did go in the sea a few times via the beach or ladders but the sea was quite rough and rocks were painful on the feet. The water is lovely and clear and fish can be seen swimming around. We never had to worry about getting up early for a sunbed which was heaven. There was always loads available and you never felt crowded. We were given fresh towels every day. Though this was a nice touch I would have been happy to continue using the same one for a few days. The hotel is a wedding venue and the pool areas looked stunning when decorated. There was not much in the way of daytime entertainment for adults when I asked about this was told that there was not much call for it so I opted for lazy days around the pool with my book instead. There is plenty of nightlife to be had in St Julians with lots of bars nearby for all ages. The town is within easy walking distance as is the marina supermarkets which is very picturesque. Tip marina area restaurants quite pricey. The Casino is onsite and as I had never been to one before spent an evening there. Worth a visit but will not return as it is not for me. Tip take your passport if you want to visit otherwise they will not let you inThere were a few nightclubs and restaurants on site. We tried one of the clubs but were told that in order to sit down we needed to reserve a seat was not imoresed at all and did not go back. did not try any of the onsite restaurants whilst we were there. purely because there was so much choice all around and kids quite fussy. We took the tourist sightseeing bus around the island and would recommend this as you can hop on and off at your leisure. Medina was a must see. Indoor pool jacuzi gym spa were lovely and we used these as an alternative to outdoor areas a few times. Some of the gym equipment is a bit dated but what made up for this was that the running machines overlook the seadid not notice many small children here but the hotel did cater for children. That said our holiday was out of holiday season. Would love to return but could probably go to a faraway destination for the price of this holiday.

The rooms are very dated and the bathrooms are awful. The mastic around the bath looks like a child has done it. We felt the bathroom was taken straight out of a very cheap tacky hotel and put straight in there. One morning we went down to breakfast and there was a huge que we had to wait nearly 20 minutes to be seated.

Another day we went down to use the indoor Pool and was amazed to see how overcrowded it was. It was so overcrowded we actually thought it was a bit dangerous and did not bother going in.

We stayed at The Westin over New Year 20152016 and generally had a good time. We had booked a full on sea view room but on arrival the room we were taken to was way back from the sea and looked across from one wing to another with the sea only visible if you went to the window or balcony. not what we wanted. This is caused by the layout of the hotel in a U Shape meaning that although its directly on the coast only a third of the rooms actually look out to sea. At this point Esther on the front desk was very friendly and helpful in finding us a better room and this was improved the next day when Anna also very helpful took us to view a number of rooms to show us what was available. Thank you to both of these excellent staff members. Also to be commended greatly was Pam in the Exec Lounge who takes a great interest in her guests and could not do too much to make us feel at home. She really looks after her guests. Breakfast was very busy in the main restaurant meaning that we tended to go to the Exec Lounge most mornings. We only ate in one night and the food and service in the foyer bar was excellent and the service friendly. It was our first trip to Malta and on our arrival we walked inland around the area of St Julians where the hotel is located and we were rather shocked and disappointed with the locality which was modern rather down market and cramped. We then realised that the further Eastwards you go or in our case walk the better the atmosphere and surroundings. We walked to Slima one day and then took the ferry over to Valetta which is a stunning walled capital city. Be sure to try to find the terrace over the gun deck that looks East over the islands main harbour. We found this through a small garden near the entry to the city and it was a stunning view that opened up to us unexpectedly. We had further trips to the Three Cities on the other side of the harbour to Mdina the old walled capital city to a lovely fishing village and to the remains of some 30BC temples which formed a stunning backdrop as the winter sun set over the Med. We tend to judge restaurants by the number of people in them but after a couple of evenings realised that people tend to eat late in Malta and were amused to see that restaurants that we had dismissed on our walk out were in fact packed out on our returnOveral we enjoyed Malta.

My first time at this hotel. The property is beautiful and is currently undergoing a renovation. Excellent welcome at check in. As a Mariot Bonvoy Platinum Lifetime member I was very well looked after with an upgrade to a fabulous Superior Seaview room which was very large and spacious. My room 50 had two large double beds but as a single traveller I obviously only needed one bed but took the good advice from the front desk that it was a beautiful room and so it was and had a large terrace. The other big bonus was that it was one of the brand new room rooms with wonderful new furnishings and even stepping out of the lift you could smell the brand new carpet. I may well have been one of the first in this new room and I would suggest that maintenance pay a visit to the new bathroom as the floor tiles had lots of grouting from the tiles all around the base. Once this is sorted out the bathroom would be perfect. The breakfast was excellent and was taken in the brand new refurbished lower ground floor restaurant with an outside gazebo style extension. Unfortunately the executive lounge was closed as it is on the 8th floor and the whole floor was closed to complete the renvovation. This was a great shame being my first time at the Westin as access to the lounge is an important part of any of my hotel stays. However complimentary drinks including alcohol was served in the lobby bar. In addition personal canapes were provided at my table and they were not only plentiful but also delicious. My other disappointment was the steam room and sauna were closed as they are part of the refurbishment but due to open around now. The indoor pool was lovely though. I asked if the lobby bar was going to be refurbished and it appears something is planned but I hope that it is not altered too much as it is absolutely beautiful and very traditional and luxurious. Every single member of staff at the Westin especially in the lobby bar were so friendly welcoming and very professional. My seafood pasta special was superb one evening. The hotel was very busy due to a large convention by VANS which should have been held at the Radison which was damaged in the freak storm and at the last minute was moved to the Westin.

Have just returned from a 2 week stay at this hotel and would recommend it. The location is stunning on the headland and yet is only a short walk away from the bars and restaurants of Pacevile and St Georges Bay. We were in the south wing so not refurbished but the room was spacious the bed was very comfortable as you expect in a Westin and it had a great sea view so no complaints at all re. the room. We had breakfast included and the selection was considerable including Maltese favourites which were good. Not so sure about onion bhaji and vegetable spring rolls for breakfast but perhaps that is to make our fellow guests from Asia feel at home. Stars of the show for us were waiter Jefrey and the egg man Blendi. Having the use of the juicers was great fun too with racks of fruit and vegetables available to experiment. Gluten free separate area and lactose free milk albeit in a fairly small carafe. I tended to top up with the soya milk also available. The one thing that needs addressed are the coffee machines There is a sensor for the cup which is too high so the cups you use do not allow the machine to work so you have to lift the cup or slide your hand in the side to trigger the sensor. My gripe is the downtime for the waiters having to explain to almost everyone trying to use them how to get them to work. Seems an oversight in an otherwise slick breakfast operation. The public areas are impressive and being able to access the sea is great. I preferred the reef club with views south to Sliema than the pool side lido but as the reef club is effectively on the other side of the road via either a gate from the casino road or through a tunnel from the main pool area I felt it was a bit detached from the efficient hotel. It was supposed to be open until 7 pm but on exiting one evening at 620 the casino road gate was locked and we had to retrace our steps back through the tunnel. The drink from the pool bar Kinie was poured from a warm bottle into a glass with ice so it was cool and no more \u20ac 490. and on one evening arriving at 5 pm there were no clean towels and the lad at the entrance suggested I go back to the hotel and get one ie back through the tunnel. Maybe an occasional visit by management to the Reef Club might not go amiss. We did not try the spa as both times we went down during the day it was padlocked and there was no literature available such as a price list or actual opening times as the times on the door were clearly wrongThe lounge bar was nice especially for a late drink if a little dark out on the terrace. I needed the torch on my mobile phone to read the menu. Thanks to Malcolm the concierge for arranging our day trip. Always helpful. We only had one issue with the room ie the sink and it was fixed promptly. There is no buffet restaurant other than on Saturdays so you have the choice of the 2 restaurants on the other side of casino road and of course the piano bar. We ate in Palios and it was very good but as there are so many restaurants on your doorstep there is no real need to stay in the hotel every evening. In our wing the room doors were very heavy to open and so make much noise when they are left to bang shut usually late at night and early in the morning. Not the hotels fault but when refurbishing perhaps a more gentle closing mechanism might be a good idea. This hotel is very big on conferences and so you find suddenly a mass invasion of business folk and their partners for a few days. By and large these did not affect us the Northern European and Asian conferences went without incident. The same can not be said for the one which changed the tone of the place for a few days loud mass pool antics and in addition to dorbanging much loud music and shouting down the corridor. Thankfully it was only for a few days but I did not get the impression that the hotel felt they could do anything about the loud incursions. For those who like to sit on their balcony reading or drinking be aware that the lighting is erratic and does not seem to be turned on at the same time or is light sensitive as on one night it was pitch dark outside at 8 pm and no lights yet the next evening they were on at 620pm. Usually they go off at 1pm. That being said we had a wonderful 2 weeks and would certainly return but would maybe check what conferences were on before we booked.", "offset": [4231, 4365], "date": "2019-10-01", "cpt": "1", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "18cc00ca-bdb9-4002-8348-145467bc5389", "sentence": "My favorite hotel in Malta.

This hotel has large clean comfortable rooms and a spectacular setting on its own peninsular overlooking the Mediterranean. So what could possibly go wrong. A surprising amount unfortunately. The Westin Dragonara feels more like a city business hotel catering to conference visitors than a \u2018 get away from it all \u2019 destination for holidaymakers. After a week there in mid October we did n\u2019t feel rejuvenated or pampered. Most days there seemed to be at least 3 or 4 business conferences competing for the attention of the staff. While the hotel is entitled to make money this way I do n\u2019t personally want constant reminders of the world of work when I \u2019m on a seaside holiday so this is something to bear in mind if you \u2019re thinking of making a booking here. The outdoor pool was also far too cold. I do n\u2019t know if it was heated but it did n\u2019t feel as if it was and very few people even children were using it the week we were there. There was no polside ambience no organised activity and no effort to make the pool a focal point of hotel life. A wasted opportunity given the hotel \u2019s impressive seafront location. The half board option was also seriously inadequate. The hotel only offers a buffet option for dinner one night a week. The rest of the time you have to choose between two a la carte restaurants a short walk from the main building not ideal if it \u2019s raining or the lounge bar. It has to be said that the quality of the food and portion sizes were reliably good throughout our stay but we found the seating arrangements irritating. A typical experience would be to walk into a near empty restaurant only to be asked \u201c Have you made a reservation \u201d. We would explain that it hardly seemed necessary only to be told \u201c Yes but it \u2019s better to make a reservation \u201d to which we would respond \u201c We tried but the phone was constantly engaged \u201d. We would then be offered the table closest to the terrace door where the draught from the October sea breeze was strongest. I do n\u2019t know what drove this behaviour but it came across as obstinate inflexible and pretentious. When you \u2019ve paid up front for half board as part of the holiday price you \u2019re entitled to sit where you want if the restaurant is empty. In the end we settled for dining in the lounge and polside bars where the staff were by contrast unfailingly helpful and attentive. The bottom line is as follows if you \u2019re visiting Malta on business or for a short break to see Valletta the island \u2019s enchanting capital this hotel could well be the best choice for you. But if you \u2019re here for a week or more you need to think carefully about whether this is really the service offering you want. It is n\u2019t what I would characterise as a self contained resort hotel with an emphasis on well being and relaxation. For example there is little effort to promote wellness and beauty treatments which in my experience is highly unusual in a premier 5 star seaside location. We formed the impression that the management are primarily focused on the lucrative conference business. We wanted a more escapist chilled out experience and will be checking customer reviews much more carefully in future before parting with cash on this lavish scale. This type of holiday is becoming very expensive and you need to undertake thorough groundwork in advance to ensure that the hotel you choose offers the ambience and service philosophy you are looking for.", "offset": [453, 560], "date": "2019-10-26", "cpt": "1", "category": "venue"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "4b3538dc-1321-49d9-8aa2-06ff047744a9", "sentence": "Terrible property.
