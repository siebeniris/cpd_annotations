Visited the Crowne Plaza on Easter Sunday with the family. We got a very good last minute deal on dinner bed family room and breakfast. On arrival we were unable to check in immediately however we did arrive 15 minutes early. Come 3 pm check in time the queue was huge and it was about 320 by the time we finally checked in. On entering our room it was nice clean and tidy and no real complaints. However I expected more from the Crowne Plaza. This could quite easily have been a Premier Inn room in fact I have stayed in larger family rooms at the Premier Inn. Following check in we took the kids down to the swimming pool which was excellent. The pool was perfect for them and can not fault it. Having pre paid for dinner we dined in the hotel restaurant. However anyone who has not pre paid I would strongly advise eating elsewhere. The menu is grossly overpriced for the standard of the food. I ordered black pudding and poached egg to start when it arrived the egg was stone cold and it did not have a yolk. It was very nice when a new plate of food was brought for me. For my main meal I paid extra for the roast duck. The duck was over cooked and the bottom of the potato fondant it was served with was burnt. My wife ordered fish and chips. I had be very surprised if the fish was fresh and the chips were almost certainly frozen chips. The larger chips were still raw in the middle. All in all it is a nice hotel however they really need to look at the standard of food served in the restaurant. Had we not booked the hotel at such a reasonable rate I most certainly would have complained about the food.", "offset": [90, 166], "date": "2016-03-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "4877d12b-8ceb-401f-895b-7524c8377244", "sentence": "Good service but lack of bathroom cleanliness.

This is a tricky review to write as there were good points and a few not so good points on our visit. We chose the hotel over others in central Leeds primarily because of the swimming pool and parking and the fact that the hotel has a decent reputation. Also the location was very convenient as it is close to the city centre. We booked a Club Room for 2 nights during the week. The Club Room costs extra and gives you access to a Club Lounge for a continental breakfast in the morning and drinks with canapes in the evening. The room was nice and comfortable and we were allowed to check in early which was a real bonusOn the second day the shower attachment broke and we reported it before heading out for the day. On our return it had not been fixed and when we went to ask about it we were told there were no other rooms we could be moved to and that we could shower in the pool showers not very private romantic or luxurious but that is what we did. Then we went to the blindingly brightly lit Club Lounge for an evening drink before heading to dinner. softer lighting in the Lounge would create a much more relaxing and enjoyable atmosphereA group of guests had pretty much drunk everything from the fridge their table was covered with all the botlesI went to reception and asked if we could have a drink and was advised they would send someone to restock. After some time a girl appeared and said she could not restock the fridge as they only use certain beers for that area it was becoming a tad frustrating for us and we felt a bit let down. Eventually we were able to have a drink horayThe next morning as we were preparing to check out the maintenance man came to fix the shower after we had showered downstairs at the swimming pool. On the bright side we did enjoy the pool and the steam room. At check out we asked if the fee for parking could be waived in light of the inconvenience we experienced which they agreed to do. however it was not offered up frontSo as mentioned the room was lovely the staff were pleasant checking in was fine and we enjoyed the pool however the glitches we endured could possibly have been addressed more quickly.", "offset": [368, 419], "date": "2017-11-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 13, "uid": "57a9f6d7-8667-498a-91b2-8f0892c4dd35", "sentence": "VERY ORDINARY PATHETIC SHOWER PRESSURE.

Good quality Showers with decent water pressure this is like having an over the bath trickle of water instead of a good morning shower.

Our rooms were well decorated great size twin beds but the lighting was very poor and it was quite hard to see to dry and style our hair. I prefer a bath to a shower the bath was very small and the bath caddy on the wall was so low down on the wall it kept digging in me. The shower pressure was also poor for my friend and for our other friends in their two rooms. The beds were comfy but we were woken a few times in the early hours from other guests and then again at about 7 in the morning from children running around in rooms above us. Breakfast was gorgeous and plentiful but we had to ask staff to clean the table then we had to get attention to get hot drinks ordered on two occasions.

I am not sure how much they restock there were quite a few people there and one large group so by the time we got there about 545pm food was limited. I am not sure what the restrictions are.

We ordered a club sandwich and a portion of chunky chips which my husband and I were going to share. We could not believe it when the chips arrived. They were obviously frozen oven chips and very pale and unappetising. Not at all what we expected for a top end hotel. We were expecting freshly cooked chunky chips and not Aunt Besies frozen.
