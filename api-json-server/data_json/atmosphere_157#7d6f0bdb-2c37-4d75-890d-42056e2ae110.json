My second visit to the Mandarin Oriental Geneva and thankfully for a longer stay than my first. I love this hotel and I have never stayed in a hotel before or since that can match it. The service is excellent I do believe that anything I could possibly have required would have been provided for me. Every member of the hotel team is friendly and polite and all those I dealt with from Front desk to concierge remembered my name on subsequent visits which is a fantastic extra touch considering the footfall the hotel receives. The room was immaculately clean fresh and pleasantly decorated. The in room entertainment is currently receiving a re fresh with new tvs which was good to notice as this was the only slight aspect of the room I felt let it down but on my next visit it sounds like I will have nothing to be negative about. I should note I was travelling on business so the hotel choice was important for a good nights slepMr Wagner the General Manager and his team in MO Geneva can be very proud of the establishment they are running it is the definition of a luxury hotel.", "offset": [614, 855], "date": "2015-03-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2cf12ec0-394d-463b-a162-18896ff3979e", "sentence": "let us be fair this is an excellent hotel. I had not intended to comment on this hotel just yet but I have mistakenly made the wrong choice on the MO survey. Well whereas there are several issues that could be improved this is a decidedly excellent hotel esp. because of the warmth and professionalism of the whole staff who genuinely cared about us right from the moment we stepped out of the car after a long drive into Geneva until the day of our departure. We certainly felt pampered throughout our stay be it during breakfast time after working out or while having an evening drink. That is certainly an aspect the hotel management should be proud about. Some previous reviewers have complained about the hotels location but to be honest that criticism makes no sense to me. Granted it might not be located in the same block as the rest of the citys 5star hotels who are within a stones throw of each other but it is still in the center of Geneva just a minute or two walk away from the main shopping thoroughfare three or four minutes away on foot from for instance the Four Seasons and certainly close to other areas like the Old Quarter or Cornavin Station. Besides the hotel provides its guest with a free transport card for those of us who find it harder to walk around or are simply too lazy for doing so. As for the hotels facilities breakfast was very good and with an ample choice both at the buffet a selection of cheese fruit cereals hot dishes dairy products cold cuts juices etc. and \u00e0 la carte. Staff was efficient professional and all around nice and they even remembered my choices. Other than that the fitness center and the wellness area while not huge are very well equipped and perfectly adequate after a run around the city. Finally the MO Bar provides an excellent selection of drinks expensive yes but just like everywhere else in the city prepared and served with expertise by the very pleasant staff working therein. The hotel building another focus of complaints from what I have read does certainly not have the glamour and glitz of the other 5star hotels at first sight but it is an interesting and intriguing piece of 1950s brutalism that does not stick out in the area where it is located so that pretty much adds to the charm even if the inside layout leaves the hotel with little room to manoeuvre thus meaning that for instance the lobby is a little bit underwhelming for a hotel of its category.
