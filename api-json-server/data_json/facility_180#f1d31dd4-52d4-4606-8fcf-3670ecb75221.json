Nice hotel close proximity to everything you want on the island. Room was clean but very spartan. I do not mind that as you are never in the room. It just looked drab very plain all white. TINY bathroom but it is an older hotel so it is expected. They need to install hooks or shelves or something in there so two people can put bathroom stuff in there. Biggest complaints. The minuscule Ice machine on our floor did not work so we had to go upstairs to get it. Not normally an issue but the stars here are straight up Mt Everest vertical and at the end of a long hallway so really became a pain after the 4th or 5th trip with a tiny ice bucket.

I really loved the Heavenly Spa foot massage that was. The bed was very comfortable they did not honor my request about being disabled and getting me a room closer to the stairs but then changed my room and was able to do that and also helped me with my bags upstairs and downstairs which was nice. The night shift manager Jose was very nice and friendly and helpful. But to me the best of all was LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. THAT ALONE was AWESOME. they were right in the heart of the WHOLE island and they could of charged more but the rooms were just not as modern as other hotels and that was why they could not charge more but it did not matter because I did not stay in my room that much anyway. I NEVER ONCE got a wake up call from them the 2 days that I was there that I requested they need to also get softer towels the towels that they had were rough like SAND PAPER. its like they could not afford to use softener. and the day shift women were NOT warm or friendly but very COLD l But the night shift manager. They did not seem to know about the night activities there I missed Karoke because they did not tell me that it was right around the corner and. I could of also of gone on a fly fishing boat tour at 730 PM. that I missed too Also NO ELEVATOR not good for disabled people at all but I heard that they were going to put one in next year which will be good.", "offset": [1266, 1413], "date": "2016-06-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "cde44b49-5ecc-4705-a4c1-ca333e6b87fb", "sentence": "Boutique Hotel with Charachter.

The staff was super nice and accommodating and the free breakfast was nice. The location was great not far from the boat landing and right in the middle of town. Some rooms have kind of a view where you can distantly see the ocean over rooftops see pic and some just sit across from other rooms so you have no view at all.
