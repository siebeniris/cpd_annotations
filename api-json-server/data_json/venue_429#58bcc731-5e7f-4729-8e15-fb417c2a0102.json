I guess I was wrong for thinking my previous review would do this hotel justice. Less than 2 years later Plaza Athene Bangkok has managed to go through a major revamp whilst staying true to its identity and quality of service. I planned to surprise my partner for her birthday and as insinuated by the title of my review had somewhat of a complicated idea to be executed by the guys at Plaza Athene. Eva Chan and her team made sure that every detail from the preferred color of flowers and flavor of cake to coordinating balloon delivery and our change of plans was orchestrated perfectly. Often mistaken for a business hotel I am attaching a photo for everyone to see what amazing things this hotel is capable of. Club Lounge was tranquil yet unpretentious and staff appeared to be very knowledgeable and experienced not only at this venue but throughout the hotel. What I loved the most were the furnishings and new room decor which I found to be quite delicate and functional. Its versatility and appeal to both leisure and business travelers is apparent. I know my particular preferences incurred a great deal of behind the scenes planning and I am very grateful for taking that weight off my shoulder and making us feel taken care of thank you Eva Giles and team for making it a very special one.

Top level attention to every detail in the Club especially by Pom who was just a perfect host. Highly recommend. I will certainly plan returning. The outdoor pool and surroundings was closed during one day as a private event took place at the pool and conference area and the whole pool area became closed to the quests. This was apparently the day I planned a longer stay at the pool since no business meetings were scheduled in the afternoon. I understand the motivation of renting the area to the events however from the client point of view you are experiencing 5star level expense and assume that all respective facilities are good to use.

In the heart of Bangkok a few meters off the main Sukhumvit Road this hotel is well located both for business travellers and tourists.

The high feature is the hotels multiple restaurants which offer a wide variety of cuisines and a multitude of choice. Guests with specific diet needs like vegetarian and vegan alao will never be disappointed. Hotel staff is also a great highlight of this hotel. the front office housekeeping restaurants concierge and bell boys all aim to delight every guest.

This is a beautiful well located hotel. Rooms are great. Staff is attentive maybe to the extreme. The problem is that they do not know if they want to cater to business people tourists or event planners. As a higher level SPG frequent business traveler they simply do not do much to accommodate frequent stayers. The upgrade rooms are pretty much the same as the others with nicer toiletries and that is pretty much the extent of the upgrade. And Im more than not told an upgrade is not even available. That said the rooms are pretty nice in the first place but there is no particular recognition of the fact that you stay in SPG hotels 50 nights a year and others are there for their few night vacation or a single night for an event. The internet service critical for foreign visitor there on business is about the worst I have experienced in a 5Star hotel. There is no executive lounge of any kind and the business center is pretty basic. The elevators are either extremely slow or way overstretched as you sometimes have to wait 5 minutes for one. In the meantime the hotel books multiple events back to back in several locations. No exaggeration on a Saturday there might be a total of 4 or 5 different events during the course of the day. So the elevators when they do arrive are packed. On of the event venues can believe it or not only be accessed from the pool bar area. So are sunning drinking or working out as people are milling around in party dresses. The lobby bar is literally in the middle of the lobby does not actually have a bar and is pretty much in the center of the bustle and noise of all the events. Not very chill.

The room was spotlessly clean the bed and linen were so comfortable that we did not want to get up in the mornings. The hotel is well placed for some great shopping malls. It is the staff though that give this hotel the edge. Every member of the team from the doorman to the bar and restaurant staff to concierge to reception to the pool bar staff all of them delivered exceptional levels of service and were so friendly professional and gracious. Our room included access to the Club Lounge which provided free afternoon tea canapes and free bar service from 40 till 80 each day which was a great benefit and we utilised this facility each day. This lounge is a very comfortable place to chill after a busy day sightseeing or before going out for dinner. The only small improvement that I personally think could be made is for the lighting to be turned down and softened a little in the evenings. We found the lighting very bright and glary in the evenings which we felt made the venue less relaxing than it could have been.
