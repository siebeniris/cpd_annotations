The AC worked well and was quiet. There was little noise evident from anywhere else. I slept very well. The star of this place is the restaurant. After a long transatlantic flight we needed a good beer and a hearty meal. We got both and we were really well looked after by our server Walter who recommended beers discussed the menu and generally made us feel happy and welcome. Check out was easy and no problems.

This is my third time staying long term at this wonderful hotel or should I say home. It s very close to the IAH airport great shuttle service breakfast front desk staff maintenance etc. During the first two weeks of initial stay I thought it may just be an average hotel however it s the staff that keeps me coming back every time. For me personally Ms Ruby is EVERYTHING. She has the sweetest disposition and customer service skills that make me feel right at home. You know how some people make a place. Ms Ruby represents Holiday Inn for me and why it s my 3rd long term visit. Mr David in the restaurant is an angel always making sure i m doing ok and my meal is perfect. Cieara is a wonderful waitress I love that she remembers whatever I order even after i ve been gone for 2 months and has a great head on her shoulders. There are nt very many eateries in the area so I eat most of my meals here and always enjoy them. Every morning i know i m going to have a good day when I see Ms Shelia and Mr Michael. Ms Shelia always has the happiest morning greeting. In the afternoons Jacob and Valerie are my favorites. Jacob can always be counted on to be very pleasant and professional. His customer service skills are stellar. Evete is my late night bundle of joy. You ca nt have a bad night if Evete is around to make sure i m ok and say something to make me laugh and hard. Dijon is very sweet and always so helpful. I look forward to seeing Charity at night because she is always enlightening me with an amenity that I did nt know the hotel had or suggestions for where I can go around here as far as pharmacies grocery stores etc. She is a wealth of knowledge and makes sure i m ok. Last but not least is Lary. He is so pleasant and courteous anytime something needs fixing. Clearly I love staying at this hotel because of the wonderful staff. I apologize if I missed someone as i m sure i have. I will write another review if I forget someone as everyone really is wonderful. So many reasons to keep coming back.

I am pretty sure the fire marshal would have something to say about that. In both rooms there were no power receptacles anywhere near the bed. How does a hotel justify that in todays world. If the renovation is not going to put receptacles in usable locations it should at least put lamps with receptacles on the night stands. The shower in the second room had a defective hot water valve. It took 15 minutes for the shower to reach a usable temperature. The door in the first room had a fist sized hole in it at floor level.

I was also automatically charged a gratuity by Lu of 15 for a party of one first time I believe I have ever seen this when dining solo.
