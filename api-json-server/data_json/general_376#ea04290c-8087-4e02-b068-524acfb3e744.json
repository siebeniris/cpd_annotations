We had a fantastic room with a pool view. Layout of hotel is like apartment blocks so a bit all over the place we got lucky. Pool is really nice read reviews saying you will not get a sun lounger unles you are out before 8 am. NOT TRUE we got there at 9 am and had our pick of any lounger we wanted. Sun loungers do not full up completely until about 11. Pool bar is ok good drink selection but quite dear food is decent burgers sandwiches but not great. Some staff are great others are terrible. Room cleaned everyday. Nice room yes they are not the Ritz but we were more than happy with ours. Plenty of room big double bed 2 twins together actually but a king mattress and sheet over them so made no difference at all. Breakfast is good cereal yogurt fruit bread pastry selection not the freshest or nicest eggs bacon fruit juice coffee tea. Ate in both restaurants the main restaurant that serves a buffet for half boarders is good with a selection of fish delicious meat average potatoes great and veg great. The other restaurant is more expensive with an A La carte style menu really nice setting and fantastic food. Beach club is great addition you have to pay \u00a3 10 for a sun lounger but it is worth it free sun loungers on beach. Again food is ok and drinks are expensive but the actual club itself is lovely. Beach is good too lots of watersports a few mins walk. Location of hotel is fantastic 510 min walk to centre square. Our room pool view and close to all amenities. Location walking distance of all attractions. Beach club.

Lovely outdoor pool we swam every day. Plenty of sun loungers and parasols by the pool. We took the free courtesy bus to the beach club and had a beer at the bar there.

The public rooms were attractive and it was peaceful.

This particular holiday was booked for our 30th Wedding Anniversary. Because of the Event we wanted to make our holiday a special experience. In looking at the pictures of the hotel online we got the impression that the hotel overlooked the Lagos Marina and very close to a beach therefore we thought we would have experienced the wonderful sights of Lagos from our room however this was not to be. The Hotel staff are so friendly and the rooms hallways outside areas and dinning areas are spotless. The food was really nice. in particular the morning porridge that was made fresh and had cinnamon lemon and honey added for extra taste which I thoroughly enjoyed each morning. The Tivoli Hotel is located in a built up area with no view of either the Lagos Marina or a beach. On arrival we were led to our room. The first room was a beautiful refurbished room with everything we would need however the view was that of a building site with sounds to match the view. The second room was again a beautiful refurbished room with a view that over looked the bottom floor of a walled stone courtyard that had no character or trace of sunshine. We explained to reception that we had anticipated a much nicer view from our room. We were then offered a a choice of a 3rd room. One that would cost us an extra 95 euro per night as it was a family suite or one that would be an extra 20 euro per night. We chose the latter which was a pool view premium room. At this stage the holiday was proving to be very expensive indeed. We had a chat with our rep the following morning who followed up with the hotel but basically the outcome was non move able. We met up with another few cuples and a family who also said that the anticipated a different location for the Hotel based on the pictures on the website too so we were not on our own in our thoughts of the Hotel location. There is a beautiful beach which the Hotel provides transport to and from and the driver is so nice. The Marina is a short walk from The Tivoli as is the bus station and a variety of of restaurants and bars. The Hotel gave us a bottle of bubbly chocolate covered strawberries and chocolates on our first day which we thoroughly enjoyed. The only downside is the views. We spent 10 days at The Tivoli Hotel and had a nice time there. The staff are really lovely and the Hotel is really clean. The rules and regulations at The Tivoli are necessary like all business organisations however I do feel the strick sunbed rule goes a little too far with the restrictions. We experienced as did other folk these restrictions when we left for a short while to get lunch and another cuple had the same experience when the had lunch at the hotel terrace. As I stipulated earlier the hotel gave us a lovely bottle of bubbly which we decided to keep until the evening. but by this time the ice in the ice bucket had melted. We approached the bar after purchasing 2 drinks one each for some ice and were refused. The rule is if you want ice you need to go through room service. While I understand the reasons for this I felt that on this occasion and since the hotel had given us the bubbly aceptions could have been made. Duna Beach is beautiful. On our first day of arriving at Duna Beach we put down our hotel towels and were then asked for 20 euro for the beds. We were then informed that the beds at the pool area had a charge but the beds at the otherside of the fencesed area at the beach were free. With a 10 euro surcharge in the toilet food and pool area could prove very expensive over our 10 day stay 200 euro. we opted to use the beach beds.", "offset": [861, 1014], "date": "2018-07-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "general"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "95202497-98bd-4739-bd92-4a23ed1c365b", "sentence": "Wonderful hotel in a fabulous location.
