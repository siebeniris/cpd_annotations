I last stayed here in 2012 and from stepping into the lobby not a lot had changed. Big atrium smallish bar area restaurant etc. Gym pool if wanted. Food that I had there was great no complaints there. Service welcoming. Rooms a little tired but big and clean.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week and absolutely loved itThe hotel lobby is HUGE clean and very inviting. Often guests or business travelers would sit at the comfy seating areas on their laptop. The lobby has a few flat screen TVs a lobby bar Starbucks as well as a restaurant. Convenient and reasonably priced for the most part. The staff at this hotel are awesome. Especially Greg at the front desk he always greeted us by name provided outstanding customer service and is a true asset to this hotel and his customers. Kerie at the lobby Starbucks is awesome as well as the restaurant waitstaf. The food was great also. As well Doug the hotel shuttle driver is great and loved the shuttle to take me shopping when needed came in handy. The room was very nice and a good size the room was cleaned everyday very well and sheets changed which was fantasticOne day I think our housekeeper may have had the day off and the fill in did not refill any shampoo etc but a call down to the front desk resolved that quickly not a big deal. The room has a fridge and safe also down the hall is a room with a huge microwave vending machine and ice machine. Very convenient also. One thing that needs addressing though is the bathtubs are in poor condition and are peeling and need to be refinished. This makes the washroom look in poor condition when it really is not. Mgmt needs to look into this and touch up a hotel this great should not have this issue. Another great touch in the lobby is the amazing fruit infused ice cold water and bowl of apples that guests can help themselves to. This water was so delicious and the fruit variation changed everyday so yumyThere is also a pool hot tub and fitness center onsite which is great the pool was often occupied with moms and tots who were not guests of the hotel not sure why however I found this a bit annoying as it deterred guests from using the facilities. We planned on swimming but decided against it. The gym also has a fridge with cold facecloths which is So refreshing after a workout another nice touchThe room has a list of items you may get from the front desk should you forget or run out. This is another fantastic touch and came in handy also you may borrow other items and and return such as a tea kettle vaporizer steamer robe etc if needed. This came in handy also. Overall we really enjoyed our stay this is a fantastic hotel with great amenities and amazing staff we would love to return should we visit Chicago again. The lobby also has a business center ATM and car rental on site. Thank you for a wonderful stay.", "offset": [1975, 2169], "date": "2015-03-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "52728857-99f7-4021-aa2b-271d1b6ed0b2", "sentence": "dressed up since i was there last. The hotel has done a nice job upgrading its interior. The public spaces are quite well done and have lots of room. The dining and service was excellent. The rooms were redone but still are a bit unique. The bathrooms are what they are canot change them too much without major cost and the toilet shower room is a bit tight but its nice to have a sink on the outside with a lot of counter room. I like the semi sweet feel with the sitting area and desk on one side and bed on the other with a tv that swings between the two sides. The television is nice but had some challenges with signal and maintenance came by right away well done. High speed wi fi could be better. Gym is not bad but they rent out the pool for people to use on a day basis for kids swim lessons which is a bit unusual and makes using the fitness area a bit uncomfortable as kids keep coming in and out and use it for a dressing waiting room.", "offset": [704, 947], "date": "2015-03-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "a202e78c-719c-4b34-9f3a-4e8ce5711a1c", "sentence": "Pleasant Staff Make the Difference.

Wonderful people. Great location and nice rooms. We had a great time. We also have enjoyed the automated check in and out services via our email. Excellent customer service. We will be back and stay again at this location. There is no doubt that the value for our stay was exceptional. Looking forward to returning for another duplicate experience. The food was very good as well. We were very happy with our breakfast and the service provided in the dining area as well. That was the icing on the cake. We travel frequently and this was by far the most memorable and best value we have experienced in recent years. That is very important to us as we travel. Hyat Regency you have earned a customer for life with my family. We traveled this time for a sports event in the area. The proximity to the complex and ease of navigating was yet another plus for your establishment. The only issue we were not completely prepared for was the toll roads in the area. That was a bit of a learning curve for us as we do not have them where we live. We leaned a lot and that is far from your control as a hotel. Thank you again for your hospitality and your professionalism. We truly appreciate all you provided to us during our stay at your wonderful hotel. I hope our organization continues to use your hotel as our destination of choice as we travel around the country. We would all benefit from such an arrangement. I look forward to hearing about upcoming events and specials you may have throughout the year. I guess in conclusion I would highly recommend your hotel to my close family and friends. They can trust our opinion when we say The Hyat Regency is the place to be. Put that in the news letter. All thumbs up on this location. Bring a swim suit and get in the pool. Plenty of fun to be had there too. We are talking the full service here. That is the kind of stuff that a customer remembers. When you are comfortable while you are traveling it helps you with the overall experience with your family. The list goes on and on with this hotel. I hope to stay here again and get the same experience. I am certain that this type of customer interaction is quite consistent at this hotel. This is plain to see when you interact with the staff at the front desk in the restaurant and via electronics. Keep up the good work. You can set a trend in the industry with your attention to detail and crisp customer service.", "offset": [742, 795], "date": "2017-02-14", "cpt": "1", "category": "fitness"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "de07d5a8-515a-42e1-bab8-74ca2a36f8e6", "sentence": "Comfortable affordable place to stay. Beautiful large hotel about 15 20 minutes north of OHare in good traficunfortunately I was coming from Midway a 45minute drive at 1230am not their fault I purposely chose this hotel because it was close to my other weekend activities. Late night check. in went very quickly no issues there. Room was comfortable plenty of outlets nice flat screen TV. Interesting room design it is basically a two room suite with a sitting area and desk on one side and the bed on the other but there is no door between the rooms and the TV cabinet is also open air between the room allowing the TV to be turned around to face either the sitting area or the bedromMy only issue on this stay was getting ready to shower on my second morning and discovering that housekeeping had actually removed the used shampoo and soap and not replaced them.

I have been to many events here over the years and it seems like there are always a few functions going on in this hotel. The hotel really seems to cater to the events as I have literally come here for things since 193 they are still going strong. The room rates are very low during the weekend when the demand goes down the business travelers all leave. The bargain is great for such a nice room. In one room I swear the bed was more comfortable than the Four Seasons but in another room it was much more firm or something. I slept better than I have in ages here. The staff members are usually pretty nice except a few that lack hospitality training. I will not get into details but a couple of them need to calm down. it is a hotel not a prison. The vast majority are very friendly however. I suppose they have issues with some of the people on the weekends who get the crazy bargains here. I have seen some odd characters here on weekends and then there is the parties with like 25 teenage girls in a room down the hall. How is that even allowed. it is usually a quiet hotel though unles you are unlucky. Sometimes there are people in the courtyard talking you can hear everything though the AC unit usually drowns them out. The AC is very good but it is better in some rooms than others for some reason not due to the sun. You can hear everything the halls too which can be a little annoying sometimes. The rooms need more light or better light fixtures. At night it is too dark in here. The internet is 16 a day for high speed anything streaming will not work on standard internet here which is only 2 3 mbps and high speed is only 7mbps. Breakfast is 1850 if it is not in your rate for the buffet. They have a menu too.
