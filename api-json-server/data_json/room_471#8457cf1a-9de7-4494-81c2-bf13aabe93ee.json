Valley Wing Highly Recommended when in Singapore. During my birthday trip we also wanted to revisit Singapore. Making the decision where to stay was difficult because there are so many great hotels but the Shangri La had been on our bucket list for a longer time. We visited many hotel websites watched Youtube videos and read Trip Advisor reviews. After all this we decided to have our second Shangri La and booked the Valley Wing to make it very special. It was also a good chance to compare a Shangri La Resort See the review of the Shangri La Rasa Sayang Penang with a city property. The Shangri La Singapore was the first hotel of the group opened in 1971 and it is also the flagship. Previously the grounds were an orange grove. We took a limousine from Singapore Changi Airport arriving from Kuala Lumpur Please see also the review of the Sama Sama Hotel. It cost 55 SGD ca. 35 Euro or ca. 3965 USD. The journey took around twenty minutes. Since there are two different entrances for the Valley Wing and the Tower Wing Garden Wing combined we told the driver where we wanted to be dropped off. We were greeted warmly by the door man Krishna who was wearing a colonial uniform. It was opulent and included a helmet. Opposite to the Shangri La Rasa Sayang there was no list and we were invited inside immediately. There was a large painting of Shangri La from the famous book Lost Horizon after which the hotel chain is named. The reception was right in front of the entrance. The check in formalities were done quickly but there was still time to ask for the reason of our stay and to hand over a Dendrobium Orchid which was created for the 35th anniversary of the Shangri La Singapore as a welcome gift. When the receptionist heard it had been my birthday the week before he looked for a special room for us. It was a smoking room on the 17th floor the highest with a balcony. He told us we could have a look since we had originally stated in our booking we wanted a non smoking room and if the smell did disturb us we could always change again but it should be beautiful and the smell no bother at all. Another colleague accompanied us to the room. On the way she explained our privileges and pointed out things we might be interested in. When entering the room there was no smell at all. If we had n\u2019t been told it was a smoking room we would n\u2019t have believed it. We were very happy and kept it. The room was very large and was a good mix between classic Chinese and modern design elements. There was a small hallway. To the left was the walk in closet leading to the fully marbled bathroom. The walk in closet could be closed with richly decorated Chinese double doors. There was a vanity table large writing desk a seating area with coffee table and Time Rob Report Epicure and Prestige Magazines. The writing desk had a complete set of office supplies and a guest directory. There was also a credenza with a flat screen TV and DVD Player. All necessary international channels were available as well as regional ones. The color scheme was green gold white and brown. We liked the chandelier the Nespreso coffee machine and Dilmah Tea selection. The minibar was stocked with Sunrasia juices other soft drinks all non alcoholic beverages were free of charge and replenished daily liquors Champagne beer and Whiskey. The 375 ml bottle Veuve Cliquot was for example 72 SGD ca. 4660 Euro or ca. 5130 USD and the 50 ml Johnny Walker Black Label was 52 SGD ca. 365 Euro or ca. 37 USDThe fresh orchid plant the fruit basket and nightly turndown service with free bottles of water bookmarks with an excerpt from the Lost Horizon and a golden flower print and mint chocolates packaged neatly in small Valley Wing branded boxes were appreciated. The king sized bed was large and extremely comfortable. We loved sitting on the balcony which was fully furnished with wooden chairs and a marble topped table. We had views over the other wings the garden swimming pool and the city. We saw one magnificent sunset. The bathroom was large with double sinks and a separate bath tub and shower. The toilet and bidet were in their own room. The bathroom amenities were by L\u2019Ocitaine Jasmin Bergamot. We enjoyed it so much we bought a large hand soap at the L\u2019Ocitaine Raffles City store in Singapore. During our two night \u2019s stay we used in room dining though there are plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from including Nadaman for Japanese Shang Palace Chinese The Line Shop which was designed by Adam Tihany the Waterfall the Lobby Court the Rose Veranda and the BLU Bar. Since we were very busy throughout our days we enjoyed to have dinner in the privacy and peaceful atmosphere of our large and beautiful room. One meal included two carrot juice one hot chocolate one Milo Singaporean Chicken Rice which was fragrant and delicate flavored and very beautifully presented Rigatoni Carbonara and a cherry banana crumble to share. Both were very light and flavorful. We would have this dinner again. It cost 12475 SGD or ca. 8150 Euro 8935 USDThe other evening we were n\u2019t very hungry and shared a Malaysian Chicken Curry with rice which was messy to eat but very delicious and spicy as we like it. Even though we did n\u2019t order anything to drink the curry came with a glass of water no charge which was a nice touch. I had the dish before but it was a first for him. We both enjoyed it. The curry cost 2945 SGD ca. 1925 Euro or ca. 2110 USD. The ladies and gentlemen from In Room Dining were an asset to the hotel discreet friendly and generally interested in us. During our stay we also used the shoe shine service which was reliable and the shoes returned as good as new in a special box the next morning. We decided to use the laundry service. Of course it was n\u2019t cheap but worth the money paid for 10360 SGD ca. 6770 Euro ca. 7420 USD. Each individual shirt was washed ironed starched and wrapped in paper. They looked as if we had just bought them. Now to the benefits that come with the Valley Wing. It includes access to the Valley Wing Lounge and breakfast at the famous and lavish Summit Room which is gorgeous and memorable at the same time. The lounge has snacks throughout the day afternoon tea canap\u00e9s in the evening and free flowing Perier Jouet Champagne cocktails or any other beverage one could wish for. On the one evening we took part hot and cold canap\u00e9s were served. They were watermelon and Feta cheese Foie Gras on toast and decorated with a blueberry tofu with soya sauce and green pesto BQ Chicken drum Polenta cod and prawn which was brought to the table by the waiter wearing white gloves. At the bar was also a buffet with an excellent international cheese selection crudit\u00e9s salads dressings and a very delectable cherry pistachio cake. The quality was outstanding. Breakfast was as high caliber and offered a huge choice of hot a la carte dishes. Guests can requests items that are n\u2019t on the menu or order as many dishes from the a la carte menu as they want. The Continental buffet was large and included many cereals fruits berries fruit salad smoked salmon cold cuts cheese bread nuts seeds and so much more. The members of staff were the same as at the Valley Wing Lounge. Overall they were efficient understated and friendly. They were happy to see us but not so pleased when there was a small hiccup with our order on the last day. Many guests were ordering at the same and there was a confusion who should get what. so I received instead of an omelet fried eggs and baked beans. The mistake did n\u2019t worry us too much and was quickly rectified. We enjoyed a variety of egg dishes and French Toast. Interesting enough every morning the table was set with different porcelain which was a first for us. We loved the elegant and lavish d\u00e9cor the floor to ceiling windows and being able to catch a glimpse of the squirrels living in the garden. The lounge was very large and had different seating arrangements from a bar lounge to a restaurant setup. It had a classic feel and beautiful design. Besides spending time at the Valley Wing we explored the hotel grounds the Tower Wing and a bit of the Garden Wing. When we needed transportation we went to Krishna who organized taxis for us. Waiting time was minimal. He was extremely friendly and showed us the VIP entrance exit to the Valley Wing allowing famous persons to avoid the lobby and go straight to their floor. There is also a secret door connecting the public spaces with the VIP entrance. Krishna was so kind to and let us use it which garnered a few surprised stares and some disappointment by fellow guests because we were n\u2019t VIPs. Krishna and we also chatted about other Shangri La properties we had been to not that many in our case. He had been at the Golden Sands the sister property of the Rasa Sayang. We talked about our jobs and Krishna proudly explained he was working for the Shangri La for over twenty years and loved it. You could see he was very proud and happy. Krishna told us which presidents of the US and other politicians he had met. We realized his brother and I were working for the same global company on different continents. Then it was unfortunately time to pack check out and leave. It was hard because the setting is very romantic the comfort great the cuisine outstanding and the staff attentive and ca n\u2019t do enough for you. We would love to stay here again should we be in Singapore. Would we recommend this luxury hotel to a friend. YESWould we want to stay at this luxury hotel in our future.

Horrid insulting disrespectful. Shangri La hotel apparently inspired by the James Hilton book Lost Horizon is meant to be an oasis nestled in the rushed and busy Orchard Road area. It should offer a calm relaxing reinvigorating experience all laden with that extra touch of luxury. Its rooms are nicely appointed the Garden Wing one of the three wings has nice balconies to stand and soak in the views of the pool and the gorgeously landscaped gardens and one can hear the man made waterfall that cascades down to the restaurants. We meander through the steps hidden amongst this waterfall our path leading to a pond with tortoises and fish galore all rushing towards us with their mouths open as if needing much required feed. The reaction of the fish pretty much sums up our romantic special occasion stay. While we should have enjoyed this beautiful resort in the middle of Singapore we ended up feeling like the fish deprived and disgruntled. The failings of Shangri La am writing this based on the fact that we paid upwards of S50 p n for a luxury stay1. Drove in in a cab whilst I fumbled for a good couple of minutes with the local currency to pay the driver my wife got out of the cab herself waited for someone to come over to help with the bags then got three heavy suitcases out of the boot herself and made her way to the front desk. Now we are not snobby folks who refuse to lift our own luggage but certain services are expected of 5star properties. 2. A concierge desk person met us half way through the walk took us 5 steps to the desk then wandered off asking us to make sure than no one cuts ahead in front of us as apparently guests there intend to do that. I am sorry but are we in the lobby of a 5star hotel or no offence but a badly managed train station queue3. Check in process We booked a weekend staycation rate which included in its terms and conditions the two main reasons why we chose that rate hotela. Late check out until 6pmb. S10 credit on food spa services within the hotel. The first thing we were told was that check out next day will be 4 pm not 6 pm. We very politely asked them to check it again to which they insinuated we are lying and it is only 4 pm. After 10 minutes of this exchange my wife finally found the email from the hotel staff confirming the late check out time. The person said well in that case they are happy to extend it until 6 pm. I am again sorry but we were not really looking for favours from them just asking for what was included in the package. Eventually we did end up leaving even before 3 pm next day as we just could not be bothered to stay there any more. Now the worst part the S10 credit. We spoke to 5 staff members between checkin in and 5 pm that day everyone of them had a different answer. Room service politely yes should be fine not sure though. Concierge very rude very condescending. NO. You can not get room service and you have to eat worth 100 in one sitting or you forfeit the rest. Person at the Line restaurant Yes should be fine but we are fully booked until 830pm. So unles we pay we can not eat even though our package includes that. Person at their Tea room on the 4th floor or first floor above entry level You can eat or drink whatever you like but the tea session is ending in 30mins. My wife got to the point of crying because everyone was replying back to us with a wry smile in a very condescending tone except the tea room lady she was helpful. Anyway we ended up ordering room service and paying for it. We then went for a walk and saw that the front desk was not a chaos so decided to confirm the 6 pm next day check out and the food inclusion. The lady was probably the most helpful of all though again the answer changed twice. First yes we can have whatever we want from in room to restaurant service. Then we can only have it until mid night that day even though our booking is until next day. She did however help us get the money back we paid earlier for room service. What was supposed to be a nice luxurious romantic stay turned out to be horrific with the staff leaving us with a feeling that we are asking for some kind of a hand out. Utterly unprofessional totally disrespectful and simply the last thing we expected from a 5 star hotel. This is a long review and am hoping the hotel management can sort out their mess and also that couples looking to travel can have a heads up. They do have a very good breakfast buffet but it is definitely not worth 500. As for the utopian views you can catch better ones at Gardens by the Bay for fraction of a price and no one looking down upon you. And yes even though the rooms were nice no one again congratulated us on our special day no flowers no cake no nothing. In fact the cab driver who took us to a different hotel offered to buy us a cake gave us a discount on the cab fare and apologised profusely on their behalf. This was our third trip for three consecutive years to Singapore we stayed for 2 weeks this time and Shangri La was by far the worst experience in three years and over 15 different properties there. The Singapore experience we adore is polite nice welcoming just like the taxi driver or most of the hotels we stayed at and not the experience offered by Shangri La.", "offset": [4624, 4743], "date": "2017-11-30 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "3dd34e15-4cba-4c03-9f94-78c44345ff61", "sentence": "An oasis in the city.

The Indian female waitress sweet as she is simply does not understand English nobody asks if you want coffee tea when I sit down on both days when I told her coffee she never brought it and when I asked again she said I thought somebody was bringing it to you. When I requested for waffles without fruits and other trimmings it came with fruits and everything else of course e. Such a lovely touch to get a box of Easter chocolates but the Chinese female room assistant simply handed it over unceremoniously formally without a smile or word I hope this is not the case with others. f when I checked in I was told by the receptionist that Waterfall Caf\u00e9 was NOT open for breakfast and I could only use The Line excuse me. Perhaps he forgot about Easter Friday andor weekends and g there was simply no reading material in the Garden Wing room not even Singapore Tatler or such. When I asked at the concierge for a copy of the Straits Times they directed me to the luggage hold counter an Indian gentleman told me the hotel has run out of papers and when I expressed surprise that a 80 room hotel did not have a single extra copy he helpfully gave me a copy destined for the Nami restaurant appreciate the kind help but no reading material in a hotel room. Why even give Lost Horizon BOOKMARKS as godnight gifts.

The walk through wardrobe area takes you to bathroom with rain shower or huge bath bidet toilet and double sinks. The lounge has a comfortable couch and chairs dining table desk sideboard mini bar and shelving and extra loo. Baicaly you \u2019d be mad to have issue with this room. It \u2019s outstanding. We had access to Horizon Lounge which was a long walk through to the lobby and up the tower.

One of the best I \u2019ve experienced as I \u2019ve done a lot of business travel. Best bit for us was the family room which is off to the side of the other spaces still with awesome view of Singapore. The family room has five large table settings including two lounge type settings with couches and large soft chairs. Best bit though is the kids table of food. Chef is clearly healthy as while it looks like lots of cakes they all low in sugar and light and airy. We do n\u2019t allow much sugar so our girl thought one muffin with a lolly on top was an enormous treat. Also lots of toys and books for kids in the space and a telly on the wall if your kids like tv. Pool is huge and spaces for kids adults relaxing and splashing. Service lovely and two restaurants right by the pool. Buds playground pretty amazing but we felt really disappointed to have to pay full price when we were paying guests with horizon club access. Even a 50 discount might be fair. But our girl had a blast and we did too watching her. You need socks for kids and adults or have to buy some there. We did n\u2019t have any so paid something like 30 for entry and then 5 for socks. The hotel was renovated in 2016 so if you recall all the red carpets they have been replaced by classy marble. Frankly the place looks brand new. Service incredible. It \u2019s not cheap but it \u2019s singapore. If you have kids you should come here. It \u2019s the best.

Overall would stay somewhere else next time.", "offset": [280, 370], "date": "2019-07-29 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "0c5aebca-ff54-4ce5-b2b1-fcec7f30e234", "sentence": "Third visit minor unnecessary inconveniences. This is our third visit to the Shangri La Singapore. We have stayed in both the Tower Wings twice and the Valley Wing. On this occasion we stayed for 7 nights in a Junior Suite in the Tower Wing. This room is exceptional. It met all our needs couple 5 year old child. The sofa bed that comes in the room is extremely handy it folds out to a very comfortable and low lying bed for the 5 year old we did not have to worry about her rolling off. I always have to build some sort of fort on the side of any rolaway beds to create a barrier for the 5 year old so that she would not roll off but this sofa bed did not require it. The kitchenette in the Junior Suite was excellent. The king size bed was very comfortable. It was like having our own little apartment in a hotel. Everything worked and it was spotless. The room cleaning service was excellent and always attended when we requested. Restaurants. We ate at almost all of their dining outlets. Our breakfast was included in our Horizon Club Junior Suite room we chose to dine at The Line as the spread was amazing and varied. We could also choose to eat breakfast at the Horizon Club but this was more limited. We also had the Suite Life deal which is a rate that can be applied to any Suite room. This included a 200 Singapore Dollar credit per night to spend on any dining options in the hotel. This is incredible value. We chose to utilise this at the nightly themed buffets at the Line again providing incredible spreads excellent quality food of anything imaginable. Kid under 6 also eat free with any dining adult. We also ate the pool on one occasion but this was not an enjoyable experience as a thunder storm rolled in and the thunder was cracking our 5 year old was so frightened so was I to be honest and we had to move to our room to eat our food. The food was packed up and delivered cold to our room. I also tried the Lobby Lounge for a lunch one day where they provide hawker type food it was excellent. Buds. My 5 year old loves buds she went almost daily. The staff there are also engaging with the kids. The only issue was on the weekend when there were several local birthday parties booked back to back which meant that Buds was overflowing and busy with guests for the party that it was not fair on guests staying at the hotel and paying for the session rate during those times. I removed my daughter from Buds on that day because there was literally no walking room in there with all those birthday party guests. The outdoor play area and splash area was closed for renovation during the week we were there. We elected to go to Shangri La Sentosa to utilise their waterslides as we did the previous year. only this time they changed their rules to not allow Shangri La Singapore guests only in house guests and we were only made aware of this as we were packed and ready to go into our transport. I had to speak to two managers. the Horizon Club manager did not handle this well at all and referred me to the downstairs main manager. Following several phone calls to the Shangri La Sentosa manager she managed to get us permission to go and spend the day there to utilise the waterslides. What an unnecessary drama. That left a negative taste in my mouth I have to say. Checkout day As our flight was departing later in the evening and as I am in a Horizon Club Suite it is advertised that I can checkout at 4 pm on the day. I requested this late checkout we were planning on leaving at 5 pm that day anyway. I was told they were heavily booked and would need my room by 1 pm. I explained we needed a room as my husband needed to do his inhaled ventilator masks for a lung condition prior to departing on a flight the horizon club manager once again could not sort this out. I was referred to the duty manager downstairs who arranged a basic room for us to move into if I could please check out of my suite at 10 am. Anyway I graciously accepted the offer. I packed our things moved to the deluxe room and we remained there until 5 pm until we left the hotel that day. This was an unnecessary move given I should have been able to checkout out of our Suite at 4 pm as advertised and given we are return guests and having stayed at the hotel for 7 nights and spent close to 60 for this stay an extra hour should have been accommodated rather than making me pack all of our stuff and move to a deluxe room at 10 am on our checkout day. Again little things that inconvenience guests leaves a bad taste impression. All in all this remains my favourite hotel in the entire world. We find it hard to look at other places to stay this hotel is very well run. However I have to say the little inconveniences experienced during this stay the Horizon Club managers repeatedly referring me to the Duty Manager downstairs to solve issues left a bad taste and I would consider looking at other high end 5 star hotels for my next Singapore visit.", "offset": [1860, 1914], "date": "2019-11-23 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "46549b28-42cf-4eea-acff-2c9388c4ab7a", "sentence": "Jesie delivered my room.

The breakfast buffet was the largest we have ever seen. it is just not huge but very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent. Only complaint about the breakfast is the coffee service. You can make much better coffee by yourself using Nespreso machines which are available there. Room and bathroom very nicely renovated. Only complain in that sector comes from the age of the hotel. Almost 50 years ago room height was lower and there is not enough natural light in the room. One thing I suggest is please remove those large writing desks which are totally blocking the windows and takes the last spacious feeling away. The incoming experience was one the best. Whole lobby level staff is so awesome. Every time we were around there someone noticed us and came to talk. There was no difference who was it. Everyone in there behaved the same. Final conclusion was the late checkout until 5 pm combined with afternoon tea service. It was really nice to stay at hotel premises when our flight left just before midnight. Also the lobby atmosphere and design makes blissful feeling. Then the garden or how to describe that paradise around the pool. Funny feeling to be few hundred meters from Orchard street and totally inside a forest. Shuttle was a nice addition though it might go more often and directly to Orchard MRTWhen we wandered around the hotel we thought that this would be a nice place for a family vacation if you have kids.

The team went above and beyond decorating our room for her surprise. They even managed to prepare on the spot the same surprise for our 4 year old as we did not inform them that we had 2 toddlers. The hotel is grand as expected of all 5 star hotels however it was the team that made a world of difference.
