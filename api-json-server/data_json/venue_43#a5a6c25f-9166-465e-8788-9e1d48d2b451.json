Parking was not clearly marked but once found was pretty straightforward. The event hall was quite nice and the facilities were clean. The dining staff were very present but were very heavy handed during service. Almost throwing the plates down. The food was good prime rib mashed asparagus with light au jus and they offered vegan kosher and halal options upon request. One complaint was the location of the smoking area. It is out back and the area is well lit and nicely designed and apointedi t is purposely stationed 30 feet from the nearest entrance but you must walk through it to get to the parking area. Not ideal for non smokers The problem is that people congregated right outside the automatic door which lead to a wind tunnel effect where the smoke was drawn into the building and filled the reception area with the smell of cigarettes. The area was not monitored or policed by hotel staff. Other than this gripe the event was nice and overall we had an enjoyable time.

The hotel was Ok. Not terrible but not great. We were there for a conference so we did not get to choose the hotel ourselves. I understand from other travellers that this hotel is consistent with other hotels near the airport but if I compare it to other Toronto city hotels that I have strayed in at the same price point I would not have been happy. There was no bathroom door. It was basically a sliding partition that really did not work well. It did not isolate any bathroom noises. You also had to watch out when you closed the door or you got your fingers caught. The fan in the bathroom barely worked. I got a free code when I checked in but I was shocked to see that you normally have to pay for internet service unles you are a Hilton Honours member. Frankly I can not even remember the last North American hotel that I stayed that did not provide free Wifi in the room. We even had a problem with the safe. The locking mechanism was not working problem and a guy from maintenance had to pry it open with a screwdriver. We did not use it again.

Again for the use of a screen for 2 hours. They were completely blind sided by this and the job had already been completed so they signed it and paid the fee. I contacted the hotel and was put in touch with the contact person from PSAV. That person has absolutely ZERO customer service ability I expressed my concerns and he just flat out said they saw the fee and signed it completely missing the point that they saw the fee AFTER the job had been done. I suggested perhaps telling people what the fee will be when they call would be a good idea considering had they been told ahead of time they would not have used it. The response I received was the job could have been cancelled. The point was the job was already completed I would imagine most people would not cancel the job at that point. The only purpose for handling things this way is because they know their charges are ridiculous and telling people ahead of time would result in most people not using their equipment and they would lose money.
