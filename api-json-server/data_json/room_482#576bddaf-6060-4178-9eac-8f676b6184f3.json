I stayed here several nights during a business trip. It has great proximity to Irvine Spectrum Center which has almost everything you need and more. And it is within walking distance. What makes this property outstanding to me is its staff. The gentleman at check in and check out was professional and kind. I ordered room service very delicious and the servers were so friendly. They offer free shuttle to the airport. Shuttle driver was unbelievably courteous. And my housekeeper was top notch. I left a very large tip because it is so rare I receive such personal thorough housekeeping. I left a note requesting more creamer and every day extra creamer was left for me. The room was very clean both at check in and throughout the stay. Often times housekeeping can make or break a hotel stay. Room perks. AMAZING shower pressure spacious bathroom and tub good working hair dryer comfortable desk and chair to do work plenty of lighting. Nice coffee station large closet and plenty of hangers. As someone already mentioned no large seam under the door so it was possible to get the room very dark. Room service while a bit on the pricey side even for room service was delivered fast and hot and was really delicious. I did not want for anything. Except a swimsuit as I forgot mine. Cons it seemed strange to charge for parking and so much but maybe that is a thing in Cali. Also the breakfast buffet price was pretty steep but again Calis not exactly cheap either. I was a little disappointed that the buffet was not included with my room rate but that is something to be worked out between Doubletree and my company. All in all this is an excellent place to stay for business travelers. They really know what we want and need. And I am from Texas so I am accustomed to friendly people but I was bowled over how genuinely friendly and helpful the entire staff was. Not artificial at all. Only my second time to Cali but I left with a very very nice taste in my mouth.", "offset": [1136, 1254], "date": "2015-06-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "073e30cd-c2e5-4369-af74-22b5956597f5", "sentence": "Worst experience EVER.

Here is my story I booked my room through third party on September 3 2015 and I drove four hours from my home to this hotel I arrived at the hotel 401 am. I tried to checking in. but the manager told me that I can not checking you in due to the system is on processing to starting a new day. I was shocked. She received my booking a day a go and they have a data that showing them a person should be here any time why should I go and make the room ready to him. I have been traveling around the world and usually when I check in late they told me your room is ready and we will take a copy of your ID and credit and we will put them on the system when it work. What happened to me is she told me we can not check you in because of the system starting a new date and you will have to wait around 10 minutes to 30 as will as we will charge you the parking for a whole day. I was very disappointing that she did not even bother herself to make her customer satisfied. After 35 40 minutes waiting outside. she let me chick in I was so tired and trying to avoid Any arguments. I took my keys and she told me you can park your car and we will charge you Hourly instead of a whole Day. is she really the manager. I went to my room very tired and the big surprise was waiting me on the Bathroom. Please check the Pic attached because it explain its self. I went to her and show her the Picture. her response was Sorry that happened to you we did not put you in this room purposely. I was like seriously. She said without even feeling sorry to what happened how can I help you I told her I can not afford anymore this kind of treatment you did not even bother yourself I am leaving. She said OK fine we will go ahead and refund the money. I went to other hotel and booked a new room. it is 6 am right now and I could not sleep because of how she treated me badly.
