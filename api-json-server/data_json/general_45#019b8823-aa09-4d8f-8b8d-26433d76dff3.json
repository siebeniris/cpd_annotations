It is hard for me to understand the negative reviews that The Reach was not what they expected from a Waldorf Astoria resort. I have stayed at the NYC Waldorf Astoria and was n\u2019t expecting nor wanting NYC facilities in funky Key West. I felt that the hotel was a wonderful combination of playful Key West with grounds that were fun and well kept and with a staff that made sure they gave their guests a Waldorf Astoria experience with consent concern for our comfort. Front Desk Manager Cindy Acevedo took care of my needs well before I arrived at the hotel by answering my endless questions. When she learned it was my 60th birthday there were balloons champagne and chocolates waiting for me and my husband in an upgraded room. The front staff \u2019s two Milenas. and Andrei always greeted us by name and asked if we needed anything. The cheerful guys who opened the door for us each time we left and returned to the hotel continually wished us a good day. The beach staff would bring out a lounge chair. it \u2019s cover with an umbrella and place them on my favorite spot of the beach without me asking them to. The restaurant staff was friendly and attentive. A special shout out to Jeremy who made me feel like family. To end with Key West is not known for it \u2019s beaches. I choose this hotel because it had a beach that was just perfect private sandy and clean. If you are looking for a place to stay in Key West with an engaging international staff that is located far enough away from Duval Street to have a quite relaxing time yet close enough to walk to all the downtown fun museums and restaurants then I highly recommend The Reach.", "offset": [253, 485], "date": "2016-01-15", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "f4e76b73-ff40-45bd-a3f9-3447fd538ac4", "sentence": "Great location and a bit more relaxed and casual.

The grounds and rooms were not as high end as Casa Marina but the cost was less too. I actually liked the grounds here better because the beach area was MUCH nicer than many other places I have stayed. Our suite was 316 and they called it garden view. Actually while we looked over the pool it had a LOVELY view of the ocean as well. Pleasant surprise. Also this was an end unit with a HUGE balcony great for the pups to wander around outside safely.

To our surprise the hotel welcomed us also gave us a godie bag with free bottle of champagne Key Lime cookies and immediately checked us into our room which we thought was wonderful. Our room was located on the 5th floor with a beautiful view of the private beach and we really enjoyed sipping coffee from the Nespreso machine while sitting out on our own deck. The bed was very comfortable. A C worked great and more importantly I slept well which is something I rarely do when sleeping away from home. Room did not have a dresser but the closet was big enough to hang up all the clothes we wanted to keep wrinkle free. I had read about bad maid service but we never ran into that problem. Every morning at around the time we had leave for breakfast the maid arrived our room was cleaned before we had return. All in all it was a wonderful vacation and I would not hesitate to book there again. Every employee including the desk and every doorman maid and bartender went above and beyond to make our stay great. And best of all The Reach is the only hotel in KW that has their own private beach which we used every day of our stay.

This is my third time staying at the Reach and yes it is expensive but the beach and views are worth it in my opinion. The rooms are okay nothing extraordinary nothing terrible either. The best thing about the room was the cold A C I have stayed a few places on the island that were too warm. The food at the restaurant was incredible. We ate breakfast and lunch there and even contemplated having dinner as well. That too is worth the money. What caused me to give this a lower rating was the valet parking and the pool. First the previous times we stayed here we were able to self park. When we arrived we were told we had to valet at 27 a night. What aggravated us was that the valet people rushed us to get our stuff out of the car we had gone to the beach earlier in the day and had stuff all over the trunk. After they rudely rushed us they left the car idling in front of the entrance for 10 minutes before they parked it. So they rushed us to get everything out of our car and then just let it sit there running not cool. Second was the pool. The pool was very nice but no one came around for drinks until the afternoon. My wife wanted a pina colada and I had to grab a waitress who was very nice inside the restaurant to make one. I have never seen an ocean front resort not serving drinks all day. So people ended up bringing their own drinks into the pool which was fine but it got a little trashy. Also it was clear that not everyone in the pool was a guest of the hotel. I heard people talking about this and other guests were upset but nothing was done. I am not trying to be a snob but when you spend 400 a night at the Waldorf Astoria you should not have to put up with this. They need to get this under control.

The bell staff are friendly cheerful and helpful. The restaurant was upscale with an interesting menu and the wait staff we had dealings with were friendly and competent. The grounds were lovely with a nice albeit small pool and beach. Our room was large with a wet bar small refrigerator and coffee maker. The bath room was of good size and had standard amenities. The room also had and iron and ironing board. The only negative was the lack of drawer shelf space for clothes. One small shelf above and below the safe and one on each night stand. Upon check in on Thursday we were advised there was construction underway in garage area. We were offered a room on opposite side of building which we accepted. Before 80 am the next morning we were awakened by the sound of drilling into concrete. It seemed to be coming from the room next to ours. Upon inquiry at the front desk later I was assured there was no construction in the vicinity of our room. It was suggested the noise we heard was transmitted through the walls from the garage area. I was offered a bottle of wine for our inconvenience. Imaging my surprise when later during our visit the door to the room next to ours was open slightly and a sign Fresh Paint was stuck to the wall. When I mentioned this to the desk clerk I was assured there was no construction going on in that room only renovation. Late Saturday afternoon 430 or so as we were leaving the hotel we inquired at the front desk if our room was going to be serviced that day. We were assured it would be and they would send someone up right away to take care of it. When we returned that evening the room had been serviced. The next day Sunday we were in and out of the room a couple of times. At approximately 430 we left for the evening and our room had still not been serviced. Given our experience the previous day I assumed they operated on a short staff and our room was one of the last to be serviced so I did not ask about it at the front desk. You can imagine our surprise when we returned at approximately 1030pm and found our room had still not been serviced. I called the front desk and asked if the resort serviced guest rooms on Sunday. I was assured they did. I then asked why ours had not been serviced. There was no answer only an apology and an offer to send someone up immediately which I declined. I discussed this with the front desk staff when checking out and was given an apology. The young lady checked her computer and found a note about my noise complaint but nothing about the house keeping issues. She assured me she would make sure the house keeping supervisor was made aware of the situation. A little too late for that in my opinion. I expected more from a hotel of this caliber.

Room interior is good but all the balconies roofs are chipped off and the Reinforced Concrete is giving away so its steel bars are visible in the balconies. they just repainted those bars instead of repairing the entire balconies which is not a good idea from a structural point of view.

Also we see more credit card charges which we never spent. Waldorf Resort personal said they can not help as it is third party even though the bill came on their name. We trusted Waldorf but looks like the hotel do not have any idea that Barefoot Billys is worthless. Finally we stayed in the hotel because we got it for discount.

I booked my stay as a package flight and hotel deal through Expedia. Booked a two queen bed with city view. Good. The Reach is located in the quiet part of key West. The beach has sand the sister hotel Casa Marina has coral. It was an easy walk to visit and use the Casa Marina pool and beach. The reach has a nice pier that goes out over the water. The beach has hammocks I liked that. Chairs set up on beach by staff upon request. The grounds have lined palm trees descending toward the ocean artistic statues of men playing cards and a guy taking a nap next to the chess game. Staff is courteous and respectful. Location of the hotel makes for an easy walk to restaurants and Duval street. They allowed me to check into my room early 12 noon but read bellow. The king bed was nice and balcony had a very nice view of property and ocean. Bad The lobby for that size hotel is small. Does not have tropical or nautical decor that welcomes you to an island. Our first room and bathroom was too small for two kids and two adults. The bathtub looked like someone was banging on it with a screw driver had dings all on the bottom of it. We immediately ask to for a different room or an upgrade. We decided for an upgrade for a fee to a king studio with pull out sofa bed would not recommend sleeping on. There were small but visible stains on sofa and carpet and small cigarette burn to furniture in room. Bathroom shower had mold imbedded into caulk at base of shower. The columns capitals on balcony falling apart and some completely missing. The railings post trim along walkway to room rotted. The elevator by pool dingy and ceiling light filled with debris. The walkway to rooms had patch work and looked dirty. Seaweed on beach so thick would not walk on beach and it smells. Overall opinion I expected more from the name but Hilton owns both Casa Marina and the Reach. The hotel needs repairs. Two queen bed room way to small for four people. do not trust the pictures on website. I expected more for the price. Would not return to this hotel.

We just stayed here for 5 nights with our two young kids. We had a fabulous time overall. If we had n\u2019t gotten such a good deal on our stay we would give a lower rating based on our horrific housekeeping experience. The first two days of our stay housekeeping did n\u2019t come until after 30 which was fine because we stayed at the beach later than that. The third day we got back to our room at 50 and our room had n\u2019t been cleaned. We had dinner reservations and no clean towels to shower with. I called and asked for some to be sent up. A housekeeper brought a pile of bath towels hand towels and only one washcloth. As I was getting ready to shower I realized that the washcloth felt a little damp. I inspected it further and to my horror I realized that the inside of the washcloth she had brought was covered in blood stains and yellow stuff. It was so disgusting. My husband called and asked for the manager to come look at what was left in our room. She looked at it and said \u201c this is not to our standards \u201d. No kidding. Who \u2019s standards would a used washcloth of this nature meet exactly. We were brought some more bath towels and some washcloths in a shopping bag. Throughout this ordeal we missed our dinner reservations. It would \u2019ve been nice if the hotel tried a little harder to make up for this revolting experience. Maybe a free breakfast or a big apology or SOMETHING to make up for it. Some people on here have complained about the dirty hallways but that did n\u2019t bother me because the hallways are outside and it \u2019s Key West so it \u2019s a much more laid back Waldorf than most. I even enjoyed hearing the roosters in the morning and the air conditioning sound did n\u2019t bother me. Our bed was VERY comfortable. However the carpet in our room was so dirty that each time one of us walked on it barefoot our feet turned black. Also little things were not taken care of. The cups were not replaced in the bathroom. The toiletries were not replaced. The kitchenette garbage was not taken out. Our room was cleaned late each day. The rest of the property and our experience at the hotel was very nice. The beach is the best I saw while I was there and the guys working at the beach were awesome setting up our chairs near the water each day. The beach is the best part of this hotel. It \u2019s absolutely gorgeous and does n\u2019t have coral preventing you from entering the water. There was good food service on the beach. Joseph the concierge was very helpful as well. He gave us some great tips on visiting Malory Square. Our dinner at Spencer \u2019s was delicious. Tuna tartare was so good. The breakfast was overpriced and there was n\u2019t much to choose from. This hotel is located close to the southernmost point and Duval Street. There \u2019s plenty to do within walking distance. Overall I liked this hotel. I would probably stay here again because of the beach and I really liked what The Reach had to offer.

No dresser to put your clothes in and our bathroom was so small you could not open or shut the door if on the throne. The city view is a treat of trash trucks and delivery trucks waking you up as they back up with beeping at 5am. The first unacceptable thing we dealt with was the rate. We are Diamond club Hilton members and the day before our stay we received an email stating for 21 a day we could be upgraded to a city view suite with a separate living room area. My husband had to work from his computer a bit so we thought this was ideal. He decided though to wait til we check in as they may upgrade us for free due to our status and it is ofseason in the Keys. When we arrived EJ stated that there were no city view suites available and that if we wanted one the next day it would be an additional 120 a night. This was not what our email stated but I was not going to argue with him. He wanted an additional 300 a night for an oceanview which really are not since these rooms are in front of the pool. He claimed we had a great room which we certainly did not. There is a high turnover of management as well and front desk did not answer phone the four times we tried to call. Calls rolled over to the sister resort Casa Marina and the staff there says it is constantly happening. The housekeeping and pool beach staff were great. Bartenders nice but overpriced waterdowned drinks are served. The Hilton corporate office will be contacted I can not believe this property is in the shape it is in and it is a blow to the Waldorf name. The last straw with us is that we discovered upon leaving the bellman had dropped my personal laptop and broke the screen when we checked in. He clearly dropped the tote bag as he was bringing our luggage up to our room. We did not use the laptop at all so we discovered it when we left. It worked fine during the afternoon when we got to the hotel. We have an insurance claim in with the Hilton at this time. It would have been nice if he had been honest about it and calls to the main general manager were never returned regarding itit is hard to stomach that we paid over 300 a night for such a disgrace of a hotel. the beach is nice but so are Southernmosts and the Pier go there instead.", "offset": [0, 64], "date": "2018-08-03", "cpt": "3", "category": "general"}, {"id": 35, "uid": "7850a393-bb9c-4fcc-b16c-78dd479f197c", "sentence": "Terrible Experience. My husband and I expected a lot more from a Hilton Waldorf Astoria hotel. On the second day of our stay a valet wrecked our vehicle and destroyed a new stand up paddle board purchased specifically for this trip. We can overlook this mistake but the treatment by the management Taj Bhandal on duty was terrible. Once we were notified of the accident my husband spent about an hour removing what was left of the roof rack system while a member of the management team3 security guards and 2 valets looked on without even an offer to call a mechanic or even a hotel maintenance worker. The only thing management would tell us after the accident was there will be no compensation at the hotel level. The manager actually said as far as we are concerned we are done. You will have to deal with our insurance company. The majority of our time in Key West was spent on the phone with the insurance company and sending emails to Hiltons corporate office. We drove 1000 miles and brought along 3 paddle boards with the expectations of enjoying the island by paddle board. We had to rent paddle boards and pay for excursions to paddle different spots around the island. Considering the 400 a night cost the hotel was not what we expected. There are no service elevators so you may have to ride the elevator with a cart full of soiled linens. The shower curtain was about 2 inches too short so each time we showered the bathroom would flood. We had to put towels on the floor to keep the water from running into the room. The furniture was scuffed up and the complementary WIFI was nonexistent. The front desk told us to use it on the balcony. did not work there either. The beach area smelled of raw sewage we were told it was the seaweed on the beach but later told by a staff member the smell was due to the hotels waste water pump. do not know if this is a fact but regardless the smell was awful. The only positive things are the valet bellhop staff. These guys were great. The view from our room was awesome 42 and the landscaping was maintained. This is the first review that I have ever submitted and it could have been so much better if the hotel had taken initiative to accommodate our needs after the accident. It has been 2 weeks since the incident. and we are still waiting on the insurance company to pay for the damages to our vehicle and the paddle board.

Poor Customer service poor noise level that does not allow for restful sleep. Took over 15 minutes to be acknowledged at bar. Valet staff very rude. The shower was so small we had to shower facing the glass wall of shower. Maid service never appeared during a two day stay. Had to request extra towels due to no service. I was awakened several times during the day when napping along with throughout the night when people came in and out of courtyard area. In the morning the room above me had young children. Something was broken which I heard along with the kids crying and the father trying to help.

I will say the location and the property grounds were beautiful. The restaurant does have an issue with the local birds coming into the dinning area outside and swooping in to the point of breaking glasses and people literally getting up to avoid them fighting over food on top of the guests. The hotel is older and though clean it does show signs of an older place and the rooms like most locations in the keys is smaller than what most may be use to. I was not crazy about the staff we had a few asks and they never came through with them or seemed to show much care to. They were polite just not helpful.

This was my second visit to The Reach and my first visit since the operator changed from Waldorf to Hilton. In general the hotel is great. the beach and the pool are excellent. The restaurant is OK but seemed expensive for what was on offer. Without any loyalty benefits it would be very easy to spend over 200 per day for breakfast lunch and dinner for two people. Refurbished rooms are very nice. Beach staff are great. always helpful and always have useful information about the area. Restaurant staff seem to have slightly less ability in communication but they will get there. My only warning beware of wedding partys. The music was way to loud and went on far too long. Also whatever rate is quoted for rooms will also attract resort charge plus taxes which adds around 500 per night to the rate.", "offset": [525, 618], "date": "2020-03-12", "cpt": "5", "category": "general"}]}
