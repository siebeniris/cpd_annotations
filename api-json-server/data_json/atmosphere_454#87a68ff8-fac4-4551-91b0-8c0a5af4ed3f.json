It was not the sight you want to see on the first day of your Honeymoon. The staff were adequate but clearly distressed by their working environment. The room was nice however our view was of the Air conditioning unit so not ideal and on the ground floor next to the chaos. You enter via the service entrance and are greeted with great big plastic sheets dust and men in hard hats. We did make a complaint as for 2 days we did not have running water during some points of the day. They did offer us breakfast in the restaurant below. They also said they will provide us with a bottle of champagne which was not delivered so we had to chase. The location is fantastic and is only 2 blocks to the wharf area and other restaurants and shops. Overall I am sure it will be lovely when it is finished.

I booked this hotel with high expectations as everyone mentions location. Yes you are close to Fisherman \u2019s Wharf but you can get a nicer hotel even closer. The reason for my low reviews is that this hotel is a area FULL of aggressive homeless people and drug users. They sleep and congregate right in front of the entrance of the hotel meaning when you walk out and they harass you. In addition if you are given the rooms facing that area like mines 428 you will hear them all night arguing and fighting. The common are inside the hotel is nice the fire pits are awesome the welcome drink is appreciated what was not appreciated was the ac broke in our room twice and one of the times the even forgot to come fix it. When we called because we were drenched in sweat an employee brought us a fan that made the worse noise. I called the front desk at 4 am and was told we can switch you to another room this would \u2019ve been appreciated if it was offered the first night not at 4 am the night we have to catch a flight at 7 am. The next morning I advised the manager what happen and showed her a video of the loud fan and she deducted 1 night even though we had 2 nights of no air conditioner. Honestly I would \u2019ve rather paid double but had a nice hotel experience. They truly need to clean up the area of homeless. My advice do n\u2019t walk around the area after dark not even to eat because it \u2019s dangerous as the homeless or drugies harass you asking for money and scream obscenities at you when you do n\u2019t give it or worse of you see them using the bathroom in front of you.

I stayed at the Hotel Zoe for 2 nights and I would advise potential customers to avoid this hotel and stay in one of the many other excellent San Francisco hotels. The hotel adds extra charges and includes unnecessary costs in the small print and their staff are dishonest and not up front when asked to explain these charges. I booked the hotel and prepaid in advance through Hotelscom. During my stay I billed nothing to the room. After leaving the hotel I noticed a 60 dollar charge had been billed to my card that I had not been told about on check out. When I emailed the hotel to query this amount they said it was a resort fee for wifi free bottled water in the room use of the gym and newspapers in the lobby. I did not use any of these extras and expect them as standard in other hotels. Indeed there was actually a sign in my room saying bottled water cost 5 and my booking said internet was free. I feel these extra charges were a negative end to my trip. Charging 30 per night for an unused gym and an unread newspaper in the lobby is extortionate.

We stayed for 3 nights at the Hotel Zoe at Fisherman \u2019s Wharf in San Francisco. It is small and quaint hotel in a great location. Close to the Powell Mason cable car and a couple of blocks from the wharf. We had a small suite and I mean small. Enough room for a single or married couple but we had our 12 year old with us and it was a little close quartered for my taste. The barn doors that closed off the bathroom and the living room were stylish but the bathroom door did not close all the way and prevented any level of privacy while in use. The room was pricey and did n\u2019t seem like the experience matched the price. I ate dinner in the restaurant Pescatore. and it was very good reasonably priced and had excellent service. The next morning I ate breakfast there to a completely opposite experience. The waiter served me never refilled my coffee acted surprised when I wanted syrup with my French toast and never returned to bring me the bill. I had ordered eggs and bacon to take back to the room for my son and asked about getting a small carafe of coffee for my wife. I was informed that was a room service feature and I would have to order it through them. They did bring out 2 over easy eggs and bacon in a cardboard to go box. When I asked if I could grab a small plate to take to the room for the eggs I was told by the manager that too was a room service feature and I would have to order from the room. I overheard the waiter argue with the table next to me that Brunch was from 7am10am and they could n\u2019t order off of the breakfast menu. It was 730am at the time.
