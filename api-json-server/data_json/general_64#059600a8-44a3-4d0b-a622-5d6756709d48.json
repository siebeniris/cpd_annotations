My wife and I stayed at the Gran Meli\u00e1 Puerto Rico December 30th 14January 3rd. 15. As with our previous stay there we were highly impressed by the beauty of the property and the size and condition of our Red Level Room. Gigantic bathroom and shower nice jacuzi spotless cleanliness comfortable bed. We dined at Chef Myrtas restaurant had room service one night and dined at the other hotel food outlets during our stay and having stayed there before I must say that the quality of the food offerings has increased significantly. Same with the service staff around the hotel and bars. They have an Avis car rental booth on the premises so it was easy to go an explore the el Yunque rainforest the nearby beaches and local food offerings in the east coast of Puerto Rico. The Trump International Golf Club within the hotel premises was excellent as well. Overall a really nice experience.

We visited the Melia for our Anniversary weekend. The reviews I read were very erratic from good to bad so I was very uncertain about out visit here. Firstly I have to communed the Melia on its outstanding service. Everyone we came into contact with was extremely helpful and very nice and most importantly not annoying ie no one bothered us about time share stuff. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Certain areas like the pools and concrete ie stairs and walkways need to a facelift and this is where the resort shows its age. Our room was a garden view RedLevel. The room had everything we needed spacious great shower comfy bed wifi no complaints. The outside of the units really could use a power washing the walls tiles stairs etc. I would recomend if you opt to stay at this resort you go for the RedLevel rooms. We are definitely not the type that needs pampering we are more like if we need you just be available. But you do get a lot of perks. Breakfast was included which is a BIG plus because the restaurants are very pricy you get a 3 hour happy hour nightly drinks and snacks you get a Cabana daily wish is awesome access to the adults only pool which is nice and quiet a butler if you need him and our unit was also the first row closest tot he beach. The resort is very spread out and there were always golf carts driving around and staff always offered you a ride. The beach while pituresque is not a great for swimming. There is a reef about 100 ft out so the waters are quite shallow and rocky. Its more of a place to chill swing from a hammock and read a book. We ate at Passion 3 times my husband need his fix of local food. The first 2 times the food was amazing the last night eh not too great both our dishes were eh. Again the restaurants are very pricy. Overall we were very pleased with our stay at the Melia. It was a quiet and relaxing weekend for sure.

Well after reading review after review here is an honest assessment. You must go RedLevel and you must understand the positives of the hotel and do not harp the negatives. Hope this review will set some things straight. For starters this is not a white sand beach resort nor some high energy lots of traffic hustle and bustle stay I get enough of that in NY. Our stay was quiet and there is not much of a beach to lay by. There are iguanas there Puerto Rico is loaded with them. it is a major resort do not expect budget prices. This resort is beautifully landscaped beautifully decorated with many sitting areas and beautifully detailed with many finishings. It is not to far from the airport but I recommend renting a car. We rented a full size from Budget for about 180 for 4 nights. Taxi would be about 70 80 each way from what we are told. You have to also pay for parking but just valet it for similar costs and you can call valet and they will have it ready whenever you need. Also press 0 on your phone gets you a ride whenever you need it. Pressing 0 gets you pretty much whatever you need actually and I was not shy to call them but every time they were accommodating. Check in was smooth. I originally booked an oceanfront junior suite and was upgraded to the villa 2103 the Maria Antonia. We were offered welcome drinks and were explained how to best access and utilize the hotel services. Our room was not ready just yet and we ate at the pool cafe. Turkey burger and mahi was above average for a pool barOur villa was gorgeous. Private outdoor seating for 4 our own pool 5 ft deep covered canopy day bed and 4 lounge chairs with an umbrella. Upon entering you open to a very large suite. Living room which merged into a bedroom. Then the toilet showers and two full closets. Past that was a whirlpool tub and his and her sinks. Our bed was extremely comfortable and had 4 pillows plus throws. We my girlfriend and I spent most of our time at our villa. We brought a speaker and relaxed outside with music during our down time. Our first day we rented a private boat out of a local marina to take us island hopping and snorkeling at Icacos reef and palomino island. Our second day we did the atv tour in the rainforest followed by a day in Old San Juan. Will review separately. However there was a hidden gem at concierge by the name of Valerie. She helped us with whatever we needed and I would definitely utilize her. As for the resort I pretty much opened the gym each morning around 6 am. Outdated but did the trick with some treadmills and dumbbells up to 60lbs. Had the complimentary breakfast buffet every morning which was quick and had what every diner would offer. As for dinners Passions restaurant was good and I recommend the stuffed peppers and the paella. Nami was very good and our waiter Jose was excellent. The infuriado roll and the ribs were very tasty desserts were definitely something to try. We attempted to eat at La Cava which overlooked the rainforest but were told they were not serving after 9 pm so we had turn around and wound up making a late dinner at Tempo which had an excellent filet mignon. There are many places to sit and just relax and take in a nice evening which certainly beats the winter of New York. There was some entertainment at the lobby bar music and karaoke but we did not really partake past a drink at the bar. Overall if you are looking for a relaxing stay book the Gran Melia. Rent a car. Red level is a must. Take advantage of the upgrades and the vouchers RedLevel offer and you will be much more satisfied.", "offset": [496, 545], "date": "2016-02-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "8c74e20c-2b19-4de8-9a33-70bc8e586a9b", "sentence": "Excellent Experience.

The beach is more shell than sand but the pools are beautiful and the resort is so close to Luquilo Beach that this was no issue.

Room service was horrible and so it was difficult to even get a room to be cleaned up. The best thing is the guys in the golf carts who were so nice and the hamacks on the beach.

Well this one did not we had to walk to the front desk and ask them to Warm our food up behind the desk. He next day the housekeeping came while we was gone and just put new Clean towels in the room and Made the bed with the same sheets. And did not clear our bathroom the tub was still dirty. We had to call some to come back and clean it which they ended up whic our room because the Shower Curtains had Mildew Mold on it and my boyfriend flipped out. The Guy at the front desk would not get him a Supervisor once he started let the people know that was checking what was going on in our room. A supervisor came out the office. Lol funny right. She said she had to move us because the stuff they USE to get the mildew out is Very Strong. So that is let me know you have Knowledge of this Problem. The new room they did put us in had a broken sliding glass door smh. And the Power went out for about 15 minutes in the new room. 16 dollars a day to Park which we was there 5 days never again. The pool was very far from our villa and the shuttle takes forever to come. I can go on and on for days but I am done at this point.

Staff do not care to offer help most servers and staff pretend they do not see you. extremely expensive too. A 3 ounce beer like the size of a mini soda was 5. Dinner for 2 adults and 3 kids about 150 plus tip. Also this hotel gives day passes to the local people that lives there and ruins the tourist experience. For this reason the pool is overcrowded full of Spanish people screaming. I am Spanish but this was too crazy. Also they were always out of towels in the pool area and the restaurant in the pool closed at 5 everyday. To go to the rooms which were far from lobby pool and restaurants you had to take a golf cart that fitted about 6 people and of course get in line for that too. The 500 dollars hotel credit that was advertised in website is actually a book with checks that they give you with discounts for the hotel. For example 10 off 30 for drinks. One margarita is about 11 half the size of a regular glass. In this book there is a 200 coupon for room upgrade but of course there was never a room available for that. The rest of the coupons was mostly for spa services. The rooms advertised in pictures are not what you will be getting. Outdated rooms and bathrooms.

Deposit I understand all hotels have security deposits but this one was a huge surprise to me as it was a 500 deposit on a credit card they expect upfront. They do return this after your stay but again it was just very unexpected. The resort credit that was included is a form of a coupon book. The rooms were very humid and smelled of mildew. Our AC did not get too cold. but it was not too bad. Our phones did not work they never sent anyone to fix them we had to figure it out ourselves. The fridge in the room also did not work wires were hanging from inside the fridge. We did not bother to mess with itThe entire pool needs surfacingrough on your feet and a good cleaning around the caulking parts.

Staff was very kind and informed our breakfast area was at waters edge it was supposed to be a \u201c made to order \u201d breakfast. Room was newly renovated and spacious. Beware bathroom floor can be VERY slippery. Bed is quite comfy. The beach is rocky and dangerous would n\u2019t recommend going in. Romservice was a bit slow but I will take in consideration that kitchen was quite far from the room. Ordered a burger not sure of the name but it was incredibly delicious. Kitchen staff contacted our room to pick up the dishes they were very sweet. I believe room service is also from water edge restaurant. Tried to make a reservation and this happened. concierge said that due to low season we could walk in any restaurant and that they would let us in but was wrong. As we arrived to the asian restaurant they said I NEEDED reservations but the manager was nice enough to let us in after I told them what concierge had said. We ordered teriyaki spicy chicken from tepanyaki table and a steak. Did not like the teriyaki chicken it was just plain and pretty much siracha sauce. Chef tried to be funny and made jokes because we ordered a medium well steak still trying to figure what was funny about it that \u2019s how we like our steak. Inappropriate and unprofessional. Pool is amazing drinks are a bit on the expensive and watered down but do n\u2019t get snacks here they are just OVERPRICED. Breakfast at waters edge is amazing Alexandra provides the best service. There is not much to be done inside this resort it is more as a private getaway to disconnect from everything else which I did enjoy. There are a few fast foods outside the resort but could n\u2019t find a nice restaurant outside so you will pretty much me obligated to consume food inside the hotel nice business strategy. We ended extending our mini vacay one more night and this is what pissed me out. Even though our stay included breakfast they tried to charge us some fees for the original stay. Thankfully manager Jos\u00e9 took care of it. Bu after extending our stay one more night they did not specified our breakfast area had CHANGED therefore we ended having breakfast at watersedge again and guess what. they charged me an extra 100 for it. I strongly suggest asking front desk and making sure you know the correct place breakfast will be served because you could end up paying amazing but overpriced food for their convenient \u201c mistake \u201d.", "offset": [1280, 1434], "date": "2019-12-19", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "aa74c993-5b86-4627-88b7-490532ace767", "sentence": "Nori Restaurant. We went to Nori during our stay at the Hyat and we loved it. Food was great and service was even better. Our waitress Deisha was a true gem.

We had the pleasure of staying at the Hyat Regency at Coco Beach in Puerto Rico over MLK weekend. It \u2019s a self styled 5 star resort and while it \u2019s not quite yet at that level with some minor improvements it \u2019l get there. Pros As an Explorist we got upgraded to an ocean view room which was pretty spectacular see photos. Check in was quick and smooth with a rum punch offered whilst we were waiting for a short time. The warmness and hospitality of the staff was a consistent theme The room itself is finished to a high standard though I do have a minor quibble that the smart TV did n\u2019t have a casting feature it may be an idea to bring a Roku or similar with you or indeed for the property to make some investments and have Rokus to rent etc. The bath tub and rainfall shower were superb The grounds are spectacular in particular the pool area. The property is a little bit limited in what they can do with the beach and efforts were ongoing to clean it up but the pool more than makes up for it. The swim up bar and it \u2019s pina coladas are excellent. There is some walking between your room and the various locations but you can call reception to send a golf cart to pick you up. I enjoyed the leisurely walks however Location is about an hour from San Juan but honesty I thought it perfect for a relaxing getaway. You can easily chill in the grounds but at the same time El Yunque Luquilo and San Juan itself are accessible. There are a lot of activities to enjoy in the area if you feel like getting out and about Amenities are plentiful the pool bar and taco truck are perfect for lazy no frills lounging. Paisan is a superb restaurant. The lobby bar has an eclectic cocktail list. Prices are reasonable for a resort 4 for a small beer 8 for a pina colada 12 for fish tacos. The golf course is easily accessible and a good layout though in poor condition during my visit. There are floodlit tennis courts also available. Cons It \u2019s still being finished so there are some rough edges. They are presently working on a dedicated spa building so that element will be improved I imagine. The beach area needs a little work The pool area waiters as mentioned in other reviews just are n\u2019t on the ball at all. It was n\u2019t very busy and yet we still had to chase them for additional orders or to close out the check. The pool bar staff in contrast are excelent Parking for 17 a day is excessive. Particularly when one absolutely needs a rental if you intend on leaving the resort Uber can drop off but not pick up and taxis are expensive. It \u2019s a 4755 star hotel that when it \u2019s finished will be an excellent property to vacation in.", "offset": [869, 1020], "date": "2020-01-24", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "1ce60455-27fb-4e97-8f83-a6621fc3766a", "sentence": "This is not a 5star hotel as advertised. The service reflects more of a 3star. I am extremely disappointed with the level of service experienced. First I paid in advance for a package that was advertised as having daily breakfast included unfortunately when I arrived the hotel refused to honor the special. Second when I arrived to my room there was used glass cups knives and forks from a previous room service. After the first night the dirty dishes were still sitting outside of my room. I reported to Jean at the front desk and showed him a picture. He promised to have housekeeping remove the dishes but they were never removed and STILL there when I checked out 3 days later. Third service at the pool bar was extremely slow. I ordered a mixed drink which never came and I waited for about 30 minutes then decided to walk over to the bar myself. Also it was almost impossible to find someone walking by our lounge chairs while at the pool. In 5 hours I saw a staff member only twice. Fourth the beach was extremely rocky and not really too accessible. Jean at the front desk was aware of this and suggested we leave the resort and go to Luquilo Beach instead where the beach is much better and actually usable. Guests should be advised of the condition of the beach as this hotel advertises itself as a beach front resort. Lastly the location was very inconvenient. There were no Uber car services available as it was too far away from attractions. You have to use the hotel \u2019s taxi which is average 35 or more each way. Airport shuttle was 65 each way. I \u2019ve stayed at St Regis Bahia Beach on my previous trip to PR and the level of service was completely different as that was truly a 5star experience. I would like to give compliments to the trolley cart drivers and bellmen as they were all very polite and accommodating. Also Juan at the Water \u2019s Edge restaurant provided exceptional service. Sadly I do not believe I will book at another Hyat. I do n\u2019t like to feel cheated or taken advantage of which was definitely the vibe here.", "offset": [308, 413], "date": "2020-02-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "1ffc5855-cfa8-48ec-bb6c-51349b05a330", "sentence": "So much potential. This hotel is in the middle of renovations after being taken over by Hyat. The rooms are nice and spacious and the grounds are pretty nice with a long stretch of beach and activities for kids. The service is friendly but slow. Upon check in they gave me the farthest room possible. I asked the man how far of a walk it was and he said 3 4 minutes. Maybe he misheard me it was a 3 4 min buggy and 20 min walk. While I \u2019m fine walking I was solo and it was dark AF. I also did n\u2019t wana get stuck in the rain at night. I called and asked to switch to a closer room and was given one next to the main complex. Why not give me this room to begin with. I do n\u2019t know. The pool and beach are both very nice. The gym is OK. A bit surprised at how small it was for how big the resort was but there were n\u2019t many people there so maybe the demand is low. The spa was under renovations and given the ridiculous pricing I did not make it. Pricing at the pool and bars were good food was OK. The service at the Water \u2019s Edge was great. Melanie was awesome and the churasco I had and tres leches both so good. The second night I ate at the Latin restaurant on site but not part of the hotel. The Ropa Vieja plantains and the guava fried cheesecake were so good but the service was SOoO SLOW. I had to ask for water 5 times when I first got seated took about 10 min and never got a refill. The beds were really uncomfortable for me. I think they were not replaced with the renovations and sunk in. The pillows were poor quality all too high and hard. The bathrooms were well lit but water pressure not good. Beware of the mosquitos. Even w det I got bit up the first night and do not usually. They should have some insect repellent sprayed on the grounds and perhaps mosquito nets in the rooms. WiFi was iffy came in and out. There were ice machines and water machines to refill bottles but the water was n\u2019t cold and annoyingly no water stations at the pool. The service there was incredibly slow as well. 20 30 min for a drink. Even at the bar if you walked up to get ice servers just ignored you. It seemed disorganized and a bit of a free for all. Think they need dedicated bar staff to focus on making drinks for pool orders and staff focused on making drinks for people that walked up to the bar. Also if they installed a couple of water stations they would save a lot of service time filling water requests. I got tired of waiting I saved my cup and refilled ice and water on my own at the station by the room.", "offset": [2418, 2520], "date": "2020-02-17", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 29, "uid": "0e770de0-e5e9-4d53-b8a5-58269d8997af", "sentence": "Beautiful resort with outstanding Service. My family and I just got back from a weeks stay at this resort. Despite two days of rain the resort was outstanding. One or two minor issues but I found the staff to be incredibly accommodating. Things I noticed that I wanted to share for other families considering this resort Roms very nice and relatively big. We had two doubles and while beds were small it was more than comfortable for my family of 4 two kids 6 4. My one issue was the shower was very slippery so make sure kids are careful it \u2019s all smooth tile so was incredibly slippery when wet. We also had a ground floor ocean front which was incredible. Kids loved playing on the beach while my wife and I would have a drink on the patio. Resort Pols the pool was huge but so much fun. Kids loved the shallow areas all around and adults enjoyed the swim up bar. Prices were reasonable kids loved their Shirley Temples for 3 and I liked the Medala Beers for 5 and sangria 8. Most adult drinks were 4 12. My only minor complaint here was that the resort said they had daily activities but we never saw any or heard announcements for them. Kind of disappointing as I know my kids would have liked that and enjoyed meeting other kids there. Maybe this was due to the resort being low occupancy the pool was practically empty most of the week. Restaurants we rented a car as several previous reviews were 100 accurate that one is needed for longer stays more than 3 nights in my opinion. We at our most nights but honestly had our best meal of the week at the resorts Nori hibachi restaurant. Really good quality food and the kids loved the entertainment. The Italian restaurant food was decent with the views right on the ocean being the highlight. Ofsite restaurants were so so. We went twice to a sushi place W Sushi which got good reviews but found the sushi to be just OK. Mojitos there were awesome though. Also did pizza from Kokos which was decent. Definitely do Nori \u2019s though. Regency Club I stay at Hyat \u2019s relatively often and have Explorist status so used a club room certificate for the week. Well this regency club was nothing short of awesome. The food was consistently good I love smoked salmon for bfast and kids loved the cereal and fruit aps in evening were also great. The thing that made this club especially awesome were the staff. Jeanete was exceptional as was everyone we encountered I wish I got more names but just forgot. The staff was so good to my wife and girls that the club made such a positive experience for our overall stay. I also loved that they had board games in the club candy land scrabble zenga Yahtze etc which was super helpful on those two rainy days. Other tips one previous reviewer mentioned bringing an Roku or amazon fire stick. We did this and it was great to get connected to Netflix just to watch some movies on the rainy days. TV in the room was large and easy to use. the fridge in the room was helpful although it did n\u2019t get super cold. However it did the job to keep drinks cool. we went to the local super market to get some snacks and such. Everything in PR seems to be fried so the local market was great to just get some fruits and healthier snacks. the hotel is super close to El Yunke and worth the visit. We ended up driving up two different days and my kids loved it. Overall this is a great Hyat. Previous reviewers complained about service issues but we had no issues there. Everyone was very friendly and was quick to help. Things generally are slower in PR than home for us ie Northeast but that \u2019s just part of the culture. The staff made this an outstanding trip so I look forward to coming back. I \u2019ve also included some random pictures of the pool club beach front view and Italian restaurant menu. I hope this helps.", "offset": [744, 790], "date": "2020-02-29", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
