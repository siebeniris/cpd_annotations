Not sure if they were understaffed or if this is their typical service but it certainly was not the same type of service I know to expect from a Ritz Carlton. We arrived from the airport with no one there to greet us. There were at least two hotel bellmen valets busy greeting another couple. We took our own luggage in and opened the door to the hotel as yet another bellman was coming with a cart to take the luggage of the couple outside making it three people waiting on one couple. We arrived at the front desk and were asked if we needed the bellman to help us upstairs. We said we managed our own luggage through the door we could continue to the club floor. Upon entering our room it was a large suite and somewhat tired in decor. The bench at the end of the bed was stained and a sheer on one of the windows was torn. Everything else seemed clean and in order. There was an old tub in the bathroom with a shower head but no shower curtain. There was a separate shower in the room as well. We went to The Grill with another couple. The smell of cigars from the Cigar Room was evident so we asked to sit away from the main entrance to the restaurant. My chair had a large stain on it and I was not offered a different one. My husband proceeded to order wine but after two attempts they finally brought out the wines that they actually had in that varietal for him to choose from even though they were listed on the wine list. The food was actually delicious and they brought us two free desserts of their choosing. The Club on the 18th floor was quite nice until everyone from every floor was there with their children who were running around and you can imagine the scene. People had their cell phones on and ringing. Perhaps a sign should be posted asking those in the club to silence their phones as you would do in a restaurant. There was not the usual decorum that I expect from the Club. On July 4th I was alone in the club. As everyone around me with families and small children were asked if they needed anything I was ignored. I was never asked how I was or if I needed anything. However to be fair I will say that the food was very good in the club and they replenished it readily. Had sushi in the lounge and when I asked for sake they told me they do not have sake. Finally the server went to the cigar room and got a bottle. She tried to serve it to me at room temperature to which I told her it needed to be iced. She did ice it and was very accommodating. Upon departure I went to the bellmans desk and no one was there. I went to the front desk and asked if I could store my luggage. The front desk person had to leave her post to store my luggage. When I returned it was the same situation with no one at the bellmans desk. Again the person at reception had to leave her post to get my luggage. When I finally got in the car to depart I was not even offered water just a hand with my luggage and a hand out for me to give a tip. Although this hotel is in a nice area I would think that the Ritz would look into refurbishing it and training the staff.", "offset": [1012, 1060], "date": "2015-07-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "1a4aab47-492d-4110-afb8-64a4996492c7", "sentence": "excellent time. room was beautiful we got an upgrade when we checked in. we had dinner and breakfast in our room.

Recently had a Stay In Town night away from home at this beautiful hotel. we have been coming to this property for drinks andor dinner since it opened which I think was in the 1990s and always loved it but never took a staycation until now and we were not disappointed except for one thing which I will address in this review. We would never stay at a hotel that has a Club Lounge and not stay in that section and take advantage of that feature. It just generally is not that much more money and so worth it just to have the comfort of being able to go to a private part of the hotel with the food and drink service but mostly just the dedicated concierge and staff to make everything so much more personal. Come to think of it it is not any more money at all when you add up the food and drinks that you would undoubtedly purchase elsewhere during your stay. And this Club experience ranks up there with some of the best in the business. The best of the best was actually another Ritz the New Orleans Ritz where the Club is actually a hotel within a hotel but I digress. Also a plus was we had booked a Deluxe room within the Club and were upgraded to a gorgeous suite Large living room large bedroom large bath plus a powder room off the foyer. Complimentary wi fi. we had been told Valet parking was included with the Club floor then we were told it was not. but of course they ended up including it. Everything was clean and elegant and the Juliet balconies were neat but a little vertigo inducing so not much time spent out there but nice to have the fresh air on the 18th floor. The staff in the Club were beyond wonderful. It was Halloween so many of them were costumed and that was cute. Heres the only negative referred to above. We went to The Grill for dinner. While I guess they always billed this as the more casual of the 2 restaurants years ago it was far from casual. It was softly lit roaring fire very clubbish elegant menu. Well now they have really decided to make it more casual and it is just a huge miss. The lighting is just dim not soft and elegant. The menu is uninspired. The service that we experienced was terribly lacking. Several items we requested nothing out of the ordinary mind you were either so late in coming or just did not come at all. The calamari said it came with an aioli but it just had a spicy red sauce which completely overwhelmed the dish. So we asked for the aioli and were told that USED to come with it. So we said. hm Do you have mayonnaise. Yes. Do you have lemons. Yes. So would you please make us an aioli with just those 2 items. Okay. Well it took 15 minutes almost making the calamari obviously not hot anymore. They comped the item without us asking but hey we had rather have an item be good and complete and be wonderful than having it comped any day of the week. Really left us just scratching our heads. I REALLY hope they take a look at this whole Grill experience and change it back to the way it used to be. I imagine they were trying to go with the economic times and provide a more reasonable alternative and I get that I am not someone who just will cut loose with money with no thought. But this is the Ritz afteral and I think people expect a certain level of wonderfulness in a culinary experience and the Grill now falls far short in many areas. But I will not end on a down note. Everything else was wonderful and next time we do a staycation we will not look anywhere else.", "offset": [1400, 1441], "date": "2015-11-01", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "365d7a32-d4ed-40d0-ab84-1a06f00646c7", "sentence": "Should not be operating under the Ritz Carlton Brand. We decided to try to Ritz again this year when we were visiting St Louis for a performance of Wicked. It seems as each visit here the service continues to decline. We had reserved a club level room and did received the welcome e mail from the concierge. I had replied with a few questions that were never answered until after asking again upon arrival. Rooms are tired looking and not up to Ritz standards found at other hotels resorts. Only saw a Concierge in the club lounge once during our stay. Furniture in the lounge could also use updating as it was worn looking. Upon returning to our room after our evening out rooms were not turn down like they have been in the past. Wanted to order room service but no menu in the room. After a quick phone call it still took them 45 minutes to send one up.

This review is of our recent one night stay. I have stayed here a couple of times before visiting WashU with no problem. But this time my shower at around midnight was nerve wracking. The water pressure kept fluctuating wildly from strong to almost none. I was afraid the water would would stop flowing before I rinsed off. I asked my husband who took a shower about 5 minutes after I did if he had the same problem and he said he did though milder. Perhaps too many people were using the shower at the same time. Plumbing problems like this should not happen at a Ritz. I reported this problem at check out and the young man at the front desk casually said he will make a note of it without a hint of real apology. The bathroom tiles especially where the floor meets the walls could also use more thorough cleaning of the stains dirt or mold. There was a screaming toddler next to our room sounded really close at about 830a on a Saturday morning which woke us up. The Ritz St Louis is a beautiful property and with the exception noted above provided decent service valet parking for example despite a packed party event by the lobby.

At first glance this looks amazing. Beautiful furnishings and details with a friendly and attentive front line team. The gym is spacious and with enough equipment to avoid delays and queues and on the Club Room floors the revamp gives elegant rooms with deep pile carpet and the lounge is well appointed. The personal touch extends to a Welcome culinary gift from the Catering Team a plastic bubble with hummus and vegetable crudites which added a very pleasant connection after a long and anonymous day travelling. So far superb. Sadly for a top level hotel priding itself on superb and anticipatory customer service it seems a shame that Housekeeping lets the side down. For the basics I was surprised to see dust on the glass topped bedside tables every day and to find that teabags consumed in the hot drink maker were never replaced with new ones. A really clever and customer focused Housekeeping team would also notice that the client sleeps on one side of the bed and change the turndown routine to match that it was after all 4 nights suffice it to say that this team were not that good. To continue in a picky theme I am a little disappointed to find that a hotel chain built on the best in quality and service for it is brand stocks bathroom toiletries which do not match their brand ethos on the glitzy trashy outside packaging or the cheap and cheerful inside content. Maybe time to consider a link with another elegant US brand renowned for quality insteadDefinitely ticking all of the boxes for a 4 star hotel except basic cleaning but a little back office team focus to hit 5.", "offset": [1148, 1432], "date": "2017-02-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "3069e7c2-2b48-4df8-a67d-ceda2e49ba7b", "sentence": "Stay. the Ritz Carlton St Louis.
