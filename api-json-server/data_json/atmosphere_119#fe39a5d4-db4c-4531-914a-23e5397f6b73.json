Horrible customer service. I was told I would be reimbursed for taking a taxi after calling three times to be picked at the airport by their free shuttle service. Each time I was told the shuttle was on the way. I stood right next to pole 16 underneath the hotel shuttle sign where they told me to stand. I waited there for 55 minutes before calling to inform them that I would be taking a taxi which I was told the taxi driver would be reimbursed for. He was not. Jasmine the front desk associate explained to me over the phone that they would reimburse my taxi driver if he simply came in to the front desk with the receipt. When I arrived I was then told in person by the same person Jasmine that he would be reimbursed. When he came in with the receipt suddenly it was decided that they could not reimburse him and they would have to reimburse me. Which was fine with me BUT then after telling me that they would reimburse me all of sudden they could not or they could only put it to the room or if I wanted to buy room service. I explained to them that I was here for work and that my company had already paid for the room. Also that I was missing the dinner I was supposed to attend that evening because I waited to be picked up at the airport for 55 minutes and because I was standing there speaking to them about this issue that is still unresolved. They said their hands were tied at that point. I have worked in customer service and this was by far some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. You do not tell someone that the shuttle is on its way when it clearly is not or you explain to that guest that the shuttle just left the airport and it will probably take another 30 45 minutes for another one to arrive. In that case I could have decided then to take a taxi and not wait 55 minutes.

Often I can be critical of a hotel stay if the experience has been poor. the stay here in Memphis at the Hilton was the exact opposite it was amazing. The hotel itself is in Germantown which is about 25 minutes from downtown and in a great area. Lots of restaurant choices and shopping. Upon check in Service was great. It was friendly fast efficient and we were greeted as Honors members. We had a room on the executive floor and although an older Hilton property the room itself was very clean. Friday night we went down to Beale Street and upon our return and to our surprise was a cheese tray bucket of cold waters and a personal note thanking us for being guests of the hotel.
