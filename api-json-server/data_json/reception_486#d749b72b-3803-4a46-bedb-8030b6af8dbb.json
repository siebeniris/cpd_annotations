The hotel looks great from the outside but the rooms are very dated. The rooms and bathroom definitely need to be updated. The bed was very hard and the pillows were too small and very soft. The A C thermostat is from the 20th century. It was either too cold or too warm in the room. The sofa bed was so uncomfortable that my son could not fall asleep on it the first night. The next night he laid 2 comforters on the sofa bed so he could sleep on it. There is no safe in the room so we asked at the front desk if they had a safe we could keep our valuable item in. The lady at the front desk was a bit rude and refused. We only chose this hotel because it had a suite and it would give some level of privacy to our teenage sons.

My sister made our reservations for the four of us for an upcoming wedding two months in advance. There was a block of rooms set aside for my nieces wedding. Two beds where supposed to be reserved. When we got to the hotel they said they were overboked and only had a king room for us. No other rooms where available. After talking to several people we finally found a very sweet girl at the front desk that said the only thing she could do was to give us two roll away beds. She said they would be set up in our room while we were at the reception. We asked her to call the shuttle driver to take us to the reception. She said he was just around the corner. 30 minutes later we were picked up. By the time we got to the reception the cake was cut and our dinner salad was being put at our table. We had an enjoyable ride back to the hotel and the driver was pleasant and informative about the area. When we got to our room we almost walked into a roll away bed standing on it side. Not set up only sheets not pillows no blankets a hole in it and stained. I would not let my dog sleep on this bed. We took pictures of it because it was so nasty. Health Department would have cow if they say it. I went downstairs to tell the front desk about the problem. They were apologetic but said they did not have any more beds. The driver rounded up sheets and blankets for us to use on the hide a bed huge stain on it. My husband is a disable veteran with multiple medical issues. The stress of all that went on and the uncomfortable bed was detrimental to him. My sister also reserved a room for her son which ended up being on another floor on the other end of the hotel. He had no a c. Only hot air blew out of the vent. He was told they did not have a fan for him. We also were only given three towels and one wash cloth. We were told the General Manager would be there the next day. Found out he would not be there until Monday. The person to who made arrangements for the block of rooms called and talked to the General Manager the next week about our issues and issues that other of the weeding guest had. He did not seem to care about the issues. Said we had a hide a bed so the room would accommodate four people. This is not what we reserved.

I stay here frequently when visiting Northwestern. It is a bit further from campus than some others but the rooms are spacious and comfortable and the breakfast that has always been included is delicious. For the 1st time I was disappointed in the customer service from the staff. Breakfast was included when I booked thru Hotelscom but there was some confusion and the Hotel did not honor the agreement. They argued with the Hotelscom reps over the phone for quite an extended amount of time and refused to include the breakfast. Hotelscom stepped up and provided an agreeable solution for a future stay but it was disappointing that Wyndham took the stance they did and made me wait at front desk for a long time while they had a Mgr paged to talk to the Hotelscom reps.

The good The location is good easy access to the highway. The staff was very helpful in giving directions and recommending places to go. Michael the night auditor and Justin from accounting were great. Now for the bad I arrived at the hotel around 1 am only to discover that Expedia messed up the reservation. Michael the night auditor was very helpful in correcting the reservation and accommodating my needs. If only the rest of the stay was that nice. Due to the time that I arrived I was given a room that faced the highway I understood and asked to be moved at 8 the next morning. I was told that they were processing check outs but would make a note and move me later in the day. I went out for the day and returned to the desk at 8 pm only to be told that they no longer had any King rooms left to meet my needs. When I informed the front desk guy of my request from earlier in the day miraculously they found a King room. The next morning I went to the desk because there was a charge from the restaurant on my bill I never ate at the restaurant. I was told it would be taken care of and went out to eat breakfast. When I returned I was asked to move to yet another room. Yes three nights three rooms. The morning I went to check out I asked about the restaurant charge only to discover it was not resolved the day before. Michael the night auditor took my email address and said he would look into it. I received an email within hours that the charge was removed. Funny how there were more people at the desk the day before and no one took care of it. When I returned home I found that I was double billed by the hotel I prepaid through Expedia. Justin in accounting quickly resolved my issue. All of the rooms that I stayed in were dated. One of the rooms had an old leather couch that has definitely seen better days. The grout in the showers is discolored either from age or the water. In one of the rooms the TV in the bedroom did not work in the other room the TV in the living room did not work.

However good customer service is what i noticed was lacking in this hotel. At check in the people in the counter were not that friendly at all there was not even an acknowledgement that you are standing in line and seems like you are invisible. The only plus was that check. in was quick and easy. Mornings are a different story as the breakfast buffet is situated in the middle of the courtyard and we were not lucky enough to get a room far from the breakfast nook. Starting around 8AM scraping of plates and frying pans and noises from the dining area starts emanating through the rooms. If you slept late and wanted to sleep in godluck with that better get an earplug. Heads up to the people who are expecting the pull out bed to be made up it is not apparently their responsibility to fix unles requested which is really ridiculous. If the room is good for 5 people and stated at the time of booking it is already implied that the pull out bed would be needed. We requested for service and we had to argue with the front desk and no one showed up. that is the level of service with this hotel and the third party where we booked basically compensated for this lack of good customer service because this hotel did not want to impress their guests.

I recently had to stay there because flight cancellation issues forced my 2 hour layover in OHare into 24 hour layover. Delta is close to the airport though no complimentary shuttle and the price was reasonable. I am Mariot Gold and was glad to make something good out of this unexpected delay earning a few Mariot points at least. The hotel is actually very nice with every room a suite similar to Embassy Suites setup. They also have a Delta Pantry with free snacks all day long and free breakfast in the morning. I am not sure if it is open only to guests with premier levels similar to Mariot policy or if it is open to all guests. Anyway having been used to Mariot Club Lounge I have to say that I do not like the Pantry. it is a tiny little place WITHOUT any seating. As the name implies it is just a pantry where you can get food and you are supposed to take it back to your room to eat. But when my room is 2 floors down and at the opposite corner of the building I do not feel like carrying hot liquids and a couple of containers of food over 14 of a mile. Also because of the small size anytime there are more than 3 people in there you literally bump into each other. Also my room was facing the highway and I could hear the road noise which was disruptive to light sleepers. I liked the look of the hotel and the size of the room and the good service by the staff but if I have the choice between a conventional Mariot and this one I will stick to my Mariot or Renaissance.", "offset": [1328, 1526], "date": "2017-08-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "db382fbf-4e6e-478a-bf3e-65ee013bf0e7", "sentence": "Outstanding service in the face of overflow crowd resulting from NE blizzard.
