My husband and I stayed at this resort from a Sunday to a Friday. I was looking for a relaxing experience since my days would be spent on property. At first we were overwhelmed with the number of children running around and the normal chaos that comes with traveling with kids. This was not what we were anticipating. However I then took to avoiding areas that would be louder and had a wonderful experience. Most of the pool area is filled with fun water park type experiences. This did not interest me but the adult pool was perfect. By arriving by 930 AM I had my pick of seats and very few people were around. It was very relaxing hanging out in the pool or sitting pool side for hours. Most of the food was very good and the servers provided great service. Nonalcoholic daiquiris were nice and cool. Our upgraded room was in the wing further away from the pool area. It was clean comfortable and we loved the huge tv. One night we went to the buffet and were pleased with the food especially the wonderful desserts. My biggest complaint is with the on property hotel run Starbucks. It is not adequately stocked with food. Breakfast is not included for guests so everyone is looking to eat in the morning. This is a daily occurrence and Starbucks should be prepared for the large number of people coming through. They were even out of certain cold drinks from running out. Poor planning by management. Four out of five times my drinks were messed up and had to be remade. If you have a car I would recommend going to a grocery store and buying breakfast food.

There were smores in the evenings and lots of sidewalks for walking. The golf course was well maintained. Laundry is available which is a nice perk. There were a few things that could be improved the double rooms have full size beds rather than queen beds. These beds are tight for two people. So the rooms really are tight for 4 people. Also there is not an arm chair or bench in the rooms so the only place to sit is on the beds or one office chair. I am not sure if there are plans for arm chairs the hotel was undergoing some renovations there were many bees in the pool area I am not sure if it is typically like this but they were quite a nuisance as they seemed to be everywhere watching the kids in the lazy river and pool area can be challenging due to its size.

OcasionOur family recently made our annual trip to San Antonio to visit some dear friends. We usually stay with them at their house but this year was a little different as both families now have newborns. As such my wife I opted for staying at a hotel and it just so happened that the JW resort was the closest to their home. IntroductionNestled in the Texas Hill Country this resort is massive and is jam packed with an incredible amount of activities and amenities nearly all of which are family friendly. A huge bonus for our stay was that it happened in the Christmas season which meant daily activities and events all centered around the holidays. The PropertyThe best word to describe the size of the property is sprawling. Golf course spa several restaurants lazy river multiple pools and a water park this resort has it all. The entire property was meticulously maintained and the grounds were clean and free of trash and clutter even though the resort itself was quite busy. The same could be said of the amenities such as the common areas and the water related activity areas. The RomI booked us a King Bed Guest Room with a balcony and a signature view. This room ended up being a nicely situated place for us to stay as it overlooked the main Christmas displays that were in full swing in the evening and at night. The room itself was spacious and clean. Christmas DecorAs I mentioned earlier the entire resort was decked out in holiday decorations. This made for an exceptionally magical experience. They even brought in a lone reindeer for the kids and adults to see. The Food DrinksThe resort offered a multitude of dining options including a sports bar a lobby bar lounge a full service restaurant in the main building as well as an upscale restaurant in the golf club. Overall I found the food to be decent with the exception of Sunday Brunch which I found to be downright awesome. I would also say the same thing for the drinks decent but nothing to particularly recommend. I had say the food beverage program was par for the course for resorts and does a good job at suiting pretty much anyones needs and palates which is good. I particularly enjoyed 18 Oaks which is the more upscale restaurant in the golf club images below. It had a bit of a country club feel to it and appeared to have a nice wine program which I always appreciate. Sunday Brunch at 18 OaksAs I alluded to earlier the most notable dining experience was Sunday Brunch with Mr Mrs Claus at 18 Oaks. This was the third consecutive Sunday Brunch my wife I have done recently the last two being at the Four Seasons Hotel Austin. The Sunday Brunch at the Four Seasons Hotel Austin is the pinnacle of brunches as far as I am concerned and there were multiple times throughout the Sunday Brunch at the JW that I found myself thinking we were at the Four Seasons. Suffice it to say the JWs spread was exceptional and so was the quality of the food. ServiceThe final aspect of our stay that I would like to highlight is the service. Just as I did with the Sunday Brunch I can easily draw a line of comparison between the service at the Four Seasons Hotel Austin and that of the JW Mariot in San Antonio. Every single person we dealt with was very kind and professional from the front desk agent to the housekeepers to the holiday festivity coordinators. This made for a warm and welcoming experience. In ConclusionMy wife I left the resort easily envisioning it being a place we visit each year around the holidays as a family tradition.
