I was in Atlanta for a 4 day weekend to have fun and shop with my sister. She is from the area and really wanted to stay in Buckhead. The area is awesome. However I have traveled to 27 different countries and many states. I am even a Westin member and I am only assuming The Ws are affiliated. My assumption could be wrong but my review is not. The hotel only offers valet which is costly even though I could pay for it. 32 a night no other option is what I was told. The check in was fine. The rooms. Well the rooms were terrible for the money paid 200 something a night. The king room bathroom area is very insufficient. A slide door that did not close no space in the toilet area dirty and small shower with broken handle. Old styling of the room. Disappointing for a downtown W. I have definitely stayed at better Ws. Now to be fair. The resturant down stairs had great presence and the food was really good. The bar on the penthouse Was fine. Needs a dance space for all the ladies. outdoor space looked fun but in January way to cold to enjoy. Your getting location location location. Ypur not getting a great room.
