We stayed here while attending an event at UMD and I would say the hotel met our expectations. The rooms were comfortable enough and the service was friendly. Wifi in the hotel was pretty quick. One thing to note though is that if you do not have a car with you you are pretty much limited to TGIFridays in terms of walking distance businesses and that is definitely less than ideal. There were a few little things that could have been improved we had a room with a fold out couch and while there was room to unfold it there was a bulky table in the way that we had to awkwardly stow and block the hallway area with. Additionally the pull out bed was incredibly uncomfortable so if you are looking to use one I might suggest a different hotel. Overall though I do not imagine you are going to do much better in Greenbelt and for the price it is not bad at all.", "offset": [646, 772], "date": "2015-01-09", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "9d2b8900-ff40-4f59-8f18-92d805928901", "sentence": "Nothing special.

I stayed in this Courtyard for work and was there a total of 4 nights. I have stayed in many hotels and the staff at this one was top notch. Now mind you I prefer my staff friendly sociable and low key. Each morning they were extremely pleasant when I got breakfast even though they were extremely busy and very attentive to my needs. The hotel itself is very nice. Everything was extremely clean which is the first thing I look for. In addition everything smelled wonderful with a faint flowery odor that reminds me of vacation. The beds were very comfortable the pillows a perfect medium softness. They change your towels out daily though you can make it so they do not simply by hanging your towels up and they come in and empty the trash and reset the sheets every day. This makes each night feel like a fresh night. As a note I brought my own pillow and blanket and they set up my pillow with the rest on the bed and folded my blanket for me as well. Little touches go a long way. There is a board in the main lobby that will display all sorts of information regarding the area you are in. I got some recommendations for local food from this board. As well there is a state park across the street. A small note there is a print center in the lobby that is EXTREMELY useful and free. should you need to print tickets directions business documents. Why four stars. The two pain points are the rather small and cramped fitness center two treadmills an elliptical and a bench with free weights and the pool. The fitness center was serviceable do not get me wrong and everything worked. However four people in there at once got very very crowded. The pool was an annoyance as well. it does not open till 170 Monday through Friday which is a poor choice in my opinion. Some background I was there with a work group so our dinners were ready between 170 and 180. The difficulty here is choosing whether to have a cold dinner because I decided to go swimming or having a full stomach when I try to go swimming. Secondly the guy who opened and cleaned the pool did not get there until 170 which means the pool did not really open until 1730. I never did get to go swimming so I can not particularly give a review of the pool itself. One last thing the coin operated laundry was VERY VERY expensive. 250 each for the washer and dryer is too much in my opinion considering the small size of the washer and dryerHowever this inconvenienced me I still enjoyed the hotel and my stay. The food was also very good if a bit on the pricey side normal prices for a hotel though.

On Saturday November 18 2016 I was treated in the most digesting and dehumanizing manner by Vanessa front desk agent. I arrived shortly after 1030pm to check in for one night. My grandmother died and I had to make an emergency trip from Atlanta to DC. In my haste I left my wallet in my car at the airport but prepaid for my room online. When I arrived I was greeted by Akon who was lovely by the way. I explained my situation to her that I had left my wallet and that I would be going to SunTrust in the morning to get cash for the rest of my trip. She told me she needed funds for incidentals and I informed her that I did not have any funds on me outside of my ability to use my credit card via Apple Pay. She went to speak to the supervisor who was Vanessa who came out to talk to me in a nasty disgusting manner as if I was scum of the bottom of her shoe. I tried to explain my situation to her but she rolled her eyes and neck and started waving her hands at me. She would not let me talk and kept saying you are not listening to ME as if I was some child she was scolding. She then said I am DONE talking to you until you want to listen. At this point I was pretty upset and needed to walk away. I have NEVER encountered that Tempe of behavior some someone who was supposed to be a reflection of the management. She kept calling me rude but would not let me get a word in edgewise wise. I felt like I was in the middle of some reality show where the women talk like trash to each other and yell to get their point across. Her behavior especially as a leader was 100 unacceptable. I am in town for 24hours to mourn the death of my loved one not to be treated like someone trying to steal a room for the night. I am asking for the strictest corrective action to be taken.
