We had a king connected to a twin corner room for our family which was on a high floor 26 with amazing views of the Opera Plaza as well as Darling Harbor. There was an in room Nespreso machine as well as a free automated coffee machine in the lobby in the morning. There is also a well equipped gym and a spa where I had an incredible deep tissue massage.

A good selection of local and imported premium beers as well as wine and spirits on offer and a huge selection of finger food was available. Only down side was a few people there who felt the need to impress all in earshot of their well to do exploits but that is not the hotels fault just society I presume but apart from that the lounge is an excellent place to unwind and enjoy a drink or two.

Upon our arrival to check in I advised the front office staff that I wish to leave the security deposit via an Apple Pay pay pass transaction. I was told that this was not possible and that an actual credit card was required. Since the implementation of this technology is not new and has been around for some years now it was with confidence that I could travel to Sydney and stay at a supposedly 5 star establishment without the need for any physical cards since the method of PayWave or Pay Pass is widely accepted. The front office staff advised that it was not possible to proceed with the transaction. I eventually resorted to using a personal savings card to leave the bond which was inconvenient for other reasons. This morning we came down for breakfast which was included in our room cost. For the price of 42 I was expecting a much larger selection of items from the buffet. I opted for some poached eggs so I could make a crude version of Eggs Benedict from the other items available. I received the eggs within aprox 1 2 minutes and proceeded immediately up to the buffet. Being quite hungry I wasted no time in starting to eat. By the time I had finished the first egg I decided that I could not eat any more as it was too cold.

Our group was very excited to stay at the Four Seasons Sydney. We booked club floor rooms several months before our trip. Less than two weeks before our trip I got an email letting me know that the club floor was being redone and we would not have use of it. They offered us 40. nt credit per room to use in the bar for drinks and snacks. The first night we went down for drinks to find that the bar was closed for a private function. The next night we planned to eat in the hotel restaurant. We made a reservation and showed up on time to find out that the restaurant was closed for a private function but we could sit in the bar area and order off that menu much different than the restaurant menu. We were able to use our credit this night for the drinks and food we ordered. The following day we spoke with the manager and told him about all of the issues. Daniel did listen to everything we said and did offer to compensate us for all of the trouble we had. He explained that they are spending a great deal to improve the hotel and apologized that no one made us aware a few months ago. I believe we would have gone back to the Sydney Hyat if we would have known. The buffet breakfast was very good and got our mornings started well but with all the other problems it made it hard to enjoy this property. The room I had needed new grout in the shower but the rest of the room was in good shape. The rooms are small compared to most less than 30sf. I feel that I overpaid for what I got.

The lady in reservations Sarah was helpful even asking me what the occasion was when i told her it was my wifes birthday she said she would make a special note of that. Sarah checked the room availability and informed me we could check in from 2 pm onwards and she would arrange a habour view room also would ensure the complementary sparking wine and chocolates would be in the room on our arrival as it was a suprise for my wife. We live in Sydney and drove into the city but we were not explained upon making the reservation about the road works and difficulty it would cause trying to get to the hotel. We drove around in circles trying to get in calling the hotel twice to try and get directions. I understand this must be difficult for you operating under these conditions but some information upon making the reservation and maybe a map emailed with the confirmation would make everyones life easier. We were very frustrated when we arrived as we had a lunch reservation and had spent and extra 40 minutes driving around trying to get to the hotel. Upon arrival we checked in when we got into our room we found it over looking the construction on George st. NOT THE HABOUR. No sparkling wine or chocolates. I had to phone the front desk to see where it was they apologized and said it would be sent up. An hour and two phone calls latter it arrived but we did not have time to drink or eat as we were going out for lunch and had a reservation. When we checked in we asked about breakfast and we were told to just call in the morning and order what ever we liked off the in room dinning menu which we did. The food arrived on time but was cold along with the coffee and hot chocolate it was quite un enjoyable. My wife ordered a side of avocado. Upon check out at 10pm which was not a busy time it took over 25 minutes. there was a 25 charge on our bill for the side of avocado. my wife had ordered for breakfast and i questioned it. Eventually the young man serving us removed the charge but seriously it took way way to long it was like he had no idea what he was doing. This morning when i arrived at work I received my reservation confirmation email. Not sure why it would be turning up on a Monday morning when the booking was for the previous Saturday night. I must say over all it was a disappointing stay I had several other hotels and much cheaper rates to choose from for our stay but i was happy to spend more money expecting to get the service and quality stay we had paid for but unfortunately that was not the case.
