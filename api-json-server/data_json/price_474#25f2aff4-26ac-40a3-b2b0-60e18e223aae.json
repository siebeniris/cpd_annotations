In retrospect we should not have rented a car. A big plus for going in Feb was that it was museum month and many of Seattles museums were half price with a hotel stay Motif was one of the hotels. This was the first time the museums had this promotion but look for it again next Feb in case they decide to do it again. Sign up for their frequent stay program to get free wifi.

Bathroom courtesy variety kits were mediocre shower cap seemed was used and was put back into the box. We paid 328 a night and stayed for two nights.

The hotel as a bunch of hidden fees. On hotelscom I was told I would pay 90 night and it ended up costing me 300. Beware of the hidden resort amenities fee. The location is great though and the hotel is modern and nicely decorated. But I do not think it explains not showing the price upfront. There was a big construction site right next to my room. it is not the hotel fault but it was really noisy in the middle of the night and I could not sleep at all for one full night. So if you need to rest or are on a business trip maybe check if the construction is still going on. Finally the room is nice they added an Alexa device in each room which is a nice attention. You can ask for thing you might have forgotten such as shampoo or a toothbrush. Finally the bed were not comfortable in my opinion especially the pillows and the comforter.
