A few years ago while it was under Mariots wing it was almost revitalized and updated. But the process stopped. Now it has a feel of general confusion and lack of desire to maintain the facility. The first room we were given was so dirty we had to change rooms. The staff was very nice but no one really seemed to make much effort. The squashed bug on the hallway wall in a prominent spot was there throughout the stay the cleaning solution wiped onbut not off. the brass elevator was there for 2 days the lampshades in both rooms we had were shredding and the cocktail list of seasonal drinks was clearly from Christmas cinnamon and spice while our stay was over Memorial Day weekend. Apparently it is being taken over by Wyndham. Hopefully they can pull this place together.", "offset": [272, 337], "date": "2015-05-26", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "71362f15-2a39-4f89-8546-522ac9c03367", "sentence": "Uncomfortable rude staffs and lots of charges. My husband and I have stayed in many hotels and resorts from 100 night to 1000 night and this hotel by far is our worse experience. Prior to booking in order to ensure that we would have a refrigerator in our guest room I am pumping breastmilk and need the storage for my 3 months old we made the reservation by phone instead of online or Expedia etc. We explicit mentioned we need the refrigerator in our guest room and the response was it is very easy and is free simply request it upon your arrival and it will be place in your guest room. The day on our arrival I called again to ensure about the fridge and this time the response is it is not guarantee. No matter how many times I asked the lady and she was rude instead of being helpful and kept saying. mdm refrigerator is not guarantee. We would never booked this hotel if they can not guarantee the fridge as there is no way I can store the breastmilk. She then said you could store it in the front desk if you want. I wonder how on earth that I am gon na pumped every 4 hours and feed my baby every 2 3 hours to run to front desk in that frequency 24hr a day. Her response is we have done it before. In the end my husband called to speak to the manager and he said it would be there when we check in. Upon arrival which is late at 10 pm my husband had to take care of the parking and I went in with the baby and a sleepy 3 year old. The front desk told me she could not check me in until my husband is here because my husband and I have different last name and the hotel is reserved under my husband name. During our stay we found the bed is extremely uncomfortable. The entire mattress move when you make a slight movement. The pillows are uncomfortable and super small even for a queen bed not to mentioned for the king size bed. All day and night I just keep hearing slamming door from other rooms that wake me up each time. The door closer close the door very loud each time. The AC system was very dry and give us sore throat the next morning. On the first day already we were charged 50 extra for each guest room not even sure for what. Then we were charge extra 10 for hotel fees. 3 adults went for breakfast and is 18 per person. The next day only 2 people went for breakfast and yet there is a 57 bill for that. When I asked the front desk for a receipt for the entire stay including the dining room she said she did not have it because it takes extra 10 mins for the dining room to send over the receipt. The breakfast was done 1 hour ago and yet the hotel front desk still does not have the receipt to show me what they are charging us and for how many people they charged for the breakfast. At check out we asked for a trolley which a bell boy sent one up to help load the luggage. He was extremely rude to us. He got there. within 1 min he was in a pisy mood and said you guys are not ready. You want me to come back. I told him we are ready. There are bags that he can load just 1 2 luguages that we have not closed it yet. He had to point to one luggage and said the bag is not close and you are not ready. We ignore him and started loading our stuff. We understand it is a busy July 4th weekend and may be he was over worked. Beyond all these unpleasant experiences the hotel itself is in 20 40 min away from Atlantic city or all major restaurants. You will not find a decent dining place if you do not drive to Atlantic city. The facilities are old and run down. From the room service and location definitely not worth the 328 a night plus all weird charges. We will never return.", "offset": [2328, 2521], "date": "2015-07-05", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "8b4e1801-2a6b-41c6-8c80-c4107c9a72ab", "sentence": "100 year Old Hotel and Golf Resort lacks luster. Had a 3 night stay purchased site unseen. While I have an appreciation of the age and perhaps historic past of more grandiose times it was just ok. The decor of rooms and halls could use updating.

So after booking my room with hotelscom I got to the hotel and was amazed by how pretty it was outside and in the lobby. Once I checked in and got to my floor a terrible smell greeted me. I had to bare through it to the room just for the smell to linger there too. The entire floor was under construction exposed wires lined the walls. The room was poorly set up and the floor was soaking wet I wore my shoes the entire time. Once I was leaving I noticed that I actually got charged for the room twice once from hotelscom and once from the hotel and when I addressed the issue they said it was just a 50 deposit lie. It was a full charge for the room. I am so disgusted with my stay and being lied to I can not believe I even paid for the room.

We stayed one night and aside from slight mustiness the staff explained was due to an overworked but soon to be replaced HVAC our room on the 3rd floor was immaculate and comfortable. Special thanks to Tia and the day manager who made us feel so welcome. If I played golf I would be back sooner but I will go back and enjoy the amenities and perhaps take up the game. The space and the feel are classic and welcoming. The staff are friendly and the grounds are breathtaking. Two pools add to the relaxing feel. Atlantic City and Ocean City are within 20 minutes or less via the Parkway and Rte 9 AC Expressway. The grounds have a golf course and gym play room.
