At the end of the day this is what lingers long after you have returned home. My family has been coming to this resort for round about a decade gradually growing adding kids and therefore adding new and different challenges to make up a perfect holiday. We keep coming back and here is why. On top of things like absolutely stunning grounds the perfect size for a maledivian island beautiful botanics a truly stunning beach serving picture perfect views and amazing water well mentained pools bars and restaurant \u2026 a timeless design for me timeless means not particularly following any trends but a very high quality regarding furniture lighting and electronics all in sensible regard to the region the resort is situated in very nice food and beverages a one of a kind spa situated on a private little island it is the staff and the people that make this resort just a bit more special than the rest. It is very hard for me to point out individuals as seriously each and every person I met working in this resort has been extremely polite really friendly and just went that extra mile to make our holiday truly amazing \u2026 in an honest and cheerful way. Not in a our HR guidelines make us smile and greet every guest although we may not feel like it at all way. You genuinely have the feeling the working atmosphere is a very good one and you get the feeling the whole team is really motivated and likes what they do. From the very first good morning of the housekeeping staff the pool maintenance guys to a chat with the wonderful FB team or the bar and restaurant staff it is just a pleasure being around those guys. As we traveled with 2 kids and a toddler we had quite a few special requests that I stated before via email. Everything I had asked for and more has been organized and cared for. A true bliss for traveling with little ones. We took advantage of a few services that I would like to point out specially they provided us with a really cool buggy stroller with big air wheels awesome with the sand. so we would not have to take our own stroller. On arrival we found the right size of nappies baby powder and kids amenities waiting for us in our room. They had everything from play blankets to bottle sanitizer milk heater water kettle and so on. A special designated kids menu was provided for us in the room and under the age of 5 kids dine fro free. The kids club is really fun with lots of interesting things to do for the little ones yoga learning how to massage exploring the island turtle and fish feeding and so on \u2026 There is baby sitting service available so even our smallest could accompany her cousins to the kids club without a problem. All staff seemed really proficient and it gave mom and dad some truly amazing us time. This may sound as if we would have chosen this resort because of their absolute child friendliness. This is not so. We went before we had kids and perfectly enjoyed our stay its just so rare that resorts with this level of service offer such extensive sympathy towards children aswel. I absolutely recommend trying the spa and one of their awesome massages. Truly an amazing experience. Also I would recommend trying out different restaurants and theme nights as they are all really good. Especially the reef club and the whole team there made it into our hearts and we went there quite a few times. We had a birthday during our stay and I have never experienced such an awesome day full of little surprises and touches that made it truly special for all of us. The GM seems to be doing a great job and is a really friendly person on top.

The experience began with warm welcomes at the airport followed by a luxury boat transfer complete with drinks fresh fruit cold face towels and a preview of what to come. In no time we arrived at Kuda Hura to a welcoming song by cheerful staff and more cool drinks before being taken to our two bedroom water villa. The villa was huge with two large en suite bedrooms separated by a large family room a guest bathroom ample outside decking for sunning and dining a fresh water glass enclosed infinity pool and steps leading down to the crystal clear lagoon. All the living quarters are surrounded by glass to take advantage of the mind boggling views and the accommodations come with all the usual Four Seasons amenities Bose sound flat screen TVs complementary Nespreso bar a life saver and enough bath potions and fluffy towels to start up your own boutique. Upon arrival the hotel surprised us with our personal butler Ziya a fabulous member of staff who could not do enough for our family and who assisted us with all our ever changing plans from dining water activities and private charters. As a result we all had a care free time with snorkeling scuba diving and water sports. Our son particularly enjoyed learning to scuba dive and mastering what can only be described as water jet boots that shot him 15 20 ft in the air and earned him the nickname Iron Man. Our daughter who is less adventurous loved the easy beach snorkeling and playing with new friends in the main pool and adjacent games room a great spot for pre teens who are too old for the Kids ClubWith several restaurants to choose from the food is fresh varied delicious and plentiful. All the restaurant hosts chefs and wait staff are attentive and accommodating. Special thanks to Budi who took care of our gluten free needs. Food and drink is very expensive on island and the 42 cheeseburger is an example. The half board plan will cover breakfast and dinner drinks excluded and help ease some of the pain. The extensive wine lists are wonderful. Trip highlights of course involve the magnificent water activities and with flat seas and water temps of 27C80F its not hard to be in the water. The corals and marine life are simply breathtaking colorful fish everywhere turtles too. Special memories include snorkeling with several large manta rays a dolphin cruise with spinner dolphins jumping all around and late night family star gazing from the villa deck. Holiday departure day is usually difficult but here made enjoyable when the GM Randy graciously offered us the use of our villa until our late night flight home. As a result we had another wonderful day and dinner before boarding the return boat to the airport. At 10 pm Randy and several staff waived goodbye with some wonderfully illuminated hand gear that brought amazement and giggles to our delighted children.

We have stayed in some of the most exclusive resorts around the world and nothing comes close to the service experience at Four Seasons Kuda Hura.

A short 30 minute speed boat as opposed to another plane flight to Landa. and you arrive at the resort and begin your vacation. We had the pleasure of staying in a newly renovated sunrise water bungalow with private pool and direct access to the ocean for swimming and snorkeling. We can not speak highly enough about this room. uninterrupted views of the ocean. an aquarium below us of fish rays coral and even a few small reef sharks hammocks to watch the waves. the sunrise or sunset right from your balcony. The beauty is overwhelming. The food and beverage service is outstanding including bars restaurants and in room dining with newly expanded menus and freshly prepared ingredients. Everyone here greets us by name and remembers what we drink with breakfast and our cocktail preference with dinner. Staff from our first visit are delighted to see us and come ask how we have been this past year. Even at high season with over 90 occupancy the resort still feels empty and like our own private island. Last year occupancy was closer to 60 but felt the same except for perhaps breakfast.

Arrived after a week at the pristine Velasaru Resort expecting to be blown away as we normally are at a Four Seasons Hotel and Resort. Sadly we were disappointed mainly because of an infestation of flies in the main dining area which was beyond doubt the very worst experience I have had in any country I have ever travelled to around the world. The resort seemed to think it was acceptable to apologise but I believe they made a grave error in judgement. No one in their right mind would go back to that. They did have another restaurant at the other end of the resort which was clean and did not have such a bad issue but when I suggested they close the main dining area and move the buffet breakfast to the other area they politely said they were working on it. but nothing changedWe decided to eat in our villa as it was just not possible to select food that had not been walked over by many many flies. Absolutely shocking and totally unaceptableExcuses about a village close by and the rainy season being the cause however we are used to good health food standards and in this instance the hotel should have closed that venue down and made alternative arrangements. Personally I believe a very good clean of both the area utensils and the floors and walls would have gone a long way to sorting out the problem. Anyway the villas were pleasant and nicely located either over the water or close to the beach the spa was underwhelming nice therapists but datedVery nice Italian hairdresser brought in for the week and that was fabThe resort did arrange an outstanding buffet in the beach at the far end of the island for our company farewell we were with a group of aprox 60. but sadly around the bar there were loads of flies again but interestingly on the beach where the tables were set up was fine hardly a fly in sight. Again I think this is telling a story about the cleanliness around the resort buildingsOveral a shame as we had all expected an exceptional experience but I think we were all shocked by this isueI hope someone higher up the Four Seasons chain reads this review and does something about the problem before they loose all their future businesVery disappointed.", "offset": [1860, 2218], "date": "2017-06-04", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "1d5b30a9-c5cb-4026-b30d-2fd84eb5ab18", "sentence": "Luxurious hotel but hotel.

I am talking about the spirit of the Maldives the reason why we choose this area of the world for our precious holidays. And not another place. Everything is too perfect almost to be too artificial. The place is generally informal during the day but at night is a but more demanding than other 5star hotels in the area. I still believe that the Maldives should offer a mix of luxury wild experience a bit getting back to our origins and relax. This is not exactly the atmosphere we found there is a bit of Ritz Paris lurking around that feeling of excessive care that makes you feel good but not exactly relaxed. The layout of the island is unusual very long and narrow. so that for instance if you take one of the water villas and you have an 8PM dinner reservation you either need to call a cart absolutely efficient or walk a long way either running a bit or leaving your room early. Another point very little is included in the accommodation price so you somehow have to look to the right side of the menu to have an idea if your food is priced reasonably or not and trust me a lot of things are not. It does not want to be a complaint by all means but it does not come out as a relaxing place. For the quality of the infrastructure food wine list i would say absolutely excellent.

The villa was beautiful and we were greeted by a bottle of champagne and chocolate cake along with rose petals and good wishes for married life. The villa was immaculate and spacious furnished with the latest technology and all we would need for our stay including a section of complementary fresh fruit replenished daily. Our villas infinity pool was far larger than similar resorts I have stayed in before and you could see the reef sharks though the decking. When the tide went out it was possible to walk on the sand beneath the shallow water at the back of the villa. In room dining was diverse and delicious and allows you to see all the famous beauty of the Maldives whilst enjoying the mouth watering selection. A whole calendar of activities from snorkeling to fishing kayaking or jet skiing is available for those want to be active. The resort allows you to see the beauty of the Maldives from the dolphin sting ray or shark watching to visiting the rescued turtles or feeding the small reef sharks. We have to mention the spa just getting there on small Maldivian boat is experience in itself once there my wife and I enjoyed a treatment together watching the fish through a window in floor show casing the delightedly of the ocean.

This review is about the Four Seasons Explorer only. We spent 7 days on the Explorer which included a 3 day northern leg and a four day southern leg. We also spent 2 days at Kuda Hura and 5 days at Landa Giraviru. We are very experienced divers who travel with our own dive 50 kg and camera gear. 50 kgThis is easily the most luxurious dive boat around. The staterooms are large with Four Season bedding. A C is ice cold. Food was Four Season standard quality and excellent. Food and wine for dinner were included alcoholic beverages away from mealtime were extra but reasonably priced. Dive staff and outfitting were outstanding as were the diving facilities. Diving was ok but generally you shouldl go there for large animals only mantas seasonal be sure to check and whale sharks. Whale sharks seemed to be only on the southern 4 day leg at this time of the year we did get to see and photograph 2. Sadly between the Christmas 204 tsunami and last years El Nino the shallow reefs in the Maldives have been completely destroyed. Deeper pinnacles are still pretty and there a lot of ref life there. Water turbidity in some places was worse than I expected maybe because the shallow reftops that ring the atolls are now simply bare rock and coral rubble. If you are a casual diver this could still be a great trip particularly if you like big animals. Well traveled divers and macro photographers would be delighted by the service but disappointed by the diving itself. I would have given this experience a higher rating except for one unpleasant action on the part of the management. It seems that the venerable German TV show. Das Traumschif had been filming at the resort at Landa Giravaru while we were there. They wanted to film on the boat so we were exiled while they filmed which was not so bad itself other than the modest bento box cold breakfast between dives. However the filming delayed our departure that day so that instead of a daytime trip south to the next spot we were subjected to a nighttime passage. And so we were all awakened by the anchor chain being pulled through the hawsepipe at 215 AM then there were large quartering swells as we motored south which made sleep impossible until we anchored again at 730 AM at which point the next dives commenced. I mentioned the next day that we were promised only daytime passages when we booked and again when we departed on the trip a few days prior but we were told that the delays due to the filming were just one of those things that happen. There was no apology whatsoever from anyone. Just shrugs. Candidly given what the passengers paid for this trip the highest quality and I think the most expensive liveaboard in the world this was truly reprehensible action on the part of the company.

I just completed my 5D4N stay at Four Seasons Kuda Hura. I stayed at a few Four Seasons mainly in Asia. I booked my stay at the Four Seasons website. You do not get the best deal there but I decided to opt for this because I wanted to have a lot of. spa treatment so their spa inclusive deal also inclusive of speedboat transfers and daily breakfast was attractive to me. The reservation team was helpful in confirming that I could enjoy all the service which was supposed to offer to 2 persons. The concierge staff also helped to arrange an in house photoshoting which was confirmed prior to the trip. From the pickup at the airport to arrival the staff was nice and helpful. It was welcomed by the team at the reception. There was a bit of confusion on the meal arrangement but eventually it was clarified. They arranged a bungalow opposite to the Garden Spa the Island Spa was under renovation so they vacated a few bungalows to become the temporary spa. It was on the sunrise side. The room itself was spacious. The plunge pool was a bit too small only good for soaking. There was direct access to the beach which was not exclusive. But most of the time it was nice and quiet. Room was clean and tidy and the bed not surprisingly kept up with the Four Seasons standard. A few mindless mistakes the beach basket was missing and no toothbrush available but that was immediately rectified as I communicated through their ap. Kuda Hura is not disappointing at all. As a solo traveller I felt very much welcomed and at home. Many of the staff remembered my last name. I also had my birthday during the stay and the team planned a few celebrations with me from the spa to a cake at the bungalow personal greetings from the manager then a birthday present and the best table to have birthday dinner by the sea under the moon. I had a very enjoyable birthday. I also tried all of the restaurants Cafe Reef Club Italian Indian the Grill and the Lounge. All of them were exceptionally good of fine dining standard. The price was not cheap at all so even with the food credit of US 100 I got from the website booking it did not help too much. The photoshoting went very well and the photographer was very professional. He was also flexible in rescheduling the last hour of photoshoting to another day so I could make the best use of the weather. There were plenty of photographic spots around the resort. But the beach alone already was stunning enough. I also had an hour of private snorkeling lesson. As i did not have any prior experience I was advised to take the private lesson which costed the same as attending one of their scheduled group class. The coach was very professional he understood my biggest difficulty in breathing and taught me what to do to deal with it. Although the lesson only took an hour majority of the time I was able to snorkel and watched the fascinating coral reefs and fishes not far from the beach. It was definitely one of the most amazing moments of my life. Angelica the Assistant Spa Manager was particularly friendly and treated me very well. She even invited me for a sunset drink where we chatted and exchanged thoughts on many issues. She is a talented person and passionate about her job. Thank you very much the Four Seasons Kuda Hura team for making this one of my most memorable trips I had and certainly a fond memory of my birthday.", "offset": [2528, 2678], "date": "2019-06-23", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "a50f435a-5ce3-4105-9c59-857d079ca5d2", "sentence": "My Kuda Hura home. Had the most amazing 15 days of 2019 my Kuda Hura home. Leaving this magical place makes me so sad I have fond memories of surfing with Hamish and Holly the best of Tropic Surf. I was scared at first but the beers on board music and just the best vibes ever made me feel confident on the waves improving rapidly. Not to forget the dive team Moose Hasan Nazer Salim Yusuf and Tony who were the best dive team any one could have ever asked for. So kind so encouraging so professional and hilarious which grew to be our family spending several fun nights together full of joy and laughter. The spirit on this island is unforgettable. When you come here you do not have to think of a single thing everything is taken care of. I will never forget my time here and will hopefully be back very soon.

Could not have asked for a better location to spend our honeymoon. Serene beautiful and relaxed atmosphere was second to none when maintained by an extensive and attentive staff. Food at the restaurants albeit pricey was unique and wide in variety to make each dining experience quite memorable. We especially enjoyed the food and staff at the Reef Club where Branka and Nano made sure we had a great meal each time. The facilities and the room were pristine and we were impressed by the Heart of the House tour where we saw how much effort goes into making the resort run smoothly. We also had wonderful spa experiences with Angelika from the Spa Team who gave a personal touch and went the extra mile to make us make the most of our time there. We stayed at the water villas which were truly picturesque and comfortable in every way the attention to detail and thoroughness was exceptional.", "offset": [199, 315], "date": "2019-07-01", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "7760fc75-a580-4f77-b00c-ec8e5c0986f9", "sentence": "A Once in a Lifetime Experience. Nothing anyone tells you about the Maldives prepares you for the sheer experience. Yes it is expensive although cheaper options are now available around Male but absolutely worth it especially if you are celebrating a memorable occasion. The luxury and the colours of the sea and the sky will remain imprinted for a long time. This resort is top of the line and the entire package from the time that you arrive at the airport is so personalised. The staff are mostly young and multi cultural and are enthusiastic and it is clear that they are having as much of a good time as they are hoping you are. The restaurants are great Italian Indian seafood and also a Maldivian meal. The water sports and the sunrise sunset views were fabulous. The list could go on since there is immense attention to detail.

From the private speedboat ride from the airport to the resort the experience at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura only escalated from there. Having flown in from spending several days in Dubai and already having some incredible first time experiences our trip was about to take a turn to the utmost relaxation and exquisite beauty provided by this very private island in the Maldives. The property is spectacular and immaculately kept the staff went above and beyond throughout our stay and it not only met our expectations it far exceeded any vision we had. Then again that has been our experience with a Four Seasons anywhere across the board. We took advantage of snorkeling a wave runner tour and a sea bob rental. Noman was most helpful and was a true calming source for me during our snorkeling outing. The dining experiences were absolutely spectacular throughout. I ca n\u2019t think of a single need not met nor amenity that was n\u2019t available and the memories we created will live in my heart forever. Thank you to the manager Randy and Giovani whom was also constantly appearing around property and making certain we were very well cared for. You guys are awesome and we thank you for being part of our 20 year anniversary celebration. Hope to visit again.", "offset": [898, 1031], "date": "2020-03-21", "cpt": "2", "category": "atmosphere"}]}
