I spent three nights at the Four Seasons this past week and could not have been happier with my experience. Traveling often for work I have definitely become a self proclaimed hotel snob. The Four Seasons was just incredible. Having to go to Chicago in January was not appealing to me but staying here certainly made up for it. The details they take care of are. impressive. When using the gym a towel and water bottle await you want to piece of equipment. When you were done a cool towel and fruit and water are available. When you leave the spa area to head back to your room you can grab a cup of juice coffee or tea. Details in your room are equally impressive. Robes and slippers turndown service and even leaving a clear plastic bag for your toiletries when you return to the airport. The bed and pillows were wonderful very comfortable. The view of the lake was just incredible each morning. it is things like this that truly stand above any other hotel experience. The meetings that I attended for this business trip had nicely appointed rooms outstanding A V capabilities and the temperature was just right. All of these things almost never happen for a business meeting. The food was also outstanding. The food is fresh with multiple options available. It is always hard to eat healthy when you are traveling but this hotel managed to find a way to give you those options and make them very appealing as well is that you decided to splurge a little. Thank you Four Seasons. I will be back but next time for leisure.", "offset": [826, 878], "date": "2015-01-30", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "dbc19a44-b9c7-4aa6-94e8-fbf3cd066515", "sentence": "Ten Reasons for the Four Seasons. Ten Reasons for the Four SeasonsI am not a wealthy person but at this point in my life once in a while I feel like treating myself to something special. So in planning attendance at a professional conference in Chicago I went outside of the usual \u201c hotel planning \u201d website. I wanted to avoid the \u201c big box \u201d hotel the hostlery equivalent of Home Depot or WalMart and wanted something special. So I booked a room at the Four Seasons in Chicago at Delaware and Michigan Avenue for a five day stay. I knew it would be expensive but I wanted a fine hotel with great service as a little treat for me. It is an expensive hotel \u2013 not exorbitantly expensive but expensive. What does one get for that added expenseHere are ten reasons for the Chicago Four Seasons1. Excellent LocationThe hotel is on North Michigan Avenue with great access to the entire North Side of the city. It is a great walking area. The area catches the spirit of the city2. ServiceThe service staff from opening the cab door to check in to room service to concierge services to all amenities exceeds any hotel in which I have stayed. This is not cookie cutter \u201c How may I provide you with excellent customer service \u201d. This is genuine customer service. Somebody clearly told every employee \u201c Look. You are working at the Four Seasons act like it \u201d. And they do. These people genuinely take pride in their work. They know they represent a brand that must deliver excelence3. 15 minute room service for breakfast. I am one of those people who absolutely need coffee after stepping out of the shower. Although the self serve in room coffee maker in many hotels helps there is nothing like fresh brewed high end coffee in the morning. The Four Seasons offers a guaranteed fifteen minute to the room breakfast menu. Yes one feels like a Vanderbilt paying such a price for coffee juice and a muffin. But sitting there in your bathrobe sipping excellent coffee perfectly brewed staring at Lake Michigan \u2013 well what could be better. Have a Rahm Emanuel Mayor Daly Studs Turkel Irv Kupcinet Bobby Hull Ernie Banks Mike Ditka moment for yourself and make believe you are ruling the city4. Room quality towels and bathrobesMy late father always said that the mark of a truly great hotel is that the towels are so fluffy that when it is time to go home you can barely close your suitcase. To the Four Seasons staff That is a joke. The bathrobes defy some law of physics because they suck all of the water off of you once you don them. In addition the towels are luxurious. And plentiful. A lot of hotel soap can be lost in various anatomic locations on the human body but not so in this hotel5. TelevisionHigh definition televisions with out of this world controls that actually work. Two televisions in many of the roms6. No door slamingHow many times have you been on a trip tired and bedraggled after unpacking and eating trying to slip into the post time zone coma when people on the floor slam their hotel doors. Now I get it. It is certainly not intentional. They are laden with suitcases and let the door close on its own. But that door closing in most hotels is akin to a guillotine coming down during the French revolution. This problem is particularly acute with late arriving international guests. Not a problem at the Four Seasons. Those doors close silently. It seems as if MIT and CalTech got together and finally solved the problem7. Front DeskThe front desk staff is cheerful helpful and competent. They know the city. They know the problem faced by travelers. And they know how to fix travel problems with the airlines. They also offer free coffee in the lobby as you discuss your plans and needs with them8. Concierge service Restaurant reservations are no problem even for the most sought after eateries. I did not test them for show tickets or sporting events but my guess is that that would not be a problem9. Little details Many of the higher end hotels have a variety of tchotchkes but none like the Four Seasons slippers ear plugs should the wind off of the lake bother you water fruit chocolates on the pillow choice of morning papers. These touches all add to the experience. They even provided high end eye glass cleaning pads when they noticed eyeglasses on the table stand10. AliumAlium is the lobby level restaurant at the Four Seasons. The food is great. We had the chicken for two. Do n\u2019t miss the peach melba frappe for desert. Many people at conventions and meetings regard the hotel room simply as a bed and a bathroom. Functionally that is true. The Four Seasons is a spectacular hotel that delivers so much more. It is a hotel experience that I will remember for a long time. It is expensive. But if you work hard and want a real treat it is an enjoyable expense to spend some of your hard earned cash on such a memorable experience.", "offset": [4149, 4189], "date": "2015-10-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "c0b7afbe-948c-4f36-b74d-20e907ee91f4", "sentence": "Awesome hotel loved it.

One evening she received a complimentary cupcake which was delicious. We took advantage of the pool and playroom. both were I use by other children staying at the hotel. The hotel did a terrific job hosting its guests on Saturday who did not want to watch the parade outside. The adult and kids buffet was terrific and there was lots for little one to do if they did not want to watch the parade. We also took a bus to and from the hotel to the museum campus at the suggestion of the concierge to go to the aquarium it was so easy. We stayed in a junior executive suite looking over the lake and my child did not want to leave. The multitude of soft pillows were a particular favorite and my husband and I loved the tea and coffee in the room. We ordered room service on one occasion and ate breakfast every morning in the restaurant as well as had dinner or an after dinner treat in the lounge two evenings.
