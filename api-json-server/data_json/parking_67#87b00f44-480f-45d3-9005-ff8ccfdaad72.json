The location of the hotel is perfect for walking to Royals and Chiefs games. The officially policed crossing to the stadium car parks is only about 100 yards away. Most people take a short cut to the car pack down a steep grassy bank. If this is too steep for you then it is only a little further to use the road. Location perfect. The staff were friendly the pool was a bonus and the bar had beer specials that made it even easier to stop for a pre post game beer or cocktail. The room had one of those noisy aircon units on the floor not a problem for a heavy sleeper like me but my wife and daughter did wake up quite a bit. Also we were on the road side so the traffic noise was high. You can not have a great location without this downside though. No breakfast.

Great room. Only problem I had was the bath was only like a foot deep. Though I did not use the pool there was a lot of people there I saw who did use it so it must be decent at least.

The bathroom was not great and the shower did not drain properly which I notified staff 3 times with over the course of my 3 night stay. It was never resolved. The hotel was close to the freeway which made access easy. Parking was a problem some nights. The hotel is right next to the big MLB and NFL stadiums and since there were no games on the weekend we were there it was quiet. The rates were good too.
