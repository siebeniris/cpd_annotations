As Platinum Gold members we stay at Mariot properties about 23rds of the time when on the road. That said in a decade of travel we have never checked in and checked out within an hour at any hotel. The first impression was that maintenance to the parking and exterior facade had deteriorated since our last stay but this is often unavoidable after a Florida summer. What was unusual were the overflowing trash cans at the entry and pool areas moldy towels under sparse furnishing around the indoor pool and the odor of decay. The standard room had none of the amenities we have come to expect from Mariot refrigerator work space desk chair or seating area often a microwave. The desk clerk informed me that an upgrade was available if we wanted to pay for it. When reminded of the loyalty program promise for best available she suddenly discovered there were no better rooms for an upgrade and that we had already been given their best available because the room assigned was on the 8th floor of 9 with the concierge lounge closed for the weekend. I asked for the managers card so I could talk to him her but she could not find one though I did find a welcome letter on the counter with no contact information. On leaving the hotel there was no apology no offer of follow up or suggestion of further contact with any supervisor. I realize this is an older facility and I am certain that the management has been trying to hold it together during its slow decline over the years we have worked in JAX but it certainly appeared to me at least on this stay that it was well on the way to disenfranchisement. Fortunately there were rooms available at the Baymeadows Residence Inn about a mile or so away where we found a well maintained and managed property that interestingly is an even older Mariot facility.", "offset": [227, 394], "date": "2015-11-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "e70e3267-4a28-4392-b3e6-210a61d70064", "sentence": "Avoid.
