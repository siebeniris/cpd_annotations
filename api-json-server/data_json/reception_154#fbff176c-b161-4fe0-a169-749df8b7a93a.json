I wondered about the level of staffing for a few reasons. When I arrived all I could see was what turned out to be a valet parking desk. There was only one party in front of me but I waited for 10 minutes before seeing the front desk which is a little out of sight from the front desk. I call the front desk every night for a wake up call which is my practice and was put on hold numerous times. There was garbage on the ground in the parking garage my sink did nt drain the first night and a wet spot on the floor next to my bed leak in the wall and other indicators that there are not enough people to maintain the building.

Ice on the Floor. Old Hotel. I have previously stayed at the Crowne Plaza as our corporate office is nearby. Those experiences were average enough for me to try to stay at other hotels in the area as there are nicer ones available. However I had to stay at the Crowne Plaza for a work conference and it was possibly the worst hotel experience I have had to date. I will never willingly stay at this hotel again and have advised our corporate office of the issue with the hopes that they do not force us to stay there again either. The experience started out as it usually does parking under the hotel and taking the ancient elevators to the lobby and dragging my suitcase across the lobby to check in. The staff members at the desk were very friendly and check in was quick. The elevator to the room was dirty with a McD bag in the corner and coffee stains on the floor. It was a wedding weekend so I tried not to think too much of it. The room I received on the 10th floor was the same as my previous stays. Remodeled but showing signs of wear and not proper care. The windows were filthy so I could not see the fabulous view that the front desk lauded. The curtains were stained. The bathroom is still old and needing complete renovation. All in all what I expected for this hotel. However what I did not expect was to wake up in the morning literally covered with bug bites. I had them on my hands chest fingers and chin I took photos for proof. I also saw a small brown bug run across the bed. I immediately went down stairs to request assistance and the head of housekeeping was at my room before I could take the dirty elevator back up from the front desk. She looked around the bed and said that it was not bed bugs but she arranged for me to have a new room and told her colleague to have the room fumigated. She was kind but offering me free breakfast for my very obvious suffering and trauma seemed to be a very weak peace offering especially as breakfast was part of the work conference. I did not have time to complain further as I had to attend the conference with my face and hands red and swollen. In fact those bug bites remained for three weeks. The second room on the eighth floor was like the first remodeled but with signs of wear and an old bathroom but at least it had no bugs. However it was literally across from the ice machine which ran loudly every 30 minutes for two days and on the last day the machine was spitting ice onto the floor. The hotel obviously knew of the issue as a towel was placed on the floor in front of the machine but by the time I checked out at 8 am there was a mountain of ice about 1 ft high on the floor. I also have fun photos of this as well. I did let IHG know of the issues I experienced and they sent the standard I am so sorry we will speak with hotel to improve e mail but I still received my bill for the night in the bug infested room and the scars from the bug bites to remind me of the visit. As a positive the conference in the hotel was very well serviced. However that will not convince me to ever ever stay at the Crowne Plaza Dunwody again.", "offset": [1072, 1160], "date": "2016-02-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "ea815721-d89d-4c0f-8473-dc7531319b5e", "sentence": "Misled. Create Date 04192016 1059 PMSubject. My main and only reason I booked at the crown plaza was because the website said there was a sauna I get there and I search top to bottom for the sauna and I am later informed by hotel reception that there is no sauna and has never been one then in the morning i asked another receptionist about it and she informed me that there is no longer a sauna and that if I wanted to complain I should go online to make a complaint on trip adviser which was helpful but she also could have completed my request of asking to speak to a manger on top of that the info on the hotel website mentions the sauna then I am informed by hotel staff that there has not been a sauna for two years. Which leads to the question of why has not the site been updated. Why was I mislead to procure my business. Not to mention how the hotel staff made me feel as if since I got my room at an advanced rate that I should not be complaining due to the fact that I did not have to pay the trumped up rate for all of the so called amenities the hotel has to offer. All said and done the site info was misleading and the receptionist confused me about how the cancellation policy worked had I known any of this I would not have ever booked a room at that location. I anticipated enjoying my stay because I do not get vacation time often and this trip was supposed to be special but it was ruined due to outdated info and under informed staff that being said it would be nice to receive feedback from upper management as soon as possible thanks for nothing Atlanta Perimeter at Ravinia.", "offset": [831, 1079], "date": "2016-04-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "43be31fd-2b6b-41fd-b5c2-4cc5d2d79523", "sentence": "Pretty but Poor service.

My friend and I arrived at the Crown Plaza Ravina Hotel Atlanta Georgia 2 hours before our conference was to begin. Hungry and tired we were hoping to get a bite to eat before attending the conference. We were excited and hopeful as the check in line was short only 2 people before us \u2026 yet we found ourselves waiting and waiting \u2026 and waiting \u2026. 10 min 15min 20 min 25 min pass before we finally get our chance to approach the receptionist. Eager to check in and move on we greet the lady at the front desk whose attitude we find to be less than friendly who moved very slowly and acted very busy and important. She looks at our reservation through her glasses then she stares at the computer screen for quite some time then waves her red colored pony tail and tells us We do not have it. As you can imagine at this point we are somewhat taken aback. We enquire as to the meaning of her statement pointing to the printout of our 4night reservation paid in full. Yet the receptionist replies with We do not have a room for you. Well \u2026 we show her the booking number to which she less than graciously replies \u201d Yes you maybe have a reservation but you did not pay for it \u201d. We are pointing to the payment confirmation which prompts the following reply. Oh yes you may be paid for your stay but we do not have a room for you \u201d. We ask her to kindly refer us to her manager \u2026 she asks us to wait \u2026 we are waiting even more hungry and. tired than before as about an hour had passed since our arrival \u2026 our hope to eat and rest a bit before the conference is fading away. 45 minutes later approaching the manager who is swamped and works really hard trying to solve many problems she is faced with she looks at our paid reservation then she looks at the computer screen and informs us that they indeed do have a room for us but only for 1 night and in a different building. Well once again we are pointing to the dates in the reservation. Time is passing by the conference is already starting \u2026. miraculously our reserved room for 4 nights and in very same building is found. What a joy we are late for the conference we may not have any time to eat but at least we have a place to sleep. Next day on a 40 min. break we are running to the hotel cafe restaurant for a tea and some sweets. Thankfully there are not too many customers we \u2019re thinking it will be fast and easy. A very confident somewhat self absorbed tall easy going young. waiter approaches our table. We order the tea and the sweets feeling that we have enough time for a cup of tea before the break is over. Unfortunately 10 20 min later no waiter no tea 25 min later he shows up. We enquire about our tea. \u201c Oh yeah. sure \u2026 \u201d he replies. Time passes no waiter no tea the break is over \u2026 we head back to the conference room. In the evening coming to the reception asking for scissors the woman with the red colored pony tail instantly dismisses us with WE DON\u2019T HAVE IT her fellow receptionist hands us the scissors.

I checked in last night and the lobby is beautiful. My check in experience was great she was very friendly and thorough. My room is also newly renovated and very nice. But the reason for my review has to do with a medical incident I experienced while sitting in their upstairs cafe waiting for my food. I have frozen shoulder a very painful and limiting condition that will last between 15 and 3 years. I did an incorrect movement with it and experienced the most pain I have ever felt in my life. I immediately got dizzy and hot and stood up to try and reach a bench nearby. I did not make it all the way and ended up lying down on the floor about 1 second from fainting. The night manager Ahmed saw me and came over right away. A waitress also came over do not know her name. long dark hair. They put a pillow under my head and gave me a glass of water and a cold cloth for my head and let me lay there until I stated feeling better. Then they brought over a chair and let me sit for a few minutes. My food arrived and they packed it up for me and gave it to me on the house. When I felt comfortable standing Ahmed walked me to my room with my food. He called me later that night to see how I was. He also brought me a couple of bottles of water as well after the call. Today in the late afternoon I received a call from a guest services person to check in on how I was doing and she said that Ahmed had asked her to follow up. I sincerely feel that he went above and beyond to ensure I was ok. I thanked him every step of the way but wanted to publicly thank him as well.
