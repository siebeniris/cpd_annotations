I spent the MLK 2015 weekend in LA and wanted to ensure I had a nice convenient location where I could easily access all areas that I needed to visit ie the lower Valley Santa Monica and Beverly Hills West Hollywood. I could not have been more satisfied with the location and it was such a quick easy trip from my rental car location at LAX. TIP. National Car Rental is in a terrific spot if you have Emerald Club service the shuttle will pick you up regardless and from there you can just choose your own car and submit your credit card etc at the exit gate and boom you are on your way. it is literally a quick right and then a left onto La Cienega Blvd. STRAIGHT DOWN to the SLS nice and easy and took me less than 20 minutes and a comfortable drive at that at 930 pm on a Friday night. First Impressions It is very busy on the weekends as this is a very hip trendy and lifestyle oriented hotel and the Bazaar Restaurant by Jose Andres is definitely a place to be seen. We had no issues pulling up to the valet where we received excellent service upon arrival and throughout the duration of the stay Minor mishap Day 2 getting me the wrong car but no harm no foul overall and a very sweet apologetic staff that even provided us bottled Evian water for our trip PRIOR to the mistake mind you. When you walk in there is a red carpet for you to walk on and some chunky pieces inspired by the wilderness in the outdoor living room area funky couches taxonomy heads big blankets etc a really welcome sight after the friendly greeting we received. From there we had a very lovely Olivia Mun looking attendant at check in who was just delightful and within 10 minutes we were whisked away to our rooms on the 3rd floor. Elevators are a fun ride too see pic below to see what I mean. Room VERY cool funky vibe and very comfortable beds. There are form over function issues because while the sliding glass bathroom doors are fun they provide little in the way of privacy when you want to be able to do your business hopefully you catch the drift. Great tub though my 60 year old mother found it a bit challenging to climb into. However no complaints about the great shower pressure and the pour from above tub super relaxing after a flight. TV in the wall is great and they have a good number of channel selections including multiple HBO channels and everything you might need. Bell attendants were not pushy but they were very helpful since we were rushing to make our reservation at the Bazaar 15 minutes after check in. I will cover that restaurant separately but definitely a must do if you stay at the hotel. Now the negative the walls are fairly thin and we apparently had a connecting room and they had a baby crying next door. I did not hear it during the evening or at any inconvenient times so I was not too bothered but something to keep in mind. Halls General Attendants On every floor there is a pool table and a mural of some celebrity. Penelope Cruz Adam Levine Mary J Blige etc and some very modern furniture directly around it. Again just a FUN vibe here. The various concierge and attendants at different places were all friendly and certainly greeted us each time we entered exited the hotel so I have no complaints there. Pool Gorgeous relaxing spot. My nice bartender got me a spicy watermelon martini by the pool as I watched the sun set and it was divine and not too crowded obviously at this time of year. OVERALL SYNOPSIS. Despite one or two minor hiccups I had definitely stay here again can not beat the location or the great restaurant pool and delightful service. Thank you SLS for a very memorable stay.", "offset": [394, 635], "date": "2015-01-23", "cpt": "0", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "e8672629-530a-44aa-afa6-6c37a7002197", "sentence": "Over rated horrible design tiny rooms. I wish I had read some of the reviews before deciding to stay at the SLS. I travel often and have stayed at many hotels but SLS has to be one of the worst hotels I have stayed. Definitely not worth the money. As other reviews have noted rooms here are tiny and worst of all ceilings are low. I had to upgrade at least 3 notches to a suite but I still felt cramped because the design was so bad. They have a TV wall in the middle of the room. Also what is with the yellowish dim lights. You feel like you are in at a dark restaurant all the time. If you have a car it is almost impossible to park nearby so you are out additional 45 to 50 per day on top of your hotel. Visitors try to stay at SLS because of the cool bar and The Bazar but a bad idea. Just reserve a table or hang out at the bar. No need to book a room. Most of my friends who stayed at this hotel hated. They also complained about the the confusing hallway. If you are staying in the LA area and want a hotel with a decent bar at better value I would stay at the W Hollywood.", "offset": [585, 706], "date": "2016-01-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "80eb69d8-c55e-4913-b65b-3597e4156aaf", "sentence": "My Entourage. I travelled to the SLS for a 4 day business trip and was very happy with my stay. The hotel is 5 star and it lives up to the expectations. The rooms are spacious clean and well decorated. I stayed in a twin room but had the chance to see a few other rooms which were all spacious and decorated in a similar style. The communal areas are very art deco and trendy. You will see form my pics portraits of Jay Z and pool tables in the halls. The SLS is exactly what you had expect from a top quality hotel in Beverly Hills from the rooftop pool to celebrities in the lifts and foyer to a cameo in a well known tv show. Staff at the hotel were extremely hospitable and friendly Nothing was ever too much. Absolutely everything is done for guests valet parking dry cleaning mail service dinner reservations and suggestions and the list goes on. We had breakfast brunch on the roof overlooking the hills each morning and despite being busy there is a sense of privacy. The pool is not for the keen swimmer but more the sun seeker wishing for a bit of respite from the blazing sun. If you want to stay at The SLS for leisure be sure to book early as I imagine rooms book up quickly especially in the summer months. Be prepared to part with a significant amount of money for the privilege but you will not be disappointed. Everything you need in conveniently placed from Rodeo Drive to Barneys and the walk of fame. No car rental required although to go further afield it might come in handy. My first choice of hotel in LA above The W and Mondrian. I will definitely be back.", "offset": [1421, 1497], "date": "2016-03-06", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "aa5b9c4e-0077-4e58-810f-9fcfdaa6f5c7", "sentence": "Luxury in Name Only.

Fine. Really at this point we did not have a choice. At 85 pmsix HOURS after the posted check in time we get a room telling us that our room is ready.

No that is still in the old room despite having been promised our luggage would be in our new room and despite having repacked our luggage so it could be transported. At this point we gave up and told them we would keep the first room and deal with the fallout in the morning. In the morning as we are walking to have breakfast the customer service manager who to her credit was incredibly competent and friendly finds me and apologizes for what happened last night. She offered a bottle of red wine or champagne which we had to decline politely. She asked what we wanted. After discussion at breakfast the answer was clear a refund of the prior nights stay. And so we received a free night which is the only reason this is not a one star rating. Speaking of breakfast the SLS fails again. Unlike the other Fine Hotels Resorts properties at which I have stayed the SLS confines patrons to its continental breakfast menu. it is an interesting spread but it is ultimately lacking especially when the full breakfast menu items look far more appealing.
