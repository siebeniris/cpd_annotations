Great Location great weather and surprisingly good tap water however not worth with the type of service you receive. CONS. From the day one we realized the service was a complete failure. No vacationer deserves to go through the anguish of getting the basic needs met while on vacation. Cofe machine was broken it took half day to replace it with another one. Horible room service. Towels were not replaced after the first day of use so on the second day we had to reuse the same towels. On third day when we returned back to the room there were no clean towels again. We placed several calls from 50 pm to 90 pm to get towels and no one showed up. They never brought clean towels in the room. We had to go outside and chase the towel card at 930 pm at night to get clean towels. That night we could not go out to eat so we ended up eating in the room. The fourth day towels were not replaced again so we had to reuse same towels from day three. Same issue with shampoos and hand soaps. They were never refilled during the stay. We also ran out of toilet paper and were arguing with each other to carefully use it Come on. is this how anyone should spend their dream vacation. Outside the room services were as bad. There were very few lounge chairs and you can only get one if you show up before 8 am otherwise you will end up with only beach towels which were also limited and few times you had to wait for over 1 hour to get one. Beach and pool were inaccessible due to the sea grass and uncleanness Restaurant services and food quality were mediocre and super expensive. Breakfast was 23 p and dinner over 32 p exclude tip oh yes they expect you pay 15 some places 18 and above gratuity.

The Best in Puerto Rico. We just returned from our fourth trip to Puerto Rico in the last year and while I have been fortunate to stay at several 45 start resorts on the island Gran Melia was the first to meet exceed my expectations. I hope this does not read like a commercial for the resort but I just can not explain how much we enjoyed our stay at the Gran Melia Golf Resort Puerto Rico without using a lot of superlatives. The location is perfect being just outside of San Juan on a beautiful peninsula in the Rio Grande area and close to all attractions without feeling like you are in the middle of a tourist center. The drive from the airport is just about 30 minutes and yet you feel like you are in a tropical paradise surrounded by a gorgeous beach with a backdrop of the rain forest. Upon arriving at one the grandest entries you will find in the Caribbean the minute you walk into the facilities you are surrounded by luxury and comfort. The staff was incredible and every where you look you will find areas designed to make you feel relaxed and pampered. We stayed in a Garden Villa not your common garden view that was in the middle of lush tropical plants and pools of flowers and fountains. The lighting effects at night were very special and everywhere you went the landscaping was perfect. The facilities including the restaurants pools beach and lounging areas were all inspiring and well kept. The beach areas were beautiful and the due to the reef location the water off the beach was calm and relaxing. The pool was huge and offered activities and areas for any age group. If you are a golfer the Trump course is just down the road and offers a dramatic layout and challenge for any level of experience. I have stayed at the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar and there is no comparison between the two Resorts with Gran Melia offering a much more fulfilling experience and amenities. The staff was wonderful and always helpful and available for assistance. The Drivers of the Golf Carts that take you around the facilities were as pleasant and helpful as they could be and we really enjoyed our rides with Pedro and Steven. The staff at Registration were also great and always greeted you with a smile. There is a wonderful selection of restaurants on the property catering to almost any taste with great service and quality of food.

Wow. what a wonderful stay we just had. We really wanted a peaceful restful vacation with the OPTION of adding amenities as our week unfolded. Our initial reservation was regular level but we upgraded to red level imediately mostly to improve the room location and access to the adult pool and free Bali beds made it worth it even though we joked about making sure we found ways to make it worth it every day. so glad we did. The main pool has loud music playing continuously. Not our thing but maybe good for families and young people. Lesley at adult pool took such good care of us. and Ruben too. Even though the wave breakers prevent the surf from coming close the privacy along the beach is outstanding. The hammocks a wonderful way to end the afternoon. A rental car is a must for off resort activities and restaurants. Try the Surfrider restaurant on bay in Luquilo so fun. watch out for prices at Richies. The spa needs a cosmetic upgrade GET RID OF THE FAKE GRASS IN THE WAITING ROOM icky. but Bill the Masseuse was outstanding and I have had many many massages. No complaints except aesthetics of spa itself. The dinner at Tempo Ital Steak house terrific. All in all the staff here was pleasant and EXTREMELY HELPFUL right from the start.

All the beautiful spaces at this resort and the cocktail hour is behind dark glassed in function room. Why offer it if its not going to be well done.

The breakfast buffets were well done and full of options. the am waitstaf very cheerful. Honestly after reading the reviews I was so concerned I do not think we got lucky.

When we first got to the hotel I was impressed. The layout was beautiful. Decor was gorgeous vibrant and colorful. The fish in the lobby were beautiful. We were Red Level guests so the host directed us to the Red Level Check In. There was a couple there checking in and no one else working. The hotel employee was very slow as she checked the couple in. We sat there for about 25 minutes just waiting to be seen. After she checked them in it took her a good 6 minutes to just acknowledge us. She called us to sit down and in the middle of checking us in tells us that the system is down and we can not get a room yet. She suggested that we go to the pool and grab lunch and that she would call us when our room is ready. Fine. We go to have lunch at the pool bar and about 20 minutes later she calls to let us know that our room is ready. After we finished lunch we went back to the check in area so settle our security deposit of 100 per night. We only stayed 3 nights so I approved 30 Fine. So we finally get to our room. which was pretty nice. Nice decor comfort level. Once we settle in we decided we wanted to try out the jacuzi. First off the plug of the hot tub was out of the tub. Looked broken. I tried putting it back into the hot tub and it would not close. I called the front desk and asked that she send someone to fix it. She said the repairman would be right over. So my boyfriend and I decided to go to the beach or lack thereof. There was no beach. Just rocky sand and rock water. Definitely a negative of the resort. We stayed there and noticed the repairman on our balcony. so we decided to go back and use the hot tub since it was already late after our check in delay. So we go back into the room and to the hot tub and notice the plug is gone now. I called the front desk again and exclaimed that it was missing. She told me that the repairman was looking for a new plug. I said ok. At this time it was 5 pm so we decided to go to the Happy Hour that was included in our red level package. The happy hour was decent. It should have been somewhere outside but it was in the red level check in area that looked like a dark library. But it was not bad. Wine Beer Sangria was included. Light refreshments also. After about an hour and a half at happy hour we decided to check on the hot tub again. We get back and the plug is in the tub but has BLACK DUCK TAPE around it. And STILL did not work. At this point I was just fed up. I called the front desk and she put me through to the manager. I told her the main reason that we upgraded to a suite was for the hot tub on the balcony. I had to ask for a new room. She did not even offer. She finally agreed and said that she would look for another room and she would send someone to get us when it was ready. So we packed up all of our belongings again. Five minutes later a repairman shows up with a new plug and finally fixes our hot tub. We decided to just stay in the room after that to avoid any further hassle or complications. The rest of the stay was pretty good. The main pool is beautiful and the swim up bar is convenient. We wanted to go to San Juan until we realized a cab one way was 120 do not bother trying to get a cab elsewhere because the hotel will not let them in. Thank god we made friends with another couple there who split a cab with us. Also there is no where close to the resort to purchase anything. Food was good but expensive and limited. The second day I requested housekeeping so we could come back to a clean room after breakfast. We came back to a dirty one. Had to call again and she said someone would come over. After the pool our room was finally clean. She did not clean the hot tub the whole trip there. There was dead bugs and debris dried up in it. After the second day of the maid not cleaning or touching the hot tub I decided to just clean it myself. Also when we were checking out the 300 deposit already charged to my card turned into 50. When I asked the girl at the front desk she said she had no idea why they charged so much but it would be released to me. Thank god I had enough money available. Oh and magically our towel cards disappeared off of our night stands which are a 50 charge each if you do not replace. Another couple had the same issue so we confronted the front desk together. She replaced the towel cards with no issue but seems fishy. Check out was simple but two days after coming home I had fraudulent charges on my credit card. I called my bank and they said where have I swiped my card the last week. Hm Hopefully the resort is not in cahoots with criminals. Overall we had bad luck on this vacation. Did not get wifi the whole time there. Kept getting error messages. Not looking forward to my phone bill. The resort is gorgeous but did not feel like a guest. The staff needs to get it together.

I like the resort because it is far away from the craziness of San Juan and located in a private area of Rio Grande about 20 miles from San Juan. We rented a car from SJU airport and it took us 40 minutes to get to the resort due to the traffic. As other reviewers mentioned the resort is new and everything looks fantastic. Our king size oceanfront room was large and conveniently located steps away from the beach literally 10 steps and next to the hotel \u2019s main restaurants. I took advantage of paying more to access the club lounge. It was worth the extra cost as club guests get special access to a private pool and the lounge which is open throughout the day. The breakfast and evening options were very limited in the lounge. However we also had lunch at the restaurant by the pool and the food was fantasticI\u2019m not sure why some other reviewers complained about the service at this hotel. I had a completely different experience and found everyone we encountered to be kind efficient and extremely helpful. Immediately upon check in our bags were collected and we were given all of the information about the property by the receptionist who was very professional. We were also given a quick tour of the resort as well. The facilities at the Hyat Coco Beach are truly first class.

Areas of growth The service at the pool bar was not good. My fiance went up to the bar to order a drink and was ignored for 5 10 min. I tried after and the same thing happened. There were 6 7 employees behind the bar but they all seemed frazzled busy. Finally a server approached us at our seat and offered us drinks The lunch buffet was low quality. Breakfast was somewhat better but still much lower quality that meals I have experienced at other Hyat Regency properties I would expect more food variety given that the resort is secluded and it is difficult to get to restaurants outside the resort There is an overall lack of attention to detail around the resort. Some examples of this are no soap in the mens bathroom in the lobby landscaping seems outdated etc. When I was emailing the concierge I noted that my fiance and I were celebrating our engagement and asked about possibly paying to upgrade our room. He said that he forwarded our request to the front desk but then this was never addressed. Even if an upgrade was not available I would have at least expected a reply to my request. I know Hyat recently acquired this property I honestly think they reopened it too early. I do think this will eventually be a really high quality resort.", "offset": [286, 432], "date": "2020-01-02", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "fb92489e-38b6-4a01-91e3-382608cc844b", "sentence": "beautiful yet secluded w some service mgmt issues to improve this comprehensive review includes Club Access info. OVERALL This is a beautiful secluded spacious resort. Even though it was full we were able to find places at the beach and pools to sit that were not very crowded most days though on New Year \u2019s eve day it was a little crowded but not so much that we had to \u2018 wake up really early to get beach chairs as is the case. some resorts. Though the property was just remodeled and rebranded as a Hyat Regency Grand Reserve there is still remodeling going on in one portion of the property. This did NOT affect our stay at all it was far away from our rooms and also there was no construction going on while we were there perhaps due to the holiday. If I were to stay there again in the coming months I \u2019d recommend calling and asking the status of the construction going on at the far end. ACCESSIBLE. The rooms are in two story bungalows \u2013 if stairs are a concern be sure to request a ground floor room \u2013 and one that is closer to the main entrance lobby. Our rooms were far from the lobby \u2026 this was ok w us but anyone who has difficulty walking andor small children may wish to request something closer. see pic of map I included. NOTE. If one is closer to the lobby you may hear the bands djs that are in the lobby bar. but I do not really know. SECLUDED. We have been to Puerto Rico many times and usually stay in a different resort location each time. This resort is about 35 45 minutes depending on traffic from the more crowded Condado and Isla Verde areas. It is a short drive to Luquilo Beach which has a lot of kiosks casual but you can sit down eat in most of them. There are carts you can request to take you to your room or to take you to a location on property. We did not use them much but they are available \u2026 FAMILY COUPLES ONLY. Though we went with our children one in HS other in college this resort is nice for a couples vacation however although there was a band in the bar lobby area each night \u2013 this was a very \u201c chill \u201d place to be \u2013 if you want more nightlife ability to walk to bars livelier atmosphere \u2014 this is not your place. ACTIVITIES. There are various things you can rent on property tennis rackets bicycles paddle boards and other water \u201c toys \u201d. There is a little ping pong table and jenga by the pool towel hut where one can play some games too. The golf course looks nice though we did n\u2019t golf. SPA FITNESS CENTER. The fitness center is adequate though the disinfectant wipes container was broken. There is a variety of equipment including weights. The spa was open but not functioning in the same building. It is in another part of the property until the spa is remodeled in the same building as the fitness center. There is a pool by the Fitness center and future spa building but it was closed. We only used the treadmill but nothing else. We probably would have had massages if the spa was open. The disinfectant wipes container was broken. EXCURSIONS. This hotel is close to Luquilo Beach and is one of the closest resorts to El Yunque rainforest. It \u2019s an easy 30 40 min drive to the marina in Fajardo where you can take a snorkeling or other boat tour or charter one. Guavate is about 90 min away if you want to explore Lechon Highway Pork highwayON SITE RESTAURANTS. The property has a few restaurants we ate at Water \u2019s Edge has buffet but we opted for a la carte El Jefe food truck by the pool Prime 787 and Pasi\u00f3n By Chef Myrta. The food overall was ok \u2013 nothing special but convenient though I liked the food truck tacos best. Reservations for the restaurants needs complete conceptualization for 1 making reservations 2. providing menus 3 ensuring staff are aware of allergies sensitivities and celiac eg some staff did n\u2019t know what celiac was or \u201c gluten fre\u201d\u2014even in Spanish \u2013 and the food truck could easily provide g f options such as corn tortillas instead of flour ones. I tried making reservations with the concierge but the concierge said I had to make reservations directly w the restaurants \u2026 and Pasi\u00f3n is not affiliated w the hotel \u2013 and had just opened \u2026. so I could not find any information on it. This is ridiculous \u2026 we paid extra for concierge level service and did not get it. Moreover ordering for the food truck is a confusing and disorganized \u2014 basically I learned to corner a waitress and beg for my order. Ordering drinks at the pool took an equally long time. Apparently servers ALSO make drinks. This is so inefficient esp considering in 2 occasions the servers did not know how to make the drinks I ordered Mai Tai and Sangria \u2026 We had a milestone wedding aniv dinner. Prime 787 and no one acknowledged it in most restaurants one would have \u201c happy aniv \u201d on the dessert. We were not looking for handouts but certainly did n\u2019t feel any more special than the couple sitting next to us having a New Year \u2019s eve dinner \u2026 at Pasi\u00f3n my salad had a lot of bad lettuce \u2026 I pointed this out and nothing was done to make up for this \u2026 I could have objected more but we were tired and just wanted to leave. There was also a little coffee juice light salads fruit cups and sandwiches area \u2013 I suggested to the delightful staff there to consider adding fruit smoothies batidos and acai bowls to their offerings. They have a blender so it seems it would be easy to do. Of course one can get daquiris but my kids wanted real fruit smoothies or even better acai bowls and not virgin daquiris. Batidos are made all over Puerto Rico \u2013 I imagine it would be an easy addition to the menuOF SITE RESTAURANTS. We ate in San Juan Rio Grande Dos Panza Taqueria Lupita \u2019s food truck Iguanas Cocina. the Wyndham \u2019s Rio Mar Country Club and Palmer Degrees 18\u2014excelent acai bowls and smoothies. The golf clubhouse in Coco Beach a very short drive or half mile or so walk. was highly recommended by someone who heard me complaining about how confusing and how long it took to order a drink and some tacos from the pool bar. She said her son plays golf and that they got take out from the clubhouse the food was really good \u2026 unfortunately we found out about this the last day but we def would have taken a quick drive or jog over for more lunch offerings. One of my favorite meals was at Lupita \u2019s Mexican food truck next to a Walgrens. If you \u2019re uneasy about eating on the side of the highway or a Walgrens \u2013 take it back to the hotel \u2014 you wo n\u2019t be disappointed there were several locals who called ahead their orders for pick upSERVICE. Service is nice and friendly and it is clear everyone is working hard. Management needs to reconceptualize a lot of its mechanisms eg ordering food from the truck food and drinks by the pool inability for concierge to make restaurant reservations if one pays for concierge service \u2013 one should get it \u2013 including restaurant reservations by the concierge. Waiting 20 minutes to order and then another 40 minutes for a drink and food is unacceptable \u2013 even on New Year \u2019s eve day. It \u2019s also unacceptable for concierge services to be able to make reservations whether or not one pays for \u201c Club Access \u201d. This is what concierges do I was told I had to make my own reservations and the concierge recommended I walk over to each restaurant however I was unable to make a reservation. Pasion b c it did n\u2019t open until 6PM and I could n\u2019t find a phone number and no one seemed to know what it was either. Having copies of menus available would be very helpful too. CHECK IN. Check in was smooth and friendly most importantly our request to have our rooms next to adjoining to our childrens room were honored. Though friendly and very nice for a resort of this caliber or what it aspires to be there should be welcome refreshments offered. None were though I later saw that there was a daquiri looking beverage that was offered to those checking in. I checked in during the late afternoon and it was hot and we had been traveling since the early morning. a welcome drink would have been much appreciated and is the norm in a lot of resorts. Also as it is the holidays I was surprised that nowhere did anyone offer a coqui drink \u2026 the last time we stayed in PR even the smallest local restaurants offered a little coqui drink. OUR ROOMS. We had very quiet private ocean front rooms with balconies. the rooms were very clean and nice with most of what one would expect. Rooms have an empty refrigerator with a couple of waters and a capsule coffee machine but we never used it opting for coffee from the club room. I was surprised there were no robes or slippers. I did request these and was told they are not always in the room and one has to request them. so if you want robes slipers be sure to request ahead so they are in the room when you check in. Toiletries were good quality however we had to ask for hand and body soap after a few days this should have been replenished w out asking \u2013 and this is typical about every 3 days. We stayed a whole week. Our bathroom had a rain shower and also a big deep tub w a handle. We only used the shower. CLUB ACCESS I always wonder if it \u2019s worth it to pay extra for club access since we like to spend time at the pool and beach and not in a room but we found club access convenient though our kids did not care for the continental breakfast but that does n\u2019t surprise me \u2014 they are partial to acai bowls. None of us are big breakfast eaters either. If your family likes light simple snacks and water flat and sparkling. then you may wish to consider it. There are a variety of board games one can play a tv indoors and nice outdoor seating \u2026 just do n\u2019t leave your food unattended \u2013 birds will swoop in and eat it. I called to ask what they had to determine if we really wanted to pay the extra and got a vague answer about snacks and drinks \u2014 so here is what was offered when we were there as it may help others decide if it \u2019s worth the expense to themAl day. Bottled water juices soft drinks. Honor bar. Beer and wine are available that you can charge to your room nuts whole fruitContinental breakfast 7AM10AM Typically there was cheese smoked salmon bagels bread fruit mini muffins cold cuts tomatoes boiled eggs yogurt parfait pancakes or French toast and oatmeal. There were no gluten free items though of course eggs fruit are and I heard someone asking for almond milk. Though the staff seemed like they wanted to help with regards to any allergens \u2013 I believe the management should work on ensuring more nut free dairy free and gluten free options. If you opt for this \u2013 note that after 9AM it gets really packed with people \u2014 and the coffee line can take a while there \u2019s only 1 coffee machine that makes regular latte cappuccino coffee \u2026. I\u2019d recommend going 8AM or no later than 830AM. Coffee was good strong though the coffee machine is high maintenance requiring frequent addition of milk and emptying of coffee grindsDuring the day During the day there were nuts some dried and fresh whole fruit and granola barsEarly evening 5 7PM. grilled veggies cheese nuts mini desserts eg mini cheesecakes or rice pudding and other hors doeuvres that varied day by day chicken skewers hummus chips and guacamole fried calamariIt closed 10PM every night \u2026. so if you want bottled water for your room be sure to get some before 10PMPARKING There is self parking that is 1673 per day. Even though one can leave and return anytime each time one has to walk to the front to have one \u2019s parking ticket validated. This is a big hassle. We chose not to valet our car so we would not have to wait for the valet or call ahead. Management should figure out a better system for customers who do not valet. RENTAL or UBER. Though uber is prevalent in San Juan I would recommend renting a car unles you want to ONLY spend time at the hotel and eat at its restaurants. We ate at the Wyndham Iguanas and a Mexican restaurant off the main road. SPECIAL CELEBRATIONS. Though it was a milestone anniversary for us the only acknowledgement we got was when we checked in \u2026 we do n\u2019t expect handouts but there are simple things that could have been done like a dessert that included \u201c Happy Anniversary \u201d or some sparkly confetti on the table \u2026 if you expect anything nice or out of the way expect to do it yourself. WOULD WE STAY HERE AGAIN. Though I \u2019ve not written a review in a long time b c work and family keep me so busy I \u2019m sure I \u2019ve noted elsewhere we are like \u2018 traveling gypsies \u2019. We rarely stay in the same place in fact we stayed one night in Ponce to see that beautiful part of the island \u2014 if you \u2019ve never been to Cabo Rojo \u2014. it \u2019s gorgeous. Even so I would stay here again but I \u2019d prob want to try out the St Regis Bahia Beach close to this property and also to return to the Ritz in Dorado Beach. And I \u2019m sure I \u2019d like to stay again in San Juan to enjoy the bustling livelier South Beach like Miami Beach atmosphere. It would depend on what kind of vacation getaway we wanted how much we wanted to spend etc.", "offset": [12743, 12864], "date": "2020-01-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "77d0bf3a-1e84-47e9-87b5-91bc8cb50aa0", "sentence": "The best experience we have ever had at a resort.
