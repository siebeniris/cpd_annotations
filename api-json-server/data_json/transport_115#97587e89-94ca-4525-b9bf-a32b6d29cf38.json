The hotel created a very stressful trip for me and my family. I spent quite a bit of time selecting our location and the one small important need was 2 queen beds my husband and twin girls. Upon arrival I was told sorry only Kings were left and that reservations for queens are never guaranteed. She actually seemed happy about this fact. It was very annoying. I told her we could not all sleep in one King bed. Finally after consulting with a back room manager she found a room with 2 queens. It was dreadful it should only be used as a meeting room. The sliding window was covered by shutters that a lot of light came through and the side of the window was not shuttered. The view was the men outside parking and receiving cars so we had to keep our windows covered at all times. A giant industrial ice machine used to fill up coolers backed up to our headboards so horendously noisy and light at night. Without sleep and agitated at the shabby 40rom my husband and I argued the entire stay which made the kids difficult. Also something jagged on the furniture ripped open my finger which bled on a number of outfits. They did bring bandaids promptly but the hotel really cared less about the incident. Pool was beautiful and my girls loved swimming. Staff in restaurants were great front desk very very poor especially the pregnant gal.", "offset": [129, 256], "date": "2015-01-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "2e47c926-0ab2-436f-9540-8f63c98819e1", "sentence": "A room location warning.

Recently spent a weekend out at this resort with my wife. From the moment we drove up the driveway we knew we were in for a special treatThe check in procedure was very quick. The gentleman at the counter was very friendly and informative. He was able to answer several questions that I had regarding the resort and its amenities. Our room was spacious and clean and overlooked the beautiful golf course that surrounds the resort. My only complaint is that it was quite a distance from the elevator to the room itself. Since the resort is so huge one would think an elevator in the middle would be appropriate. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. The room also had plenty of outlets for all of our technological needs. There really were no items to complain about in regards to the room. The swimming pool has got to be the highlight of the resort. it is a nice size and has a little beach like section for the little kidos. My two year old would have had the time of his life at this pool. We will definitely need to re visit with him in tow sometime soon. The water fall feature of the pool was very nice as well. Finally there is a nice bar in the center of the pool. On our first night we asked the concierge to call a cab for a ride out to Fantasy Springs casino. He quickly got on the phone and our cab arrived no more than 5 minutes later. Someone else tried to hop on the cab but was quickly and professionally advised that this cab was not for them. The resort is located in a very nice area of Indian Wells and I will definitely be returning to this resort with the family.", "offset": [1515, 1639], "date": "2015-05-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "dbc83a4a-0b8e-4713-bb33-ac4d57636e2a", "sentence": "Indian Wells location is perfect.

The staff at the Renaissance are all very nice pleasant and helpful. They are friendly always smiling and eager to help with anything you need. It is in all honesty some of the nicest staff I have had the pleasure to experience in my travels all over the world. We were here on a golf vacation and you could not ask for a better location with two of its own courses and a quick drive to do many more. It is also very close to great shopping and amazing dining only a 10 Uber ride to most anything you need. The grounds are well kept and clean and the room sizes are fairly large. The hotel it is self has been remodeled lately it seems but parts of it still seem dated and a bit old and not in a quaint mid century way.

My wife and I attended a conference here and spent a few days in the area. I love this property. We come here every year and has not been disappointed. The service and the location are exceptional. Staff is very friendly without hovering. Note to travelers this is NOT a budget destination. it is pricey but with proper planning it is very worth it. Fortunately for us we have stayed at this resort often enough to know which rooms to ask for rooms that offer the best views closest to parking lot the pool etc. while no rooms have terrible views some rooms offer absolutely stunning scenery. I always request mountain view upper floors and the difference is night and day. So plan carefully do some research ask questions and you will have an awesome and relaxing experience. Best thing about this resort is the pool. Lots of options and locations to lounge that each offers its own pool experience. This is Palm Springs area so time of visit is critical. Summers can reach 17F so being by the pool can be harsh unles you are a gecko. we will definitely be back next year.", "offset": [843, 924], "date": "2017-06-11", "cpt": "1", "category": "transport"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "c182f8db-7b63-4808-bf55-106d99be35b0", "sentence": "Huge conference Hotel good rooms and service but. We stayed at the Renaissance this time around for the BNP Tournament and the location is hard to beat for Tennis fans. The fact that the hotel provided free shuttle to the Tennis Garden was A. Rooms are spacious and the beds are extremely comfy. Service was good overall really good at the pool distracted at the Cava restaurant. While the hotel is definitely a conference hotel and not a resort we definitely felt it was trying too hard to play that vibe. what is up with the loud Mall type music blasting from the speakers at 745 in the morning. Even from the 6th floor this was not a peaceful stay.

Very friendly staff everywhere on the grounds. Limited parking for larger events which was a big hassle. The hotel tried their very best to handle the extra traffic though with excellent security staff working overtime. Quiet place to stay in the rooms but the central open area can be quite noisy. Meeting room facilities were superb. The swimming pool area is a kids dream with a real sand beach area. The location is excellent since one is outside of Palm Springs but not too far away to sight see etc. Being right off of Hwy1 gives great access to many locations I10. The main airport is 30 minutes away by Hwy1 and less if I10 is used. While pricy I felt I got more than my moneys worth and I did not use the golf course or many of the really professional amenities furnished in the resort fee surcharge. The wi fi actually worked very well and the in room very large flat panel smart TV was a real extra I used alot. The bathrooms are spacious and all the towels were large and plush. The bath robes in the closet were very comfortable as well. The air conditioning worked great and was easy to set the temperature on. Drive very carefully in the parking garage area when it is over crowded. The good assortment of on site restaurants all were very good. The Sushi chefs were great.
