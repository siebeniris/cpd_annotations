Okay there is lots of confusion as to weather this hotel is a Ritz Carlton or a Four Seasons. For years this used to be a Ritz Carlton until the Ritz Carlton decided to sell this property. The current owner has a license agreement in place with the Ritz where they could still use the Ritz Carlton name however this is not a Ritz Carlton property. This is a Four Seasons property and this is why they call it The Ritz Carlton A Four Seasons hotel. This hotel does not participate in Mariot or RC rewards point programs and Mariot or RC reservation center can not book you a room here. We knew all this before we booked here but since the pool area at The Four Seasons Chicago on Delaware St was closed for refurbishment this was a logical and close choice. Never the less this is a fine hotel in a fantastic location with great service. I just do n\u2019t want anyone to be mislead by the name. I was traveling with my wife and two kids ages 7 and 11. The location is great attached to the Water Place shops you can walk to the mall and restaurants without ever putting your coat on or ever going outside. The Lego store and American Girl are a 3 minute walk and its all inside. Check in was good with no issues and like many Chicago hotels the lobby is on the 12th floor. At check in the concierge gave our little puppy some treats and small toys for kids. There were also some soda drinks and popcorn for the kids once we got into our room. Our room was clean and tidy with no issues. Towels linens and beds were decent quality. The room is dated but still very nice. We had a junior suite on the 26th floor with a queen bed and sleeper sofa and a roll away bed. Our room was large and comfortable. The hotel offers complimentary coffee in the lobby each morning and that is nice. Note there is no coffee shop in the hotel and no place to gets sodas. The hotel has a restaurant called Deca. They do not have a buffet breakfast which always works well with kids. For breakfast I would suggest going to the Water Tower shops on the 2nd floor and eating breakfast at Fodlife. A family of four can eat there for about 200. We ordered room service the first night as we were tired from the long drive. The kids had a cheeseburger and grilled cheese and my wife had the Asian beef soup and the crab cake and I had the cheese soup and chicken pot pie. The kids food was good but the crab cake and soups were just average and very spicy. The chicken pot pie was not the traditional type and more like a julienne rather than chicken pot pie. Certainly this restaurant is not as good as the Allium Restaurant at The Four Seasons on Delaware Street. We tried this place two other times and you can read my full review of Deca in my other review. We thought we would eat lunch the next day at Deca. The kids has Mac and cheese and I had the cream of mushroom soup and the Chicano style hot dog. My soup was warm at best and I sent it back but the rest of the food was good. The food and beverage did seem to have issues on this trip. I would not go out of my way to eat in the hotel again when other choices are so close by. We did use the pool area and hot rub and the hot tub is heavily chlorinated it will make your eyes burn. The hot tub could use a make over and looks pretty old but still nice after a long day on the strip. The spa and pool area once again is certainly not as good as The Four Seasons Chicago on Delaware St but is still nice. The locker rooms were clean and tidy and they also have a steam room which was nice. They also have a full service spa and salon. All in all we had a good three night stay and I would return without question. The hotel is not as good as the Four Seasons on Delaware Place but still very nice and we were please with our stay. The staff at the front desk concierge maids spa restaurant and through out the hotel were very nice and I never had to ask for anything twice. In fact on the second night I requested a roll away bed for my daughter and it came with in 10 minutes. On the 3rd night I requested another blanket and it came with in 5 minutes so the service was good and consistent throughout our stay. I would recommend this hotel and definitely stay here again.", "offset": [3379, 3498], "date": "2015-01-19", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "09708d95-8ed6-496e-bfa4-46a2eff9ca9d", "sentence": "Above and beyond.

We chose the Ritz Carlton partially because their website promoted that they had an indoor pool. Imagine my kids disappointment that the pool was under renovations. I popped for the two bedroom suite. It was not cheap. I planned on swimming being one of our main activities and budgeted the weekend accordingly. They suggested I could walk down the block and use the pool at the four seasons. Had I been aware of this problem I would have simply stayed at the four seasons. The idea that we would put on winter clothing and walk a block just to go swimming was hardly ideal. When I brought this problem to the attention to the front desk staff they suggested that it was my fault and that I should have looked closer at their website which supposedly indicated that the pool was not available. Sorry for not closely examining the site for unwanted surprises. I relied on their reputation for quality service. I will not make that mistake again. I suppose I could have made a scene and argued more vociferously with the staff for some type of future consideration or break on my bill. that is just not my style nor something I felt like doing in front of my children. We were very disappointed by the lack of expected amenities and their refusal to graciously accommodate me with some type of consideration.", "offset": [572, 672], "date": "2017-03-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "d6325a58-6318-4942-b47e-fd2f14b09245", "sentence": "Great location quiet. Great location in the middle of the action on Magnificent Mile. Yet the hotel is quiet with no street noise noticeable in the room. Staff was very well trained and very helpful. This is not really a tourist hotel. There is no lobby to speak of very small bar area and one restaurant. Perhaps that is because there are many good restaurants and bars in close proximity. The pool is indoor and quite unremarkable though the fitness center is well appointed and attended. The room appointments were first class.

If you have not been to this Ritz recently you would not recognize the place. The hotel has been completely transformed with a whole new contemporary look and feel that is elegant and sophisticated. there is a new vibe and energy that is subtle but still palatable. We booked our stay for our anniversary and were welcomed in our room by champagne fresh strawberries and a personal note. We stayed in a small suite with a city view which was pretty nice. Rooms at the other end of the building have killer views of the lake but we were still able to see the lake fairly well because of the three huge windows that also make the room light and airy. The bathroom was all new with the same clean lines and rich materials as in the lobby spaces. The walk in shower was roomy with both a rain shower head and hand held shower though the water pressure was a bit low. The bed and bedding was lush as would expect at such a hotel and we slept very comfortably. We prefer to explore the neighbor so we did not dine in or try some of the amenities like the spa or pool but we did at least have a look. the spa is all new as is the fitness center which also has great views of the city but was very crowded that Saturday morning. There is a caf\u00e9 where you can enjoy some light fare under a glass roof that makes you feel like you are outside. Or if you really want to be outside there is a rooftop deck next to the caf\u00e9 complete with a bar lounge seating and fire pit. And because we did not make use of many of the amenities there was not much opportunity to interact with staff. But the service that we did experience was attentive without being overbearing and friendliness felt genuine. And you can not beat the location shops restaurants parks museums historic places the lakefront are all literally just a short walk away.", "offset": [971, 1109], "date": "2017-09-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 10, "uid": "831c033c-95d0-4a41-813c-90513ed73423", "sentence": "Dinner and a Show.

Now THIS Is a Ritz Carlton Experience. After a less than stellar 3night New Year stay at the Ritz Carlton Chicago we were invited back for an additional night to re experience the hotel. We chose this past weekend as we were celebrating a birthday and the kids were looking forward to some pool time. When we checked it the front desk was so inviting and friendly. They saw the kids and offered the Ritz Kids wagon for my son to choose a toy. We were also offered welcome glasses of proseco not sure if that was due to the birthday celebration or if that is offered to everyone it was not offered to us during our prior stay and it was much appreciated. Took the elevator to the room and it was a bit slow but at least 3 of the 4 appeared operational and not too much waiting required. We booked two beds and were upgraded to the lakeview room. When we got to the room there was a small individual birthday cake and balloons with chocolate. That was such a nice touch. the kids loved the balloons. I am not sure if that is in lieu of the milk and cookies that come with the ritz kids program because we never received that. but since we had a lounge package we were able to get cookies there. One odd thing about the room is that it is a rather large room with 2 small double beds not queen beds. We asked for an extra rolaway and was told that they could not offer that in the 2 bed rooms due to fire code. I am pretty confused about that because there is plenty of space so it was a really tight squeeze for us in the small beds and was not very conducive to a good nights rest. That was a big miss for me. Otherwise the rest of the stay was good. They had okay food options at the lounge that evening with Conies deep dish pizza italian beef sandwiches salad and scallop ceviche. I was not a huge fan of the offerings except the ceviche so I ordered room service from Toralis. Black truffle butter for the win. I slathered that on everything. Dessert options at the lounge were chocolate fondue with strawberries pineapple and marshmallows plus some individually plated cheesecake canoli and lemon tarte. Again not a fan of the fondue. it is overly sweet and never hardens so I think it is a kind of hersheys syrup. But the individually plated options were really delicious. I regret not going back for seconds. Breakfast in the lounge was good with a variety of hot and cold options fully stocked this time. Woo. Then lunch was pastrami sandwiches and ham cheese sandwiches. We had to pick the peppercorns off the pastrami sandwiches and asked the lounge staff to request mustard free ham cheese for the kids. It took awhile to get the sandwiches for the kids so I feel like these peppercorns and mustard could have been served on the side from the start as they are rather polarizing condiments. We went to the pool in the morning before checkout and only one other family was in there. The pool is divided into lap lanes and the water seemed a bit cool so I asked the attendant to check on the temperature. It warmed up a couple degrees later on so that was good. No hot tub in the pool area though. Overall it was an enjoyable stay much more so than our previous one. This stay was much more in line with the service that I expect from a Ritz Carlton. And of course the location can not be beat. Staying completely indoors to get to the mall is great. Especially when it was only 40 degrees at night in the middle of April in Chicago. Valet was 71 though so would suggest another option if it is available and you do not mind the walk.", "offset": [210, 323], "date": "2018-04-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "97b51f0b-c2ab-4d7d-8202-dcf7e1532050", "sentence": "The New Improved Ritz Carlton Chicago.

A couple cons. they have added a sports bar. Really a Ritz Carlton with a sports bar. Maybe because it is now part of the Mariot. Also the service in bar area not the bar itself is so bad. We had half our meal comped one night because the service was so bad. It appears that it is not the fault of the servers. Either it is the kitchen or the fact that there are not enough servers.
