So we booked a room through Expedia with two double beds and paid a ridiculous amount of money to stay in a resort that was the eqivalent of a Hilton do not let the Waldorf Astoria name fool you. While in route to Key West they left a voicemail at 630 pm that they were 100 sold out and that they upgraded our room. At check in this meant one of us had to sleep on a sofa bed that they tried to sell as a Queen bed. I explained to them that is not what we booked and how can they just assume we would be OK with this change. I am sorry but a sofa bed is essentially a couch. If I wanted to sleep on a couch we had 8 other friends staying at other resorts and I could have stayed there for free. They said well that is all we have so you need to take it. We stayed there for 4 days and it was not a great experience. We ate breakfast at Spencers twice and the service was really slow. We had to ask for our check 3 times one morning and it was not busy. At check in they knew I was upset so they offered to take the resort fees off of my final bill which was around 30 per day. Well you guessed it at checkout time the resort fees were on the bill so we had to explain to a new person the whole story about the upgrade that put one of us one a sofa bed.

She greeted us with a smile and she remembered us from a phone call we had made a month ago about my birthday. That is amazing. She handed me mini cupcakes and a letter they wrote wishing me a happy birthday. She is so pleasant to deal with. EJ he is AMAZING too. Anything we wanted or had questions about he answered.

When we went out to the beach we were greeted by Doug. He is nice. He did n\u2019t want us lifting a finger while on vacation. He set up the beach chairs for us and filled us in with information. Kip who also worked at the beach was very nice as well. My fianc\u00e9 lost his phone and we thought that maybe it got rolled up with the towels after we left and Kip was so nice he went looking through all the towels to help us find it. Luckily we found the phone and it was in one of the chairs in the lobby. But the whole staff was helping us look. Our housekeeper did an amazing job cleaning our room. We were in room 414 and stayed the week of July 28August 3 and she did a wonderful job. They text you once you leave your room and notice the privacy sign is gone. You \u2019l receive a text asking if you want them to clean your room which is convenient. The concierge would text us too asking how our stay was going. Now to the hotel itself. I liked it. It had the chill key west look to it. The beach was great. No coral or rocks so you did not have to watch where you step like all the other places in key west. They pool was nice too. They have staff who set up the beach chairs for you and hand you towels. There is also a cool button on the umbrellas that you can press and a waitress comes over to take your orders. Literally you do n\u2019t have to lift a finger stating here. The room. We stayed in a court yard view junior suite. Well our view was still unbeatable. We had court yard view AND the beach. So we got both views. The room is nice and spacious. The bed was comfortable. My only complaint is the couch. Literally only the couch. It was stained and dirty and you can see foot prints on the couch. That was the only piece of furtinuter that was gross and should be changed ASAP. Other than that everything else was great. Yes you will find dings here and there on their wooden furtinure but it \u2019s wood it \u2019s going to happen especially with people on vacation and being careless with hotel furtniture. Like I said the couch was the only dirty looking thing that should be thrown out or burnt. I truly felt welcomed and appreciated.

There was a big empty spot in our room we later found out that they took the furniture for a deep cleaning before our visit and never brought it backAt any rate we asked for a table and chairs and they brought one rolling desk chair which was almost laughable especially since there is no desk in the room. No full length mirror. No extra table or stand to put your clothing in the bathroom. Very basic things that normally are included in a hotel room were missing. Floor was soaking wet when we checked in. I have no idea why. It dried after a day. I reported this but there was really not much they could do. I am not even sure why the carpet was damp. It was only in a couple spots. Spilled drink from previous guestsWe also asked for several amenities shampoo wash cloths which were forgotten after the housekeeping staff had cleaned the second day. They said they would deliver. never did. On my previous visit here we had the Suite and I thought I was booking the same thing. This room was called the STUDIO Suite. Since the room descriptions are so similar I also had a different room type than I expected. The last one had a separate bedroom area. But honestly that did not bother me that much it was the other missing furniture items that did. I think the biggest deal breaker here was the indifference and the lack to find a resolution for some of these basic furniture and amenity requests. I did enjoy the roosters at the pool. And I appreciate the proximity to Duval Street. There are so many other wonderful boutique hotels to choose from in Key West. I am not sure I had choose the Reach again. The property is beautiful.

But I \u2019m afraid that \u2019s it. The beach is however covered with seaweed and stinks. Bad points. Well it \u2019s not a Waldorf Astoria. It \u2019s a 3 star at best but prices itself as a 5 star. No bell hops on arrival so carry your own baggage. And no the elevator still is n\u2019t working. Yes the hotel bar still closes at 10 pm so if you have the temerity to come back after dinner for a nightcap forget that. Room service. No chance. No there \u2019s no turn down service so do n\u2019t expect clean towels. Do n\u2019t ask for late checkout as they \u2019l ask for another full day rate. Do n\u2019t expect a sea view when you pay for a sea view. You may get our room facing the garage of the hotel next door with their staff members smoking next to it all day. Do n\u2019t expect a 5star luxurious marble bathroom. But if you ever stayed in a Ramada Inn in the 1980 \u2019s you \u2019l be reminded how small and dank they really were. It is supposed to be getting upgraded at some stage and being renamed a \u201c Curio Collection by Hilton \u201d. Maybe keep an eye on the reviews to see when this happens and maybe they reduce the exorbitant rates. You never know one day they may also fix the elevator.", "offset": [1065, 1113], "date": "2019-05-20", "cpt": "2", "category": "room"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "797742dd-c3da-49d7-a368-0acb6f056d8d", "sentence": "It \u2019s okay.

For some reason there is a resort fee that does not include parking or access to the kayaks or paddle boards. The hole place felt as though it needed a face lift.

After the room change the disappointment increased. The shower curtain was very dirty. The shower drain was clogged. We were told that it is a natural beachit is good to know it is a natural beach but just imagine u can not enjoy the beach due to all that sea weed blocking the access. It is like I paid 350 per night to smell the sea weed. Now about the food it was ok. The Mojito drink the mint was nt even fresh. Its overly priced for the taste and quality. Before checking out we complained about the shower drain and all they said was oh sorry. In simple words unles they make changes to provide better access to beach and maintain the rooms well I do nt think I will ever come and stay here.

Had to call maintenance in first 5 minutes. Bathroom sink would not drain. How had the housekeeper cleaned the bathroom. Ceiling fan in bathroom covered in dirt and cobwebs which had to be cleaned out with paint brush. Cracked and dirty tiles on the floor. Hotel was in a nice location on the beach in the South End. Seaweed would accumulate on beach in mounds and was not cleaned up unles there was a wedding. Happy hour was at a tiny little bar and mixed drinks were not included.

We had high expectations for this resort as it is part of Curio Collection. The first night we were placed in a room in the middle of the construction zone.

Upon complaining we were offered a room at the Waldof next door which was a very nice gesture however it was a room with one bed and there was 3 of us in the party.

My wife and I were very excited to go to Key West for a romantic getaway this past weekend. We chose The Reach Key West Hilton Curio because it looked wonderful and we are diamond Hilton members. We have over 200 nights in a Hilton Hotel for work and pleasure in 2019 alone. This resort by far had the worst customer service and room amenities we have had. The room we were assigned was at the very back of the resort which I thought would be fine as it should be quiet and private. However upon entering our room the construction noise and VERY large garbage dumpster right off our lanai was disgusting. The lanai is unusable because of the smell and view. We went immediately to the front desk and asked if there was another room and were told the hotel was sold out for the weekend. Fair enough. However when we went the following day to see if we could be moved we were told that they did have other rooms available however it would cost an additional fee to move rooms. This hotel runs over 500 night and the complete lack of empathy or response from the front desk is shocking for a chain like Hilton.

The Reach is located right next to the Southern Most Point. A few steps from the hotel starts Duval street which is only a mile long. Great location. The Reach has the only natural sand beach with ocean access along with a pool. This is a big draw since most of the resorts only have pools or beach chairs on decks docks with no sand or beach access. But the Reach is not cheap and for the price you will need to decide early on what is most important to you on your vacation before you commit to paying the price. We could have easily taken two other vacations to more luxurious resorts with better service for what we paid for just 5 days at the Reach even with a wedding rate discount. The rooms are average even after the upgrades and I have a better bed with more luxurious bedding at home. The bathrobes are nice but do not expect slippers with it. And be prepared to go to the local CVS to buy bottled water and anything else you need. Everything in the resort store is highly overpriced. The staff is very courteous but the service itself is average. The Reach markets amenities that you would expect to be included for the price you pay but the amenities either do not exist or are not high quality. The service on the beach and the pool need improvement. Again the staff is accommodating but more staff is needed. The bar does not open until 130AMeven though everywhere else on Duval street serves alcoholic drinks at 7AM. Beach and pool drink service is very slow. There are service buttons on the umbrella poles but I do not believe they work. We tried multiple times to use the buttons on different days but even after waiting 15 minutes or more the waiter did not show so we went to the bar ourselves. The staff walked around with Popsicles once a day at the beach and pool but never once was I offered a chilled eucalyptus towel which is marketed on the Daily Resort Fee Inclusions. The daily resort fee is 45Repairs and upgrades are still in process so keep that in mind. They are doing their best to update everything so expect to see and hear repairs being done during your stay. Food at the restaurant is very good. Definitely have at least one breakfast there. The coastal sunrise and the avocado toast leave little to be desired. They are fulfilling and deliciousFinaly we stayed at the Reach for a wedding. The reception was outside on top of the restaurant. The music played until 1PM. Make sure to ask if anyone is getting married during your stay. If so you will most likely hear the music until the reception is over and it may keep you from sleeping.
