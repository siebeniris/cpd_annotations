Before booking this hotel I read the reviews on here. Much is made of the place being in need of painting. Whilst I agree that some of the outside does need painting this really is not such a big deal. My room was clean and well decorated as were all of the public areas that I saw. The central lobby has almost the sense of a massive white washed cave with highly polished teracota tiled floor and the bedrooms are in interconnected blocks around the central pool area. Although the hotel is within the maze of narrow streets that form the older parts of Lagos it still covers a large area and it has a large free car park. The buffet breakfast is average but has lots of choice. The hotel is excellent value and well located if you need central Lagos. I did not eat in the hotel in the evening as the menu was not to my choice and there are a couple of places with more atmosphere just across the road. I hope to stay there again if the price remains the same.

It is very close to the shore and old The front desk check. in was not timely The desk was always busy with considerable wait. We were advised at check. in we had been upgraded to a better acomodation which I would describe as a premium king or junior suite. It was a large room modern updates and a sofa sitting area. The King mattress was premium as was the beddings and linens which provided for a very comfortable rest. At each side of the head board were remote switches for various room lights and usb ports for charging devices. This was well appreciated. The bath was a large glassed shower with rain spray shower head which was nice. The room was spotless and a 3 person housekeeping team thoroughly cleaned each day in the most efficient manner. Regarding meals we utilized room service the Italian restaurant morning breakfast buffet included in our price and the Duna Beach club patio restaurant. The food was tasty and presented well. The prices were moderate and less than what I would expect at a beach area resort. The food choices for room service were good and had pizza and toasted sandwhiches. Finally the breakfast buffet had many choices and was all well presented. The property did seem rather busy for shoulder season and perhaps that explained the slow service at the desk. I tried calling several times one evening to borrow an iron. Repeatedly over an hour the calls went unanswered. I walked to the desk waited approximately ten minutes to ask for an iron and was told by the representative she would call me right back in my room. Back to the room and fifteen minutes later no call. Back to the desk. and I was told the iron was loaned out until the next day but one would be brought to our room. This never happened. Also at the Italian restaurant service was slow despite having two waiters but no more than six tables occupied. The pool at the main property was sparkling and well used during the day.
