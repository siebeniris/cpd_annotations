The rooms in this hotel need a renovation refurb urgently. Almost everything looks like from 20 30 years ago.

I do not watch TV when on vacation but simply the appearance of a yellowish grey 20year old CRT screen in the room does not make you feel comfortable. The marble bathrooms look nice on the first look but are old as well and let you feel particularly the hair driers with their fusty smell. The most disgusting moment was when we saw a giant COCKROACH in our bath. We immediately asked for a new room and got one but the staff did not look to be very surprised nor embarrassed about it. From a service POV it was also not the best. We arrived as a couple and got a room with twin beds instead of one. No problem I immediately asked for another one but the staff could not give us one as the hotel was fully booked. at least that is what we were told. The rest of the hotel is quite nice.

After reading many reviews we decided to stay here for a week for my 21st birthday. It took around an hour and a half to get to from Faro airport. The entrance to the hotel was welcoming we were given a map of the area and our luggage was taken to our room as we were being shown the bar restaurant and pool. The hotel is very large six connecting buildings. One indoor and one outdoor pool with a small gym. Our room was very nice. A little outdated and needs modernising but other than that it was great. We had a balcony air conditioning a safe private bathroom and a small fridge. The TV was very small and old we never used it. Breakfast was good lots of choice of food and drinks. We never had lunch or dinner there so I can not write a comment. One of the days we went to the beach club we decided to walk across the beach which was a mistake as it was 30 degrees. There is a free shuttle service to go to and from the hotel it takes around 10 minutes. The club is lovely however if we wanted a sun lounger we had to pay 10 euros a person. We said we were with tivoli and we were told we had to pay for one. The loungers on the beach were free for the guests and so was the pool. This club is also open to the public so it is not private at all. It also has a bar and restaurant.

We enjoyed a relaxing holiday in Tivoli Lagos in a newly refurbished room that enjoyed a stunning view over the town and the sea. The rooms on the whole were very modern with new fixtures and fittings. They did lack a little in terms of character when it came to smaller details. The rooms lacked artwork on the wall a mirror in the bedroom and the Coffee machine pictured in the photographs on the website. The bathroom door had n\u2019t been replaced and required you to bang it to shut it properly which seemed odd as everything else was brand new. The hotel did make an effort to accommodate tea making facilities for us however. The bathroom was really good with an excellent shower and contemporary fixtures and fittings. I must add that the room was meticulously clean and the 7 day a week service from housekeeping kept it that way. The balcony had n\u2019t been refreshed apart from the new chairs and tables and was in need of a little TLCThe staff at the hotel are excellent and make every effort to deal with any issues. The free Wi Fi was very speedy and the complementary UK newspaper of our choice each morning was a nice touch. Two excellent brand new Samsung TV \u2019s were in place along with USB ports and 3 pin plugs by the bed. One of the air conditioning units was also state of the art and easily programable. It \u2019s important to note that the classic rooms have not been refurbished. The refurbished rooms are the Premium Deluxe and Suites. From previous experience the yet to be refurbished rooms now redesignated as classic rooms are not in anyway a bad option but are far more traditional in decor as reflected by the images on the website. The breakfast was of a good standard even providing the option for a glass or two of Sparkling wine. The hotel still had areas that were undergoing refurbishment 2 weeks after reopening and therefore is still very much a work in progress in places. This did not impact significantly as we were staying in a refurbished block although the pool was open it was still a few days away from being fully completed. I \u2019d imagine that it is now fully complete. The Patio Velho restaurant provided an intimate dining room excellent service and delicious food which we felt was excellent value for money. We did n\u2019t use the complimentary bus to the beach club but many others did. The beach club has a pool and a restaurant that was only open for lunch during our stay but apparently in the summer serves meals into the evening. The beach club is a huge asset especially in the warm summer months. To summarise we loved our holiday the location is perfect the staff excellent and the hotel is characterful and quirky and the new look rooms and pool area have brought a lot to this lovely hotel.

The next morning I complained about the state of the room and they said they would move me during the day while I was out playing golf. One of my party I had organised the stay also asked to be moved as he did nt like the ground floor room he had been allocated. He was moved to an upgraded room in a refurbished area. I was left in a Standard room despite the state of the room originally allocated. So the Tivoli failed spectacularly to seize the opportunity to deal with a stupid mistake effectively.
