Third time they said they did have a regular room and would bring up the new key. I waited 20 m. No show. Called again. They told me they were busy and I should go to concierge to get the new keys. Went down. Concierge did not know what I was talking about. Eventually got new keys. Rooms are small and tendy. The blackout shade does not work so you can not get a dark room that blocks morning sun. Next day was the pool. Went to foxtail pool not realizing there was another small pool on the roof. At Foxtail they frisk you better than the TSA. They would not let us bring an empty bottle for water in. There are about 20 free chairs. The rest have minimum purchase of 350 to 1000 spend requirements. When I made a comment about it the staff told me I could leave if I did not like it. No one mentioned the other pool till I was going out the door. The other pool called beach life is small but at least free and more friendly.

I covered all the bases away from elevator upper floor not overlooking Foxtail Pool Club etc. She told us that she put us in a quiet room on the 7th floor. We were mislead to say the least. It felt like the Foxtail Pool Club was in our room. The outdoor club music is played loudly 24 hours a day and never stops. I could not sleep and wink day or night.

I like you have read many reviews on this hotel and did not have very high expectations of it based on the wide swing of reviews. If there are just a handful of bad reviews on a property I write them off but with this hotel there were so many very favorable or very unfavorable so I did not have high expectations. I am also a travel agent and personal concierge but booked this stay as a regular guest to make sure I got the regular guest experience. I also made sure to pay close attention to the things most people complain about with this hotel. We received an offer to stay for 3 nights with 60 food beverage comp since I was a former Sahara Players club member. There were no black out dates so we stayed over a weekend during August. Resort fees were included in the deal too. Booking the hotel using the promo was very easy over the phone. The agent on the phone was very polite and friendly. We arrived at the hotel early on a Thursday around 1 or 130 and the valet was very polite and helped us immediately. He got a bellhop to take our bags right away. We had a very short wait at the check in desk perhaps a couple of minutes. I am a gold Hilton Hhonors member but did not see a special Hilton check in line. But it was fine since there were three agents working the desk. Cesar helped us getting checked in and he was very polite efficient and knowledgeable. And no upgrade was offered for gold members no big deal. We were able to get into our room right away with no early check in charge check in was at 3 pm. Cesar explained that our 60 food beverage comp would be added to our CODE players card. We headed to the CODE players club desk and got our cards. They loaded the 60 onto my card to use later. My husband was celebrating a birthday and they gave him a free 30 on his card to use toward food beverage. The young man at the CODE desk was very helpful and friendly and knowledgeable. Next we went to our room in the World Tower. I like the location of the World Tower since it is easy to get to and near the monorail entrance and the hotel valet area. We were on the 7th floor. We got into the room and found it to be very clean and the AC already running and cooled down. We called for our bags and they arrived within 5 minutes. The room is not oversized but I felt the size was right for two people with how the furniture is arranged. It is not good if you have to conduct business in this room the desk is a little wonky but cool if you do not have to use it for more than setting things on. We liked having a sofa at the end of the bed. The window above the bed was of adequate size and you could open both the blinds and the photographic shade all the way to let in as much or as little sun as you want. The window also opened about an inch or two. if you wanted fresh air. The bathroom felt quite large and we did have lovely etched colored glass drinking glasses on the first day but the maid never replenished them during our entire stay. I thought that was odd but others have said the same thing. We just made sure to bring back our plastic cups from being out and about to use in the room. I really liked the oversize shower not a tub girl and the shelf in the shower that holds your cocktail. The toiletries in larger sizes were wonderful and the maid did bring brand new ones every day even if we did not use the ones from the previous day. The bathroom was very clean we did a thorough check. There is a blow dryer as well as a light up beauty mirror in the bathroom. And yes there really is very little space to put your clothes. There are a couple of shelves at the mini bar area and then the small closet area behind the entry door. There were about 8 hangers included. I just used packing cubes and lived out of my suitcase. My husband did the same. The safe is in a drawer under the minibar and is of a very nice large size. I prefer having the safe in a drawer I found it easier to use. We did not have any treats from the minibar and this is the only place I found dust in the room on top of the minibar snacks. But also on the minibar area is an ice bucket cork screw etc. to use. I found everything user friendly and modern and cozy. I have no complaints about the World Tower room at all. I like the modern ness of the room and the infinity mirrors that light up. The bed was very comfy and we never heard a peep from others except our last night. The next thing we did was have lunch at Umami Burger. It was very tasty. I do not particularly care for sports bars so I may or may not visit again it would have to be during a non game time for me to eat there. But the food was very good and my husband said the Ahi tuna sandwich he had was the best he is ever had. I had the Manly burger and it was tasty. We also had the maple bacon sweet potato fries yum. Cocktails are very good here as well. Service at this lunch was great. However another day we did get just a cocktail from the casino side of the bar and the server was quite rude. Anyway then we went to the pool around 3ish. Since it was a Thursday anyone could go to the Foxtail pool. We were never able to get the server to help us and eventually went to the bar for our drinks which is fine just frustrating that she saw us and we flagged her a couple times and she blatantly ignored us. Drinks were good yes they were expensive but it is Vegas. I do not go to penny pinch I go to treat myself. The next day Friday I had arranged to reserve a day bed at the Foxtail pool for the two of us. When we went to check in they did not have me on the list. I was frustrated since I had emailed with a representative of the Foxtail Pool club several times prior to our arrival but Drew at the pool made sure to give us a day bed for the day. You are searched upon entry and can not bring any food or beverage even water in. I had my afternoon vitamins with me and they had to throw those away. We had a 300 minimum food and beverage for the day bed but we easily exceeded that after five hours. Service at the pool was hit or miss. We had three different servers over the course of the day and as the pool got busier service got slower. Drinks were strong but small waters cost 8. it is not the cost that bothered me but that I had to order them frequently. I would have liked a huge bottle to start. Needless to say we had a great time at the pool and people watching. I say the day bed was well worth it. I would be miserable trying to find a piece of concrete to put my towel on as most people were doing. We tried the 80 Degree pizza place during our stay and I found it to be just ok. The service was mediocre and the pizza and salad was ok. We did like that they had brocolini on the menu. I might try it again on my next stay. We also had a drink from the Monkey lobby bar but bartenders do not come on until the afternoon. We also did play slots during our stay and I found the slots to be looser than MGM where we played earlier. I actually came out about 100 ahead and my husband played on the same 40 for a long time. They have many different slots. it is not a huge casino so you can find anything easily. And it is easy and quick to get back to your room. We did find that drink service while playing the slots could be a little slow depending on the area you sit and the server. But the servers would get to know you and remember what you like to drink. I did not find the casino smoky. There were some girls staying in the adjoining room to ours on our last night who we could hear perfectly while they were getting ready for their night out. That night we did not get back to our room until about 330am and promptly went to sleep. The girls came back around 430am and starting having a very loud party with music screaming laughing etc. which woke us up. You know the post party wind down and re cap. Anyway we gave it a couple minutes for them to settle down before calling the front desk. Then within a couple minutes we hear their phone ring. They immediately quiet down but then within minutes the party starts back up again. Then their phone rings again they quiet down again for a short period. Then there is noise but muffled. Then we hear there is a knock at their door and what sounds like a security guard talking to them. Then we hear nothing for the rest of the night er morning. Not sure what happened over there or if someone called or what but security was ON these girls and making sure there was no disturbance for guests. Security is also at each elevator and you have to show your room key to get by them. Upon check out on our last day I was able to check out using the TV and all my charges were correct. The valet was courteous and prompt in bringing our car by. I was very sad to leave. All in all we had a fabulous stay. I like the vibe of the hotel the d\u00e9cor the size the room proximity to the monorail just about everything I liked about this hotel. And no I am not a 20something I am 47 and I loved this place. We will definitely be back for a stay at this hotel.", "offset": [6025, 6061], "date": "2015-08-28", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 5, "uid": "bb4d6995-cf80-44f2-bf88-68fcfc3a12f0", "sentence": "Party place. Party pool. Loud. Small family pool. Sorta snobby. Close to outlets. OK. you do not like the snobby comment. in fact most of the LV strip hotels fall into that category. there is a minimum spend to have a seat at the main pool. Sorry that sucks. You have to stand in line to go the the main pool frustrating. To be fair there is a small family pool on the 3rd floor where there is no cover or minimum. Ok pool aside the standard room was very good. Spacious quiet and efficient 910 for the standard room. Nothing extravagant but certainly comfortable. A big plus to the elevator system hardly any waiting. Food was expensive and less than so so in the cafe. Kind of normal for hotels. After that I did not go into the more expensive restaurants. Party there was something going on in the main pool area most of the nights I was there. There were shows performers DJs etc. The place was happening on those nights if you wanted to wait to get in and pay. It was just crazy watching all the different people walking out in varying states of consciousness. Location be warned you are much north of the other major casinos. In fact SLS is right across from Stratosphere which many would consider very north strip. You will need a car if going many places. SLS is hooked into the monorail system good. Bottom line if you want to be in the middle of everything and walk to the other casinos you need to stay further south of SLS. This one is sorta by itself.

I have just spent the weekend at the SLS Las vegas and thought I had share a few observations about this hotel. Overall it is a clean modern hotel. However if you are intending to use this as a room to sleep than it may be an option for you If however like me you plan on using the hotel for a relaxing resort stay than stay somewhere elsea few reasons for this are listed below. I stayed in the story tower and the rooms are SMALL just about big enough for one person. The room has zero space for storage and you will be bashing into each other. Getting ready is an unpleasant experience. Pros. the maids are really nice and do a great job. Food Not much to choose from and it has restaurant that are only open on certain days. quite strange with this said options are limited. Crazy that in vegas you have one coffee shop that closes at around 9ish. Pool Where do I start. This is a big deal for me. I want somewhere that I can site and relax for a few hours when in Vegas. They have two pools at this property one is the Lux pool which was closed over the weekend for an event. I did manage to use the facility on the friday and was unable to get a sun lounger. the pool area is so incredibly small. I would say there were about 40 loungers in total. the rest were cabanas. The other option is foxtail. I was permitted entry but again no lounge chairs to sit and relax. The only option was a lounger with food and bev at 50. I mean come on seriously. If pool room food are not of great importance then this place may be for you otherwise choose somewhere else. SLS has forgotten what makes vegas the best holiday destination and its not just partying. pools should be available for use to relax at and not just thumping with music all day long. Better still why not make a bigger pool for those who want to get away from the music instead of something so small which appears to be used for special events and rarely available to the public.", "offset": [1794, 1989], "date": "2015-09-21", "cpt": "0", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "e8ec6f8f-69fe-46c3-a0d0-28ef6ff76565", "sentence": "Newness masks mediocrity inconsistency.

Given that though this is not much compared with other similar hotels on the Strip. One of the pools was closed for a private event when we went in the middle of the afternoon leaving the remainder of the hotels guests cramped into the beach lounge pool near the lobby. The room was laid out bizarely with the sink in the hallway doors which barely functioned and no real desk area or outlets in the appropriate places. The gym had multiple attendants standing outside guarding entry when a room key lock would be just as useful but inside there were no towels laid out for guests to use until I asked.

I stayed at the SLS Las Vegas in July on business and I was pleased about some things but not pleased about others. First the hotel is pretty cool with a great pool and funky casino bar. But the cool room vibe is used to offset a much smaller room and some very basic amenities. The hotel is also at the wrong end of the strip so do not go there expecting the same atmosphere down by the Aria and Cosmopolitan. Next because the casino floor is a bit dead there and the hotel is at the wrong end of the strip which is under a gentrification however the crowd can be a bit rough. When I was there a patron from the club was being taken down by 6 security guards and they were quite violent with him. I am sure he violated some important casino rule but beating a man on the floor made me gamble elsewhere. The pool however and the restaurants are amazing and I although I will not stay there again I would visit that hotel on a Sunday for there pool party which is where I imagine hotel properties do very well.

The hotel is at one end of the strip close to the Las Vegas Convention Centre. it is away from the strip which after visiting Vegas for more years than I care to remember is somewhat nice as one thing that drives me crazy about Las Vegas and the bigger hotels on the strip is that after your flight it can take 30 60mins to check in and get your room keys then 15 20mins to walk yo your room like my experience at The Belagio. The SLS check in is close to the towers where the rooms are located make sure you tell the taxi driver that you want to go to the check in entrance otherwise you will have a long walk through the casino as there are two entrances to the hotel. The rooms are smaller than most Vegas hotels but well done inside and the Lux Tower rooms are the larger size. The bar area opposite the check in is not so big but its nice apart from the mono rail entrance doors are right in the middle of the bar this idea was not one of the best to place two large double doors in the middle of a bar especially at certain times of the evening and when the temperature outside can be triple figures letting all the hot air in. There are several restaurants in the hotel all of which are good overall. This hotel has a cool pool scene at the weekends and it draws a crowd if your looking for a peaceful chill out pool area this like many Vegas hotels is not the place as its a younger party crowd. There is a great concierge area and coffee shop in the lobby area and a shop selling trendy clothes and gifts. The room numbers are a little confusing as they add a number to each room which represents the tower or part of the hotel your room will be so make sure you ask the check in staff to explain.

Never been to Vegas before and had planned a slight diversion on an 18 day road trip to squeeze in a night. I was up for some Vegas fun and the hotel offers a free minibar in their Story Tower so I booked a room there. Nothing speaks to the lore of Vegas like a free minibar to get your whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas story going before you even leave the room. Well the minibar was empty upon check in. I called down and they said they had send up someone to refresh it. I waited about 20 minutes and no one came. Decided to go to the lobby for a drink at their bar and told the front desk they could enter the room while I was out of the room. He told me no problem and that I would be taken care of. Mid drink I had to go back to the room to get something and no one had refreshed it still. About an hour later after initially leaving my room I went back upstairs and there was still not a stocked minibar. I spoke to someone for the third time. She was shocked and someone would be right up. That did not happen of course. On my fourth contact with staff I decided to request in room dining on the phone tree and they said the people that stock minibars left at 730pm and I was basically SOL they transferred me back to the people I had been speaking to all along. That fifth person said the fourth person was wrong but did not bother to suggest how to fix the problem just offer a 100 food beverage credit. Okay fine. What a let down. Why should I have to chase down the hotel on something they not only proudly advertise on their website but the front desk person reminded me of at checkin. My kitschy Vegas attempt at some silly fun was dashed right from the start. I just gave up altogether and went to bed. The room was cool looking but obviously the hotel has completely useless staff.

You can rent chairs for 10USD 150USD on weekends but then u get a credit for food and drinks for the same amount which is fine we did this and some more friends showed up our bill was 540 which was no big deal so we asked the waitress to spilt the bill yep no problem next morning we looked at our bill on line and yep it was split on there so roughly 280 and then I thought weird bc I put our half on my MasterCard so called there another 280. messaged my gf to see what she was charged she was charged 540 and 185 for the chair so this lovely waitress got one hell of a tip. We went to the front desk they never asked us anything like it happened all the time and they removed all our room charges no questions asked. My girlfriend had to fight to get her and eventually just called MasterCard and said her card was not authorized. Sitting around the pool next day mentioned this to someone else and same thing happened to 3 other pl there so if you go watch your statements seems the waitress is getting some pretty great tips one guy at the pool his was overcharged 110. Pool water is freezing as well but in 105 degree weather it was nice and the DJ was awesome. We did not gamble much here ended up taking the sky train to planet Hollywood more than staying here it is just to far away from the center strip. I would pick somewhere in the middle.", "offset": [1450, 1542], "date": "2017-06-04", "cpt": "1", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "60dbe39c-0a01-45dd-869a-cfd20cdb3fae", "sentence": "Far away from everything.

To anyone considering staying here do n\u2019t. My party and I gave this place a chance and I really wish we did n\u2019t. The disaster broken into different sections below. Check in. After a 6 hour flight and being left on the plane for an additional 2 hours because of a malfunction from a plane in front of us we were ready to check into our rooms immediately. In Vegas it was 2 am but back home it was 5 am. We were exhausted and looking forward to going to bed. When we finally found the awkwardly placed check in desk we obviously tried to check in. The girl helping us had an attitude to begin with and seemed very uninterested in doing anything. We tried to make small talk with her asking politely if this was a Starwod property. She blankly looked at us and said \u201c yup \u201d with such an attitude. After she typed and clicked away she then proceeded to tell us we only booked one room. What. It was my boyfriend and I my father and his girlfriend. We had booked TWO separate king rooms. We pulled out the confirmation email from the hotel and she again blankly stares. After arguing about booking two rooms for a while she finally finds the other reservation. Great finally can get some sleep. WRONG. The front desk worker then proceeds to tell us all the king bedrooms have been taken and they would have to put us in a room with two twin beds. Are you kidding me. So you overboked your rooms and now we are not getting what we booked paid for. Again arguing saying it was not fair she did n\u2019t care at all. Then another lady walks over even ruder than the first and talks over us loudly repeating over and over again \u201c it is 2 in the morning there is nothing we can do until the AM. Did you call the hotel saying you \u2019d be in late \u201d. Astonished by how rude she was we tried explaining we booked on Sunday because we \u2019d be arriving around 2 am Monday so obviously we would need to book Sunday as well. She then proceeds to yell \u201c our days do n\u2019t start until 8 am. It \u2019s not Monday until 8 am \u201d Excuse me but I do n\u2019t understand. If it \u2019s not Monday here until 8 am and I booked for Sunday and it \u2019s 2 am then how can I not check in. She totally contradicted herself. After repeats of her saying \u201c it \u2019s 2 am there \u2019s nothing I can do \u201d. then she tells us our booked room is \u201c not guaranteed \u201d. We have never had an issue at any other hotel so why is it an issue here. she finally said we would get moved in the morning to our booked rooms. At this point we are done dealing with the attitudes and just want to sleep. She gives us two separate rooms but with the twin beds. I \u2019m a manager in customer service I was disgusted by how they handled the situation. Not even a sorry or a manager in sight. I said multiple times \u201c where is the manager \u201d. but they ignored me each time. The first room with the twin beds the bathroom was nice and large. The tv was huge. But the weird design on the walls and a crowd of people as a curtain was unsettling. The light up mirrors were cool I guess but nothing spectacular. The twin bed was an absolute joke. After being exhausted my boyfriend and I pulled back the cover and what looked to be the sheet. But surprise. There was no sheet. It was just a thrown on random sheet to cover the mattress. So you did n\u2019t even have a sheet to pull over you. The pillow in the back closer to the wall had a dried blood stain. So disgusting. The bed sat on a fragile looking board from Ikea for a 5 year old. The next morning my father talked to Caesar from the front desk. He said that \u201c what happened last night should n\u2019t have happened and that it should have been resolved immediately \u201d. At least someone showed a little bit of concern. He told us by 1 pm he would call us and our new rooms would be ready. Second awful room with king bed When we got the room keys to the next room we were n\u2019t even excited after such a terrible experience from before. When my boyfriend and I entered the room I swear to god I was on the set of American horror story hotel. Black carpets yellow and grey walls sliding doors for toilet and shower unfinished looking ceilings with globs of red on them which looks like blood a light up bed and couch with a mirror above the bed a tv on a wall to the right. so you have to break your neck watching it. The lights on the ceiling did n\u2019t even work. What a mess. Then we look closely at the bed. The light up plastic bed frame was so DIRTY and the light just highlighted all the dirt and smeared stains. When we pulled back the sheets and looked down the side of the bed hair was EVERYWHERE which we had to brush out. We realized the next day there was a thrown green card behind the tissue box not easily visibleon the sink explaining to put the card on the bed if you want clean sheets. I then realize we probably slept in dirty sheets sense the hair was everywhere. I have never been to a hotel before where they do n\u2019t change the sheets unles you ask them to. We were also very itchy in those sheets and now I have a small RASH on my leg Could be unrelated but it really does n\u2019t help the case. the couch was dirty with smeared black stains along with the bed frame. The sheets had small holes in them. The shower walls and tile were peish yellow including the separate toilet room. We dreaded being in this room to sleep. Our new room keys worked fine but my dads did not as he had to go back downstairs and tell them he could n\u2019t get into his new room. What a joke. Whenever my boyfriend and I stay in any hotel the workers say hello hold the elevator doors for us make small talk and everything in between to serve great customer service. The SLS does not care about customer service. Multiple times my boyfriend and I were in the elevator with Employees. They say nothing not even a hi. We said how are you to multiple workers in the elevators and they say \u201c hi \u201d or \u201c good \u201d looking so annoyed that we tried to be polite. At one point we were trying to get into the elevator and a worker was in it. The door starts to close and he does nothing. My boyfriend threw his arm into the closing doors to stop it. The worker sighed so loud and seemed so mad. The foxtail pool actually super underwhelming. Every other hotel in this area has a better pool then this hotel. It \u2019s so boring compared to other pools for 21. Only went once because it was nothing great. The pool girl server we had was nice. The most polite we encountered. Location really far from anything exciting. The monorail really helps so if you end up staying here make sure you ride it. Casino. dead 247 including the check in desk. It \u2019s funny because at all hours of the day in all the other hotels on the strip the casinos and check in desks are extremely crowded. The SLS casino and front desk is dead 247. Conclusion. I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone. It \u2019s dirty and the employees are n\u2019t exactly kind. Next time I am in Vegas I will stay at another hotel on the strip. I would pay double just to avoid the SLS.", "offset": [6206, 6271], "date": "2018-07-13", "cpt": "3", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 31, "uid": "2b85b834-5488-42c6-a96d-099bb351d137", "sentence": "Better than I could \u2019ve expected.

Recently stayed at the SLS for our trip to sin city. Mainly booked it as it was amazingly cheap through Expedia. We \u2019ve stayed at several other Las Vegas resorts closer to the action and loved them. The SLS is a very clean hotel that has been modernized during the last renovation. Our main complaint was it way too far away from anything we did. We had to take Uber \u2019s everywhere. It does n\u2019t help that most other resorts around it have either been demolished or still under construction. The resort has a few great restaurants that should be checked out especially Bazaar meats. Umami burger is also a great spot for a burger and to watch the game. We found there was n\u2019t much to do in the resort after 9 pm as all the restaurants close except for a Chinese cafe spot that we were n\u2019t interested in. It could use more late night options to eat andor have a drink. There is n\u2019t anything around it either to go to as it again is far away. Another negative is the dreaded \u201c resort fees \u201d all the Vegas resorts charge. The SLS is no different. 40 US per night on top of your bill. I have never understood these fees. They say it \u2019s for \u201c complimentary \u201d wifi and pool access etc etc. Is n\u2019t that why you pay the regular fee to stay at a hotel. Plus they seem to get higher every time we return.

I stayed at SLS Las Vegas on Friday February 22nd and it was one of the worst experiences of my life Everything went wrong from the time of check in until we left the place. So before we got there I spoke with one of the employees and he was wonderful. I let him know that I was celebrating my 5 year wedding anniversary and I need a crib in the room as well as a microwave and a mini fridge he said they will place the fridge and the crib in the room however they do n\u2019t have the microwaves which was disappointing since I was traveling with my baby and I needed to warm up his food. He said he upgraded our room since we are celebrating which I thought was very nice. So we get to the hotel and the agent who checked me in was just awful it seemed like she had no training or experience in the hospitality industry at all she did n\u2019t go over any of the amenities that the hotel has to offer she also did n\u2019t go over the facilities that they had and where the facilities were located she did n\u2019t congratulated me for my anniversary no eye contact either she was just looking at a computer screen and asked me how many keys I wanted. She also mentioned that there is a note about a crib request I said yes I did request a crib to be placed in my room and she just said here is your keys and very quickly said something about where my room was which I did n\u2019t understand at all since she spoke very fast and made no eye contact. I was very tired from a long drive with a young child so I shook it off and managed to find my room with my husband. Once we arrived to our room we see that the fridge was placed however the crib was still not there and I decided to wait a little bit longer to see if they will bring it up without me calling an hour past and no crib was sent. I needed to feed my baby since they did n\u2019t have a microwave I thought I will ask for a tea kettle so I can warm up his food with hot water then I was told they do not provide tea kettles as well. I basically had to feed my child a cold meal and at that point and I was very frustrated. I called the front desk manager and told her about my experience and she apologized and waved the resort fee and told me that she will send the crib right away. Finally after multiple requests and hours we received the crib. Later in the evening I called the room service to request for a cup of warm milk to feed my baby the order taker on the phone says ok it will take 35 to 45 mins for them to deliver 1 cup of milk. I said 35 to 45 mins just for a cup of milk he says \u201c yes that \u2019s our policy \u201d. I mean who talks like that. he could \u2019ve lied to me and said they are backed up with orders they will do their best to bring it as soon as possible however it may take 35 to 45 minutes but no he says that \u2019s their policy which means if the milk is ready before 35 to 45 minutes he \u2019s not allowed to bring it up to my room because it \u2019s against their policy. I laughed it off and said OK 35 to 45 minutes it is then. later he brings the milk and the milk is 16 just for one cup. I could \u2019ve bought 5 gallons of milk for that price. So I open the lid to the milk and see there is a bug floating on top. I was very disturbed by this and called room service immediately and there was no answer so I got forwarded to the operator. The operator tried to help me when I told her what had happened. She could n\u2019t get a hold of anyone at the restaurant so she asked if I can go there and get it. I said no it \u2019s not convenient for me and that it \u2019s time for my child to sleep they need to send a new one immediately. She said because of the incident there was a 50 food and beverage credit placed on our reservation. After that incident no manager called to apologize for what happened and when I checked out I saw that they still charged me for the milk that they tried to poison me with that had a bug.

My stay at the SLS Las Vegas. The establishment is a smaller sized hotel casino that used to be home of the Sahara. The designers incorporate old school themes of both the Sahara and modernized styles from the 70s throughout the hotel. it is smallish when compared to other massive venues like Caesars and Mandalay Bay for example. There was an area under construction but I noticed each day they were making great progress. The main pool is easy to find and is a nice size. It has a stylish set up with a bar in the middle of two symmetrical pools. There is one other small european style pool read. topless if you so choose on the 3rd floor which was closed while we there. We upgraded our room to the Grand tower. The room was spacious and super cool. I enjoyed the very comfy bed and pillows and there were lots of interesting sitting areas. It also had a walk through closet his and hers sinks and the toilet was in it is own little room. No tub. If you are a foodie you will flip for the selection of food here. We ate at Uno Mas twice because the tacos blew our mind. Cleo restaurant had some very unique items like lamb tartar. BAZAAR MEAT by Jose Andre this place is one you can not pass up. I was blown away by the professional service the oddities and decorum of the restaurant see my pictures the food selection the fantastic drinks Come on if you do not get to a great restaurant near enough times in your life do it here.

Not a family friendly place. I stayed in a Grand Luxurious with 2 double beds. I shared with wife a 7 and a 26 year old. Spacious room spacious but very small beds I doubt they are doubles. 7 yr old shared a bed with my wife and fell off it is so small. The bed area has large mirror walls strange for a family room. Bathroom has no door. Shower stall is spacious with 2 shower heads. But the door and wall is clear glass which is awkward with no BR door. The toilet stall has a door that you can not lock. On bedroom side part of wall is glass through which you can look into the shower. it is draped but still awkward. The other wall has a window that is small and high off the floor. The TV covers part of the window. Walking in you come straight to the casino and have to walk through it and all the cigarette smoke. They do not do a good job of clearing it up. Front desk was all the way in the back and hard to find. We took my 7 yr old swimming. Large pool is a party area with a bar loud music women in skimpy bikinis and guys catcalling while drinking and smoking inside the pool. There is a smaller pool that was not nearly as crowded. We thought it was the family friendly pool but were told that children are not allowed because they had a bar. We had to use the first pool which also has a bar. There is a monorail station at the SLS which is very convenient. Overall I would not stay here again when traveling with family.

I have rated this a 3. because my children aged 9yrs and 1yrs went to use the hotel pool and only to be met with a huge amount of drunks and all smoking weed.

While i understand weed is legal in Navada this hotel was full of it everywhere we went even our floor where the room was stunk of it and it was nt only us that noticed a few other guests passed comment on the smell too. This was more towards the end of our stay but it completely ruined it for us and my children. as a suggestion for SLS Sahara perhaps keep the lower pool alcohol free and non smoking so that families can enjoy to there are 2 other pools the drunks drug smokers can use at this hotel not everyone wants to be around that. You need to cater for all your guests. The rooms were infact very nice and clean and the lobby was lovely restaurants were all really nice quite expensive but we enjoyed our meals in the hotel staff were friendly and helpful.

My partner and I flew in on a late evening flight bound for the Sahara. I had been through the old SLS on my way to the Monorail from The Strat so I was not sure what to expect. I figured it was undergoing a guting and renovation so things should be good bordering on great. Boy oh boy was I right in this choice. Check in was a breeze coming in through the Alexandria Tower doors and being greated by Miriam I believe. She was very pleasent and unbelievably helpful. She was so excited that my partner was in Vegas for the first time AND we were celebrating our anniversary. With a quick check in that includes photo ID and a credit card to cover the resort fees we were on our way to our room. The room itself in the Alexandra Tower was spectacular. We had a view leading up the strip showcasing the Sahara Circus Circus Treasure Island Westgate and Stratosphere Marquis. The windows featured black out curtains beautiful tapestries covering the walls a window length chesterfield in room coffee and a bathroom you could have had a party in. There was also a mini bar \u2026. but buyer beware. Amenities offered include a gorgeous pool casino on site of course a coffee shop for the morning a wonderful grill for afternoon evening and late night Burgers and fries. There is also an other option with a patio whose name is escaping me Bazaar Meats with a renowned chef and a Starbucks opening soon. I am sure as the Renos progress so will the food options. There was also a spa we did not visit a steam room and a weight exercise room. Conveniently located are Walgrens Pharmacy for booze breakfast and Munchies Subway and a McDonalds beside the Walgrens for some decent cheap coffee and breakfast. The Monorail deserves its own mention. Like really folks why pay strip prices when you are at a Monorail station. Save the money for shows and meals and stay here and jump on the Monorail. Or the Duce to head downtown. In the casino things are jumping. Jackpot Holdem 5 Blackjack Roulette workers willing to teach you and great machines. We found the machines to be looser then further up the strip and sincerely enjoyed the benefits offered by Club 52. If you are staying here or just passing through the first thing you need to do is visit Club 52. Free enrolment bonus and great accumulated rewards. The service was incredible. Tip accordingly and the ladies will return often. In conclusion we both can not wait to return to the Sahara. Each and every single staff member we encountered most specifically Miriam at the Alexandra Tower entrance was so kind accommodating and overall wonderful.
