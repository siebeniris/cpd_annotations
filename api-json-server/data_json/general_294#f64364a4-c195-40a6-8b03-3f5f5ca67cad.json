Superb service. My four children and I had such a wonderful stay at the Pelican Grand. We were made to feel welcome as soon as we arrived. Enrique the bellhop was so helpful. The receptionist at check in was very kind. The first night we had dinner at Ocean 200. Sylvia our waitress was extremely kind and helpful. One of my daughters and I are vegan. Sylvia spoke to the chef to accommodate our dietary needs. The chef made us a fabulous vegan risotto with grilled vegetables. My son chose the tuna with a size of fingerling potatoes. Sylvia suggested the perfect sauce to accompany the tuna. After dinner we went to The Emporium for ice cream. Kathy was the friendliest person I have ever met. My son wanted a shake but wasted sure what kind. She made him her legendary Kathy shake. He said it was the best shake. Ever. The other kids loved the ice cream and sorbet. The 2nd day we spent the day at the beach and pool. The cabana boys were pleasant and patient helping us get set up with chairs and umbrellas. We ordered drinks and food from the waitress. My kids loved the orange crush frozen drink. I loved the Silver Surfer. The waitress was so sweet. I do not remember her name but she had long dark hair. After a long day outside my kids were worn out. We ordered room service. It was fantastic. Mike from room service was great. Our room on the 10th floor was perfect. Fabulous ocean view from balcony.

My wife and I spent a week at the Pelican Grand Beach Resort which we booked through VRBO. The room was on the 11th floor and was excellent. Counter space in the bathroom comfortable king size bed gorgeous balcony overlooking the ocean. Very clean. There is a beautiful terrace on the 2nd floor and also on the 11th floor great for taking pictures. The food was pretty good in the bar near the pool and also in the restaurant. The Sunday brunch buffet was too expensive and the seafood was a bit disappointing. But overall the food was good at the buffet just very expensive. The pool was pretty and for the most part pretty clean. The lazy river is the highlight of this place but unfortunately it is not properly maintained. Bottom line it was filthy. Food wrappers chicken bone cigarettes it is supposed to be a non smoking property littered the lazy river and all around it. There was also a ton of sand at the bottom which should have been vacuumed daily. It was not cleaned at all not even skimmed until my wife and I complained 3 times. Then finally they started to clean it but the cleaning was minimal. It was such a shame because the lazy river was great. The veranda was lined with rocking chairs overlooking the beach. Beautiful and relaxing. The ice cream at the little gift shop was good although they kept running out of popular flavors. The pool ran out of towels often and the pool guys were not that helpful or friendly. The receptionists at the front desk did not seem to know what was going on in the hotel or the surroundings. They could not give restaurant recommendations. We were there over the July 4th weekend. The hotel posted many scheduled activities live music etc. but most did not happen and no one seemed to have a clue when asked. I do have quite a few complaints but overall I really did like the hotel. Not sure if I would return due to the lack of cleanliness of the lazy river but I may.

The beach is great for swimming paddle boarding or snorkeling. We stayed in an oceanfront suite on the 2nd floor and it was beautiful and clean. From the gorgeous view to the expansive veranda to the comfortable beds I never wanted to leave. Every morning the sunrise over the Atlantic was a welcoming treat as well as the moonlit dinners at night in the restaurant.

First I \u2019l start with the location of this wonderful resort. The hotel is located directly on the beach on one side and the main boulevard in Fort Lauderdale on the other. Although many of the better hotels in Ft Lauderdale do overlook the beach guests must cross a street in order to access the beach. Not so in this hotel you are just steps away from the ocean. We stayed in an oceanfront king room on the third floor. The views are spectacularThe resort is currently in the process of remodeling their guestrooms. The room that we stayed in had not yet been remodeled and was naturally a bit dated yet was still a lovely room crisp and clean. Although there was construction going on throughout the resort it never once hindered our stay in any way. This hotel has thick walls so any disturbance in our room was minimal. The pool is lovely as is the lazy river. The water in both was clean and clear with plenty of sunshine during the day. The pool has a walk in area that allows you to gradually transition into the pool. Makes it nice for those less ambulatory and for parents with small children. The pool area could use some new cushions for the lounge chairs as those have seen better days. We could not be more pleased with the staff at this resort. Everyone that we encountered during our stay were as friendly and helpful as one could hope. Astrid checked us in on our first day. What a lovely young woman. She provided us with helpful information in a most courteous manner. Hubby must have tipped her off that this was a birthday celebration so Astrid decided on behalf of the hotel to make it an extra special occasion. Later that evening Paul from room service called to say that he had a little something that he wanted to deliver to our room. To my delight he showed up with a plate of chocolate covered strawberries surrounded by purple orchids for my birthday. How deliciously lovelyThe guys that handle the parking and retrieval of your car from the garage are very timely and helpful. They provide a cool ap that allows you to request your car from your phone. Using the ap your car is often available and ready to go before you even get downstairs to pick it up. Very friendly guys and great serviceThe hotel is eco friendly as many are now. in that it changes sheets only after three nights stay which I think is a great idea. However this may be my only complaint. Generally in other hotels I am used to housekeeping coming fairly early to take care of the room at least by 10 am. On the fourth day of our stay we straightened up the room in anticipation of housekeeping services. We left in the morning and were gone for most of the day into late afternoon. When we arrived back in our room we were disappointed that our room had not yet been serviced. Eventually later that afternoon we received a knock on the door from housekeeping to clean the room. We did n\u2019t feel like leaving our room at that point as we were too poped. My only disappointment during our stay. As stated previously the staff at Pelican Grand is great from the ladies working at the coffee gift shop to those working at the pool the beach and the resort \u2019s restaurant OCEAN20. a separate review will be forthcoming. On one particular late night we arrived back at the resort after room service was over and we were starving. I spoke with a young woman at the front desk and asked if there were any pizza places that she would recommend. She said yes of course and provided their number and additional delivery information. They were there lickety split delivering to the lobby. I thanked the young lady at the front desk for her assistance. Another example of excellent service and customer care. On one occasion we were waiting for the elevator on our floor when a gentleman from housekeeping stopped to tell us to make sure that we go on up to the 11th floor and climb the tower steps for a nice surprise. Later that week we did just that. The views of Fort Lauderdale and the beaches were phenomenal. It \u2019s the little things that made our stay wonderful. I can not forget to mention the nice gentleman that was working out on the veranda where we were having breakfast one morning. He saw my purse on the ground and said that I must pick it up and place it on the chair next to me. He said that the floor was no place for my purse and that if his wife knew that he witnessed my purse on the ground and did n\u2019t do something about it he \u2019d be in big trouble. Lol. So I moved it. Too sweet. The beach and pool are always my top two attractions when visiting a new resort hotel. I was not disappointed by either. The hotel reminds me of the old grand hotels from yesteryear. Ca n\u2019t wait to go back after the renovations are complete.

The worst part of the room is that lack of insolation on the doors. The cracks of the doors are open to the point where you can see the hallway. That means you can HEAR everything.

We got told the kitchen was having \u201c issues \u201d. it took 30 min from time of order till we got food. They also would not bring things like lemon w ice tea or ketchup w burger you would have to ask for it then wait 10 min to get it.

I have stayed here many times over the last decade and when the Pelican is great. it is great. When it is bad it is bad. I am happy to say my last stay in mid February was a great one. I was concerned by all the bad reviews dealing with construction so I emailed the GM Heidi who made sure I got the exact room I requested and reassured me the construction is for the most part over. A handwritten welcome note was in our room when we checked in. Super follow through. follow up. I was doing business in the area and the gf would be staying and enjoying the property while I was working. We booked a winter escape package through their website. While the room rate would have been cheaper on some discount travel websites the package offered a 50 credit for dining and no resort fees which brought it down to equal to the discount sites so we booked direct. I managed to sneak in some time at the lazy river and the rocking chairs on the deck were a welcome sight after a day of meetings. We ate at the hotel restaurant for lunch Meh. Bring back the old menu. and dinner. The views were nice although be aware if you stay on Sunday they do a Mimosa Brunch which means you will be sharing the patio with lots of locals and no lunch service. The food was good at dinner and I highly recommend the wedge salad with added flat iron steak. They also have a happy hour from 5 7 pm offering 50 off drinks. Pina Coladas were only 7 at Happy Hour and so godThe view from our balcony was outstanding. we wished we could sleep with the doors open because the sounds of the surf were so relaxing even on the 8th floor. It was like being at a spa with a bottle of wine each night. The room renovations are interesting. Personally I preferred the old style which felt a bit more tropical and less sterile. The new one features lots of grey and white and pictures that have more of a cheap rented house vibe than luxury hotel. In fairness the gf loved the new modern looking rooms. We both love the new bathrooms. So much more functional and convenient. The layout was great for a couple. Beds were comfy enough and although I miss the Mango Coconut products of old the new Lather products are nice and upscale. We are proud to say between the beach and chairs we did not need to use the tv once the whole stay. Overall we had a great experience. Everything was back to normal for us regarding construction. These construction problems are frequent at The Pelican and I will say that the corporate Noble resort office must really screw over the management as the renovations always seem to hit in the busy season. 3 times I have had stays disturbed by construction. all in January and February peak season. Why not wait until things get slow in the summer for major renovationsdo not hesitate to book. If you are looking for a secluded resort right ON the ocean vs across the street head to The Pelican. The nightlife is fairly non existant but a scooter bike or Uber ride away is plenty of stuff to do. The Pelican is for relaxing.

Our brunch receipt gave us two hours free parking but we stayed two and one half hours so we had to pay 17 because we had stayed 12 hour over the two hours. There was no pro ration of the fee we had to pay for the next full three hour period. it is a really bad deal from start to finish.", "offset": [0, 51], "date": "2019-10-01", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 28, "uid": "46719ebc-24a8-4091-9fae-50383d8d57e1", "sentence": "Beach Life.

Fort Lauderdale and it is quite a different place than Greenville SC. First of all we expect to pay more for most things and people drive around in Benzs like we see Kias back home. But it is a beautiful vacation spot. We have stayed in places like Hard Rock and Bahia Mar before. There are 3600 hotel rooms in the area and more being built every day. But there is a gem of a hotel called the Pelican Grand Resort a little older but very well kept and an extremely well staffed place owned by Noble House Resorts. Very reasonable rates. QUIET CLEAN great service from the front desk to the restaurant and bar and house keeping and grounds people. No booming music piped through the place. The private balcony off our room 812 was a million dollar view of the ocean and sunrise. Our room had nice upgrades. As far as the beach it is right on it not across the street and you could not find a nicer one manicured daily. Oh and hotel staff will set up your chase lounges and umbrellas for free no rental fees The hotel does have a wonderful pool and amazingly it is own lazy river. Meals at the restaurant and bar were very good. In Fort Lauderdale I have paid more for less. A nearby water taxi station can take you site seeing for a very reasonable price and the longest we waited for an uber was 3 minutes. Honorable mention for extraordinary service.
