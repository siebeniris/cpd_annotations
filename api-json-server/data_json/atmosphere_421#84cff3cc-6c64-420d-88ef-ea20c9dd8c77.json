The relaxed atmosphere makes for a perfect Caribbean holiday with no pressure to conform to stuffy dress codes yet feeling equally at home if wanting to have an elegant evening. We stayed in an ocean front one bedroom suite and loved watching the sunset on the balcony with a glass of rum punch. The suite offered ample room and the huge bed was extremely comfortable. The only slight disappointment compared to our last visit were the new sun beds on the beach. On the face of it they looked very attractive but actually were not very practical as they were so very heavy and hence we were unable to move them from sun to shade and whilst staff were very willing to help we did not like to keep asking. This was no bigie though and instead we just located ourselves on the loungers by the pool which we found more comfortable and easier to move.

We spent Thanksgiving weekend at The House. The five day four night Thanksgiving trip doubled as my 50th birthday getaway. A college friend who is originally from Barbados recommended the place to me and stated it is understated British luxury. it will be quiet and dignified but nothing to blow your socks off. She was 100 correct. The hotel is in a great location in St James with a beautiful ocean front setting. We stayed in an ocean front junior suite which was basically just two standard rooms combined into one. I do not think the two of us needed two bathrooms but it was nice to have the sitting area. The room was well appointed but certainly not overly spectacular. The Spanish tie and some inferior moldings around doors and baseboards need some upkeep. The setting is lovely and the best part of the hotel is its quiet sophistication. The guests are quiet adult and well mannered. The ambassadors of the hotel roam around throughout the morning mid day and evening and are always willing to answer questions and be helpful in any way they can. The beach is right out front so get up early and reserve seats as they tend to get filled quickly. The breakfast at The House was perfectly fine but the service was a bit slow with coffee and other drinks as the breakfast service tends to be a bit understaffed. The food for lunch was delicious but I do recommend walking outside and trying the Roti shack just across the street. Delicious authentic local cuisine at 15 the price. The best part of each day was the late afternoon stroll down the beach and then returning for high tea at 4 pm and happy hour at 6 pm. Daphnes was closed while we were there but there are plenty of restaurants to try Cariba The Tides and Sandy Lane will be the subject of further reviews. I almost hate to say it and it sounds counterintuitive with the rest of the review but this was the third hotel I have ever stayed at with prices topping 10 night. The other two were the Burg Al Arab in Dubai and The One and Only in Hayman Island in Australia. The inexpensive Mexican tile floors along with some moldings and floor boards seemed a bit worn for a 5star property. I know Barbados is crazy expensive but The House does not compare to those two other hotels. We enjoyed our stay very much but I think at those prices I just expected a bit more.

This is my first ever review on TA and our first time in Barbados and just waiting to get picked up having had ten days at this amazing place. You take a shirt while getting used to the idea of no reception or desk of any description rather just a central meeting place which is the hub of the House. But you quickly adjust and it seems to make eminent sense and works really well. All the staff are trained to do everything. Very relaxing place with very good facilities and the staff are just amazingly friendly and helpful and incessantly cheerful. The guests are a mix of European with many Brits and American and like the staff most are caught up in the infectious mood of friendliness. Great food next door at Daphnes restaurant but you can also order and eat in the House and book a private table by the sea of your own. It does not come nicer really than having dinner hearing the sea lapping the shore just a few yards away. The chef is very attentive to food allergies here see also point about the Cliff belowThere is a barbecue once a week and on a couple of nights a week there are some fabulous musicians and singers who provide low key but high quality entertainment. All understated but excellent. Plenty of other restaurants around very good quality and the Cliff is a must do experience. In some respects people will say it is pricey and it is. but it is worth every penny for the setting and also the quality of the food which is outstanding. it is one of the few places in the world we have eaten that has been able to accommodate an allergy to garlic and onions without turning a hair and without sacrificing taste and flavour in any way.

Been to many Caribbean Islands Aruba Turks St Thomas St Croix Bahamas Grand Cayman. so we are not new to beach vacations. Typically we stay in large chain hotels think places like Mariot and are used to vacationing with lots and lots of people around. The House provided a refreshing break actually something we have never done. Never been to a small boutique hotel before. Nice that it was an adults only hotel too. So everything from check in yes there is no front desk or any desk at all to check out was superb. Welcome rum punch was great and refreshing and a terrific way to start the vacation watch it though as they are strong. While relaxing on the couches and sipping punch your bags are whisked away to your room. A senior member of the staff also personally inspects the room to ensure everything is in order before they walk you to the room. The check in procedure is actually done in room you sign one piece of paper and they take down your CC info. The senior staff member shows you all the amenities of the room and gives you an overview of the hotel. From there you are good to go. Could not be closer to the beach. Just about every room has ocean views of some sort. We had signed up for the Spa Indulgence Package and one perk of that package is a free room upgrade if available. Well we lucked out. We were placed in the nicest room category in the hotel full one bedroom suite with two balconies center of hotel overlooking main decking pools and beach. Just incredible. So the place is just beautiful. I will try and post some pictures so you can see for yourself. What I think really sets The House apart is the people employees and the service. Everyone is so friendly and they just can not do enough to make sure your every need is attended to and every want is satisfied. Even simple things like coming around in the morning to spray clean your sunglasses. A simple thing but rarely seen this done. Or bringing you a cold fruit smoothie during the heat of the early afternoon just after you have had lunch. Boy does that hit the spot. Or the mid afternoon ice cream brought to you at your pool or beach lounge. Ice cream has never tasted this good. Then there is the mid afternoon tea service. For this you need to come up off the beach and to the decking. And then there are the early evening canap\u00e9s. Before I forget a word on the wonderful buffet breakfast. A special shout out to the ladies and gents who worked the omelet station. Lots of other chafing dishes to choose from as well as breads pastries cereals and juices. And of course lots of coffee and tea to get you going. I would be remiss if I did not spend a moment to call out a few special employees who left a memorable impression on us and made our vacation even more special. Ricardo. what a wonderful guy. We just loved him. Always there with a smile looking to help. A wealth of information on the island restaurants and things to do. Recommended we consider Ragamuffins on Sunday evening they have an interesting drag show. we did and loved it. Changed two dinner reservations for us always there to call a taxi. Just a wonderful guy. Wade thanks for all your help including assisting with the bags and helping us with check out. Damon and Shawn always there to help with food and drink service. Paul hotel security big dude and wonderful human being. Tedie great bartender and genuinely nice guy. Service with a smile. There are lots of others too but I will stop there to make a few comments on the local restaurants. Here are the places where we ate Lone Star Best restaurant decor and overall ambience food excellent toThe Tides Best tasting food in my opinion loved the seafood stew great location and ambience as well. The Cliffs Beach House. What a view. Food was good but portions were small. In terms of value least value for the Cin Cin Great food and great location but decor too sterile for me everything and I mean everything is white wife loved it though. Daphnes Great location. If you were any closer to the beach your toes would be in the sand. Ragamuffins Bar restaurant. Food quality not up to the others but it was quite good for what it was.

After reading many reviews on this site my wife and I decided that we should post our first ever review. We have traveled extensively through the Caribbean Mexico and some of Europe. We have never contributed to any site in the past but now I feel that it is our responsibility to help others in our situation. One of the most important things about the house is that it is quite small with only approximately 32 rooms and is adults only. This is new for my wife and I who traveled with our four sons extensively for years. It was a welcome part of the experience not to have children frolicking in the pool or disrupting our adult time. We usually rent a car wherever we go. This is not necessary in Barbados as there are many taxis available at a reasonable charge. We had previously stayed in Barbados approximately seven years ago and did not have the greatest experience. At that time we had rented a house on the south part of the island. The west side is clearly the more upscale area to stay with many excellent restaurants and shops. The house is a somewhat older boutique hotel and could benefit from some renovations. Nothing dramatic but there is clearly the sense that the place is a bit dated. The pool lounge furniture has clearly been recently replaced and it is beautiful and comfortable. The room decor is unobtrusive simple and comfortable but some of the room amenities could be better. Some of the lighting and availability of outlets etc. as well as a better stocked minibar. Our king size bed was clearly constructed from two twin beds which were fastened together. This was quite uncomfortable. We did bring it to attention of the general manager and some attempts at improving the situation were made and they were very apologetic but overall I believe the beds needed to be changed completely. Esther from housekeeping was very concerned about our comfort and tried her hardest to solve the situation. They also did some beautiful things in the room to make us feel special recognizing that we had that complaint. The staff is where the House really shines and makes the experience special. Nearly all of the staff took The time to engage us both professionally and personally about our trip and even about our family and truly appeared to be concerned about our experience both on the island and at the resort. Special thanks go out to Andrew Ricardo Richie and Shane. They were an excellent source of info regarding other restaurants and activities on the island. The service at the pool area and beach was generally excellent however the choices for food were limited to what was available from the Daphnes restaurant. that is another story. The restaurant also needs updating and room service could be better. All in all the stay was excellent which is why I gave four stars.

We stayed here for our 27th wedding anniversary. We got married at The Tamarind Hotel next door. 27 years ago on the beach steps but looking at these 2 Hotels we opted for this one as it was adults only and appeared to look luxurious. Our arrival was lovely and we had a warm welcome. We were given a garden room with a plunge pool and large balcony which was nice but it was outdated and not a 5 star standard. The bathroom in particular was long and thin and in much need of modernisation. The rooms were cleaned twice daily and the cleaning team were very friendly and attentive. A criticism is that our room was not cleaned until 3 pm ish each day and again at 8 pm so after returning from the beach to freshen up it was often not made up. The champagne breakfasts were nice just enough variety and fresh eggs cooked to your liking if anyone was around to cook them and the champagne kept coming for those who liked it. The afternoon teas were nice too. Our major concern with the Hotel was the fact it had no dedicated Reception Welcome desk. yes there were Ambassadors around but you had difficulty finding one at times especially breakfast and mid afternoon and had to basically go into the kitchen. Certainly no Ambassador came to make a fuss of us or attend to our needs we had to ring or find one of them. We did see Sandra a few times on arrival the welcome night and a few other occasions she was always chatty and pleasant but returning guests certainly got more personal service which did leave you feeling like a second class visitor. The room where you had breakfast was not really a room it was a walk way under the Hotel to the beach. It had a lovely breeze but was not fine dining and a 5 star hotel should have had a separate room with air con for dining in. The sun beds were a complete let down. all gone by 8 am and saved by people who did not turn up until mid morning. We ended up using the ones at The Tamarind where you could spread out and basically have the pool to yourself. The Hotel did not really have a bar either there was a tiny bar area with aprox 6 seats but not a dedicated area as such. We never saw anyone in the Gym or the library area so this was a waste of a good space. The welcome massage was a let down too we arrived on a Friday and could not be seen until the following Thursday at separate times too a shame and not as advertised. We also felt there was a lack of communication with management and guests some days we got a newsletter but most days we did not. events were very last minute and we never knew about live music nights or cooking nights which was disappointing. We got the bus up and down the coast while we were there and tried all sorts of restaurants from local shacks to fine dining which was lovely. We only ate at Daphnes once and found it to be nice food but lacking in atmosphere and very expensive. Towards the end of the holiday we hired a car for 3 days and explored the Island a lot more and visited the other Elegant Hotels all differing in what they offer. We would not stay here again especially for the prices as charged. A great holiday but not as special as we had hoped for.", "offset": [2807, 2909], "date": "2019-11-20", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "a026c9fd-2340-4e75-b1b1-ba1ac50c2676", "sentence": "45 out of 5.

Our room was spacious and led out direct on to the patio. So why only 45. The property is needing some refurbishment particularly the bathrooms in the rooms. the gym and some redecoration in places but the most signifant factor is the lack of a decent restaurant. The hotel is attached to Daphnes and Daphnes is not up to standard for a 5 star class hotel. Most guests ate elsewhere as the ambiance the choice and quality of the menu and food are limited in Daphnes and simply not worth the money compared to other nearby restaurants. They could also reduce the price and provide a better choice at lunchtime. Whilst this did not detract us from enjoying our stay and returning to the House in future it simply did not reach the heights we have expected and stayed recently at other 5 star resorts. Finally I would like to point out that the beach has suffered in recent years. It is tricky getting in and out of the sea due to broken coral and stones and you need to be very careful not to cut your feet. I accept this may be outwith the control of the hotel but it is certainly a negative.

We definitely never had any interaction with an ambassador after check in. The Manager was clearly not receptive to our complaint and did not agree with our assertion it did take her almost 25mins to organise two beds which had to be carried in point proven I thought. Our en suite was really poor long and very narrow no room to pass and never seen a shower like it the door missed the WC by mm once you sat down you could not close it you had to enter close turn around and use WC worse than a caravan. The bedroom size is not 4 nor are the fixtures. The seating area separate room for us was a good size but poorly appointed very dated throughout Room 276 to be AVOIDED. there may be better available of course but I can not see anything being that much better the theme throughout is consistent very very dated. The gym is rubbish very sparse old rusty equipment filthy floor mirrors not cleaned quite astonishing. Upon arrival they tell people the closest WC for the beach is through the gym so many people do that many go via the lobby to be fair too hence sandy floor and door left openly constantly. very warm. Hotel BQ is stored in the stairwell. At check in I was told dress code for Daphne \u2019s long trousers long sleeves turned up as directed to find shorts n T \u2019s everywhere incredible. Food was OK but nothing special and very poor wine list which is an indication of a restaurant is it not. The timber fence around Daphne \u2019s looking onto the beach is rotten joints falling apart with 4 \u201d nails hanging out it is a real liability.

They have Whispering Angel on the wine list at the beach bar which is a minor redemption otherwise the beach bar is quite limited on drinks selection large bottles of Schwepes Tonic often flat two local bottled beers limited spirit selection very poor and not 4. though again the bar staff have to be commended.

The breakfast was reliable each day with a choice of breads english muffins bagels toast a good selection of fruit and yogurts as well as a warm food station with bacon sausage pancakes and eggs to order. It definitely looks like folks come down before 8 AM and reserve the chaise on the beach for the day leading to a shortage on sunny days. The room was nice as mentioned. The bathroom showers were just tubs with rain shower heads installed. The showers could certainly use some modernization updating to better match the rest of the accommodations. One of the more annoying things was the large king bed is two mattresses. This made it very uncomfortable if you want to be close to your partner and one of you inevitably ends up in the crevasse. One interesting thing to note is that there is no hot tub. It never even occurred to us to check that first. I love hot tubs and was somewhat sad not to have one available. I suspect this could be a British vs US preference. We also had some difficulty scheduling massages especially a couples massage as it appears that the slots are limited and book out several days in advance.

I liked the quieter inner space of the covered patio where they served breakfast. The ocean front room with the balcony is a must. The chairs on the deck directly behind the beach were very comfortable but it was hard to get those as people would save them. The check in was very personable but then never saw our ambassador again. You are basically on your own after check in. We just returned from The House on Jan 13th 2020. We had just lost our house in Marsh Harbour in hurricane Dorian and really wanted to spoil ourselves and decompress. It was also my husbands 60th Birthday and so we decided to go to The House as the reviews seemed very good. We were disappointed on so many levels. The service went from a 1010 to a 410 very quickly. The personal check in with our ambassador was the best part and I felt this was going to be a pampered experience they set up our massage brought you a drink of your choice checked you into your room. but then no one assisted us in any way thereafter Our ambassador showed up on our last day and told us she was on days off for the last 4 daysThese may seem trivial but not one staff member asked us if we had like a drink during the days while lounging on the beach chairs. so you had to go to the bar yourself. Our towels got soaked we had a lot of rain bans. several times a day and no one came to help clear them away and bring you fresh ones and if you went to get fresh ones there were none at times. I had read about the complaints about lack of chairs coz for this nightly rate who wants to get up at the crack of dawn to save a chair. And our ambassador assured us there would be no problem on check in. There was. Once I asked a staff member what the policy was on saved chairs and she told me its not allowed. Ok so how are you managing this. She said go ahead and remove the towel yourself. Onus on me not the Hotels problem. Our room was number 374 which was dated but functional beware the shower stall is in a bathtub. Not sure what this was about but one night there was very loud music coming from the bar across the street til about 11 of the clock. Loud enough that you could not read in your room or relax. The main bathroom was dingy and there was never a roll of toilet paper on the roll.", "offset": [0, 79], "date": "2020-01-17", "cpt": "1", "category": "atmosphere"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "5c6c66e0-51c1-421d-b3d9-ac28344f2fad", "sentence": "A charming small boutique hotel. Firstly I \u2019ve given it 4 stars rather than 5 as even the staff will admit it needs a bit of tlc as definitely looking shabby chic.

Sandra the GM is very visible and ensures she gets round to chatting with all her guests. Repeat customers make up around 80. and I can see why.
