Immaculate of course. It s switzerland. Chose because of location amenities and price. The weekend rate was a great deal and I added breakfast at a reduced rate through an offer Radison sent in email. Well worth chf 25 for a most wonderful buffet including specialty pastries from my favorite patisserie and excellent service. We felt as though we were personal guests of the staff. Great capucino as often as we desired. The pool is actually long enough for laps. Not often in an indoor hotel pool. The area also has an OK gym steam and sauna and locker rooms. Our room was a courtesy upgrade to executive which was appreciated. With the free mobility pass which Basel hotels give guests and tram stops a few steps from the hotel getting anywhere in the city and environs is a delight. Of course it s a lovely walk to the marktplatz Munster the rhein museums shopping and much which this great historic city offers.

It was very spectacular event at the middle of February. We chose the Radison Blu Hotel because of its good location center of the city shops restaurants museums and famous squares are near the hotel. 3 days and 2 nights was pleasant. Unfortunately servis staff had come in our room twice a morning so we noted that they really did not know when they should come to clean our room and do not disturb us. I liked our breakfasts we booked only them tasty and good variety and when we ordered supper it was tasty too. The hotel has a super swimming pool sauna and 24hour gym. One piquant detail in sauna everyone should take off the clothes. If you travel on car you can use the underground parking zone for free.

We stayed here for 3 nights in early September me my husband and 7 year old daughter. I booked a standard double room and requested an extra bed for our daughter when we arrived we were given a business class room which was very large and comfortable and had a separate sleeping area for us. 2 TVs a safe fridge tea and coffee making facilities etc. The room was very quiet and a comfortable temperature and the beds were big and comfy. We all slept well. We used the gym and swimming pool these are good and the pool is plenty big enough to swim properly in The location of the hotel is very good a few minutes walk from the Swiss train station Bahnhof SB and a few minutes in the other direction for the old town. The area around the hotel is safe and clean and there are plenty of shops and restaurants close by. Paddy Reilys Irish bar next door serves decent beer and food at reasonable for Switzerland prices. We enjoyed our stay in Basel it is very under the tourist radar but has some excellent museums and a nice zoo and a nice mix of old and new buildings in the centre. It is easy to access the hotel from the airport either by taxi or airport bus line 50 to the train station cost about 4 francs.

Location excellent for getting around Basel but front rooms which we had opposite a dance club so disturbed by music noise and people shouting in the early morning despite double secondary glazing.
