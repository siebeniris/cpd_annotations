Checking in here was a near disaster. We booked on hotelscom and were supposed to get breakfast for 3 as part of the deal. I was handed a voucher for one breakfast and two drinks. I warned the lady at the desk Tiana that my girlfriend who made the reservation was going question the vouchers. When my girlfriend did so Tiana became very hostile loud and argumentative saying that she would not jeopardize her career to fix the problem. Other hotel employees were just standing and sitting around watching it happen. We called Mariot corporate which did nothing but initiate a case file and forwarded it to the manager. I expect more from a company like Mariot. Hotelscom readily agreed to refund the price we paid for the breakfasts. Got to the room and the saga continues. Almost no toilet paper in the bathroom and no spare roles. We tried to use the two drink vouchers at the bar and were told that the bar was closed for the holiday. Well. It is morning and the lies and rudeness continues. When we tried to use the drink vouchers at breakfast which we were told last night we could use at breakfast we were told that we could not use them at breakfast for anything other than coffee or juice which would have been included with breakfast anyway which I would have had to pay for for two additional people. We walked away with coffee and orange juice and no breakfast. So the drink vouchers turned out to be absolutely WORTHLESMy worst hotel experience ever.
