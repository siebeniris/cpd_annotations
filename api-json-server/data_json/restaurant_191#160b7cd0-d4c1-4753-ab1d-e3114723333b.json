The check in process was simple and we were on our way to our room. The bell man drove us there on a golf cart. The room we had looked out over the property with a great view of the ocean. The room was what I expected very nice. While at the hotel we spent most of our time by the pool. If you want a nice spot at the pool or by the beach you better get up early as guests begin claiming their spot with a towel very early. We ate several times at the pool restaurant and every time the food was good. One cool perk was while we were at the pool the staff would come around often with complimentary fresh fruit as well as a sample of the drink of the day. We also had a dinner at Bluewater one evening and it was nice as well. The hotels location was great as we were close to both Red Hook and Charlotte Amalie.

The Club Level Lounge has an omelette station for breakfast aside from the usual breads danishes fruit and variety of cereal lunch had a good choice of snacks salads fruit petite sandwiches and sometimes soup there is both alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks and dessert had some good choices too. My daughter loved the chocolate fondue and we dined out for dinner on our own some nights. We walked around the property during sundown and also enjoyed a meal and music at Coconut Grove. I enjoyed the walks around the property and the hills were not bothersome at all. The gym is a bit dated but did not affect our stay. There are ice water stations all over the property and bug spray is readily available. The pool attendants serve trays of fruit kabobs ice towels and ice pops to guests and offer towel set up when you arrive.

We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ritz Carlton St Thomas staying in an oceanfront queen bedroom. With Bon Voy Ambassador status and previous Ritz stays my expectations were high but tempered by recent reviews and understanding that they are still recuperating from the hurricanes. However we were extremely disappointed with the consistency of service offered. We take this special trip every other year and were extremely disappointed with our stay. From the beginning we were not able to reach anyone at the hotel via phone or email to answer questions related to the reservation. One time that I did talk to someone it took over an hour on the phone to attempt to change our room type. After leaving several messages and emails for a concierge no one ever responded. Eventually our Mariot Ambassador was able to confirm everything for us before we arrived. While the check in process was simple through the ap and the welcome lovely after several calls to the front desk we were told that we would need to pay an additional 350 night for access to the Club Lounge regardless of the lifetime status. We made several requests at the concierge desk the pool deck and over the phone to reserve a pool cabana and never received any response. Half of the time when we would call for reservations or room service no one would answer the phone at all. While lounging at the beach the service was spotty and inconsistent at best. There was an issue with the Sails kitchen which prompted a very limited menu for lunch and food being prepared next to the pool beach on grills under a tent. I was not expecting just one restaurant on property to be available for meals. Our room was on the 5th floor of building E and with only one elevator on the other side of the building I would not recommend this hotel for anyone with mobility issues. There are stairs everywhere throughout the main building to and from the pool and the beach etc. The construction of the family pool was very disruptive. It was visible from every room and the hotel attempted to disguise with music that started early each morning on the pool deck with the same playlist each day. The construction definitely cuts into the pool deck and you need to reserve your pool loungers early in the morning if you want a place to sit. At the beach you need to reserve a chair early in the morning if you want to sit in the front row. The attendants were friendly but not helpful even with tips.
