However there are some required structural improvements they should focus on. In the same trip I have also been at the Four Seasons at Landa Giravaru Landa and there is a clear difference in terms of the hotel condition. The key for my rating were the hotel staff services my room and because the resort is located in a beautiful island. I got there by sea plane from Landa and was very well impressed again by the efficient and organized logistic. I was very well welcomed and the checkin process and hotel overview was very fast. I have stayed at a Sunrise Beach Bungalow 207 which had a beautiful beach just steps from the nice but small pool different from Landa where my room did not have a beach in front even it was also a Beach Bungalow. The room was excellent but not very big and with a very good maintenance. The two main negative points were the noisy air conditioning and the old and noisy mattress. Also the room lack of some privacy some of the windows were facing a public passage and are too close to one another. Before my checkout date the management offered me a complimentary late checkout I was leaving at 930pm but I needed to move to a smaller room Beach Pavilion 106 at that day at 11 am. That was a very nice gesture mainly because I did not ask for. The room was ok not at the same standards of other rooms The room did not have sea view had big privacy problems had a very mold smell and it was clear that the wood of the balcony and ceiling had termite problems I also noticed some termites in other parts of the resort. I think it would be better to finish with this room category and construct other common areas or more Beach Bungalows there is not reason to have such kind of inferior room there. The hotel is compact and you can easily walk to all the places. Surrounded by a gorgeous beach you can stay in both sides with no reasons to complain. sunrise side the one I was has the best spots for snorkeling and the sunset side have a calmer sea very shallow during low tide but the beach is busier. There are two pools. The Main Pool is easily reached by the sunset beach and is located besides the main restaurant. It is very nice but has an old style floor and some of the tables were lacking of a good maintenance. Service was great thank you Mr Amu. The other pool only for Adults is located besides the Blue Reef restaurant same style as in Landa and is GORGEOUS. If you are traveling without kids do not waste your time and head to the serenity pool. There is also a jacuzi facing the ocean great for the sunset. The service at the serenity pool was very good but not great. At the beach you normally stay at the chairs in front of your room but they also offer spare ones. Even though the beach service is very good and efficient thank you Mr Blue also there is energy plug in case you need to charge your phone something missing at Landas beach. BTW wifi works perfectly everywhere but they charge for a premium package unnecessary for a 18k daily rate. The diving center is much smaller than the one in Lada but the dives I did were much better. even with strong current I was able to see big fished including lots of sharks and rays turtles but also beautiful and healthy coral formations with an exuberant life. I would like to highlight that I was the only one diving at all occasions and the resort had honored my appointment. I would like to thank Mr Mazin for the excellent job. The spa is beautiful and treatment was great. Thanks Ms Inez. I had a better impression of this resort restaurants. Mainly because I loved the Blue Reef and the Indian option I can not remember the name. Mr Ghirit from the Indian restaurant was great providing detailed information about the ingredients and history of each dish. The Indian buffet night was very good but expensive 120 for Indian food looks very expensive. The sunset bar is a great option for drinks and fast meals. I went every night and spent time chatting with hotel staff. Very quiet and with incredible views. Special tanks for Mr Jestin Mr Danu and Mr Das. Thanks to the management for everything. Great job. My overall opinion is very positive and I would like to come back.

However the staff were wonderful and we had a breach bungalow whereas at LG we had stayed in a water villa with private pool. Our bungalow was nestled in dense vegetation which made it very private and had its own plunge pool and gorgeous day bed within a small garden. The room was nearly as good at LG although smaller.

We stayed in an over water villa on the sunset side and it was perfect really spacious with all mod cons. Loved the bose sound system complete with chill out music. TV sound needs a bit of work as it is very echoey also we took a dvd one night and it was dubbed in chinese so could not use it.

Also orders were forgotten and you would need to ask staff a couple of times in order to get what you wanted I felt they could do with having an experienced supervisor on hand at breakfast service to polish things up and help train the staff.

We had just been to Four Seasons Landa Giravaru so this may have influenced this island not meeting our expectations. The first thing we noticed was the close proximity to other islands. It did not seem as private and remote as other islands but it was a very convenient 30 minute boat ride to get back to Male for our flight. The water villas were nice but small with an equally small outdoor space that was lacking in privacy especially the plunge pool. The restaurant and bar staff were very friendly but others we encountered were lacking in smiles or a cordial hello. The food was very good especially the Indian restaurant. Unles you dined in the only breakfast option was a large buffet that while tasty meant your day started out with loud organized chaos. A wide variety of water sports were offered and the ocean was calm enough to take full advantage of them. The Discovery Center at this location did not have the warm welcoming staff we had come accustomed to it was actually quite the opposite making us feel like we were intruding.

My family and I came here after our lovely stay at the Landa Giravaru island. We had a late night flight so our hosts planned for us to stay here for the rest of the day since the speedboat ride was only thirty minutes. After checking in to our room we walked around the island to explore. Being so devastated by our trip ending we decided to stay here for another five daysOur main reason for staying was to dive. Nihad Clare Moose and Musto were apart of our daily dive crew and we could not have asked for a better team. My brother and I received our PADI Open Water certification here and I also progressed to Adventure Diver along with my mom and uncle. Nihad was so knowledgable about aquatic life and pointed out things on every dive. We stayed in the Sunrise villas and the reefs next to us were sectioned off giving us calm waters to snorkel and swim in. My favorite restaurant had to be Barabaru. We dined waterfront at the Sunset Lounge every night since you are able to order from any menu. I definitely found myself comparing everything here to our stay at Landa the entire time. Kuda Hura is about three times smaller but has more character. The service was not as attentive and I think the breakfast buffet needs more variety. We had one incident where we were going to dine at one of theme night buffets at Cafe Hura but were told that adult men were required to wear sleeved shirts due to hygienic reasons. Yet women and children were able to wear tank tops. This rule did not apply to breakfast which is also a buffet. The request was a little confusing and we ended up not eating there since all we had packed to our beach vacation was tank tops. So be aware if you are planning to eat those buffets. If you are looking for a more relaxing quiet vacation I had recommend Landa Giravaru. If you want a more family friendly environment Kuda Hura is your island. Everything else during our stay was wonderful. We were extremely happy that we extended our stay and once again had to experience the devastation of ending our vacation.

I stayed here with my family 3 generations of us. a week ago. I have stayed at several resorts in Maldives and many Four Seasons around the world before and this is by far the best hotel. The service is impeccable. Our butler Mr Nawax was attentive and often delivered solutions that far exceeded our expectations. There are plenty of activities for the whole family young and old even if they do not dive. All of us went to the spa which was relaxing and accessed by a short ride by dhoni. One of our party wanted to buy a pair of the comfortable slippers made available at the spa. We were told these were not for sale and yet the lady at the spa kindly arranged for a complimentary pair to be delivered to our villa. This exemplifies the exceptional service at this resort. We also had a pleasant private sunrise yoga session on the beach. We windsurfed kayaked surfed and snorkeled. There are many fish to see in the corals lying just off the beach on the sunrise side. The resort is one of the few turtle sanctuaries in Maldives. Turtles that have been caught in ghost nets who require their flipper to be amputated are brought here for the operation and recuperation. There is a resident marine biologist who also gives talks and accompanies the guests on the dolphin watching cruise. We saw many spinner dolphins on the cruise. The tuition provided by the snorkeling windsurfing and surfing instructors is also professional and we all had great fun. Mr Sabah the snorkeling coach was very patient with one of our party who was very afraid of the water and he managed to persuade her to go snorkeling. We stayed in the water villa suite. We would recommend the villa on the sunrise side where the waves are less choppy and it is less windy than the sunset side. Staff at the Caf\u00e9 Hura where breakfast is served are very friendly especially Ms DeDe and another lady from the Philippines. The staff squeeze fruit and vegetable juices to order which we appreciated very much. Complimentary dimsum was also delivered to our villa for tea and when we commented to the chef how good they were the Caf\u00e9 Hura staff made sure we were provided with a steamer for breakfast on subsequent days. The pizza and pasta at the Italian restaurant were excellent as were the waffles served at breakfast. We also appreciated the complimentary early check in and late check out and the boat upgrade for our return journey to Male. In the evening there is shark feeding and crab races which the child in our party thoroughly enjoyed along with the kids club. and she said it was her best holiday ever.

I stayed at Kuda Hura with my family for 3 nights and then went to their other resort at Landa Giravaru. Kuda Hura is a nice small resort with a service that exceeds excellency. All of the staff know each of our names and they greet us with a smile each time we pass by. The resort itself feels like your at your own home. You would feel very comfortable walking around the resort and get the feeling that you are very acquainted with the overall ambiance. Their restaurants are of a very top quality. The Indian restaurant is a must try. I could not resist eating more and more of that real extremely delicious authentic Indian cuisine. Also the resort hosted an all Asian themed buffet night at Cafe Kuda Hura and it was one of my best dinners ever. You could find all kinds of Thai Chinese Indonesian Vietnamese and many other regions. I personally fell in love with their Lobster Chili. It was one of the best unique lobster style I have ever tasted. However the Italian restaurant is not good at all. They need to get a new chef. The breakfast buffet is excellent and they can prepare anything you may request. The overall service is excellent fast and efficient. By the way you have to try their Lomi Lomi drink. It is non alcoholic and is a mixture of lime ginger and honey. I drank it on a daily basis Please note that Landa resort Lomi Lomi drink is not as excellent as the one in Kuda Hura. But it is still godMoving on to villas I have stayed in their Sunrise Over water Bungalow with Pool. The villa is nice and it is small and very cozy. The only flaw is that I did not get the Four Seasons Luxury Feeling. It looks like any other villa in a regular resort. Please do not get me wrong it is still nice. Another flaw is that the pool is extremely small while the patio is quite spacious. They could have extended the pool size more. I tried swimming in front of my villa but the sea has lots of stones. I recommend wearing a sea shoes. The villa needs a refurbishment definitely as it looks old and depreciated. The interior of the villa is nice but as I said it is not luxurious at all and I do not believe it worth the price I have paid. I have heared one of the staff saying that the management is considering demolishing all of the current villas and rebuilding them with a much better looking design. I believe this is exactly what Kuda Hura needs. It would be a perfect resort if the villas were redesigned into a more luxury standards as Four Seasons are known for. I have not tried the spa but my wife seems to love it so I am assuming it is excellent. The main pool area is nice and the kids club seems to be average. My child did not like it a lot. According to my paradise twice offer the resort was supposed to arrange a seaplane to transport us to their other resort. I was instructed upon check in that I will be getting the plane schedule at my last night. I waited until night and nobody has said anything. I checked with the front desk. They seemed to have no idea about my plane schedule which made me upset. I did not expect such a simple flaw from the Four Seasons. The gentleman on duty did his best to arrange the transportation. He then told me that the plane will depart around 9 am in the morning. He apologized and the job was done correctly. If I have not checked with them then it would have been a catastropheOveral Kuda Hura a good resort but I would neither consider it a 5 star resort nor a Four Season Resort.", "offset": [1781, 1864], "date": "2016-02-07", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "80dfe357-a6ac-4b4b-8f37-e0c29d06d9a7", "sentence": "Short break in Maldives.

Both the beach bungalow and water villa outclassed rivals we \u2019ve stayed at. The beach bungalow had a nice secluded pool outside and private pathway to the beach. At the end of the path there \u2019s an umbrella and couple of loungers with a service button. The hotel does n\u2019t guarantee these loungers will be unoccupied as the beach is available for all guests but we never saw anyone else around. The water villa was superb and has a nice modern feel. The net above the ocean where you can sunbathe or use as a trampoline is an especially good touch. Choosing between a beach bungalow and water villa is hard \u2013 they offer contrasting experiences and if you have time then it \u2019s great to try both. If you want romance with a wow factor go with the water villa. If you \u2019re with a family and prefer to be close to everything with more immediate service do the beach bungalow. Whatever you choose be aware that the sunrise side of the island is calm and hot whereas the sunset side has a breeze that can be quite strong. \u2022. food and drink.

Warning this is a long review but there \u2019s just so much to say. We stayed at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura for 7 days as we wanted a luxury family vacation where we could just unwind yet still have fun. We hit the jackpot. A member of staff greets you as soon as you clear Immigration and get your bags. You \u2019re taken to the Four Seasons private waiting lounge where you can relax with a cold towel and drink while your bags are taken to the waiting boat. And if you ca n\u2019t yet unplug from life they have free wifi. A short boat ride takes you to the island. They say it \u2019s about 30 minutes but I think it \u2019s less than that. We stayed during monsoon and arrived just after a big storm so the boat ride was n\u2019t exactly pleasant me being squeamish in rough waters. However the crew made us feel welcome and safe and the captain handled the waves expertly. Before long the island comes into view. It \u2019s just far enough away to make you feel like you \u2019re really away yet not fair enough that takes you hours to get there. And you \u2019re far enough away so you ca n\u2019t see or hear Male. As the boat pulls up to the dock you are welcomed by a traditional drum and welcome committee. You are greeted by name and they continue this for the remainder of your trip \u2013 which is impressive. They took us for a quick tour of the island via golf buggy and then took us to our room. We had a beach bungalow on the sunrise side we definitely made the right choice. If you have small children I do n\u2019t recommend the water villas as there \u2019s no walls separating your little ones from the water. You may want to check with the hotel prior to booking to see what side is catching the wind as it does change. We were lucky in that we were on the calm side of the island which meant we were able to be outside in our pool and on the beach without facing strong winds. Also the water was much calmer so you could actually snorkel or even just see the fish by standing still. The beach bungalow was brilliant. We purposely chose it instead of the pavilion as we knew to expect rain and wanted to have enough space inside in case we could n\u2019t go outside. We have a toddler so having this extra room worked perfectly. Now where the Four Seasons really earned extra points was in their preparation and treatment of our daughter. Everyone knew her name and in the room they thought of EVERYTHING. There was a crib with beautiful beach themed bedding and blanket as well as a small box with diapers swim diapers wipes and baby body wash. There was even a diaper genie in the bathroom. There was also a bottle warmer and fresh milk in the fridge. They had an infant menu as well as some fresh fruit puree in case she was hungry when we arrived. Amazing. It \u2019s the small things which mean the most. Now for the restaurants they \u2019re all amazing. However we spent most nights at the Kuda Grill as the staff there were wonderful. They made us feel special and their friendly treatment of our daughter kept us coming back. Special mention to Osy Jinan Melody Baha Dian Shawn and Husain. Ashamedly I never got the name of the FB Manager despite his regular visits and attention \u2013 he was also wonderful. For the food we enjoyed everything we ate but I would recommend going with a fresh fish which was caught that day and have it on the grill. The Sunset Lounge is also incredible as the view for the sunset is beautiful. You ca n\u2019t help but take incredible postcard like pictures. It cements that you \u2019re in paradise each and every day. We also took a tour of the Marine Center where they are housing rehabilitated turtles. They are doing great work and if you sponsor a reef frame the proceeds go directly to Kuda Hura to help them provide continuous care to these animals. Thanks to Tobias for the tour and explanation of each of the turtles. We bought a coral frame which they use to regrow the reef. They already sent us pictures of it and it is located outside the water villas. I ca n\u2019t wait to go back and visit it. As if relaxing on the beach was n\u2019t enough I also experienced the spa twice. There \u2019s a cute little boat that takes you across the small bay to the other island where the spa is located. They focus on the healing elements of the ocean and this is clear in all their products and treatment names. Both my treatments were excellent with the treatment rooms opening up with a beautiful view of the crystal blue water. For those with kids the Kids Club is highly recommended. It is well designed and well planned with many activities throughout the day. All in all it was an incredible holiday and the hotel was amazing. They found the right balance of relaxation with activities. You can be as lazy or as adventurous as you want and they seem to know how to cater to your desire. They took care of us and made us feel welcome from the moment we stepped foot on the island to the moment we got off the boat back at Male Airport.

All the restaurants are excellence especially the Reef Bistro is our definite favourite.

We spent 7 full days at this resort as part of our family vacation. The staff there are so accommodating and cared about us. Special kudos to the In Bungalow dining staff and chef who assist us in making special menu to our special needs son. This is so memorable and made us so happy. We stayed in the beach villa and it comes with a private pool and can have access to the beach. Perfect room for family with kids in my opinion. Breakfast buffet is great as daily they have new items offer so you will not feel bored eating there daily. My elder son just loves the strawberry milk with cereal. Another must try is their daily flavor of coconut rasbery strawberry protein shake and mango lasi. Also love the theme nights buffet and we tried the Kuda grill and the Asian theme. Joseph Ashley Kiki are great and always engaging with us. For sure Giovani is running and leading a good show there. Front office Ahmed and Suzu cared about us and gave us great tips and ensure we have a flawless stay. Max the Director of Rooms is very kind and humble and always ensure and ask if our stay is fine. Lisa and her staff in the kids club are great and cared about my son and just allow him to run around and played with all the toys. Thank you so much. My wife did a SPA treatment and she said it was a wonderful experience as welWe enjoyed the dolphin cruise the tour of the Maldivian village and also the recreation activities at the resort. Impressed with the funny crab race and the feeding of the shark. Learned about taking care of turtles at the resort too. Lastly special gratitude to the general manager Mr Randy and the most helpful Ms Chanet who ensure we are well taken care of and introduced us what we can do at the resort. Again thank you so so much for all the arrangements and this is the best family summer vacation for us.", "offset": [419, 467], "date": "2019-08-08", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "9390324b-f3ad-4040-9108-ccf5cab20467", "sentence": "Incredible way beyond a 5 star experience. We recently stayed at the Four Seasons Kuda Hura for a week to celebrate my wifes special birthday and take in some time in the Maldives for a beach holiday. I have gone into a fair amount of detail in this review as a Maldives holiday is a big decision. But for quicker reading the summary below helps. If you are looking for a beach holiday that surpasses your expectations in every way then the Four Seasons is the perfect way to do it. It goes way beyond the luxury of the property itself every person goes out of their way to ensure you are having the time of your life. every minute of every day. We arrived as guests and left as a part of the family. Beyond the physical amenities and the incredible gastronomy of this resort what makes it truly special is the staff. Without exception everyone we encountered went way beyond our exepctations of a top class resort. it is very clear that this is something they pay attention to and everyone is personally accountable for making that magic happen. We had several opportunities to observe the team at work and what stood out was how that management team remained visible and active whether it is helping with daily duties no matter how menial or interacting with guests during each meal and during the day. If there is one thing that sets this resort head and shoulders above the rest it would be this. This is not our first stay at a Four Seasons property but it is by a large margin our best Four Seasons experience to date. ArivalWhile the airport itself is nothing to write home about the Four Seasons experience begins once you are through customs. We were escorted to a Four Seasons lounge and could relax while our luggage was transferred to a speedboat. The transfer to the resort then takes about 35 minutes whereafter you are welcomed to the resort by the management team. Villa style AcomodationWe stayed in two different villas the sunrise water villa and the sunrise garden villa. Both rooms are incredibly luxurious and I think it is a personal preference as to which view is preferable. The sunrise villas are identical to the sunset equivalents but on the opposite side of the island. Our rationale was that the best way to enjoy sunset is with a cocktail in hand meaning we would be watching it from the Sunset Lounge. we are happy with our decisionWe enjoyed having the 2 different rooms. Unles you are certain of your preferences opting for a few days in each is a good idea. Just remember that you are then packing up your hotel room mid way through your stay but the luggage transfer process happens seamlesly behind the scenes. Villas are spacious and sumptious. Each had a super king bed generously sized TV which you should never need Bose sound system complimentary Nespreso and tea making facilities and walk in closets. The bathrooms are amazing double basins supersized bath as well as indoor outdoor showers. The private pool is indulgent and lovely. The outdoor area around the villa has at a minimum sun loungers a day bed under a gazebo and a general area to enjoy the sun. Rooms are serviced twice a day as can be expected in a property of this category. But what I appreciated most was the attention to detail. Normally evening turndown focuses on just that the bed and a pair of slippers. At Kuda Hura I noticed how outside towels were refreshed clothes were neatly folded and one evening my book received a Four Seasons bookmark too. Pools and public areasKuda Hura is located on a fairly small island which means everything is in easy walking distance. Grounds are immaculately maintained. In addition to the private pools at each villa there are 2 main pools one of which is for adults only. The all access pool has a swim up bar perfect for when the need cocktail now impulse kicks in. Sun loungers are available around both pools and on all beaches. These areas are serviced which was welcome. And every few hours someone does a tour of duty with a smoothie or ice lolly of the day. The final daylight hours are best enjoyed from the Sunset Lounge near the lobby great cocktails with an amazing view. Alternatively the Reef Club bar is an outstanding alternative. The cocktail menu is limited but the team will make absoutely anything you prefer or will get creative when you ask them to. WiFi is offered throughout the resort including on our boats to and from the airport. Unles you pay extra it is adequate for email and messaging but not really video calling. RestaurantsThere are 4 restaurants on the property. All are excellent. Some nights offer a fixed menu while other nights are a la carte. I had recommend you spend a little time planning your evening dining when you arrive and make sure you try to get the right blend you are looking for. Breakfast is a lavish affair with a wide variety of global options. We enjoyed venturing beyond the full English into some of the oriental options on offer. You can expect to see a full selection in continental buffet cheeses cold meats fruits etc. The pastries offered each morning are out of this world expect to find several varieties of croissants danishes muffins doughnuts and other goodies. Eggs waffles and pancakes are cooked to order. A highlight for us was the juicing station also freshly prepared. Lunch is available at 2 restaurants. Alongside the adults only pool is Reef Club which offers Italian cuisine. You can expect fresh pizza pasta salads fish and the like. Portions are generous so consider having a starter and mains to share. The calamari is a winner. Alongside the larger pool is Cafe Hura where the breakfast area is set for lunch. Expect to see more international options on the menu. The highlight included fresh fish of the day and the lobster crab pasta. Presentation is superb and food is excellent. For dinner one is spoilt for choice. And every option is excellent. The Kandu Grill is an upmarket grill expect to see red meat fish and shellfish. The Reef Club transforms into an upscale Italian bistro overlooking the pool. Barabaru offers some of the best Indian food around. Finally Cafe Hura offers a more international menu complemented again by fish and shellfish. I had suggest you try them all you can not make a wrong choice. Every night were were overwhelmed by the selection. In particular the fresh seafood bought from local fishermen is moutwatering. In all restaurants for all meals presentation is world class. Portions are generous by European standards but it is worth indulging in at least 2 courses. Your waistline might not thank you but your tastebuds most certainly will. The wine list is generous and the selection by the glass will not disappoint. In addition the team can make any cocktail you choose. For the birthday evening we decided on the private BQ for our 2nd night at the resort. If you are looking to indulge this is the perfect choice. The team had created a private dining area on the beach and we had a dedicated chef and server for the evening. As for the food. some of the best sushi I have ever had made from locally sourced fish followed by shellfish fish and tenderloin. Dessert was equally impressive. Hint. if you opt for the BQ make sure you arrive hungryFitnes RecreationThe 24h fitness facility is generously appointed with weights and a good selection of cardio equipment. Sunrise yoga is lovely. Being an island there is a great selection of complimentary and paid for watersport activities. There is a lovely area on the sunrise side of the island for snorkeling which was always teeming with wildlife. We used the kayaks on the sunset side and were fortunate to see quite a few stingrays in the shallow water. The excursion to the western side of the athol to take in the turtles is well worth the time. Whatever your preference there will private or group activites to suit. Being in the Maldives it is essential to take in something to observe the marine life and the Four Seasons provides amazing options. Taking some time out when you arrive to plan any activities is well worth it as not all activities are available every day. SpaThe island spa for which the resort is renowned was being renovated while we were there. Temporarily the Four Seasons team had built Garden Spa which occupied a few of the garden villas. We thoroughly enjoyed their signature massage but opted to spend most of our time on the beach or around the pool. Environmental PolicyI was pleasantly surprised to see the steps being taken to reduce environmental impact. In particular bottled water still and sparkling is made on site in reusable bottles. Also shower gel and shampoo do not make use of plastics. The Four Seasons also plays host to one of 4 turtle rehabilitation centers in the Maldives. They run education programmes for kids and adults and have a team dedicated to protecting this important species. Finally the hotel supports a coral regeneration programme. it is not news that that the Maldives has suffered from the impact of coral bleaching. This tragedy is also evident during snorkeling. But the positive impact of the programme is also visible. We enjoyed spending time with the team to hear about their programmes and it is clear they appreciate the support of the hotel too. Special MentionsFinaly the resort hosts a behind the scenes tour. If you are interested in seeing how the magic happens this is well worth the 90 minute investment. I found the scale of operations astounding. Clearly the resort does not have city conveniences and yet still have to provide a first world experience. And that takes a lot of work. I was able to observe the staff dining facilities the engineering facilities including power generation and water desalination and finally the food storage preparation and kitchen areas. Clearly providing a world class dining experience where you require military style logistics is quite an endeavour. And it has to be matched with a team that can prepare everything on site. And that includes a bakery that operates 21 hours a day. And FinalyAs mentioned above the stand out is the entire team and how well they work together. To experience it as a guest is very special indeed. There are a few folk that stand out to us in ensuring that our experience for 1 week was truly a slice of heaven on earth. These are Razaq in the Recreation team Amito in the restaurant Danu the resident cocktail magician the servers Mohamed Das and Rajendra Branka Maximilien Giovani and Joseph. Aflah and Tamil deserve special mention too for ensuring our BQ evening was so incredible. And these are just the names we could remember but should not be viewed as a slight on those we do not immediately recall.", "offset": [2334, 2404], "date": "2019-11-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "220d43c9-b7f3-45de-a131-c94eb74639ba", "sentence": "We love the Four Seasons.
