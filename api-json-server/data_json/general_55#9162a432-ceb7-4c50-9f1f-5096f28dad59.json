The Muse is a renovated ultra chic funky boutique hotel full of its own personality. As world travelers we have seen many hotels of various types and we generally like modern. This hotel ticked most of our boxesThe hotel is very close to Times Square and is a central location for absolutely everything. Theatres shopping sightseeing are all easily acceptable by subway bus or taxi. You are greeted by a very competent staff who are so friendly that they almost treat you like a personal friend and no request is too big or too small. The big difference at this hotel is that the staff really care and want to make your stay as pleasant and worry free as possible. In short they have an excellent customer service atitudeEvery room is a different shape and design and all have funky touches such as his and her robes in Cheetah and tiger or zebra designs. The rooms are all spotless but ask for a quiet one facing the back of the hotel if noise bothers you or you could bring earplugs. There is a room safe in each room and in an effort to save paper the television guide is on the TVThe beds are really comfortable as are the pillows different types of which can be requested. One strange anomaly we found was that the bed sheet folded inside the bed as opposed to over the covers. our only little irritation. Book directly with the hotel and definitely join the reward programme as after your first stay.

Let me begin by saying I have been a loyal Kimpton customer for coming up on 20 years. I have stayed all over the US multiple times in many spots for both business and pleasure. This was our first stay at The Muse. Our stay itself was unremarkable. Not my favorite of the Kimptons I \u2019ve been to but certainly no problems to be upset over during that time. We stayed for two days valeting our car for 55 night. We checked out on June 15th. On July 26 I received in the mail to our home address notification of a 125 NYC parking violation dated the day we checked in to the hotel for the offense of parking in the hotel loading zone. We left our car with the valet almost two hours before the time of the ticket. The ticket had been removed from our vehicle while in the care of the valet so the first notice I received was in the mail. Not very happy they tried to hide it. I called Kimpton \u2019s 80 number and explained the issue. They transferred me to the hotel itself. Hotel employee asked if she could help me. I then asked to my dismay did n\u2019t the person I just spent 10 minutes on the phone with tell you why I was calling. Oh yes she says. No apology from her about the situation though. Gave me her email address to send the ticket to which turned out to be wrong so email bounced back. I call again so she sends me an email so I can reply to it. I send the ticket. This time I get a \u201c so sorry for that \u201d and she \u2019l let me know when the parking manager takes care of it. 12 days go by. Crickets. I email her yet again and her solution is to copy the parking manager who I have now figured out is a third party contractor on the email to let me deal with the parking company directly telling me to contact her yet again if I need further help. I respond to her by requesting to speak to a hotel manager. No reply. Two additional phone calls on my part with parking manager plus a long call with NYC parking bureau and I independently verify ticket was paid. In the meantime Kimpton front desk manager forwards me an email from the parking contractor that they also verified it was paid. I reply again reiterating my request to speak to a hotel manager. Almost a week has passed since my initial request. In this time I flew to the west coast and completed a stay at another Kimpton and am now back in the east. Yet still no phone call from NYC hotel manager. Nor did front desk manager respond to either of my emails requesting the contact. What poorly executed customer service. And how disappointing from a hotel chain that I have been a loyal customer to. I feel like I am a fairly laid back traveler but not happy about Kimpton knowing that that violation was concealed and then making me follow up dropping it in my lap. And how about a sincere apology. Cherry on top is ignoring not one but two emails. As the old saying goes the lack of response is my answer.

Based on the hotel reviews we were looking forward to staying here unfortunately from that point onwards the service received at this hotel is the worst I have ever received plus the breakfast prices are extortionate for the available food options. My partner returned to the hotel to check in alone but the check in service was awful. My gf was simply given the room key no friendly welcome and no information about the hotel amenities or area. Instead of offering any assistance with the two luggage bags she was simply told the room number. When I arrived to the counter I explained it was my partners 21st Bday and thought it would be nice if we could return to the room after midnight with the balloons banner and cake I had just bought. we have stayed at so many hotels where they go out of their way to help celebrate anniversaries and birthdays yet this is the ONLY hotel where they wanted to charge a rediculous amount of money just to put some balloons in a room. I did not feel like a valued customer at all. One evening we noticed the fire alarm must have been faulty or running low on battery because it was periodically beeping loudly. I asked if it could be looked at but at 050 in the morning the beeping started again. When I spoke to the staff in the morning I was reassured the issue would be fixed the second time. When we returned to the room in the evening we noticed they had simply removed our ceiling fire alarm and one was not replaced for the remainder of our stay. I was delighted to hear I had 50 dollars of credit left on our last morning one of the things we never knew about because the staff never told us we had 10 dollars of credit per night. So on our last morning I thought we had have breakfast at the hotel. I was surprised for the 2 of us the 50 dollars still did not cover breakfast and we would have to pay an additional 13 dollars because of the additional charges the breakfast food options at this hotel are seriously limited for what they charge you.

You are told that 10 will be deducted from your mini bar or bar bill as part of this but as a bottle of water costs 10 there is not really much you can get from the mini bar without spending more money. I prefered when they used to give the 10 voucher and free wifi as part of the loyalty programme as it felt like something special. It seems a rip off and a way to have slightly cheaper rates. The service was great but a constant issue with all of the hotels on this trip was not preparing for the number of guests on the booking.
