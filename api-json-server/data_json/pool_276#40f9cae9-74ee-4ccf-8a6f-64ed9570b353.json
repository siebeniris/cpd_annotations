You are on the river walk and it is spectacular. The rooms are very comfortable and the amenities are nice too. They are fairly quiet but you can hear your neighbors at times. The shades keep the room dark and the environment seems good. Now on to the bad. 1. I have never seen elevators this slow in a property this busy. This really needs to be addressed. 2. My room was not serviced two our of four days. 3. service in the Great Room bar was pathetic. So I would recommend dining and drinking elsewhere. Give yourself ample time to allow 20 extra minutes for the elevators. The pool and fitness center are fantastic and when the concierge club is open it is very good too.

My boyfriends company is working at the convention center for the week. I decided to tag along for part of the stay to have a little mini vacation. The property is beautiful. The location is perfect.

We plan on seeing the Lightening game on Tuesday. Amalie Arena is literally RIGHT across the street. It is so prefect. You have to valet and it is 24 dollars for overnight. If you come prepared for that it is actually awesome. I can see why someone would be upset if they did not know that before hand. The front can get really busy and congested I recommend calling ahead and having them pull your car up for you. It is worth it and really stress free that way. The only downside for me is the fact that the pool is closed. I did see a review on here before we came stating that the pool was closed. I was hoping it was just the pool itself and not the whole deck. But it is the entire area. I believe they are resurfacing and making it nicer. You can not really complain they are improving so. You are allowed to use Embassy Suites pool. It is a Spa Swim Pool. it is 104 degrees all year round. It got a little cold the days I was here so it actually worked out really nice. It is located on the 3rd floor rooftop. They have about 30 lounge chairs and a few tables. It was not busy at all so there was plenty of room. I would LOVE to come back when the pool renovations are done. The pictures of it before reno look amazing so I can not imagine how great it will be when done. As for the room it is pretty basic but nice. There is not a fridge or microwave just a cooler that keeps drinks around 50 degrees. I believe you can request a fridge though.

They do have a cooling box in the room but did not get cold enough for the meds. Probably okay for fod40 50 degrees.
