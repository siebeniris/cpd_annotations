I was looking for a location relatively close to Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. Since the Downtown Hilton was priced too high I chose the Homewod Suites. The stay there was excellent. Clean comfortable and spacious suite well supplied. Five minute walk to bus stop. 30 minute walk to Pearson Air Museum and Fort Vancouver. The bus provided access to Downtown Vancouver. I liked the location of this hotel and there were restaurants nearby. Note that the lobby breakfast area is under reconstruction but there is a temporary setup which worked just find.

We were having a good of our daughters friends meet us in Portland for her 21st birthday. This hotel was a good location for both the travelers by air and car. The hotel does provide free airport pickup and drop off but it must be arranged at least a day in advance. Parking is available and free for the cars. make sure not to park in a neighboring business area and only in the hotel parking. The rooms are the standard Homewod Suite setup. Clean and well appointed. If you need additional chairs for the table do not be shy and ask housekeeping for the chairs. The staff were really concerned when we told them it was for a 21st birthday celebration. they had images of the 20somethings hanging from the rails and loud music disturbing guests. Well this group is much more mature and tame. They are gamers and when together played video games and did not actually drink alcohol at the hotel. The hotel is well placed to access Portland north east and downtown. our plan was a McMenanins Pub Crawl for the weekend. Our designated driver drove the 12 person van. We visited the McMenamins Edgefield the first night which has 10 built in pubs and food establishments in the hotel. We purchased the McMenamins Passport for our daughter. Yes this is a must see. We visited Powells and prowled around Portland. We then had a pub crawl of 15 McMenamins pubs. They have over 45 in Portland alone. All unique and very NW. The foyer and breakfast area are currently under renovation. However the hotel manages a nice breakfast on a heated and enclosed patio area.", "offset": [1528, 1607], "date": "2015-02-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "restaurant"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "fc68f31b-8e39-4b23-ae52-03e384730f5a", "sentence": "It was nice. It was very clean and nice but not quite as nice as I had hope it was our 26th anniversary. Picture of course showed a beautiful river view. Well If I stood in the bedroom and looked between two tree I could glimpse the river. Bed was a little stiff however the pillows were very nice. The forced air heating blow to much cold air at you room said 70 degrees but the forced air made us chilly when setting on the couch or in the chair in the living area. The complimentary wifi seemed to work very well for my purposes mostly email and social media. Bring you own toilet tissue. theirs is a step above gas station grade. Who ever was above us stomped back and forth all evening and we kept hearing doors shut. Having the kitchen was very nice and there was salt pepper sugar etc. supplied. A nice touch was microwave pop corn which we fixed while watching a movie. Also in the kitchen there was pretty much anything you would need including wine glass dishes bowls silverware cutting board There is even a dishwasher.
