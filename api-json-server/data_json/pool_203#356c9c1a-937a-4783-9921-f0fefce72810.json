No. We did not have the room key anywhere near our phones. Room. The Room was clean but had a funny smell. No view at all the reason I come to Chicago and just so so. No big deal we will make the most of it. After all we are here to see our friends at the pool. So after a quick change we are off. Our friends were not there yet so we swam for a little while and then went to lunch. Returning after lunch the odd smell was still in the room. I was now able to place the odor maybe mildew.

Back to the pool for funSwiming Pool Fiasco As we were approaching the pool two of our friends kids were standing outside the pool area just inside the door shivering. I asked why they were there. They said the pool attendant kicked us out. I asked what did you do. Nothing she just said we can not be here without an adult. I completely agreed with that and told them I was sure it was liability. But I am here now so it is fine. Boy was I wrong. We walked in and immediately this woman walked up to us and said No way. I know what you are doing and it is not going to happen. I was shocked. She attacked. She yelled at me so loud the other guests at the pool turned around to stare. I said it is okay they are with me. She shouted that I was lying. I said I will assume complete responsibility for them. She asked are you their parent. Well No. You have to be their parent. That is the rule. She said I will call security. I said please do. I sincerely wanted someone else to be there to calm her rage. I hoped security would do that. The girls were than kicked out. I called their Mom immediately to tell her what happened. She then stood about 10 feet away from me heckling my phone call. She was talking loudly enough for all guests to hear saying. Go ahead and twist the story. I see how you are. I know your kind. I not only wanted to leave but I was embarrassed and my children were mortified. We just wanted to relax at the pool and watch fireworks. I chose to ignore her hoping it would calm her down. I tried to focus on my kids and quickly called my husband. He is a minister and is always very comforting and positive. I saw security speaking with her for a few minutes. They seemed to calm her down. I decided to just blow off the situation and relax. Until. As it started getting darker my daughters needed a towel. Guess who that had to get towels from. Yep. She refused to give my daughters a towel. She told then to get towels from the room. I looked around at all of the people with pool towels. I did not want another scene so I decided I would go to the room for towels. As I was passing her on my way out she handed 2 nice big pool towels to another guest right in front of me. I gritted my teeth and reminded my self to stay calm and do not stoop to her level. I asked for some towels please. She held her hand out in front of her face and stated I am not talking to you I do not hear you she kept on repeating that as she walked away. Are you kidding me. At this point my anger turned to such emotion I could not hold back. I quickly left the pool to get towels from the room. I called the front desk to ask them to please bring more towels to the room because I had to use mine at the pool. They stated that there were towels at the pool. I told the very nice man what happened and he was shocked. I went back to the pool with the room towels and told the kids it was time to just leave. This is when Tyler came. He wanted to hear exactly what happened and apologized profusely. He and I talked about travel and SCUBA and he was very pleasant.

When I pulled up to the machine to insert the card it would not take it. I tried again. Now there are people behind me. I hit the assistance button. After about 2 minutes they answer. I explain what is going on. I even said I just paid Ruby for this. She said she will have to check it out and please hold. Now people are honking.

The hotel staff were great. The room was okay. it is an older hotel that has been renovated. My boys loved it. Only issue was at the pool on our last night. Some young adult girls were at the pool and wereloud. They were playing music from their phone and personal speaker music with illicit lyrics. No one said anything because the girls had obviously been drinking. There families with small children and couples etc nearly 25 people outside of them present. Security came at the end when the pool to close the pool. Last older building have older elevators. The elevators were slower and caused tremendous lines. Now those cars need modernizing again.", "offset": [234, 287], "date": "2019-08-11", "cpt": "9", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 60, "uid": "b293af84-ac92-4ccc-a1a6-0688cb29ebba", "sentence": "Great location comfortable rooms. The location is wonderful a few minutes walk from Navy Pier the lake the river the shops and just about everything of interest on Magnificent Mile. We had 2 very comfortable spotlessly clean queen rooms each with 2 large beds on the 5th floor 507 51 same floor as the outdoor pool. As we visited in August it was a great bonus to have the pool so we could spend a few hours relaxing most afternoons following sightseeing. We were slightly puzzled though that the pool bar was closed most afternoons. it was open on the day of our arrival but not again during our stay as it would have been great to enjoy a cool drink by the pool. There was a delay checking into one of the rooms on arrival a bit irritating because I had arrived after a 9 hour flight just after 3 pm check in having advised the hotel that I was likely to check in at about 3 pm and I was then greeted by a very grumpy and unhelpful male receptionist when I tried to collect my keys about 415 however the manager Caitlin handled my complaint very graciously so no hard feelings and I had definitely stay again. We were pleased we chose this hotel for our 4 nights in Chicago.
