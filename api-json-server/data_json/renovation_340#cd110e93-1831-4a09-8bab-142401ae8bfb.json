Arrival went well offered tea on arrival and room ready much earlier than check in. This was a bonus after a 14 hour flight from London. Room was on ground floor with locked gates to access in order to prevent tourists accessing the hotel areas. Room smelt a bit damp on arrival and appeared to be somewhat dated. Bathroom was large well provided with towels etc. Older style TV enclosed in cabinet. Room had a smaller lobby area with a table chairs and sofa. Colonial shutters on windows gave the room a very old fashioned colonial feel just what we had wanted. I had booked an evening meal in the Raffles Grill in advance and on arrival to the room a confirmation card was provided although I had received an email prior to our trip which stated that the Raffles Grill was closed on Mondays and our booking was changed to Long Bar Restaurant. but as the confirmation card was in our room I thought that the Raffles Grill would be open. We went out to explore Singapore then returned late afternoon and changed into our posh gear arriving at the Raffles Grill just before our reservation time. But restaurant closed. Went to Long Bar restaurant and felt very over dressed. This is a casual dining venue. After some discussion about whether we could still have the early bird meal rate as we had arrived after the allocated time due to the booking issue we eventually were seated. I chose the chicken while my partner chose the steak. Starters were OK. the soup was tasty however the main course arrived on a slate despite me having stated that I wanted a plate. Meal was taken away and re plated. Chicken breast was dry and hardly any sauce gravy provided. Then I noticed the fries were in fact crinkle cut oven chips. I challenged the waitress who admitted they were frozen chips. She offered to have my meal re cooked but I declined. Never shown the menu but asked if I wanted fish instead no mention of what sort of fish or how it would cooked. When I stated that I did not really like fish there was mention of lamb but again no details. In the end I sent the meal back. By now my partner had eaten his meal his comments were that the meal was just OK and not worth the money. We waited for a waitress to offer desserts but we were ignored. I had to ask for the bill and I made it clear that I did not expect to pay for my meal. Bill arrived no comments or apology made. We left after a terrible dining experience. Later we did enjoy a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar itself. Bed was not great sloped into the middle so not a great nights sleep either. Next morning we were checking out and we had been charged for the complimentary Singapore Slings and various service charges for the meal. I was asked is everything had been OK with our stay so I reported the issues about the meal and service. Raffles decided to remove the cost of my partners meal as they accepted that service was not up to Raffles standard. On my return they have still charged us for the meal service and tax. Not great. Reported issues to Raffles who state that rooms are being renovated and we were allocated one which had not been renovated yet. More apologies for meal but no change in bill. Overall disappointing and I would never have expected a 5 star hotel with such a reputation to maintain to serve frozen oven chips fries but still charge S 80 per head.

We recently ended a holiday with a three night stay at Raffles in Singapore. I wanted to stay at Raffles before it was closed for refurbishment and so was intrigued as to whether I would love it is old fashioned tradition and decor or whether it would be faded glory. I absolutely loved it and would encourage any one to stay here before it closes in December. We had a Palm Court Suite overlooking the courtyard and the room was fabulous. I loved the entry parlour and dining area the bedroom was huge and the bathroom was spacious. Yes we did experience a few plumbing issues shower going hot then cold and only hot water on our last day. but it all strangely added to the charm of the place. Our butler John was always on hand and he arranged for a complementary bottle of champagne for our wedding anniversary and our room was also decorated on our last night. Check in and out was a breeze done in our room and we were also given complementary Slings in the Writers bar on our arrival. Breakfast in the Tiffin Room was first class and we also enjoyed the curry buffet in the evening highly recommended. We were lucky with the weather and got to enjoy a couple of mornings around the splendid rooftop pool. the service up there both from the bartender and the delightful lady who arranged our towels and complimentary water was spot on. Finally we arranged the hotels 1962 Daimler to take us to and from the airport and this is something not be missed.

A four night stay in a State Suite 17 21 August in what is lauded as Singapores iconic luxury historic colonial hotel with a price to match was unfortunately far from what the marketing hype would have one believe. A very mixed experience in terms of ambiance and service was experienced leaving one feeling somewhat abused and neglected by the experience. It all felt like the luxury Raffles name has been cheapened by Acor down to something more akin to an MGalery Collection branded hotel. Service experienced was very mixed starting with my travel agent Virtuoso and myself sending independent email inquiries regarding my confirmed reservation only to receive the automatic acknowledgement email but no following email to answer the queries clearly the hotels email system is not working. I was greeted on arrival by the resplendent Sikh doorman and ushered into the main lobby. Rather than shown directly to my suite for in suite check in as expected I had phoned ahead and told my suite was ready I was sat at a reception area under the main staircase where I waited and waited with no refresher towel or welcome drink offered. After some time waiting with nothing happening I got up and wandered about the lobby until a butler finally came up to check me in only to be rudely interrupted by a hotel visitor with the result the butler switched her complete attention to the rude hotel visitor and wandered off with them showing directions leaving me abandoned on the lobby floor. Welcome to Raffles. I walked back to the reception area where another staff member completed the check in process. I requested to inspect a Studio Suite but was told they were either occupied or being cleaned. Despite saying I would not mind seeing an uncleaned one just wanting to get an idea of layout and view. this was refused. Arrangements were made for a butler to arrange a viewing the next day but this never happened. A couple of days later I requested at reception for an inspection but was told all were occupied a lie to fob me off as it turned out. and that the hotel was no longer selling the Studio Suites and I would not be able to inspect one. Why then are they still being advertised on the Raffles Hotel website. Later that morning my butler said she could show me a Studio Suite when I was ready she immediately took me and showed me a serviced unoccupied Studio Suite. Do not train your reception staff to lie to in resident guests to fob them off it leaves a very sour impression indeed. My most helpful and professional butler also gave me a glimpse at the still unfinished Sarkies Suite gone is all the magnificent elegant antique furniture and persian carpets and it now looks like some hideous gaudy upmarket brothel. black sofa with silver or gold speckles. bed with huge contemporary brass bedhead etc. History destroyed. Talking of history the silver beef trolley famously saved from the invading Japanese has been relegated to the store room perhaps never to grace the floors of Raffles again. Very sad. Check out experience was even worse than check in. Despite all confirmed for a butler to attend my suite from 130pm to check out for an arranged limousine transfer at 145pm I waited until 140pm with still no contact from any staff. I phoned to ascertain what is going on and a butler said he had come to my suite. I got sick of waiting yet again and commenced carrying my own luggage down to reception to check out only to meet a butler half way who ushered me down only to be sat down in the public part of the main lobby and wait and wait again presumably for a sheet of paper to be printed out. By the time check out was finally completed it was nearing 20pm. Fortunately at least the limousine was on standby and ready to go and luckily I was not in a mad rush to catch my flight or attend an important business meeting. It seems my check out was completely overlooked by the system. Such a shame as excellent service was also experienced during my stay. Special mention must be made of one of my butlers Claren who was very polished and professional with the service she provided. Ryan at the Tiffin Room could have been in any number of European three star restaurants perfect professional service to be highly commended. I used room service once which was promptly and professionally delivered. Butler Jeremy was efficient at delivering fresh milk for coffee in suite it must be the first hotel I have stayed in where no milk or creamer is provided in room of course preferable would be on call tea or coffee served by butler as used to be the case in Raffles and is still done at The Strand Hotel Rangoon or Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur for example. The restoration architects are to be applauded and commended for the magnificent restoration of the Raffles Hotel building beautifully accomplished. Modern technology airconditioning and lighting have been cleverly and seamlesly integrated into the historic suites and bathrooms pleasingly remodeled. Double glazing and soundproofing provide for a generally quiet retreat although the traffic noise can still be heard in the State Suites overlooking Bras Basah Road and thudding footsteps of those in the suite above can still be heard below. Marble and teak walkways gardens and courtyards have all been beautifully restored. However those in charge of interior decoration ought be sentenced to several dozen strokes for the unforgivable destruction of the grande dames classical and elegant colonial soul. Gone is the Raffles Hotel logo in the red entrance carpet colonial cane furniture on the front portico replaced with dull modern furniture of a style one would expect to find in an Ibis hotel a somewhat gaudy platinum coloured main lobby chandelier clashes badly with the elegant colonial styled brass coloured chandeliers elsewhere in the lobby the beautiful antique persian carpet in the main lobby replaced with a dull bland modern abstract patterned rug the same completely meaningless and out of character mass produced contemporary artworks hang in every suite abstract patterned carpets in the suites instead of say reproduced persian carpets in keeping with the colonial ambiance and so the list goes onThe beating heart of any grand hotel is arguably its dining room and bar. Those who remember the classical elegance of the Tiffin Room Raffles Grill and Writers Bar will reel in horror with what has replaced them. The Raffles Grill what used to be arguably Singapores most elegant colonial hotel restaurant has been replaced with a modern style bistro at fine dining prices complete with gaudy laser cut light fitting and devoid of table clothes with some tables so close you could bump elbows with neigbouring diners. The elegance of the former Tiffin Room has been completely guted and replaced with an ambiance more akin to that a of an upmarket food court stripped of crisp white table clothes and with tables so small the waiters have difficulty juggling tableware around to fit plates on the table. What used to be the most elegant haven in the Writers Bar is now a darkly decorated room which feels like ones in some modern Italian basement bar. The final straw would have to be the graffiti street art murals on the gleaming colonial white interior walls of the first and second floors of the main building completely and utterly absurdAnd yet the elegant Raffles Hotel monogram cutlery and silverware is retained a big tick for getting that right. The mix continues with the suite furniture elegant bedside lamps remain and there is a comfortable leather upholstered chair. but then a modern styled table and bland gray sofa with thin armrests which looks like it is from a cheap Novotel hotel. The whole hotel now feels like a modern day Four Seasons Peninsula or Mandarin Oriental Hotel plonked inside the historic shell of Raffles. Despite my protesting yes it is a comfortable plush modern day luxury hotel but this is supposed to be Raffles an icon of classic colonial elegance something which has now been completely lost by Acor. it is a pity Acor did not pay more attention to recent colonial hotel renovations in The Strand Rangoon another Sarkies hotel or The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur Majestic Wing that have been decorated with far more sympathetic regard to a colonial ambiance particularly the Majestic Hotel. Acor are misleading guests by claiming the hotel fully reopened on 1 August. The Bar Billiard Room was still not open and scraping down and repainting of the front wall of the hotel was still taking place at the time of my stay and most likely at the time of writing this review too. Scraping painting and use of strong smelling epoxy glue was evident in various locales about the hotel. The reopening seems very rushed in desperation to commence raking in the S with lack of preparedness and testing of systems and procedures. It all felt like the hotel was very much still in pre opening soft opening mode. The much lauded in suite iPad management system is an excellent idea and generally works well for operating lights curtains etc except that the night and day curtain buttons are the wrong way round as are the high to low fan speeds for the airconditioning check for yourself Mr Westbeld State Suite 265. The latter resulted in me having a somewhat noisy uncomfortable suite with roaring fan noise and blasting air in the parlour on what was supposedly low fan speed until I discovered the fan speeds had been incorrectly programmed and one had to choose high for low. The Acor Hotel group with their greedy eyes for profit were no doubt convinced by some consultant to adopt the in suite iPad management system with the marketing sell that it replaces the work of three people which of course is complete nonsense as I have never seen an iPad drawing a bath polishing shoes or making a pot of tea thus resulting in an understaffed hotel unable to deliver premium levels of service despite the eagerness and dedication of the service staff generally encountered. I utilised the iPad command to have butler call me or attend to my suite a couple of times but gave up waiting only to discover it is much quicker to pick up the ye olde fashioned telephone and dial 2 to speak directly to a butler if the call does not ring out with no answer as it did on a couple of ocasionsThe Raffles Spa facilities are excellent with helpful staff the sento provides a wonderfully relaxing soak and there are saunas and steam rooms. Pity the ice machine never worked for the whole five days of my stay. Breakfast was excellent in the Tiffin Room apart from the lack of colonial ambiance with what may well be the best pastries in all of Asia. Service too in the Tiffin Room was excellent particularly from Ryan as previously mentioned. Overall though a rather disappointing and saddening stay punctuated with some excellent experiences. One has the feeling Acor have cheapened the Raffles name and are price gouging on the Raffles name and history and celebrity chef name dropping to rake in the S rather than focus on actually delivering a premium luxury product for guests in this modern day and age I suspect they will probably sucedIf you are merely seeking a plush modern hotel experience in the shell of an historic building then you might give Raffles a pass subject to service levels experienced. If however you are seeking that unique special elegant colonial Raffles experience that modern hotels do not offer forget it you are too late. I suggest you book a Raffles view room in the JW Mariot Hotel Singapore South Beach across the road for a fraction of the price and admire the beautiful historic Raffles facade from there to retain your dreams or stay at the Majapahit Hotel Surabaya before Acor ruin that one too.", "offset": [4750, 4898], "date": "2019-08-27 00:00:00", "cpt": "1", "category": "renovation"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "fcfb428a-2484-4857-bc8d-ff5ac9b2e264", "sentence": "Raffles is as aways relaxing indulgent and an overall wonderful experience.

Visiting Singapore for 6 nights and one of the highlights we were looking forward to during our trip was a visit for afternoon tea to the refurbished Raffles Hotel.

I had pre booked and had noted the dress code \u2018 casual chic \u2019. so we decided to dress up given the standard we were expecting. Negative points1. No welcome to hotel upon exit from our taxi at the Long Bar entrance2. No clear signage from Long Bar entrance to the Grand Lobby where afternoon tea was served. 3. Underwhelmed by tier of cakes sandwiches. Did not have any wow factor as expected and small portions in comparison to other equivalent afternoon tea experiences4. Waitress mixed up our tea order which meant had the wrong tea and had to then wait for tea issue to be resolved with our food already sitting on the table5. For afternoon tea expectation is tea leaves served with tea strainer etc. Tea arrived in teapot already brewed and no sign of tea leaves bag at al6. Despite dress code on website and sign at main entrance stating \u2018 residents only \u2019 we witnessed many tourists standing in the main lobby feet away from our table dressed very casually taking photos. Did not create a refined dining atmosphere and we felt like we might as well not have bothered spending time to dress up for our visit with tourists being let in to take photos which is inappropriate. 7. After we finished the cakes sandwiches a basket was brought with scones for us to select 1 small scone each. This was a very strange way to serve afternoon tea rather than customers being given a tier of different scones with condiments. Almost seemed like they were rationing the scones. 8 Plates and cutlery were not changed between food servings. Positives1.
