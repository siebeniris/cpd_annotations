The 3 of us checked into the Crowne Plaza at Dallas Market Center location 117 119 the day after the icy weather so temps were pretty low. We walked into a very cold room and realized that the heat was not working. I go to front desk and Juan said he was sending a mechanic. Marvin arrived and apologized for the problem. After working on unit he said if it did not improve to let front desk know. Room was getting colder so I went to lobby again and spoke to another man shift change. He is unaware of the issue so I have to explain it all to him. He says hotel was booked solid and did not have another room but would send mechanic again. Marvin arrives and is very apologetic. He says he will have to leave us some space heaters in case heat does not work. it is after 1030 pm and getting ready for bed we realize there are no towels in bathroom. We call down and after finally more than 15 minutes someone answers and sends up towels. Heat never worked so we had to run electric heaters all night and this is a fire hazard. In the morning I speak to Kelly shift change who knows nothing about our problem. You would think by now all desk staff is aware there is no heat in room 403. I have to explain again. She says while we are out she is sending the head mechanic and if not fixed she will change our room. We return Thursday evening and ask Juan if our heat is working. He raises his hands up in air and said How should I know. You have to go into your room and if it is not working you have to call me. Wow thanks for your concern Juan. We walked into a warmer room and figure things are fixed. Getting ready for bed and again no towels. We call and get towels with holes. Around 1 am the room is cold again and Thank goodness heaters are still in there because not a single blanket is in room. So again we have to run heaters throughout the night. Checkout morning I speak to Kelly shift change and it is like she forgot there was a problem. We have to go through whole story about heat problem no towels no communication between staff lack of concern inconveniences and that our breakfast coupons were removed from the coffee table where we left them. Her response. Well you do not really need the coupons and sorry you did not enjoy your stay but we will be going through a billion dollar renovation and I promise your next stay will be better. REALLY. And how does that help the past two terrible nights. We were lucky the heaters did not cause a fire. The fact that we had to explain the problems repeatedly means our comfort was of no concern to anyone. At 165 per night this should have been handled differently. And taking one night off the bill does not make up for everything. We heard other people complaining about other things too and they were also not happy.

The ladies room was disgusting. Multiple stalls had toilet paper all over the toilets and it was dirty. I find a semi decent stall and proceed to go to our room. The elevator was dirty. We get to the room and after an 11 hour drive all I want to do is shower and pass out. I take a look around the room and feel so grossed out. I start itching because of how dirty the room was. The bathtub was rusted and the rest of the bathroom was dirty there was even a dirty looking towel on the edge of the tub. It looked like there was a blood stain on the lamp shade.
