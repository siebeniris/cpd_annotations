We arrived with 2 buses 100 high school kids from Pennsylvania. I arrived a day early so my stay was 3 nights. This hotel is very new and very pretty lobby. The large pool is just off the lobby and you can get a room overlooking the indoor pool. They only have balconies that are looking inside the hotel. The rooms are nice and very large. I had a king with a sofa. The elevators were amazingly fast. Are 130pm last night our two buses and two buses with a different school arrived at the same time. Your looking at 200 people to move to the rooms and 12 of our group was on the 7th floor. They only have two elevators working. We arrived at 130pm and by 145pm the lobby was empty. We were impressed. The rooms are clean and well decorated. The beds were very comfortable. Because you come in the room and walk what appears to be a bit of a hall way in the room to the room itself it seems to block any hallway noise. When sitting in the bathroom I could hear activities in the hall outside but when I was by the bed it was very quiet. it is a very easy jump onto the I93 into Boston from the hotel. We sent each bus at separate times bus 1 departed at 730am and arrived at the symphony hall at 830am. Bus 2 departed at 9 am and arrived at the Quincy Market at 920am. Traffic into town was at times terrible. I arrived a day early from the group and I took the commuter train to Anderson Woburn and it was about a 20 minute run from the city. The hotel has a free shuttle that came over to pick me up at the station about 5 minutes from the hotel. My only complaint about the hotel is it appears that housekeeping is not paying attention to details. They are cleaning the big stuff but the little stuff is not addressed. We had one room where the boy had backed up the toilet and left a note for housekeeping to please have it fixed. We were gone all day and when we returned it looked as it did when we left. How could the room be clean with a toilet that does not flush. I had a broken hanger in my room put a shirt on it and it just broke wooden hangar. well I left it on the floor by the door to the closet thought fro sure they would take it and bring me a new one nope it was still there when I returned that night. I also was sitting in the bathroom this morning and noticed that yesterdays dental floss was hanging on the side of the trash can. Now that is easy to miss as it is pretty small but if the trash can had been tipped upside down it would not have been there the next day. These issues are very small and barely worth mentioning it is just that the hotel really needs to get the housekeeping staff to pay more attention to the small stuff. The small stuff is what turnes to big stuff later. If your going to Boston and want a wonderful place to stay I would recommend this hotel as it is easy to get to the trains are easlily accessible and the hotel for the most part is very nice.", "offset": [948, 1065], "date": "2015-05-02", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "248c7037-2aca-4313-9488-b3d4b6450e65", "sentence": "Not a bad place not perfect.

I have stayed at this property several times over the months I am a Diamond Hilton member so I stay at quite a few Hilton brand hotels in the area for work. I have to say there are definitely opportunities for this property to really be one of the best hotels in the area but it really is not there yet. Business CenterMy first stay here I had a super frustrating experience with the Business Center where my presentation was printed on dirty paper it had someones boarding pass on the other side seriously and the printer was missing ink. I also had to pay to use the business center and the computers did not have updated software it literally used such an old form of Internet Explorer that I could only access Gmail in HTML mode. Thankfully the most recent experience was significantly better there was a working printer with all of the ink available and clean paper. The computers are still using an old form of Internet Explorer it is 2015. Update your software already but I was prepared for that so my blood pressure did not go up as it did the first time around. Printing a presentation for my meetings would be free at every other Hilton property in the area but I had to pay 7 for it here. Whatever it is what it is. Hotel GymThis has one of the better hotel gyms in the area. I am a huge fan of the updated treadmills. But none of the personal tvs work which is odd. HousekepingI keep my tooth brush in a cup whenever I am staying at a hotel. Housekeeping dumped out my toothbrush onto the bathroom counter when they were cleaning so that they could return the cup to the top of the fridge. That was ODD. And the chaise in the room was noticeably stained which did not make me comfortable to sit there. RomI highly suggest the executive floor with the lounge they offer breakfast and bottled sodas and waters throughout the day. I do not know why it would not be open at night but it closes at 10 pm.

I had love to entertain you with some witty anecdotes about this particular property but by and large it is so utterly indistinguishable from any other hotel you would stay at that it is not really entertaining at all. Unlike some other Hiltons whose bed quality is so poor you will need a chiropractor afterward the beds at this Hilton are actually of a quality that you could sleep in them. Though as with the rest of the chains the bedding does not come close to living up to the price you are paying per night for the room. Rooms are spacious but the hotel really shows its age when you step into the bathroom. Memo to hotel room remodelers you can remodel the main room all you want but if you do not redo the bathroom it is still obvious this is a 30 40 year old property. Restaurant food is adequate but overpriced which is par for the chain. Housekeeping does an adequate job of cleaning your room however the laundry is subpar as most towels in the room smelled stale and looked heavily used. Soundproofing between rooms unlike some other properties is above average. So if a quiet nights sleep is important to you get an odd numbered room and you should be ok. Under no circumstances however should you stay in an even numbered room. As with most Embassy Suites even number rooms are designed with balconies to face an open area that includes the pool which invites echoes from the bar area the breakfast reception area and the pool area below. Woe unto you if a gaggle of screaming children is in the pool while you try and sleep. Why Hilton tried to emulate a noisy design such as this is beyond me. Parking could best be described as mildly inconvenient despite the presents of a small amount of underground parking. The wifi particularly overnight is somewhat problematic and cuts in out at an unacceptable level for business travelers. If you do heavy off hours work that involves use of wifi for connection to external customer systems consider a different hotel. Like most Hiltons this is an adequate but overpriced facility.

Before I get there I will mention the fitness center met my needs and having a room on the 6th with the H lounge was nice. I had breakfast each morning after using the fitness center. The layout of the hotel is much nicer with the larger matador restaurant which I will try next time. These were my issues during the stay. I was in room 613 and the AC was n\u2019t able to keep the room cool and it was February. The fan speed setting did n\u2019t seem to do much good. I had many warm nights while trying to sleep. After my second night I had to work from the hotel in the morning. I had the \u201c do not disturb \u201d on the door until about 1230. I left for dinner around 530 and house keeping did n\u2019t come to my room yet. When I left I went to the front desk to let them know and it was cleaned when I returned later that night but I was concerned if it was n\u2019t done by 530pm and it may not have been done if a had n\u2019t said something. While I did use the fitness center which has adequate equipment the far right treadmill could n\u2019t get any TV reception. I basically stared at static for the during if my workout. When I went to the 6th floor lounge for breakfast I took 2 yogurts and got some fruit. Before opening the yogurt I checked the expiry which I always do. The yogurt was a couple weeks past expiry. The biggest issue is as follows. One day I was at the hotel most of the day. Around noon I was hungry and needed lunch. I actually went downstairs to see where I could get lunch. The main restaurant Matador is only open at breakfast and dinner which I can understand. There is another bar area and no one was there. I went to the front desk to ask what the lunch options were. I was told there is the \u201c grab and go \u201d which is a pantry type thing I \u2019ve seen at HGIs or \u201c there is a pizza place within walking distance \u201d. Not kidding. This is a full fledged Hilton. So after quickly deciding those two options would n\u2019t work I went back to my room. Room service was the answer. I looked at the all day menu and made the call. I said I \u2019d like to order room service and was asked the typical questions. How many people will be dining and what my order was. I said one person and I ordered the chicken bacon sandwich which said it is served with kettle chips. I forget the exact acronym it was called. I was asked if it was for pick up or delivery. I\u2019d never been asked this question for room service before so I said \u201c delivery \u201d. I mean it \u2019s room service. 15 minutes later there a knock at the door. It is a person holding a prepackaged sandwich in a plastic container. I take the sandwich in a little bit of surprise. No one asking if they can come in the room to set it up. No tray no silverware no napkin no ketchup mustard no salt pepper no glass of water nothing. Also no kettle chips that it was supposed to be \u201c served with \u201d. I later found out this was the prepackaged sandwich that is in the \u201c grab and go \u201d pantry and they just brought it to my room. Good thing I did n\u2019t want the sandwich with no bacon or no mayo or something. This is definitely not \u201c room service \u201d.

The lady at the reception was like a robot. No greeting to an elite member and she rushed to ask for last name ID credit card and the reminder that the breakfast was included. When the key was being prepared she picked a phone call and did not have a word to us afterwards. By contrast I was warmly welcomed and greeted at another Mariot property nearby earlier this year though I did not hold any elite status there2. As a benefit of elite member two complimentary bottles of water should be placed in room. This looks trivial but it really matters some time. We took a nap after check in and when we woke up we searched water in every corner of the room to quench the thirst. After checking with room service the answer was. yeah you are gold member so go to the lounge and take several yourself. Very reluctantly I took the elevator to the lounge at 6th floor yes we were not upgraded to executive floor. I have some really good experience with Hilton in recent years. Last months stays at Hilton properties in VA and DE were all fantastic. I do hope the management team improves the service and make the guests feel at home.", "offset": [1576, 1624], "date": "2018-05-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "ad0d29ac-f177-4737-9fe3-87bdb03a217d", "sentence": "Supportive and Accommodating Staff Excellent Service. Just a beautifully newly renovated hotel. I had originally reserved two rooms that had to be adjoining. I had my daughters 17th birthday party in Boston so we had several teenagers 16 17 yr olds that were occupying the rooms. Upon arrival we noticed that one of the rooms was leaking water. I went back down to the counter to let them know what had happened. They apologized and immediately upgraded my rooms and floor and provided us with breakfast which was not originally included. I completely recommend getting the breakfast. The freshly made options were prepared perfectly. Food was being refreshed every few minutes and it provided several teenagers with all different preferences and options that satisfied everyone. After returning from our night out in Boston the teens took to the pool which was very clean and not too Chlorine drenched as some hotels do. They felt comfortable with their surroundings and enjoyed taking in a quick night swim. I am pleasantly pleased with the insulation of each room. Having several teenage girls I was leery of their noise level and bothering other around us. I am pleasantly pleased that I did not hear their voices or their music in my room that adjoined theirs. Overall I would say that the Hilton is an excellent choice when looking to find a hotel that is near Boston for both business or pleasure needs.
