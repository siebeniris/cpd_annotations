This hotel is a bit tired. the headboard for my bed was actually peeling. and my robes were stained and there were some really strange noises that came from behind the walls almost like someone was swinging a pipe. I was at this location for a meeting. it is in a good location and the catering services were very good. Lots of local restaurants that you can walk to. Be prepared to wait for an elevator especially in the morning for a long time. what W did not consider was installing bigger elevators because they wanted to be hip. they apparently forgot about functional when you books so many conferences that in 1 case they were running sessions in the elevator foyer.

I love the W brand. The properties I have stayed at in LA and Chicago have been quite cool. They were full of hip style and awesome hotels. The rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable. They are just cool and hip. that is about all this W has. It is cool and hip. It is also dark dirty and loud. And ABSOLUTELY not worth the price. Stayed here only one night. Thank God we only stayed one night. It gets 2 stars and not only one due to the cool factor. Where to begin. This place is DARK. Even the rooms with their floor to ceiling windows are dark. Almost depressingly dark. The walls are paper thin with almost no insulation. We could hear the television from the next room. At 20 AM. And the pipes. let us not forget about the pipes. There was this knocking of the pipes that went on all night long. And the decor is VERY worn. See photos. Worn in places causing one to wonder how. The room had ketchup stains on the baseboards. The shower was hot then ice cold then hot then ice cold. As it was sold out we dealt with all this ridiculousness. Under normal circumstances I would have complained very assertively. Unfortunately all of Atlanta was sold out so luckily it was only for one night. The staff seemed to be put out. With check in check out valet etc. As a Honors member who was trying a proven Starwod brand I was quite excited as keyless entry was offered. The check in person said it was Just too much trouble and that I should just use the keyed system really. The most disappointing part was this. I expressed my discontent during my post stay survey as well as a direct e mail to the general manager during my stay Whose email was sent to me after check in to contact directly for any problems. I was basically patted on the head like a little schoolboy by Ken Rosenthal the Style Director and I have not heard a peep from the general manager. Abhorrent. And all this for 369. I could have and should have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental where there was availability for just a tad more but wanted the convenience. Next time I will drive in from Buckhead. And I am still waiting to hear from the general manager about compensation for my horrid stay. Look for the blue guy. I will be holding my breath. The only good is that we were within walking distance of Lure restaurant. Probably would not have eaten the best trout in my life had it not been for this stay.

Known as a party hotel and not without reason which might be good if you want to party but a pain if you are here for work. The service is not all that I asked reception to take my washing from the room at 730am but when I returned at 7 pm it was still there and when I called they asked me to bring it down and barely an apology. When you turn the shower on there is a banging behind the wall. probably some kind of pump the issue is that it continues even when you finish in the shower you also hear the banging from the shower next door even at 3 am. When I arrived there was a party of people leaving some young wannabe gangsters with hand guns clearly visible stuffed in the trousers not the ideal welcome. For running walking and playing there is a wonderful and safe park at the end of the road with some great trails for keeping fit. A nice touch when you return to the hotel from a run is that the concierge hands you a bottle of ice cold water thanks for this as in that heat you need it. You should take a room where the last two numbers are 15 or greater to reduce the number of people who need to pass your room. Rooms 1 or 2 on each floor are the worst as you can also hear the elevators all night. The bar at night is always busy and a cool place to be the service is good throughout the hotel in the main and aside of the one issue I had with the washing. The hotel is very dark inside including the rooms and communal spaces this is clearly intentional but often not practical when you are trying to find your way.

I was in Atlanta on business and during the week this hotel was peaceful and serene. it is funny how it all changed starting on Friday night when the solitude of this hotel changed into a party scene. On Friday night for example I had to fight my way through the crowds of people in the lobby to get to the elevator line to get to my room. Because the night club located in the hotel is open late both Friday and Saturday nights my associates who had rooms overlooking the front driveway where the valet is located did not get to sleep until late due to the noise of the partiers coming and going.

BUT a few hiccups. When you first walk into the W Midtown Atlanta you get the feeling you are in a \u201c cool \u201d place. The music is bumping the d\u00e9cor is modern the front desk people are \u201c beautiful \u201d. It has all the makings of a hip music video. All kidding aside first impressions of the hotel are nice. When I checked in I was helped by the best people. Faith and Sabrina were professional NICE attentive and helpful. Michael who helped me with my bags was also THE BEST. He would help me at other times during my stay and that was MUCH appreciated. During some check in times you may get lucky and get there to have a glass of champagne or a chair Massage. Both great touches. Once I was in my room I was excited by the large entry space. The mirror with sitting stool AND outlets good for doing hair in the morning and not in the bathroom. There was an \u201c open closet \u201d with a handy light that doubled as a great nightlight at night. The shower only bathroom had ample counter space and plugs. The room had a sofa and large windows and again ample plugs situated throughout the room. I liked that the TV and bed were not in front of each other but rather to the side. There was plenty of desktop space and even a small refrigerator. The air conditioner did n\u2019t blow air directly over the bed which was nice and the curtains closed all the way not letting in light in the morning. The property has two dining locations as well as a bar and room service. I was a patron of all. TRACE is the traditional restaurant. I ate breakfast there one morning. I do believe the food all comes from one kitchen so the service was godThe Lobby Bar also serves food and I had lunch there. Although there were only 3 tables dining the service was not very good. It was slow and I pretty much waited on myself. Getting up to ask for water ask to place my order and ask for my check. Room Service was great. I always placed my order on the door the night before and my food was always delivered at the time I ask for. The food was always hot AND ALWAYS tasted great room service TRACE and The Lobby Bar. The breakfast potatoes were Perfect. And the Grits were Yummy. The buffalo chicken salad I ordered for lunch was also very tasty. I did have some issues during my stay1. I asked for a small coffee maker for my room. It took 15 days to get the coffee maker and almost 3 days to get the coffee. I was told that there was no coffee in the hotel \u2026. ODD but that is what I was told. To make the situation worse \u2026 the first night I asked for the coffee maker I called 3 times asking if it was being sent up \u2026 I gave up at 130 pm and went to bed \u2026 NO coffee maker arrived that evening. 2. For the first 3 days the ladies on the other end of the \u201c whatever whenever \u201d line were not very helpful. When I would ask for the front desk they would tell me that I was speaking to the front desk \u2026 the only issue was there was a distinct difference in the front desk and phone people. The front desk people were considerable MORE friendly and accommodating. 3. There was construction on my side of the building. Luckily I was on a higher floor or the noise at 70 am from the construction would have been too muchI was there for a week and all in all it was a good stay. It could have been better had a few more things been taken care of better. A few more Good Things. There was a concert by one of the front desk people one night.
