There are a lot of good hotels in the downtown area that are great for exploring all the must see sites but we took advantage of SPG \u2019s Hot Escapes special and scored a rock bottom price that made the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown the clear winner. Even so we feel it was a good value even at the normal price. We arrived late and the lobby was really busy but check in was quick and easy. The desk agent was friendly and greeted us promptly gave us the scoop on where to go for light night nibbles and even wished me a happy birthday. Since it was late we opted to eat in the lobby bar. There were a couple of convention meeting groups at the hotel so it was busy but we found a seat quickly. Service was a slow though. Despite the crowd there seemed to be a wait staff of one. After that we relaxed in the comfortable lobby sofas and took advantage of the free Wi Fi there. Our room was on the Club Level which we appreciated we missed the evening hors douevres but there was an espresso machine in the lounge that would become my best friend. We did have breakfast daily in the Club Lounge which could be done better. The options were limited to scrambled eggs oatmeal a few pastries and some fresh fruit. The espresso machine was good but time consuming having a pot of brewed coffee available would have helped. Our room was unremarkable in that it is a typical Sheraton room but comfortable and very clean and the television and furnishings were in good condition. The bed was comfy cozy with big fluffy pillows but looked hastily made. I have noticed a trend towards loosely made beds rather than tight corners and smooth bedspreads. I ca n\u2019t say I \u2019m a big fan of this \u201c shabby chic \u201d approach to bedding. The desk was large and clutter free with outlets at the lamp and on the desktop itself. A comfortable chair ottoman and side table rounded out the room but the best feature was the view of a snow dusted Logan Square outside. Two things we found missing were an in room safe and refrigerator which would have been nice to have. But the closest we came to a complaint was in the shower once you switched from faucet to shower the water stream dwindled. It seemed that there was a lot of water pressure just not a lot of water coming from the shower head. The front desk was quick to send up extra supplies when we asked and the staff was super polite about everything. One amenity that we surely appreciated was free in room Wi Fi which was easy to connect to and reasonably fast. We did have trouble attempting to stream movies on a tablet but no problems streaming music on a phone or transferring files on a laptop so we are not so sure where the issue was. Free Wi Fi is not included in all room rates a policy we believe hotels everywhere should re examineOveral we enjoyed our stay. The staff was excellent and that far outweighed the few areas that could use improvement. In fact I would not even say there was a negative element just a little room to improve an already good experience.", "offset": [1370, 1523], "date": "2015-03-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b0ed6d46-c914-4124-8c4f-d39e983fb336", "sentence": "In need of some freshening.

The hotel was very nice comfortable in all of the ways that one would expect though I have stayed in other hotels that have failed to meet even minimal expectations. The room was clean very comfortable and quiet. My room was on the 23rd floor so I also had a fantastic view of the city. But mostly I would like to comment on the awesome service which was delivered by their amazing staff. Each and every staff member that I dealt with was super friendly and engaging but also very professional. Regardless of whether I was dressed in professional business attire or I was wearing my faded t shirt and jeans I was treated exactly the same they went over and beyond to meet all of my needs. For example upon check out I really needed to weigh my luggage because I was bringing home a number of heavy books and I thought that I was probably over the airlines 50 lb weight limit. I normally travel with my own luggage scale for just such occasions but I did not have it this time. I asked whether the hotel kept one handy for guests. The answer was No but let me see if I can find something somewhere that will get the job done. And that is exactly what he did. Then he spent 15 minutes or more helping figure out which items I needed to shift or remove from my suitcase so that I would not have carry more than was absolutely necessary. And the entire time he remained friendly and funny and never made me feel rushed.

Despite this hiccup they were quick to award me a decent number of Starpoints so I was fine with the room with 2 doubles. The room itself is very dated carpet is worn furniture is not in great shape and really just needs a refresh. The bed was comfortable enough but certainly not the best and not as good as the beds at most Courtyards. The rest of the room was functional even though it was worn. The hallway had an odd odor and needs a refresh. The lounge is very small for a hotel of this size but had a decent selection of beverages and snacks when I went.
