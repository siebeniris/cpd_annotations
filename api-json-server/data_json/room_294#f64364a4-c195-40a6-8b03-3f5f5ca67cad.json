The staff were all friendly and pleasant. The room we had was very nice but a bit dated. The beds were comfortable and our AC worked fine. There is construction going on but we were not bothered by it. The restaurant was a bit pricey but it was good. The pool area and lazy river was excellent. We had no problem getting chairs and towels as you have to give the pool attendant a towel key card to get towels and when you return the towels you get them back. Same thing applies at the beach. My negatives are that there was not much to do within walking distance but being right on the beach outweighs that.

First Impressions This is a hotel and not a resort. The front of the hotel was crowded and disorganized no one really greeted you. A decrepit looking fellow asked if we were guests and I was not sure if he was an employee or what. Sort of creepy. We did not have a car but the valet area was lacking they were not too attentive when you stepped out the door. This area always seemed chaotic. Lobby front desk. Front desk help was okay nice but not overly welcoming as previous reviews have stated. We asked them to get us a cab one night a full hour before we needed it and that caused some confusion no one really took full responsibility if one was even called. Luckily after 10 minutes of waiting one did appear luck perhaps. I do not know. Lobby has potential but something was lacking. maybe the frayed rugs. Just did not have that really polished look. Lobby bathrooms were closed for renovation. Our room was not ready so I had to change into my swimsuit in the pool area bathroom. Tight fit for me and my carry on in a small stall. Ugh not the greatest first impression. Outdoor restaurant. Had our first meal lunch overlooking the ocean. Desi our server a few times during our stay was very nice and accommodating. It was very nice being outside and eating with the ocean right there several yards from your table. However at one point I looked up and saw bright red spots on the upper beams as well as some chipped paint. It was a lovely eating area so the ceiling upper beams should have been up to par as well. The rocking chairs nearby on the porch overlooking the ocean were a nice touch. Beach. The beach is pretty but very narrow. Whether it was high or low tide it really did not change a thing in the width of the beach. Once afternoon comes the beach is crowded with lounges everywhere. We were here in early January so this was during the least populated time for the hotel no doubt. The sand was lush and plush but so much so that it was rather difficult to walk in the sand. To do a short walk was quite a workout and I consider myself in good shape. Not worth the effort the sand was kind of like quicksand. In January and winter in general the beach gets shady mid afternoon. Something for sun worshippers to think about. The staff at the beach was nice and they are helpful and accommodating in getting you a lounge chair drink etc. The pool The pool was nice but it is not that big and I can not imagine it being very accommodating during a more crowded time. Personally I think the Lazy River takes up precious space that could be used for a bigger pool. Tanya was an excellent waitress server polside. The drinks are expensive and a 5 oz. cup of wine is 12. Again like the beach the pool has a good deal of shade during the winter months parts of it in the morning parts of it in the afternoon as the building itself blocks the sun. The room The room was nice enough I was surprised we had an adjacent living room with a couch and loveseat and small table for two. The front of the room by the bathroom had tile on the floor which was nice. The bedroom and adjacent room had thick carpeting. While nice enough there were some stains on the carpeting and I think the carpet traps in the smells of the surrounding area basically the ocean. The room had a strong musty moldy smell to it and I kept the door to the balcony open as much as possible for some fresh air but the odor still remained. I realize that the ocean air is part of the musty smell problem but gee can not we do something about that. The two plastic chairs and table on the balcony were very cheap which is okay I suppose abut the dirt and grey stains on them were NOT okay. I put a towel on the chair when I sat on it. A simple wipe down once in awhile with a good cleaner would solve this problem. Inside the living area the leg on the table had chipped paint as did the TV cabinet. Just neglect that could be an easy fix. The bathroom was decent although the water was usually scalding when you first turned the bath on. At one point I looked up on the popcorn ceiling and there were little grey dust balls stuck to it in some places. Bar and Gift shop The bar is nice enough. There is not much to do at the hotel that being said it is not a resort. The gift shop is small and this is where you would go if you want to have a quick breakfast on your own. They only offer English muffins and bagels both of which are no where near as fresh as they should be. You can also buy coffee no juice. Coffee SHOULD be complimentary in the lobby. Whether it is a hotel or resort. The gift shop has no cans of beer or bottles of wine. You are on your own to either drive or worse walk at least a mile one way big mistake to a 7 11 or Walgrens for such items. There is no mini bar in the the room either so if you want a drink you need to order it via room service or go to the bar. While on the subject of walking there is NOTHING to walk to outside the hotel. The hotel is in the middle of condos no stores nothing within a walking distance of a mile or longer. That was disappointing if you wanted to just go for a walk and explore. Housekeeping We were on the 6th floor and our maid was sourly and unapproachable. Room was never made up before 4 pm. Restaurant. We ate at Ocean 200 it was dark and there were hardly any folks there probably due to the time of year. It seemed very nice and the food was great. We sat overlooking the outdoor patio but it was dark and all I saw outside was a vent so congested with puffs of dust it was gross. There were several construction items lying about as well. Not a thing patrons want to see view and it was very dark out to begin with. I can not imagine seeing it all in daylight. ugh. Service We ordered a bottle of wine one night and we also had a problem with our safe. Both times we were serviced quickly. Sightseeing I would recommend going to Las Olas Blvd in Fort Lauderdale. It was very nice. We ate at the sidewalk cafe restaurant Big City Tavern which was very nice. Nice street to stroll on and have a dinner out about a 10 minute drive from the hotel. One night we ate at Shooters which was on the intercoastal and about two miles north of the hotel. It was a very nice place outdoor seating etc. just a fun atmosphere. Amenities I would give the gym a D. It is very tiny and has your basic two or three cardio machines and a few weight machines. Mirrors on the walls to make it look bigger. For this reason this place is not a resort. There is no spa which I could care less about personally. gym is poor not many areas to see roam around in at all gift shop tiny bare basics. Overall My review goes up and down. It was a decent place but I have stayed at better and it is not a resort in my opinion. With some tweaks and polishing it could be more upscale it has good potential as a nice hotel. The cons would be it is small for crowded times of the year can not accommodate that many people. and the beach is very narrow and hard to walk on that was disappointing. Everyone talked about the construction yes it was a pain but they are trying to update so what can you do.", "offset": [5446, 5577], "date": "2015-01-18", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "871e9912-71d0-436d-a901-908e68b70f15", "sentence": "Lots to bike to.

We tried having a drink in the bar but the air conditioning was so cold we ended up sat outsidebreakfast for us was usually a bagel from the shop or off property. otherwise the lunches dinners that we ate at the hotel were bland uninspiring and in my view not good value for money. There are restaurants elsewhere but not within walking distance so this aspect was disappointing. The hotel is a long way from the main nightlife and shopping of Fort Lauderdale which in itself has positive and negatives clearly this makes it quiet but on the other hand you have to drive everywhere if you want a decent meal or elore Fort Lauderdale. The guys around the pool were friendly and helpful the pool itself and lazy river were very nice and very close to the beach. The final sting in the tail was upon checking out when about 150 worth of meals had been incorrectly charged to our room.

Our overnight stay was a 50th anniversary surprise to my husband and me from siblings an children. Upon arrival at 3 pm our room was not ready. They asked us to give them another 15 minutes. We sat outside in a rocker on a porch facing the beach. As lovely as that may sound with children running and yelling on the porch a power mower moving at full tilt right in front of the porch and some other monster piece of equipment making an unreasonable amount of noise. I was just about ready to blow the whole trip off. At 345 pm my husband went to the front desk to inquire as to the 15 minute promise. At 4 pm we were given keys to room 304. Room 304 made the whole wait a minor incident. It is beautiful. we have traveled extensively. we have never had a hotel room quite so spacious. The decor is done Key West style or old Florida. The linens are pristine white with sea foam blue green edging which is stunning against the wrought iron king sized bed frame. The room has full ocean view and a balcony on the side with full pool view as well as the ocean. Champagne J P Chenet and chocolate covered strawberries were delivered to our room about 45 minutes from the time we got to the room. No headaches from this champagne. It was excellent. The strawberry plate sported an orchid garnish so pretty. The service to the room was professional without being stuffy. A note on the tray said to put the tray outside the door and to call a given number to have the tray removed. We did and the tray was gone piste haste. We went out to dinner. We returned with leftovers. Our room is outfitted with a refrigerator to store those morsels. The room also is equips with a microwave oven and a coffee maker. A real hit for us was the lazy river. it is a winding canal of 3 ft deep water which you can easily walk. There is a gentle current to the water that helps to move you along. We walked around it a couple of times but really why walk when you can float in hotel provided intertubes. So relaxing and no kids at 830 am. Other couples were out enjoying the pool and the lazy river before moving on with the rest of the day. The hotel dining room was a lovely atmosphere comfortably elegant. Like most hotel restaurants the menu is a bit pricey. The best choice on the menu for breakfast is The Continental at 13. It includes fresh squeezed orange juice coffee. 2 pastries chefs choice cut up fresh fruit yogurt with granola topping and berries. it is really an amazing offering. We had a terrific 24 hours.

I was so looking forward to our stay at the Pelican Grand in the Sky Suite. I had stayed here before years ago and remained on their email list. I had open heart surgery to replace my aortic valve and almost died two weeks later due to complications that required a second surgery and a pacemaker. I got their email announcing the opening of the Sky Suite and thought it would be perfect to celebrate not only my survival but our 38th wedding anniversary. I am not a rich man three nights at the Sky Suite at 140 a night plus taxes and fees is six weeks worth of work for me. At that rate I was expecting perfection and found that the hotel needs work if they want to maintain this as a high end suite. I will give my opinion on each phase of the hotel and suite and hope they at least consider some of my points. Valet service was almost always flawless the only time we had a little bit of a wait was checkout on Sunday. They are limited by the space they have to work with but all the valets were very nice and efficient. Front desk check in was a breeze all the people were very nice though the young lady checking me out did not really seem to care when I said my stay was not the best after saying we had several problems. Her only response was sorry no offer to speak to a hotel manager or questions about what was wrong. One of the front desk managers came up to the room the first evening to see for himself the problems we were having. We were offered some considerations by the front desk manager that came to our room for all the problems but our anniversary stay was just plain bad. The room is advertised as having a private lift to the room but it is not what I was expecting. You take the regular elevator to the 11th floor get off and walk a few steps to your private lift. You wave your room card in front of the card reader and a blue light comes on press a button to call for the lift or open the door. Once inside you have to physically hold the 2 button the whole time this slow moving lift takes you to the 12th floor. Once the door opens you can let go of the button. The door to the lift opens directly into the dining area of the suite. There is no way of locking the lift out and three times we had employees come into our room uninvited. Expectation of privacy is an important thing in a suite like this and unles they do something to address this you will never feel comfortable that your privacy will not be invaded by housekeeping in the morning or turndown service time or if you are lucky enough to have your drinks restocked. I never felt like there was concern about this every time I was in the beautiful shower or in intimate moments did I not feel like at anytime someone could walk directly into our room. In addition to the lift there is a staircase to the room on the 11th floor landing. There is a slide lock in the suite on the door at the top of these stairs. We had to use the stairs to first get to the room as it took three different sets of room key cards to get a set that finally opened the door to the elevator. They need to come up with a way of securing your privacy in this suite I found it a major problem. Dining area a very large room with an oval table that had a very large floral arraignment on it. The rug under the table was very soft and comfortable to walk on. Kitchen area another area that needs work. There is a Nespreso machine with three coffee selections which is fine. The bad the mugs they supply you with are to small and overflow it makes you wonder if anyone ever tried to see if the machine worked. If you want some extra cream or sweeteners they are not supplied. The area is stocked with some complementary supply of water soda and juices but they are not refilled and unles you call someone. There are two types of stemmed wine glass but no drinking glasses. There was one set of silverware and a cloth napkin on the shelf under the counter I guess we would have had to share. I know these are minor details but it never should happen in a high end room. Living room area there is an L shaped sofa with some pillows a pole light that we could not figure out how to get it to work a coffee table with some books on it. A very course rug that was not comfortable to walk on in bare feet. I even got some of these course threads stuck in my feet. A rug like the one in the dining room would be so much nicer. The TV has a great crisp picture. But the remote is not always responded to. Even when the front desk clerk and bell man was showing us the room they had difficulty getting it to work. The TV frequently reverts back to the menu screen on its own. Sometimes to go back to watching tv you need to turn the set off and on several times before it becomes responsive again. There are a limited number of channels available. We had the same problem with the bedroom tv. There are no curtains on the slider in this room. The sun in the morning shines directly into the room making it uncomfortable to sit in until about 11 AM. Bedrom the bed is very soft not defective it just the type of bed its is. It was so soft it hurt my back and I ended up sleeping on the sofa two of the three nights. There are sufficient number of drawers for your clothes and a large closet with some hangers an ironing board and iron a small wall safe and the hairdryer was found in the closet in a bag. The ceiling lights like in all the rooms are dimable. Bathroom. shower what a disaster this was for us. The first time I took a shower the water was scalding hot especially on my surgical scar. At this time I had been awake for close to 24 hours and needed a shower to go to our dinner reservations. I could not figure out how to adjust the temperature and felt foolish but had to call for someone to come to the room. Almost three hours later the best the engineer could come up with was to remotely adjust the water temperature and call a plumber to repair the shower. We missed our dinner reservations and never did eat that night. We asked that the pumber come in at 11 am the next day as we were going to the beach until 2 pm so that would give them three hours to fix it. So we come back to the room at 2 pm and find the shower still in pieces and tools all over the floor. We had another hour of sitting around waiting for the repair to be completed followed by another half an hour for the hot water to be restored as it was turned off. The control was defefective and who knows how long it had been that way as the one engineer told me different guests would call about the water being too hot or cold and they would adjust it remotely like they did for me the first day instead of fixing the problem. The fact that it could not be controlled with hot or cold in the showers should have told them there was a problem and it should have been fixed. They supply you with different soaps and lotions. There were also three make up removal pads that my wife used two of the first day. They were not restocked. We asked the housekeeper that just walked into our room via the lift about getting them restocked and she said only the supervisor can restock them. what. They were never restocked. There are more towels and wash clothes that you could ever use. There are no drinking glasses to rinse your mouth while brushing your teeth. The sink is only about four inches deep and you could not fit a wine glass the only glasses in the suite under the faucet in the bathroom Drinking cups sure would be nice. The shower now that it is working you are welcome future guests is very nice. There are four small rain type shower heads in two locations. These can not be pointed toward the shower door or it will leak and flood the bathroom that is a whole another story. The shower has the ability to connect by Bluetoth to your enabled device so you can listen to your music while you shower. I did find you can not take a lengthy shower. The engineer from prior visits had told me the room has its own 30 gallon hot water heater and it is not big enough to give you hot water for much more than15 minutes. The shower is huge big enough for probably six people. There are two robes and slippers in the bathroom for your use. Hopefully they are washed but who knows. The deck it is huge the length of 5 balconies of the rooms under it. There is an outdoor shower and tub two lounges chairs and another set of chairs and coffee table. There is a table and chairs for dining but the table wobbled real bad another one of those attention to details items. I wanted to have room service on the deck but the table would have been useless. I wanted to call about it but my wife was so tired of having hotel employees in our 140 a night suite with us she would not let me so we never had a meal on this spectacular deck. The other problem was the deck apparently does not get swept. We had dead bugs on the deck the evening we checked in I figure they would be gone the next day. nope I guess I am expecting too much. I called to request to have the deck swept clear of the dead bugs that were there now for two days and was told by the housekeeper there will only one be others as they fall off the roof onto the deck. Another privacy issue arose with the deck. Keep in mind there is an outdoor shower and tub. One day at sunrise we have a drone hovering at our deck. In the evening we see two men controlling the same drone on the lawn on the beach side of the hotel. They are wearing long sleeve black shirts and red ties and appear to be either employees and or someone hired by the hotel to film the place at sunrise and sunset. No notice was given to us. If I show up in a promo for their place especially with what I was wearing in the morning there will be problems. Again no consideration for privacy on a deck with an outdoor shower and tub. The one night we were out there and housekeeping is in our room without our knowledge and knocks on the deck slider scareing the hell out of my wife. Luckily we were appropriately dressed at the time.

The property has a great location just north of the cruise terminal and right on the beautiful Atlantic coast. The building is clean and tidy check in and valet parking was efficient and the rooms were superb. To save on mile use we had rooms that were supposed to be city facing not ocean but on arrival they were on the side of the building so that you can see both. On floors 8 and 7 the rooms were massive with huge beds and a nice bathroom. As usual they were equipped with an over complicated hotel TV coffee maker air con and hair dryer. Storage space was limited and if you were here for a longer period you would struggle with hanging space. The bar was efficient but had a strange smell so we did not spend too much time in there. the hotel has a restaurant but we did not use it due to the excessive cost however we did have some bar snacks that were very good. Ice cr\u00e8me in the snack bar was also very good. The pool and lazy river are a major selling point of this hotel and both were clean and well kept with a good selection of inflatables to keep all entertained. The other major selling point is the deck out front with rocking chairs. This would have been great with the exception of 2 things. Firstly the wind which the hotel has no control over but secondly the noise. There was different background music playing on the deck to the lobby and the bar. this compounded with the live pianist or guitar player from 8ish to 10 made the environment unbearable especially for my mother who has 2 hearing aids. When sat in the lobby your senses were assaulted from 4 places at once and conversation was all but impossible. This was further compounded by the acoustics in the bar that amplified the din caused by a huge wedding party on Saturday night. I know that I am a grumpy old man but the noise was very bad and we resorted to sitting on our balcony for most of our stay. Luckily the double glazing was good and with the doors shut you could not hear it. All in all a good stopover hotel but I would not recommend a longer stay as the local area has nothing to offer. Aside from the beach bar next door the nearest restaurants are over a mile away too far to walk with elderly parents and if I go out I do not drink and drive.", "offset": [1322, 1394], "date": "2017-04-26", "cpt": "1", "category": "room"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "a59fe3e0-a6c8-4a3d-bba2-04dc21d8dec6", "sentence": "Potential but overall disappointed. We chose this property because we have stayed at a few of the other Noble resorts and I was really excited to check it out. Unfortunately Pelican Grand is falling short. Definitely not living up to the 45 rating here on Trip Advisor or comparable to their other properties. We had the most hopeful and excited intent going into our stay. We secured a great last minute deal at a hotel brand we love. But we ended up paying for the good deal in many other ways. If you are used to 4 or 5 stars it is just not there. When the front desk heard it was our anniversary they complimentary upgraded our room. Nice. This was a pretty ocean view king room and the upgrade was generous and thoughtful. The rooms are cozy but the furniture is worn and our bathroom had some rust in the shower and there was hair on the floor. Our toilet was blocked and maintenance had to service it which they did timely. The ladies bathroom in the lobby was dirty almost unacceptable. The dust along the baseboard in the lounge bar was gross. I only noticed this because I had to plug in my cell phone. It made me recognize the lack of cleaning and detail going on all over the resort. Upon first arriving we had lunch outside at the restaurant. The service was beyond slow. Which resulted in my husband being forced to complain after waiting over 1 hour and 15 min for lunch. The food was good when it finally came out of the kitchen. I had a quinoa salad and my husband had the lettuce wraps. I would recommend both. Because of our first dining experience we avoided any other meals at the hotel. The pool food service was almost non existent having to ask for someone for service both afternoons while polside. The lazy river pool was dirty lots of stuff floating and lots of sand. The indoor lounge had a yeast like bar odor that was recognizable upon entering the room. The property is very pretty the potential is certainly there. It offers a convenient northern FL beach location which suited us well for our activities while in town. Overall the staff on property was polite. However food and beverage needs service polishing. We were provided excellent customer service by Jackie at the front desk and Stanley at the emporium who were both friendly and helpful. The hotel offered us 50 resort credit for our mishaps which we appreciate but overall it did not make up for our disappointment. Think it is time for a facelift and a good thorough cleaning at the Pelican Grand.

The manager was nice apologetic and took two items off the bill but bill was still 160 for 4 people for lunch which is very pricey. At 4 pm check in time we still had not gotten a call that our rooms were ready. I received a call about 410 that my room was ready so we went to check in. There was confusion about whether or not my sisters room was ready but they confirmed it was so we all got our keys and went up. We stopped at my sisters room first to check it out and housekeeping was right outside. They asked us what room and when we told them and they gave us a look like uh oh. Sure enough the room was not ready after all. So my 6month pregnant sister and her husband hung out in our room for a bit then went to the front desk around 5 pm when they still had not gotten their room. They waited another hour in the lobby so over 2 hours before their room was ready way after 4 pm check in time. Totally unacceptable. They were offered free breakfast which she passed on since we were not impressed by lunch. They then offered drink vouchers but she is pregnant. Out of frustration my sister and brother in law just accepted the vouchers to give to me and my boyfriend. Also when the room was finally ready they sent over a random staff member not a manager or front desk agent who stuck his hand out with the room keys and just says here. I could not believe after all that that is how they inform guests that their room is ready after over 2 hours past check in time. The rest of the stay was not great either aside from the beautiful rooms and location. Those are the only redeeming factors and the reason for the 2 stars.

Location could be a hit or miss with travelers a HIT with me. There is nothing within walking distance save the beach. The Pelican is located in a residential area at the northern tip of the Lauderdale beach. I loved this.

The Pelican Grand is a beautiful hotel right on the beach and should rate 5 stars except for an architectural misstep. The hallways are open air which is nice in concept but leaves travelers victim to traffic noise from busy A1A below even oceanfront rooms.

Beds are super comfy. I would have switched the bedroom first room upon entering with the living room farther in next to balcony giving guests more quiet at night.
