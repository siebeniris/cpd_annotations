We found what we wanted an up to date clean hotel located in the Old Port within walking distance of any attractions that might be of interest. The beds were comfortable the room and bath immaculate and the noise factor either from outside or the hallway was nil. On the downside our room d\u00e9cor though contemporary seemed Spartan and it looked out on the parking garage. The breakfast buffet was bountiful though many of the cooked or baked items sat too long to retain the heat and freshness. But stick with the fresh fruits granolas and yogurts and you will survive. The hotel location was perfect just a block or so from the waterfront so once we gave over our car to the ministrations of valet parking we did not need it again until we left the city. If I have any major criticism and I imparted it to the front desk. it is the lack of signage. Even with GPS bringing you directly to the front door you would not know that you had arrived. There is no sign above below or beside the entrance with the hotel name. But like a modern office building which it strongly resembles simply the street number discreetly pinned to the fa\u00e7ade. If you look closely and come from the right direction you can if you are quick spot a small sign next to a driveway cut out that says Hyat Place Old Port Valet Parking. Once you spot it you are already past it and must circle the block to get back to it. The highlights of our mini trip were an exquisite dinner at Ebb Flow and a Casco Bay cruise.

Until about an hour later when the people next door decided to have a party themselves and insisted on slamming door and screaming.
