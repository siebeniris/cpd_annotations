The breakfast was better than any we have had in our road trips. Besides the standard waffles fruit and cereal there was always eggs potatoes and bacon or sausage freshly made on the premises.

The bathroom was a nice size but there were some hairs in the tub when I arrived. The bed was comfortable though and was fine for our two night stay. Some other observations from my friends who went to breakfast was a lot of water from the pool in the coffee area. kids and parents not drying off ahead of leaving the pool and the Cofemate provided was left out overnight so it curdled.

This Hampton was below par and should be in jeopardy of losing the Hilton brand. I am a loyal Hilton patron and a silver honors member. I have stayed at nearly every kind of Hilton including several Hamptons. The Hampton in Covington was without a doubt the worst experience I ever had in any Hilton hotels. Let me first say that this experience will in no way deter me from visiting another Hilton. Overall I am happy with Hilton hotels. And even when something goes wrong I have never seen a need memorialize it on an online review. However as the title states I created an account on Trip Advisor solely to express my discontent with this hotellet us begin with the cleanliness. There were several issues most for which I have provided photographs. First when I checked in on Thursday night November 17 2016 I noticed a very small brown stain on the white bedspread. I assume that I do not need to speculate on what this could have been. It was so late in the evening that I decided to put the bedspread on the floor and to sleep without it. The next morning the housekeeper was in the hallway and I informed her of the situation. She very politely advised me to report this issue to management as it would certainly result in a free nights stay. I thanked her but declined to report the issue. Let me reiterate the housekeeper could not have been more friendly. I do not have a photograph to support this claim. Second there was some sort of a disgusting stain on the wall. For this please refer to the picture titled Photo 1Third as Photo 2 will show the front of the air conditioning heating unit did not close. I had to wedge the waste basket in between the AC unit and the desk in order to keep the unit at least mostly closed. Photo 3 will show further issues with the AC unit specifically the lack of attention given to the cleanliness of its exterior. The filth on the side of the unit easily accessible with a feather duster had quite obviously been collecting for months. The final issue on the AC heating unit was its functionality. The thermostat when the unit is on heating mode is not functioning. So yes the never shuts off. This poses quite a problem in the overnight hours. My routine was to get the room warm enough before bed turn off the unit and sleep as the room cooled overnight. Mornings were brisk to say the least. Forth Photo 4 reveals another issue of cleanliness lack of attention to detail. This is a picture of the vent in the bathroom. Notice the dust and filth that has built up. This is what customers are breathing in. Fifth Photo 5 shows that there is no knob on top of the lamp. This issue alone would never have warranted a negative review. However when combined with everything else it certainly shows that cleanliness and attention to the small things are not priorities when management is training the housekeeping staff. To add to the misery this hotel was under construction which started promptly at 80 every morning. However there were signs posted everywhere advising guests of this inconvenience and so I do not place blame here. It just added to a negative experience. I am not a negative review person. I am a professional who tends to see the good in people. I chose to not ask for a free night when I discovered the horror on my bedspread. because that is not the kind of person I am nor do I wish to be that kind of person. However this Hampton has a duty not only the Hilton brand but also to the customer who has become accustomed to a certain level of professionalism and quality when staying at a Hilton hotel. Neither of those important aspects of the hotel industry were achieved at my stay not even close.", "offset": [1676, 1793], "date": "2016-11-21", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "3184625a-a223-4ece-afd5-1c4b308d47ad", "sentence": "Service and management deficiencies.
