I have never been to the city and it did not disappoint. After a long day of shopping I decided to stay the night. I could not decide on a hotel but was recommended by one of the sales associates at a shop to try this hotel. I am glad I did. I have stayed at a Doubletree only once and I must admit it was not memorable. However I will remember this one. The front desk clerk Jake was phenomenal. Check in was a breeze. He gave me tips on places to go and things to do. He even threw in a couple discounts coupons to take to a nearby bar restaurant. Because I am also a Hilton Rewards member I was able to get the room at a discounted rate. I was happy to see they designated members with their own floors. Nice touch. The room had modern decor with striking bold color and dark wood. The room was very clean cozy and more than enough space for just myself. The breakfast was great. I am not the most picky eater however I am picky about presentation and taste of food. Again I was impressed. The chef made a mouth watering omelet and the hot and cold bar was well stocked. The servers were very nice and informative as well. I received even more information about things to do on my next visit. And yes. I will be visiting again. As much as I love to switch hotels for different experiences I will try this one again. It does not hurt that I learned they also have renovations coming up soon. As nice as the hotel is now I can hardly wait to see this establishment after.", "offset": [817, 882], "date": "2015-01-06", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "cc388188-f6cc-49e6-a783-1a23e11a5102", "sentence": "Double Tree.

My wife stayed the weekend for a little Chattanooga vacation. We have stayed in Chattanooga previously but not at this property. If you are coming to Chattanooga for the usual tourist attractions the Aquarium the Lookouts or the Riverwalk then you could not find a better place. All of these and the other downtown attractions are within walking distance. We arrived before check in time but our room was ready and we checked right in. The room while not spacious was comfortable clean and cool. There were the usual amenities on the property the ones we used were the pool and the H2O bar. The pool was probably designed more adults to lounge in than for actual swimming. There is a ledge to sit on ringing the pool several comfortable chairs in the pool area the pool looks larger in the photo than it actually is.

Not sure if there is just no service elevator but dining staff were constantly going up and down the guest elevators. that is generally fine except they were so impatient that they kept hitting the close door button on every floor often shutting the doors in the face of guests attempting to get on. what is worse most of the staff do not seem to think any of this is a problem and did not even offer an apology let alone an attempt at service recovery.

We needed some extra linens and the young man ran to the laundry room and handed me towels fresh out of the dryer. As we were leaving we bumped into one of the maintenance guys.
