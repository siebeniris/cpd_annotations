We decided to try to Ritz again this year when we were visiting St Louis for a performance of Wicked. It seems as each visit here the service continues to decline. We had reserved a club level room and did received the welcome e mail from the concierge. I had replied with a few questions that were never answered until after asking again upon arrival. Rooms are tired looking and not up to Ritz standards found at other hotels resorts. Only saw a Concierge in the club lounge once during our stay. Furniture in the lounge could also use updating as it was worn looking. Upon returning to our room after our evening out rooms were not turn down like they have been in the past. Wanted to order room service but no menu in the room. After a quick phone call it still took them 45 minutes to send one up.

The last time we visited St Louis in the fall we stayed at The Four Seasons. This trip dictated a lot of down time in the hotel so I wanted The Club Level option for that reason. Overall the decor in the hotel was comfortable with stately old world charm. Pretty typical Ritz. However the Cigar Bar was a complete turn off. The lingering smell in the lobby kept us away from the right half of the hotel our entire stay. Just walking up to read a menu at the two restaurants that flank it was nauseating. Especially bad on Sunday morning. So we never even tried to eat in either restaurant which was a shame. Instead we walked across the street to 801 Chophouse. Although convenient the steaks were atrocious. Back at The Ritz we did really like the lounge taking up the left side of the hotel because it was large enough to feel like a restaurant. Maybe you should also offer The Grill menu over here as well. The sushi bar was a unique and very nice alternative to the bar menu. Drinks were fresh and staff attentive. There were also a lot of convenient outlets for charging. Looked like a good gathering place for locals on Saturday night with live music. Our room was on the 17th Floor. It was very large for a standard room with 2 queen beds instead of doubles thank you a desk and sitting chair plus a lovely marble bathroom with double sinks. Big Bonus for a regular room type. The pillows were just OK and overall the mattresses were comfortable. The little Juliet balcony you could step out onto overlooking the front cul de sac of the hotel was a nice architectural addition. As for the The Club Level I think this is a must staying here even though it is not one of the chains larger or better culinary ones Key Biscayne might be one your best with a bartender serving signature Saturday night martinis. Although I \u2019ve heard that Mariot may be cutting back their Club services and offerings chain wide. As for service Selma in the Club Lounge was outstanding. I was there with my teen on a special business trip and Selma fulfilled every request we had. However the food offerings were a bit limited and not always marked. This is a concern with food allergies. So I would have to ask each time what something was if it was not obvious. I think offering guests a menu to order from would be welcome when the food selections are limited or do not suit your taste or allergies. Love the espresso machine but overall breakfast was not great. Sunday morning was an offering of biscuits and what looked like gravy bacon oatmeal cereal 3 fruit bowls and lox. Sundays at the minimum should be a mini brunch in Club Level with eggs french toast charcuterie champagne and Bloody Marys. Instead I ended up just ordering an omelet to be delivered which was fresh healthy and perfect. The location of our room was very convenient as it was both near the elevator and just at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the 18th Club floor. There was never an official concierge ever at the Club desk to help so we just called downstairs. The car service available from Corp Transportation was very convenient since we had to travel back and forth downtown at least twice each morning and twice in the afternoon. Typically we would Uber but this allowed us to come right down and step into a clean large car. I think for the service and distance traveled the fares were very fair. The bell staff was very attentive and I really appreciate that service. First and last impressions mean everything. Especially when you are single women traveling alone. They made every effort to be courteous and helpful. As for your business center being located in a confessional booth outside of said cigar room not great. Especially since this is touted as a business hotel. I asked the front desk about printing my boarding passes and they sent me to this \u201c room \u201d. After trying for 15 minutes in a hot unvented sized phone booth the printer did not even work. It was a waste of time. I suggest you move this to the lobby near the front desk or back off the lobby bar near your conference rooms. there is plenty of room or nearby help if need be. I did not use the workout facilities but they apparently removed the pool to increase the size of this area. Why remove a pool and not even add a spa. A spa would have been nice. Dial up massage services is not luxury level. Overall it was a good stay for 2 nights and the location felt much more safe than some downtown areas. I was worried about it being too far out but I liked being in a more suburban area just on the fringe of the city. It was a quick 15 minutes into mid downtown without much traffic. Lastly the mini sundry store did not have what we needed one evening so I asked if someone could run to the nearby drugstore for it and they did without hesitation. When this request was made the last time we stayed at The Four Seasons they did not oblige. Which was surprising. I \u2019ve never heard \u201c no \u201d from a Four Seasons hotel. Probably the biggest factor in us returning to The Ritz St Louis again.", "offset": [4110, 4160], "date": "2016-03-14", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "91c2f1d5-cf40-4fe7-bb18-b01495872811", "sentence": "terrific location in Clayton for kids activites.
