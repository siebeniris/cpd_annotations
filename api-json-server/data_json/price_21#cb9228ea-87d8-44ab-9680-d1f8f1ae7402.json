The park used to be Mariots Great America which may be why we were able to get discounted tickets with our hotel package very much worth it for that reason alone. We had 2 cars and they let us park our second car in the garage for free the day we went into the park as we had to check out that morning. It is a little pricey but you are staying in a rather expensive part of the bay area. The facility itself was clean updated and nicely decorated with good sized rooms and very comfy beds. Most hotels in this price range include a hairdryer but this one did not luckily we brought our own. Service was attentive and very pleasant. The only surprise well except for that lack of a hair dryer. we encountered was the restaurant. We wanted something a little nicer than the sports bar but the 65 per person dinner and 25 per person for 3 tastes of wine fixed price was a little more than we had expected. should have read the menu before we went in and sat down.

My reservation sad bed types were not guaranteed but they try to accommodate requests. I even called the morning of arrival day to ask can you make sure and save a 2 queen bed room we are really coming. I was told they do not hold room types but do their best to help. We arrived after a long drive at 115pm went to the check in and was told their would be a 20 per night charge for the 2 queen room. What. I booked a two queen. When I told her I would not pay and I would call my credit card company and make sure they knew I was being railroaded she called her manager. The manager I guess told her to put us in a king room and not charge us for a rolaway bed. I again said I was leaving. She stated then they were out of queen rooms. Really. You just tried to sell me one for 20 a night more. After the run around and another call to the manager they found a two queen room. Not planning to stay here again.

Had to book a 1 night stay here at the end of a vacation trip with a friend to Tahoe. Came back only to realize I lost my apartment key so we went looking for a hotel to stay at on Thanksgiving night. We could not book online since it was past midnight 1AM so we walked up to the counter to check the rates. We had been booking rooms for this vacation using my friends associates rate which was having a promotion for an additional 50 off. The check in agent initially would not let us book the associates rate saying it had to be booked online. Seeing as we could not book online since it was past midnight we were at a loss. I really did not want to pay full rate for a 1 night stay across from my own apartment but I was not seeing another easy choice. She finally let us book the normal associates rate not 50 off and booked us on the 4th floor low floor for an empty hotel on Thanksgiving night but at that point I did not want to argue. The room was nice with a small balcony. The view overlooked a roftopeven at the 4th floor but it was nice to get some fresh air after waking up. My friend was uncomfortable with the temperature through the night but I slept okay. We did not stay for breakfast especially since I was not even sure if they would honor my Gold status for free breakfast and I already felt unwelcome after the check in.

We spent one night in this hotel while exhibiting at the convention center down the street. The hotel is nice and the staff was friendly so no complaints about our stay at all. The issue is upon checking out. I was told there was a 6 self parking fee which was fine and there was a 6 internet fee but it would be waived due to the convention package deal I was offered. When we checked out we were charged 6 for every time we entered the parking area we had dinner and drinks and went out twice from the parking area. so instead of 6 we were charged 12 and the supposed free internet was also charged to our room. I know that a 12 extra charge is not a huge deal but to me I do not like being told one thing and getting something else. The hotel corrected the issue on check out but it left a bad taste in my mouth and got me wondering how many people just paid the bill without looking. Bottom line is always check your bill before paying to make sure what you agreed to is what you are charged.

I stayed at the Santa Clara Mariot for a night while visiting for the MLS all star game in nearby Avaya stadium and paid over 500 for the pleasure. During my stay the service was not too bad but I found some of the ideas about what 500 bucks buys you a bit laughable so I caveat all of the below with a reminder of the cost of the room. First of all the concierge service booked in other tower we needed to come down from the 9th floor and go back up to the 10th floor of the other tower when arriving and keycarding in we found a room with about 20 seats maximum where they had some hot food small spinach pizzas a bolognese nachos etc and soft drinks. However for the cost of my 500 room I was also required to pay 6 for a bottle beer and 16 for a glass of wine so basically I could have just bought a normal room and gone to the hotel bar restaurant. Also not included with my room was 12 for self parking I will repeat that for self park and a further 13 for the pleasure of setting foot within the concierge bar. The room itself was not too bad it was relatively clean apart from a nice sticky spot on the floor by the window and relatively large enough room for a tub chain and about 3 ft between and around each bed. Beds were comfortable and The sports bar downstairs was pretty decent it was decently priced for food and drinks and the service from the bar staff and the speed of food arriving was very good we found most sports on their TVs when we visited it too including a European soccer game.
