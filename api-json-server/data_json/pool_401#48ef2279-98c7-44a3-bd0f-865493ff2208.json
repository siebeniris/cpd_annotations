We found this small resort that perfectly suited our needs. The motel offers a variety of rooms from efficiency units to those with separate bedrooms. Ours had a microwave and generous refrigerator. There is a small beach pool and lovely tiki bar for watching sunsets. We ate our breakfast at the tiki bar as well and watched the ocean. People are very friendly. Many of the renters had been returning for years for a month at a time. We only stayed one night. I would highly recommend this motel.

During our short stay we took the paddle board and kayak out a couple of times to a nearby sandbar. We saw a shark sea turtle several bright red starfish and tons of harmless jellyfish. My only complaint was that the fins on the boards were banged up bent because from all guests having to use the boat ramp entry and sitting on the board in water too shallow.
