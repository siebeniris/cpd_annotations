My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for five nights while in town to visit friends and family. it is conveniently located across the street from lots of restaurants and a movie theater. The lobby is huge and spacious with a ton of seating and a fireplace. there is also a Starbucks booth in the lobby which is convenient in the morning. there is a restaurant in the lobby as well which has a nice bar. The hotel has 14 floors and the west facing rooms offer excellent mountain vistas. The rooms were clean for the most part and the beds were very comfortable. The shower had excellent water temperature and pressure and most importantly drained well. The biggest drawback was parking. Valet charged 10 to park the car overnight. This seemed way too pricey given the hotels suburban location. Also the bathroom did not appear to be cleaned all too thoroughly. The counter looked as if it had just been wiped down and not cleaned properly. There was actually a faint toothpaste mark on the counter when we arrived. Also the bath robe looked dirty so we were unable to use it. The staff was all very attentive helpful and friendly. The biggest issue was when we arrived at our room on Friday night after being out all day only to discover that our room door was not closed all the way. Luckily all of our personal belongings in the room were accounted for but that was still unnerving knowing that our room was unlocked all day. Other than that we had an enjoyable stay. The views the location the lobby the shower the restaurant bar the Starbucks booth the beds. Across the street from restaurants and movie theater. Also near a large park and rec center.

Although the Lobby and Rooms at the Westin Westminster are beautifully appointed we were greatly disappointed by the following. The Starbucks in the Lobby was rarely open. At Hampton Inns one can get coffee and tea 24 hours day. The Kachina Restaurant though delicious food is overpriced and was less than accommodating when we wanted two pots of tea. We were told they were fully booked yet most of the tables were open. The swimming pool water was very cloudy yet full of chlorine. The shower in the womens locker room stayed warm for about 2 minutes then went very cold. There were no hair dryers provided in the locker room and the towels were small. There was only one robe provided in the room we stayed in and it was very wrinkled and looked old. The parking lot is far from the hotel when it is raining and snowing. Valet parking is 10 per night and the valet lot is close to the hotel. The Valet and self park lots should be reversed. Beware of the Room Service bills.
