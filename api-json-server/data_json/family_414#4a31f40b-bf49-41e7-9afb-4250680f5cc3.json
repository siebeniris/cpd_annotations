I will try not to repeat many of the same reviews tips that seem to come in every post. We reviewed hundreds of reviews mostly to get excited for our upcoming trip and found many to be accurate. Those however overly critical of the food rooms waves and construction are just looking for things to complain about in our opinion. If you put those reviewers in the nicest place in the world they had find something to criticize. Below are our opinions and tips for your trip. Overall we absolutely loved our trip and have already discussed coming back here next winter or maybe trying another Excellence resort because we liked this one so much. Airport Transfer I can not stress any more the benefit to buying your 10 tourist cards in advance. We skipped a line of about 100 people because we purchased these online. htpwdgigovdo tarjetaTuristica. en about Paginas defaultaspx. Second if you can fly without checking a bag you will also breeze past huge crowds of flights arriving. Third while there were plenty of taxis available on arrival we booked a private transfer through Caribbean Dream 140 round trip for two and we were glad we did. The taxi drivers were approaching us the second we got outside. so the peace of mind was great being able to say no thank you and walk right to our private driver who was on time and waiting for us. The ride was quick and the van was air conditioned and comfortable. By traveling like we did we essentially walked right off the plane past all the lines short wait for customs. and then into our car and to the resort. It was a breeze. The Room We were in a Garden View cheapest available at time of booking and we were content with our room. The bed was firm but we found it comfortable enough to sleep on without a mattress pad. There were some very minor things in need of fixing updating. Our door handle in the bathroom was loose and the air conditioning grate had a piece of metal hanging down when we first arrived. However these small things did not detract at all from our enjoyment of the room. The bellboy pulled the metal piece down and we did not even really notice the handle much. We talked about moving to a pool view but that was only because we liked waking up early for room service breakfast and coffee on our balcony and we thought it might wake us up a bit more to look over the pool rather than just a few trees. We were not able to switch but we were still just fine on our garden balcony. The window view into the bathroom was a bit odd but we just hung a towel over the shower door and it blocked the view from the bedroom to the toilet. Service. The service was very good. We tried different things pools beach each day so we did not build up the personal relationships that I noticed in other reviews but it looked like if we made one bar or area our spot that building relationships with the staff at that spot would have been possible. There was good but not great waiter service on the beach and at the pools but the bars are not very far so its not that big of a deal. In addition stopping at the bars is not very difficult because if you are drinking throughout the day you will be passing bars on the way to and from the restrooms. Tips We brought 150 singles for tipping and tipped 3 to each bell boy 4 each day for our maid service 34 every morning or night for the room service delivery 1 for each drink 1 for each towel if there was an attendant there and 45 for each waiter at dinner. One night at the Lobster House our waiter was especially great. He was very friendly was happy to make me a non seafood dish brought us dessert without us asking for it and then snuck us a bottle of wine wrapped in a napkin. Even though giving us wine at an all inclusive is kind of silly it was the thought that mattered to us. We gave him 10. After our entire trip tipping everyone we still came home with singles. Though tipping is not required the cost of 1 here and there is not much and they truly appreciate it. Food We loved lunch at Las Olas during the day because the food was delicious it was quick and easy self serve and you can not beat the view being right on the beach. We also had lunch at the Toscana buffet and that was great as well with tons of options. We had dinner twice at Oregano and loved it the Lobster House was very good too as was Toscana. The one dinner we did not like too much was the French restaurant the steak was not great but it still was not awful and the soup salad and bread were good. We ordered room service every morning for breakfast and several nights after coming in for the night. It was always quick good and easy to order. Shows. We went to every show and liked all of them especially the Circus MJ shows. Beach Pools We got out to the beach pool every morning between 815 845am. We found this was a good time to have our pick of wherever we wanted to sit. We loved the beds and had our pick at both the beach and pools. I brought a bluetoth mini speaker to stream music using the wireless or play from iTunes while we were on our bed. Pandora will not work but iTunes radio will. We loved the beach and liked playing and boogie boarding in the waves. The water is rough but it is fun and not overbearing. I had suggest not going too far out if you are not a good swimmer or if you have had too much to drink. We saw one man on a boogie board get taken out to sea and had to be saved by the lifeguard and other boogie boarders we also saw the waves steal the shorts of one man out in the waves. We spent one morning at the Cascade Pool which was very nice. It \u2019s more private and small and has its own small bar making getting drinks very easy. There is a small private area at the top of the Cascade Pool which is space for just two that we grabbed and it was like we had our own private pool with waterfall. We spent another day at the main pool and that was really nice as well. The pools were great but we preferred the beach and spent the majority of our time there. TIP. Bring your own insulated drink mugs or beer cuzis. When it is 85 degrees your drink can warm up pretty quick we saw people who had brought these mugs and it was brilliant. I am sure you can buy them there but you will probably end up dropping a crazy amount I had guess 30 for these when you can just bring one from home. Also bring plenty of sun screen from home the cheapest bottle they have there is 27. so you will save money bringing from home. Mosquitos Noseums We brought bug spray from home and we used it at night but we still got bites. We did not notice the bugs during the day but at night they are out. It was pretty bad for us but we think this was due to eating outdoors near the garden at Oregano. The trouble with Noseums is that they are small and you do not feel them until after they have got you. As you can tell from the review it did not ruin our trip and we had still go back but you should bring bug spray and also lotion for when you do get bit. We thought that on our next trip we may bring a mini battery powered fan that we could put near us if eating outside at night to help keep the bugs away. Off Resort Reviews We did one excursion the BeBe catamaran trip. It was 75 per person leaving from the resort at 1 pm and returning around 445pm. I booked this at the excursion desk at Excellence. I mistakenly did not do any negotiating but I would next time as I am sure you could get a better price. This trip was a good time. We were driven to the Caribbean side of Punta Cana and then got on the boat with others from different resorts. The staff was fun. We rode for about 10 15 minutes to a sand bar for snorkeling. The snorkeling was not the best we were surrounded by other similar boats snorkelers the water was not great for it and we only had about 25 30 minutes before they put us back on the boat. Once reboarding they got out the drinks serving beer and rum drinks on the boat. We rode out to another sandbar and they had floating bars. It was very fun. we had do a similar trip again but our next time we will be booking one that takes us to a better spot for snorkeling and for a longer time snorkeling. The only other time we left the resort was when we walked down the beach just off the Excellence property. On both sides there are little shops and people will instantly come down and try to get you inside to buy things. They walked up and gave me a free cigar and lit it while shopping. I had say that these guys were persistent without being pushy. You can certainly leave without buying anything but they will be pushing hard for you to purchase things you show any interest in. We bought a photo album negotiated to 20 and a box of cuban cigars negotiated to 50. They will let you shop and buy things without any cash on your word that you will return after running back to the resort to get. No issues at customs for either. TIP. These guys WILL negotiate and WILL accept waters alcohol for partial payment. I had suggest offering up any of the alcohol bottles from the room that you have as payment. Those bottles are built into your cost of the trip so in my opinion you can do whatever you want with them including give them to the shop workers for payment for merchandise. Excellence Club We did not do this and after visiting did not see the value. There are plenty of beach beds chairs available in the main area. The only other benefit we noticed was the actual Club with snacks food drinks. but there are snacks food drinks all over. Save the 100 extra per day for other things on the trip. Overall this trip was wonderful and we will be booking again for next year either at Punta Cana or Excellence somewhere else. we had recommend this resort to any of our friends. It would be a great trip for a couple like we traveled or for a group of friends looking to relax and do some partying.

This resort is so beautiful. We went to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary the first week of January 2015 2 9 and as promised we received sparkling wine upon arrival an adorable anniversary banner on our door towel swans and rose pedals fruit and sparkling wine basket in our room. I will try to break this down in categories so I do not get too off topic. Room we stayed in a swim up in building 10. We had a fabulous patio with a bed couch table hammock etc so nice. As everyone says the window in the shower potty area is a little odd but not a deal breaker by any means. We always had tons of hot water terrific cleaning service our beverages were restocked daily but we barely touched them. We did stay in Excellence Club more on that later. Yes the rooms do show a little wear but so does my bedroom at home. I do not understand how some people complain but maybe our room was better than others. The bathroom sink is a little odd tho in an effort to appear modern the sink takes up the whole counter and there is no place to keep your toiletries. Our bed was comfy and I am pretty picky about that it did have a mattress topper before we arrived I am sure that helped. Grounds. as mentioned above absolutely beautiful. Someone was always preening and pruning. Very lush which is a sign of a mature resort. The beach did get seaweed it was pretty windy and wavy when we were there but the seaweed did not bother me at all it is part of the deal when staying on the ocean. I loved that when we were on the beach all we could hear was each other and the waves. They did try to clean up the seaweed every day neverending battle I wonder what it is like at other times of the year. Beach was very long you could walk forever. Very secluded. As mentioned above loved the sound of crashing waves. Food this is the ONLY reason I gave 4 stars. We certainly did not starve by any stretch but the food was just so so. We learned to have eggs made fresh at the omelet station do not bother with the breakfast buffet as it truly is room temperature nothing is hot. But the omelet station was awesome as was the fruit and juices. We did not try the buffet for lunch. We usually got pizza from the beach grill I think it was called Las Olas. Anyhow that was awesome and you could take it to go and have it on the beach. Otherwise we had lunch at the outside restaurants around the pool Lobster House and Grill I believe. Very good and outstanding service. Dinner was our disappointment. Ate at Agave twice though and LOVED it. Spice was also good not great but good I enjoyed the pad thai though. Really disappointed in Flavor Market I think we chose 6 different plates to share and not one of them was good. Also did not care for the Domincan night just that nothing was ever hot or even warm. Oregano was also fine. If we went back a second time though I would know better what to avoid. It was not terrible just not what we have experienced at other destinations in Mexico Costa Rica and Jamaica. Pools very clean and refreshing. We preferred the quieter pool that was near our room. Beach bar service was hit and miss. some were awesome some seemed inconvenienced to have you standing there. Beach service Excellence Club this is the number one reason I would recommend Excellence Club. They do monitor who uses the beach beds as we found out. Thanks goodness we were on the good list but the head guy only checked once after that they knew we were in Excellence Club. You get special towels over there too. And the beach service is great sometimes slow ish but who cares we were not in a hurry. And if we were we had just walk the 20 seconds over to the bar. We were lucky enough to score a beach cabana bali bed 4 days. Yes we did get up early to reserve a bed but we were up early anyhow. We did use a book or magazine to hold it but only because the beach hut was not open yet to give us towels before 80 or 90 am. You really need towels on the beds before you cuddle up in one as they were always damp with morning dew. So we had save our home for the day eat breakfast and then we could get our towels to set up camp. We literally used our beach beds until at least 4 pm. We would get up to walk the beach or grab lunch but otherwise we were there. We did see some folks reserve a bed then not show up until after noon which was rude and unfortunate. The actual Excellence Club was a nice touch a nice place to grab a cocktail before dinner with some small plates that were yummy and the presentation was beautiful. Also self serve coffee stations for the coffee lovers always with sweet treats available too. I would recommend Excellence Club more for the beach than the club itself though it was very nice. Service Tipping this is what I feel sets this resort apart from our other trips as mentioned above. We actually had stowed 100 in singles in our suitcase for tipping for the week which as it turns out was a dumb idea on our part. At some point at one of the airports my suitcase was rifled through and our cash was gone when we got to EPC. Our bad. But we were counting on that for tipping so we had to use what we had on us for the week we had probably 30 singles and some fives so we had to tip more conservatively that we normally would. Not once did I feel that tipping helped or hindered service it was always awesome or it was not but I did not feel it had anything to do with tips. 99 of the service was outstanding just a couple of grumbly bartenders at the pool bar made it not 100. Spa I did a spa treatment once and it was divine. The hydro circuit beforehand was like a massage before my massage. Very spa like experience smelled lovely like a spa should. it is a decent sized facility. I went early I think 9 am and by the time I left it was much busier so I recommend going early. I had good intentions to work out but never did but did peek in the gym and it really looked topknotch. Sorry so long. In summary this was a great place to unplug from reality for a week. Our biggest decision every day was beach or pool. Loved the no reservations and no wristbands no children. I would absolutely recommend to everyone. Will we go back. Hard to say because there is so many places on my list but I would go back for sure or check out another Excellence property. Wish I were back there right now as I look out my office window at snow and 15 degrees. My memories are my new happy place until the next beach vacation. Enjoy.", "offset": [4752, 4851], "date": "2015-02-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 2, "uid": "7f2e641a-0bdf-4e3b-878f-d524a22bb606", "sentence": "Awesome girls trip. I was traveling with a group of 8 ladies the last week of April 2015. We have been to Excellence Riviera Maya 2 years ago. We stayed in club level rooms which have a private beach but no private pool area as ERM had. However the Excellence club itself we greatly preferred to the one at ERM. It had a lounge feel as opposed to a business center feel. We often had breakfast in the club it also served as a great place to meet for a drink before dinner. The rooms are fine could use a little updating but not a big deal. The shower has a large glass window which looks into the bedroom. This combined with the fact that there are NO rooms in this resort with 2 beds per room forced most of the group to have our own rooms. However given the reasonable price we were OK with that. We had lunch at Las Olas outdoor on the beach and our favorite waiter Ramon Ozuna took such great care of us. Now we are a group that will still tip at an All Inclusive for good service so he was well taken care of but we were treated like VIPs. Every day at lunch he asked where we would be going for dinner and he would tell his friends at that restaurant to take good care of us. We were treated so well with such great service each nightSpice was our favorite restaurant and we were not crazy about the food at the Mexican restaurant. We did not eat at the French restaurant as they basically told us we were too large of a group and that it was mostly for couples. Seriously. That was really the only negative thing. The shows were pretty good the 80s review and Broadway were the best. We also enjoyed the Martini bar. Marlon the pool concierge was fantastic. The beach has white sand and the ocean is beautiful. Our only complaint about the beach too many hotel employees constantly coming by trying to get us to do horseback riding boat trips etc. Overall for the price this is a very nice All Inclusive vacation.", "offset": [606, 741], "date": "2015-07-29", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 3, "uid": "c2d9ff0f-273e-4ae2-aefe-4f08a62cb537", "sentence": "Amazing resort. We are diehard Sandals and Secrets fans but Excellence in Punta Cana was truly excelente. The resort was immaculate every moment of every day the cleanest all inclusive to date we have stayed at a couple of dozen across the caribbean over the past 20 years. The variety in food was wonderful it was great to have several choices for lunch a buffet that had many choices a burger pizza place that often had a live band and overlooked the ocean and a sit down restaurant. Our favorite dinners were at Spicesasianpad thai was best I have ever had and they were able to make my husbands curry super spicy. The Lobster House. lobster was terrific and patio seating overlooking ocean so relaxing and romantic. We loved that we could walk the beach in both directions most of which was undeveloped. Casino was fun we both won a bit at roulette and video poker. Bartenders were great the ones at the martini bar fixed our usuals before we sat down. Tipping occured burpt it was not out of control. We prefer not to tip everday but to give special tokens when warranted. Edward the bellhop was great. Shout out to Nelson our waiter at the Lobster House. We did do the free horseback ride and bicycle tour. Great pix and souvenirs after hourseback ride. Would have preferred longer bike ride without the stop. The sports bar has the coldest bottled beer. Putt putt golf was fun. The resort is beautiful with wonderful natural lagoons with wildlife and flowers very romantic walks. Quite a bit of mosquitos though take and use off during day away from ocean and at night always. Cold not quite figure out the club hours so rarely made it up there in time to grab food. We LOVED our room it was near the pool bar which we feared would be noisy but the pool and bar closed at 6 pm so noise was not a problem. We had first floor room on corner it was great to walkout to pool and be able to duck into room for rest room or to grab cold bottle of water. Special note the saxophone player nightly near the martini bar was great played music to dance to sing along and toe tap to the beats. Great way to start the evening. We did not do any excursions since we rely needed to relax. No pressure to join playmakers in activities but there was a variety offered. Shows were fantastic so professional and costumes amazing. take a nap before dinner so you can see them. Had a couple minor maintenance issues but they were fixed in a timely manner. One note this was our second visit to Punta Cana and our second tropical storm. The resort provided plenty of activities to keep people entertained. A minor complaint is that they did not keep us up to date on storm status which was a bit unnerving. This resort is not new so do not expect shiny and modern it has some wear and tear and could use a bit of TLC but again it was very very clean. Overall I would give the resort a 95. The only reason not a 10is that it they do not provide free transportation to from airport. It costs 70 each way. Luckily we called the resort and they set us up for private transportation but for most arriving in a foreign country and not knowing how to get around is not the way to start a vacation. One last kudos to Excellence for not trying to sell us anything during our stay other resorts do not get that the sales pressure ruins a relaxing vacation. Of course you have vendors when you leave the resort but that is par for the course you can always walk away. Finally the staff at the resort were FANTASTIC friendly easy to understand and understood english very well. We will definitely look for Excellence resorts in other countries we can not wait for the Jamaican one. It would be nice to see then on grenada and barbados too.", "offset": [3177, 3332], "date": "2015-09-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 4, "uid": "9ac588da-9f9f-4493-943d-83fa61928393", "sentence": "Wonderful. We were not disappointed with our trip to Excellence. The staff are wonderful. If you do not have a great time you are to blame. Everyone went out of their way to make sure our time here was Excelente. A special thanks to Ariheney Chile and Wiliam a k a Will I Am. Also I had like to give a shout out to Pedro at the Casacade Pool Bar. We met some lovely couples from the UK who were our beach mates all week. The ocean was rough but no more so then our East Coast beaches in Delaware. The food could use some improvement but that was fine too. We will definitely consider another trip here in the future. My only regret is that I did not discover the iceberg at the bar prior to our last full day. We also enjoyed the 30 minute horseback ride on the beach.

We booked our 25th Anniversary trip at Excellence Punta Cana primarily because we wanted an adults only resort. We loved this experience and had a wonderful time. The resort is simply lovely and just large enough so that it never felt a bit crowded. There were several activities on the schedule each day and we liked that we never felt pressured to take part in anything we did not want to. In the past we stayed at Iberostar and had problems staying on our feet with all the wet super slick surfaces in fact I experienced a serious fall at Iberostar. This was not an issue at Excellence they have mostly textured walkways and very few areas where we slipped. Our favorite part of visiting Republica Dominicana as always is that we love the friendly and smiling people. Regardless of their job or financial status usually VERY poor the Dominicans value family and tend to lead a much less stress filled life as compared to Americans. They take time to visit with us and we feel incredibly connected through sharing of their experience. We were invited into the homes of some wonderful people. If you choose to interact in a respectful manner they are largely warm and genuine. Yes you should be intelligent and protect yourself if you choose to wander but we have never felt unwelcomed or unsafe anyplace we have gone. We probably are not the typical tourists though. Be aware that the concept of the Dominican minute is very real. Be flexible with expectations because it is much more relaxing to go with the flow than constantly be rushing and watching the time. Many locals are very fluent in English and other languages but remember their primary language is Spanish. There will be times when communication is more fun than others. Practice patience. The staff at Excellence really does want the guests to have a good time and come back. Thanks to David at the front desk our check in was smooth and he accommodated our requests with no problems including upgrading us to the Excellence Club even though GBS Travel had advised us it was sold out. We were seriously pleased to be offered a room right on the cascade pool. We stepped out to our patio and jumped right into the calm and wonderfully quiet pool which is actually two levels. We preferred it to the more lively usually loud and huge wandering pool on the opposite side of the resort. Our bed was very comfortable we had no problem with the window in the shower and enjoyed having natural lighting. There was a rambunctious party of 20somethings that tended to drive us crazy for several nights of pool and post disco parties but all was well when they checked out. Overall we would not have done anything different with our room except possibly book a roof top room when we have an excessive amount of cash to spend. We truly enjoyed our space. We also liked working with and visiting Will Carlos at the front desk. One of our extremely early trips left before any food options opened and we did not realize even a continental breakfast was not available until 70 am He quickly arranged breakfast delivery in the lobby. He helped us understand the currency differences assisted us to obtain my husbands debit card back when the lobby ATM ate it for the weekend and explained so many things particular to Dominican culture. He would win as our favorite staff member at Excellence this trip. Almost everyone was great but Will Carlos was EXCELLENT. The food was fine for us. There was always something we could like and the menu was always interesting sometimes adventurous. The wait staff did not always understand food allergies and therefore it was up to me to determine items that were safer. Anything we did not find pleasing could always be replaced with a different choice. If we ever went away hungry it was by our choice because Excellence bends over backwards to make the food available. We disliked the hotel beach on the Atlantic. It was very heavy surf with an overwhelming amount of seaweed. The crews worked constantly but it would be impossible to keep up with. This is through NO fault of the workers. We used the Excellence Club private beach and enjoyed the amenities. We insisted on trying to be in the ocean a couple times but decided to book some tours on the Caribbean side as we MUCH prefer the Caribbean. If you want to immerse yourself in the ocean we suggest other resorts are a better choice. We were happy to read and nap on the beach and swim a lot in the pools. Beware of the tour sales guys stalking guests on the beach and at polside who misrepresent themselves as being representatives of Excellence. They are not. Their company apparently has a contract to solicit guests. While the young man seemed good his knowledge was flawed and he sold us a package with completely incorrect tour information on the receipt. Had I not made inquiries the night before we would have missed our expensive tour by several hours. We highly suggest seeking out Jeanete Senior at Olympus Tours just off the lobby. She arranged a free tour for us to Don Lucas Cigar Factory and arranged an absolutely FANTASTIC all day trip to S Cape Park that was not her usual offering. Again another local person who made sure we got exactly what we wanted. Jeanete totally shines. Go find her you will be glad you didThey do fog for mosquitoes which was pretty necessary however we wish they would do this in the early mornings before guests are out or at least warn the guests that they will be fogging so we can leave the area. We were playing pool and ping pong when the foger came by and gassed all the guests right along with all the insects. We did not appreciate breathing in a thick neuro toxic cloud of poison. Make sure to take along bug spray you will be glad you have it. we are steady tippers for food and beverage staff housekeeping and generally for great service. it is never required but when you learn how terrible the pay is for the staff you will want to. Our drink quality significantly improved with only a buck or two. Everyone wins. Entertainment was okay but got better if you drink a little before and during the shows. They work HARD to put on a good show. It would be great if they learned to lip sync to the songs. Dancing and entertainment was great for the Circus show Michael Jackson show was our second favorite while the Dominican show was bad enough that we decided we did not want to endure the entire show. The dancers for most of the shows have impressive skill and are fun to watch. I was particularly annoyed by the entertainment team announcer. MC whatever he was. His constant demands for the audience to CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP or they would leave the stage was uncaled for. We did not expect Broadway cruise ship or even community theater quality performances but some were just a lot better than others. The transportation available to be booked directly from the Excellence Punta Cana website is deceptive. We paid 140 for direct private round trip airport transportation which is billed to our room. There is no one to call if you have a problem at the airport they only deal with bookings via email which is not too handy at the airport and we ended up paying an additional 70 directly to a driver to be taken to Excellence. We looked for the correct reps at the desk we were directed to black shirts with pink lanyards and then shuffled over to an Island Sun rep. We decided not to make a big deal of this because we really liked the resort. The photos show nice read SAFE SUVs. We got a ride in a van to the resort. For the return trip we were supposed to be picked up at 120 resort staff called every few minutes when the vehicle never arrived then finally a broken old mini van taxi with non functional doors and broken seatbelts showed up at 1205 to take us to the airport. We were not pleased. While it got us where we needed to go we will not book the transportation this way again. Long story to say that we had an Excellent 11 day vacation at Excellence Punta Cana. Thanks to staff from the bell hops housekeeping food beverage entertainment tours and front desk. we are sure to return someday.", "offset": [834, 997], "date": "2015-11-20", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "8cdf2346-08ba-4ab4-9920-653bf8aee71b", "sentence": "Great place.

My husband and I recently returned from Excellence Punta Cana. We had already been to another Excellence Resort so we went in with a certain level of expectation and we were not disappointed. We chose this resort based on our previous experience at their resort in the Riviera Maya. We did reserve the Excellence Club which allows for private check in use of a private lounge beach area. The in room amenities are upgraded like the toiletries which are Bvlgari. The resort grounds are beautiful. The staff is constantly perfecting the landscaping and the beach. But the grounds is where the one draw back to this amazing resort hides. The Mosquitos. The mosquitos make themselves known as soon as you step out of the car. If you are anything like me and tend to get bit more than the average person you will spend your vacation being attacked no matter how much bug spray you have on. On that note you NEED to bring some type of mosquito repellent. I came home with more mosquito bites than I could count but my husband only got a couple the whole week we were there. If you are pregnant or planning on getting pregnant because of the mosquitos and the Zika virus you may want to contact the resort prior to making a reservation. I am sure that a resort of this quality will be doing everything they can to control the mosquito population. Now that I got the one draw back out of the way lets get to the wonderful things. The most wonderful part of this resort are the staff. The concierge staff at the Excellence Club Edwin Jeifrey Luisa were incredibly helpful. We learned that we could not get home as scheduled due to weather back home. Edwin Jeifrey and Luisa did anything they could do to assist us in not only staying another day at the resort but making sure we could get a new flight home. Our flights had changed so many times and we did end up needing another 2 days at Excellence. They were able to keep us in the same room for each of the extra days. We can not thank them enough for their patience and their assistance. The Excellence Club lounge has a very attentive wait staff as well. Erick was my favorite. He is hard not to like great personality and great at his jobThe restaurants across the board are good. The favorite seemed to be Spice an Asian restaurant. The wait staff at each place were attentive without being annoying. You will never have an empty beverage. We had a group dinner at the Lobster House one night and our waiter was Adan. Adan stuck out because he really made it seem like we were guests in his home. He was so welcoming and up beat. We pretty much ordered the entire menu but if there was a dish he thought we might like he brought it out for us to try. The rooms here are clean and comfortable. There is a quirk to the rooms. The shower has a window into the bedroom area which does not sound too quirky but then the toilet is also viewing range which is not the most romantic thing in the world. But I guess channel 96 could get some peoples motors running. The room has a stocked mini bar which is included. If there is something in the mini bar that you would like swapped out as long as they have it you can. The Mile spa was refreshing. The massage therapist Jasmine did an amazing Excellence Massage. The time just flew by and I felt amazing. We also did the hydrotherapy which is included in the Excellence Club and part of any massage booking. The hydrotherapy was the best cure for a hangover. You can not do the hydrotherapy while you are drinking but the morning after is highly recommended. It pretty much makes you feel like a newly refreshed person. Plus if you have long hair expect to leave with a gorgeous braid. The entertainment staff is exactly that. Entertaining. They are by the pool all day and then run all the shows at night. Marcos AKA Cappuccino was nicknamed the Master of Fun by part of our group. He pretty much has the best job ever and you can tell he loves it. The shows at night are entertaining. The fire show was so much fun. But the best show is the Michael Jackson show. It is a must. Get there early good seats go fast. Overall this was an amazing resort. Totally worth it.

We stayed for 10 days to celebrate our ruby wedding anniversary we had upgraded to the Excellence Club which was well worth the extra cost. When checking in we were offered an upgrade to an ocean view suite at an additional cost of 90 per night with a 10 discount which we declined at that point we had not even seen our room. I had requested a ground floor room with a garden view but was allocated a room on the top floor in building 8 which was not a problem. The little extras such as towels made into swans was lovely. The room was cleaned daily and the mini bar etc was restocked every day. The maids certainly worked hard. Another nice touch was cakes bought to our room each day. The food in all the restaurants we tried was very good as I knew it would be having stayed at the Excellence Riviera Maya Mexico. The only downside to this holiday was the staff are not quite so sharp on service as they were in Mexico also the staff had a tendency to prefer giving preferential service to the American clients this may be in part due to the fact that Americans are well known for tipping for everything which certainly was not the case when we stayed in Mexico the level of service provided there was the same for all. Although we had some rain each day it did not spoil our holiday and we were able to spend time on the beach each day.", "offset": [859, 1264], "date": "2016-12-03", "cpt": "0", "category": "family"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "0c261355-b8d0-4698-86d5-cd59558dbe30", "sentence": "Gorgeous property with THE BEST customer service. Our eight night November honeymoon at the EPC was our first trip to the Dominican Republic. I researched the resorts like crazy and I am so happy we tried the EPC. The short of it is it is the nicest people you will ever meet at the most stunningly tropical property with the longest beach front I have ever seen. The long version and minute details follow. Please note that Tropical Storm Oto joined us so my review is based on an unusually rainy visit. The GroundsI was not prepared for how green and tropical the resort was. The photos do not do it justice. It was beautifully jungle y with so much foliage and tropical plants. The attention to detail with the landscaping is amazing. The gardeners are like ninjas you never see them but there is not a leaf out of place and every plant is perfectly manicured. For the reviewers that say Mexico has better food or other resorts are newer you will not find more fully developed astonishingly tropical grounds anywhere else. The other thing about the grounds that is remarkable is that the entire resort is built along the beach. Every other beach resort I have stayed at had some beachfront with the majority of the hotel built back from the beach. At the EPC we did not have to choose between beach day and pool day because the main pool runs all along the beach. You can see the ocean from 80 of the resort. You can sit at the beach and take a swim in the pool in just a few steps. Finally I loved that the grounds felt very Latin or colonial. I do not want to fly all the way to the Caribbean to stay in an ultra modern resort that looks like it belongs at the Vegas strip. The PolsThe main pool at EPC is one of my all time favorite resort pools which is saying a lot. I have never seen such a large pool that is so close to the ocean. You can see and hear the ocean from almost any place in the long winding pool. I really liked the quiet end near Building 14. It has a beach style zero entry and is the widest part of the pool. Sol Bar with the lovely Kendry is right there and the servers will also bring you refills in the pool if you do not want to get out. This was great to learn as at first I was surprised that such a huge pool only had one swim up bar. By having drink service but no swim up they have truly made a tranquil place to relax. At the end of the quiet end there is a full barrier wall. So you have to get out and back in to swim the entire pool. it had be nice to swim the whole pool but it does provide a barrier between the quiet end and the swim up. The pool was nicely heated as well. The other end of the main pool includes the activities team and the swim up bar. I have never been one to participate in pool activities but the swim up was a lot of fun. it is a long bar with tons of seats and the thatched roof totally shields the sun or the rain. One big surprise at the pools is they do not have any floats. I have read so many reviews about the floats and problems at times with float hogging but they simply do not have ANY any more. I bought a 7 super junkie one at the gift shop. So if you like to lounge on a float or use one as a cocktail table to push your drink around the pool order a decent one from Amazon. We liked the main pool so much we did not take advantage of the Cascade pool. It does have a lovely quiet ambiance with the two layers of water falls. If the main pool had not had an ocean view we might have split up our pool time more. The FodThe food is very palatable with some really pleasant surprises. Manage your expectations keep in mind it is an island and a developing country and do not be afraid to branch out. I have had better all inclusive food and I have had way worse. If you eat seafood stick to the fish as often as possible. We had some legitimate five star fish entrees. The beef is quite different than in the States. you will see hundreds of cows on the drive to the resort and they are just different. They almost look like water buffalo and they are very lean. It appears they just eat grass so I imagine the beef is actually far healthier than the fat corn fed cows we eat. But most beef entrees we tried were pretty dry. For dinner we got a lot of great tips from asking other guests while chilling in the pool what the best thing they had ordered was. Some of the best meals we had were off menu. By befriending the servers and giving our favorites repeat business towards the end of the week they were offering to prepare us specials for dinner. We had some amazing platters that way at the Grill and at Spice. If you are not over the moon about what you ordered try something new and worst case scenario the late night pizza near the disco is delicious. The room service is also prompt and hot for any midnight snacks. You can also order champagne by the bottle from them. One of the best things about dinner is no reservations. I will never go back to an all inclusive with reservations. it is great to decide on a lark where to eat that night. I do not care to schedule the time and place of all dinners upon check in. The BufetsThe breakfast buffet closes at 11 and starts breaking down at 1030. As such we were not able to fully experience it preferring to sleep in and hit the gym. The lunch buffet however was fantastic. A huge fresh salad bar with items I do not often see at home like hearts of palm. It also had sushi grilled to order meats a wide variety of prepared dishes self serve champagne and two flavors of sangria. A la carte breakfast and lunch Most days we went to the Lobster House for breakfast. They offer a handful of egg based breakfasts with different meats or starches. We enjoyed all of them. The service is attentive and the open air restaurant has a nice breeze and view of the ocean. The Grill is also open air built over the pool. We had lunch there several days. The special of the day and soup of the day were always very good. They offer three ceviches which were fresh and delicious. The grilled grouper there was one of my favorite things I ate. The Grill has its own bar so drink service is very prompt. Las OlasLas Olas is outdoor grill right on the beach open from 12 4. They have a standing selection of pizza and burgers and rotating items of the day. The unfamiliar Dominican dishes were uniformaly better than the American ones duh so again branch out. They had paella and spicy beef black bean nachos that were delicious. Their pizza is wood fired and amazing. We liked to pop into Las Olas for a snack about 330. They have to go containers if you want to take it back to your lounge chair. The servers there and the guys grilling are super nice. In the afternoon they will also walk around the pool with mini pizzas so you do not even have to get out of your chair to indulgeThe RomsThe rooms look exactly like the 90 pictures of the rooms on TA. It baffles me when people have a TA account get all the way to the hotel without knowing what the rooms look like and then are displeased. I would not call our room tired or dated. I did not expect remote controlled blackout shades or a TV inside the bathroom mirror. Its not Las Vegas. Our basic garden view room had ample space plenty of storage for clothes great air conditioning and a lovely shower. The rain shower had great water pressure. Yes the in shower window is not something we see at home. Look on the resort map and request a building near a pool bathroom or the Club house if you get the club for more bathroom privacy. The included Club toiletries were really nice. I asked for a mattress topper right off the bat because I do not like firm mattresses and it was lovely. The linens and towels were very nice and the housekeeping got the room spotless every day. The balcony was small but nice to chill for a few minutes before we went to dinner. The mini bar was much better equipped than any other place I have stayed. It came stocked with regular and lite beer sauvignon blanc Coke Diet Coke Sprite Tonic Club Soda all in those glass bottles we do not get at home cranberry orange and Clamato juice. We left a note and a tip with our requests and it was always stocked with our favorites. We had a top floor room with a vaulted ceiling. We loved the ceiling and not having any guests above us. However if you are not up for taking the stairs get a first floor room. We took the stairs nearly exclusively and appreciated a little exercise. When we finally took the elevator to check out we had our own suitcases and had chosen not to ask for a bell hop the elevator was cramped and about 105 degrees. I would have been uncomfortable to take it multiple times per day. The GymWhat a lovely surprise. It sounds strange that a gym is one of the highlights of a tropical vacation but I absolutely loved this gym. The gym is huge perfectly air conditioned with a super high ceiling and wall to wall floor to ceiling windows. It has a great view of the mountains and the eco park. Inside were all the weight machines of a real health club new and in great condition plus two sets of free weights. They are in kilometers but there is a handy chart on the wall to convert. The cardio equipment was in great shape as well. They pump in a lovely scent and blast super fun Dominican hip hop. They have fruit infused and chlorophyll infused water. The other half of the gym is a functional fitness room with mats ketlebels jump ropes medicine balls push up handles etc. Best of all an amazing employee named Andras takes great pride in caring for the gym. As soon as you finish using something he cleans it. When you have finished your workout he magically appears with a tray of iced eucalyptus infused face towels. He was one of my very favorite employees at the resort which is saying a lot. If you are even mildly into working out do not pass up this gym. The Eco Parkdo not miss this. The birds are crazy beautiful including the pinkest flamingos you will ever see. it is a very peaceful area to walk around and check out all the wildlife. The StafThe EPC staff are among the nicest hardest working people you will ever meet. The language barrier might be greater than places I have stayed in Mexico but I have never seen people work harder to make the guests happy. I want to make a disclaimer here that none of the stand out staff I am about to acknowledge asked me to mention them on Trip Advisor. I would not do it if they had asked. The practice by select staff aka the entertainment team of helping people start a TA account to leave a 3sentence review with their names is incredibly off putting. It clogs up the hotels TA page and does nothing to help people decide the EPC is for them. The management needs to put a stop to this practice. That said we had two particularly wonderful bartenders that stood out among the excellent crowd. Kendry at the Sol Bar and Yerlin at the swim up. They remembered our regulars made excellent drinks refilled them before we even had to ask and were just smiley friendly guys all through their crazy long shifts. At night they moved inside to the lobby bars and ultimately worked at least 12hour shifts. We also met two incredibly sweet young waiters who went above and beyond to deliver great service. Francisco Grill Spice and Joel Las Olas Chez Isabele. We scheduled our last couple of meals around where they were working. Seek these awesome guys out. And as discussed above the gym attendant Andras was so pleasant and took so much pride in his job. These staff are all reflections of the manager Yeifred who went out of his way to meet his guests remember them by name and make sure they were having an amazing time. One experience really sums up the above beyond service we enjoyed. Due to the sub optimal weather we spent a lot of time in the hot tub. it is a lovely infinity hot tub that overlooks the ocean. We were relaxing in there in between downpours and Kendry showed up with cocktails IN coconuts. We had not even ordered them he just thought we might enjoy. Just when we thought it did not get much more decadent or relaxing than a drink in a coconut in a beach front hot tub one of they guys from Las Olas showed up and gave us each a personal pizza. Now THAT is serviceRegarding service I know tipping can be a hot button on Trip Advisor but we tipped. We always tip at all inclusives and these employees deserved it above all others. These guys work insanely hard for weeks on end away from their families and have an amazing attitude about it. I never saw any server cop any attitude toward a guest who did not tip so it is not implicitly expected I just think it is the right thing to do. The BarsYou can not walk for more than three minutes without coming across a bar. Cafe Kafe is the most central bar so it gets a little crowded backed up. Branch out and give some of the other bartenders your business. The sports bar is hard to find we had to actually carry our resort map. But it is lovely with an indoor outdoor vibe and super nice bartenders. There are four different TVs and seating areas and the guys will work to find whatever sporting event you want to watch. It also has ping pong pool and darts and the widest beer selection on the property. Next to the sports bar are also the raquet sports courts shooting etc. Again it rained too much for us to take advantage of those. The Sol Bar had the best location quiet end of the main pool and just feet from the hot tub and one of our favorite bar tenders. We preferred the vibe at the main pool to the Cascade Pool but we did swing by the Cielo bar a few times on the way back from the gym for a drink. Their bartenders are super nice too. One suggestion I would make to the management is when it rains put some bar stools at the Sol and Cielo. Both are covered with a thatch roof but no stools. If it is sunny I am sure most people prefer to take their drink to a lounge chair. But on the rainy days it would have been nice to sit at either bar. Instead the ones with covered seating Cafe Kafe and the indoor bars got crowded. We braved the rain to venture to both Cielo and Sol to give the bartenders some business we felt bad they had to stand there all day in the rain. Finally as discussed above the swim up bar was awesome. We spent a LOT of time there in the pouring rain. Every day after gym and brunch we ventured out there in the rain and soon enough other guests started joining us and it was a fun way to make the best of the rain. It usually had two bartenders and played great Latin music. Who wants to go to the tropics and hear American hip hop. The bartenders especially Yerlin surprised us with fun drinks and specialty shots. The DrinksThis is not one of those all inclusives where they water down the boze those drinks are legit. I deem this a positive but if you are a light weight sip slowly or ask to them to taper it back. The alcohol selection was very good just under the very top shelf. Just ask by name if you want a particular spirit and you will get it if you just say rum or vodka you will get the well. Naturally the rum selection was the largest and we really enjoyed trying new local rums. My husband liked the Presidente but there are more beers at the sports bar. Their mojitos and margaritas were excellent and they made them not sweet per my request. Regarding dinner drinks at times the language barrier presented when trying to order from the waiter. A few times we had to write down Cosmopolitan and Gin Tonic but the proper drinks got to us. The SpaOur honeymoon package included the hydro therapy which I highly recommend. A spa attendant takes you around as a couple through several steam rom sauna shower treatments and you finish up in an open air room with a huge jacuzi. After your final jacuzi you relax in a lounge chair for a short neck massage. The ShowsThis was the first all inclusive trip that I have partaken in shows. Other resorts it seemed like work to keep track of the time and get to the theater. At the EPC the open air theater is central to the resort right in the lobby. It was easy from the bars or restaurants to keep an eye on when things were getting started and get a seat before they were full. I am so glad we did these shows were awesome. The Circus show was absolutely amazing. The acrobatic rivaled any Cirque de Soleil show in the States. The drink service is great during the shows. After you order once they magically keep appearing when you are ready for another. The CrowdOnes neighbors make a big difference in the all inclusive experience and the crowd at EPC was perfect for us. We are mid thirties and were younger than over half the guests. It was at least 80 couples with a few friends trips and some families traveling with adult children. The crowd was laid back and just the right amount of rowdy. The booze was flowing but it did not have a loud frat party atmosphere. I think being one of the older resorts among the super hip new ones helps. We did not see any of the usual offending behaviors like blasting personal music at the pool or excessive seat saving. The Excellence ClubWe paid for the Club for two reasons. 1. My husband thought he had have to do some work and TA reviews said the club house had the best wifi 2. I hate seat saving and wanted a guaranteed seat at the beach. To be honest I do not think I had pay for the Club on the next visit. First the club house. Its wi fi was great but our room and balcony also had fine wi fi. So we did not use the club house too much except waiting for it to be 10 and the lunch restaurants to open a few mornings when it was pouring and thus we could not hang out at the pool or beach. I did not really understand how the cocktails worked. There is no actual bar and no bar tender. They have a ton of variety of high end spirits just sitting out. They have an ice bucket and just one or two mixers. So I was unclear if you were supposed to order a mixer and make your own drink or ask a staff member to make you a drink. The vibe in the club house is a little strange and stif like an airline club lounge. It was well air conditioned which I am sure is welcoming at hotter times. The TV is set to CN non stop. We did not particularly want to watch politics on our honeymoon. Finally they go overboard with the pumped in perfume. It was so flowery and so strong it gave me a headache. The downstairs concierges in the club house could not have been nicer the few times we needed something so it was nice to have them to go to. The other alleged club perk was the beach seating. It rained 90 of our trip so we did not really sit on the beach. The few days we did I was underwhelmed. Sadly the beach concierges for the club were the only rude employees we encountered. They all acted like it was a major inconvenience to hand us a towel and escort us to a chair. I had rather have sat myself. Also the prime seating was taken by the same couples every day. they had put their stuff down in the morning and leave and the concierges would be like no you can not save that all day and they had say they were coming back but never did. Finally the beach drink service was weak. I just got up and got our own at Sol Bar. OceanI hate to deter ANY one from this beloved property but if you are really into ocean swimming you might be pool bound here. We were there during a tropical storm so I hope my experience was fluke. I had read all the red flag reviews and thought meh I can do it. I am a really strong swimmer and did not last more than two minutes in the ocean. I went underwater for a second and was immediately about a football field away from where I had entered the water. But the waves made for lovely scenery and background noise so if you prefer to just look at the ocean you will love this beach. LocationWe had no issues with the location. The 45 minute drive was no big deal I live farther from the airport than that at home. We enjoyed seeing a little bit of Punta Cana on the way. We had private transportation and the highway drive was very smooth. Overall we absolutely loved the EPC. Thank you manager Yeifried for a wonderful honeymoon. I would put the EPC in the regular rotation if we had a direct flight to Punta Cana but we will definitely be back every few years. They have set the bar for customer service. The fact that we randomly had an absolutely ridiculous amount of rain and STILL loved our trip speaks volumes. No matter the weather there is too much to do and too great of service to get crabby about it.
