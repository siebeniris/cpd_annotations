My wife and recently spent 7 nights at the Sheraton Maui Resort and Spa. This was our second visit to the property which we first visited in 2013. As one of the first resorts built in Kanapali the resort enjoys both a spacious feel and a great location at the midpoint of the Kanapali beach walk one of the many benefits of a planned resort community. As was the case on our first stay we had a room in building 4 with a stunning view over the grounds pool and down the beach. The room was clean quiet and very comfortable. Having a private lanai to enjoy breakfast or the sunset made it one of the best resort rooms we have ever had. The highlight of our stay was \u2018 Dinning Under the Stars \u2019 to celebrate my wife \u2019s birthday. The meal was incredible 5 courses all spectacular I would however suggest eating very little beforehand. As great as the food and service were what really made it stand out was the setting. A private cabana looking over the beach and Black Rock. Planning a special dinner event from afar can sometimes be complicated. From the moment we chose a return visit to the Sheraton Maui and arranged our Dinner Under the Stars we received amazing service. Rory Cosma Guest Service Manager not only made sure that all details for our dinner were perfect but went above and beyond on several occasions. For instance he was kind enough to stop and buy a lei for my wife on his way to work after I inquired about purchasing one at the hotel.

We had buffet breakfast every morning lucky it was comped since it is 40 a head. but service was wonderful. The pool was perfect as well but you have to hit the beach pics included. Lots to see when you snorkel. The mini cabanas by the pool for some reason is cheaper than getting 2 chairs and an umbrella beachside. The pool was not too cold and what I love about the property is that even when full it does not seem too crowded. The exercise room was ok but needs newer equipment. Lots of cardio vs weights.

I stayed at Sheraton Maui with my fiancee husband on our elopement honeymoon getaway. Sheraton Maui is a great location nicely landscaped on a beautiful beach and it is just a short gorgeous walk to Whalers Village for shopping and dining we enjoyed this convenience many times during our stay. This review will seem a little harsh compared to the four stars I gave. that is because its a great resort however I could not help but compare it to the resort that I stayed at last time I was in Maui which is why I have a few more negative comments I would had I never been to Maui before. The newly remodeled rooms were nice but a little bare as if they had forgotten a to hang up the last few pieces of art. House keeping was good although a little inconsistent with towels sometimes not replacing any hand towels or wash cloths. We stayed in an ocean front room in a great location with an amazing view however the rail on the lanai is thick and can block the gorgeous view if you do not position yourself strategically. Kanapali beach is a great beach and we loved the convenience of having snorkeling on site. We ate at Mai Tai Bar Cliff Rock and Rock Salt 2x. I enjoyed both meals at Rock Salt but I found Mai Tai Bar and Cliff Rock to be over priced and under whelming. The gym is nice and well equipped however I was disappointed that there were no exercise classes offered. I loved the convenience of the on site Black Rock Spa and I booked a few services there. I had a great massage worth it and a mediocre mani pedi definitely not worth the price on two different days with different aestheticians. My fiancee commented that even he could have done a better job on my nails. The spa has a nice atmosphere and some of the rooms have openings to the outside so you do not feel too closed off from the beautiful Maui atmosphere. Beware of the Aloha Welcome. We thought that this would be an information session on the large resort. Not so. They just try to sell you a a tour and or time share of other nearby Sheraton resorts. I have only been to Maui one other time and I stayed at the Royal Lahaina. It costs about 150 less per night the rooms are nicer the property is nicer and the beach is quieter. My then fiancee stayed there the night before we got married and I was pleased to find out that they still offer free yoga classes first thing in the morning on Mondays and Fridays.

The grounds are beautiful with plenty of walkways and access to the pool and beach with a great snorkeling area. We even saw some sea turtles from the beach. The ocean was relatively calm in this area. The beach has eroded due to the storms over the winter so there is n\u2019t much room to sit on the beach at high tide. Also the beach is public so the hotel does n\u2019t have chairs service on the beach which seems to be the case in all of Maui. The pool area was very comfortable but the umbrellas are limited so on busy days it \u2019s best to get your seats early if you want shade.

Also we did n\u2019t get any information about any activity in resort as there is resort fee charged. Afterwards my room is unfortunately at second floor and that means the view is mainly garden. The room is standard as normal hotel no surprise. Breakfast is USD32 but just a few choices. The worst thing is that I can not enter my room after have my time at beach. The reason behind is that they failed to enter our continuous nights into system. Could you imagine if you are all wet and can not go into the room and have to walk 10mins to lobby.

Second time staying at this hotel last time was three years ago. it is a beautiful location with the best beach snorkeling in Kanapali but you pay a premium for that. I would rate the location a 5 but the overall 3 rating is based on the total experience. Total nightly charges we paid for ocean view in July the off season with AAA discout were 34 for room 14 room tax 34 state tax 29 resort fee charge and 23 for self parking each night. The resort charge and parking fee are ridiculous. I wish Sheraton would just build it into their prices even if this sort of practice has become more prevalent. The resort charge covers wi fi okay I get many other hotels charge for this too but also pool floats the shuttle to Lahaina and other things that should simply be included in the price if you ask me. Food is expensive here too feeding a family of four for dinner will run you 200 without alcohol unles you eat the simpler food by the pool then expect to pay around 100 again without alcohol. You are better off eating in Lahaina every night which is more fun anyway. What really disappointed me is how the pool is managed now which changed since our last visit 3 years ago. While there were a few cabanas for rent previously I would say roughly 14 of the seats by the pool are now only usable if you purchase them. These are covered spots that range anywhere from 55 per day two seats with retractable cover up to 200 per day cabana with little TV that 4 can use comfortably. I was really disappointed to see the increase in these covered spots that require you to pay for them. I realize this is a growing trend saw a lot of that in Vegas too but it is a fleecing for sure. Of course you can get up at 6 am and run down and put your towels out and get one of the free covered spots with umbrellas but we all know what a hassle that it and 12 of those formerly free covered spots are now gone because of the paid spots. My last complaint we reserved an ocean view but upon arrival were told that none were available so they were going to upgrade us to oceanfront usually at other locations I prefer oceanfront but not here because the oceanview rooms are closer to the pool. Unfortunately it was on the ground floor only room available we were told and there is a 5 foot hedge that impedes your view of the ocean unles you walk over to it and stand next to it might as well have been a garden view. Fortunately we pushed and were able to move to an ocean view the next day when one became available. Okay I am done complaining. on to the good stuff. The location is fantastic right on black rock where you have some of the best beach snorkeling in the Kanapali region. Not only is the beach wider here than others on the the same stretch but the water is typically calmer and you will see lots of fish by black rock. We also saw at least one turtle every day swimming very close to shore you can usually tell when a turtle is nearby because of the people that crowd around it in the water. The facilities have a very nice retro but modern vibe I believe built in the 60s. my parents met here. that still holds up today and has been nicely updated in the interior. The kids really enjoyed the pool too it has a form of lazy river in shape only the water does not move that you can float around in with the beanbag floats oh and I saw the floats referenced online as part of the resort fee is not that crazy. Sorry I know I said I was done complaining. The room was comfortable and modern. not sure what more to say. it is a room. The food while expensive was great and I could not get enough of the polside fish tacos or spicy Ahi poke bowl. In summary beautiful location but you pay for it. My review might seem a little harsh but having been here before I was just a little disappointed to find some of the changes that occurred especially by the pool.

The one downside is that we did not have a patio while most other rooms every room facing the ocean did. but we did have a partial ocean view which was great. There is a shuttle to take you to the shops nearby or to the town of Lahaina which is about 15 minutes down the road. The staff were lovely and so were the pools gym etc. it is unfortunate that even guests do not get an hour of free rental for beach rentals as we have found this with most other of the higher resorts but oh well.

We chose this hotel for the week of our wedding and I regret our choice. I do n\u2019t expect special treatment but of anytime in my life I would like to feel looked after by the hotel I chose for the week of my wedding. Unfortunately this hotel was a very bad choice. Even from check in I could sense the type of stay we were about to experience. The very first night we checked in we found 2 cockroaches in our room and even worse our bed. Nightmare start. It took 15 hours to move us to another room as staff were very slow in making this move happen. Everytime myself or my partner went to reception there was nobody there. Absolutely crazy for a property of this size. There were occasions where staff were in the back chatting and it was not their priority to come and assist guests. The sea was very dangerous and rough by this hotel and we found it quite scary the lack of lifeguards or signs or announcements. I would not have had a child at the beach here. In the lead up to the wedding we tried to book the dining under the stars again this was a very arduous process and I was n\u2019t getting responses so we chose somewhere else. The day of my wedding I had an issue with my dress steamer. I rang for any help that might be offered. Absolutely no help.

We upgraded our room to the \u201c ocean front room \u201d it was located really close to the beach. When we booked this time we booked \u201c ocean view \u201d not realizing all the technicalities of each room. We walked down to our room which was on the ground floor the key did n\u2019t work. After a day of travel you \u2019re a little exhausted and just want to relax for a second but we had to trek our way back up to the front desk to get another key we head back down we get into the room and start to unpack and a roach comes running out of the closet. My husband immediately called the front desk and they switched our room to I guess what is considered \u201c ocean front \u201d. it \u2019s on the other side of the hotel it takes forever to get to the pool or beach which is a little annoying. We have n\u2019t checked out yet but I keep seeing these 100 charges to my credit card and I \u2019m hoping they are charging us for the relocation for the roaches being in our initial room. Also if you booked recently you may want to call apparently they are doing construction to the hotel which is pretty loud when sitting at the Clive Dive bar or the beach. We had breakfast here one day and that was n\u2019t even that great for the 100 we paid which is such a bummer as I love this area but highly doubt that we \u2019l be back to this Sheraton location.", "offset": [371, 471], "date": "2019-10-06", "cpt": "2", "category": "beach"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "7babccdb-dd87-4f2d-abe2-1c2322574c17", "sentence": "Beautiful beachfront property and great customer service.

The room has newer furniture now but there is next to no place to put your stuff. Two small draws that just fits all you under garments socks and swim wear. One for me one for the husband. The rest you will need to hang like who wants to bother with that or you will keep in your suit case. And you will have to ask for More hangers.
