We stayed at FS Jimbaran Bay for the last 4 days of our honeymoon. We had been to 3 other Four Seasons Hampshire Langkawi and Bali Sayan on the same trip so Jimbaran Bay had a lot to live up to and it did not disappoint. First things first there are reviews on here about the building work. Yes there is part of the resort which is currently under going refurbishment and yes if you are really sensitive to noise then perhaps not the best time to go here but for us it really was not a problem. We were put in Villa 210 which was on the very edge of the resort and during the day if the noise was an issue we sat next to the waterfall pool which completely drowned out any whisper of drilling. I know a lot of guests were irate about this and the staff were managing as well as they could. From my perspective the only thing I would have said they could do better was communicating before we arrived so it was not a surprise. Okay now that bit is over let us focus on the rest of the review which can not find any other faults. After figuring out that it was a lot cheaper to arrange our own transport we had a private car take us between FS Sayan and FS Jimbaran Bay. This cost around \u00a3 20 which was a third of the price FS were to arrange but was pretty basic so you pay for what you get. We had a really warm welcome from the team as FS Jimbaran including Uday the resort manager who personally came up to us to say hello. As you expect from a Four Seasons the service was exceptional. it is what you pay for but they go out of the way so much that it is really hard not to be impressed. The villas are beautiful. We stayed in a beachfront one with a stunning private pool overlooking the yoga pavilion. The whole resort is styled on traditional Balinese villages which was noticeable as we did a tour through some villages when we were in Sayan. it is a pretty large resort compared to the cosiness of FS Sayan but it is certainly walkable and if you do not feel like walking the buggy service is free and very quick to get everywhere. The best part of this resort for us was the food. The standard of the dining is exceptional and a lot of that is down to the Sundara restaurant. Josh and the team did a great job and with a unique menu it was perfect and fitted our taste exactly. They outdid themselves by organising a lovely dinner for my wife and I on a cabana overlooking the sea on our last night. A special mention to Adi Wiraguna who really looked after us well thank you. If you are hungry and it is Sunday we definitely recommend the brunch there which is about 40 for all you can eat. Pretty good value for the kind of food you get.

We loved talking with the staff and waiters and learning more about the Balinese culture especially during this week where they were celebrating the Kuningan holy day. What a sweet culture. More on the staff later in the review. At Taman Wantilan we had a late lunch on Friday and one of our servers Ayu Rai gave us a beautiful overview of the holy day coming up the next day.

We were there for 6 nights on 4 occasions the main pool and on one occasion the beach were closed from 3 pm due to weddings and there were a huge group of loud American investors from Edward Jones there infiltrating the resort. At one point BOTH the quiet pool and Coconut Grove were closed and we were only told the day before. Why pay so much money to stay somewhere where you can not enjoy the facilities if you want to stay somewhere exclusive this place is not for you. The beach front pool area Sundara is open to outsiders who can use it during the day. So the place gets overcrowded over the weekend. That also means you get downmarket rif raf from outside coming in to your resort who can not afford to stay at FS coming to use your facilities. Sorry but I am not paying extortionate prices to share facilities with downmarket rif raf constantly taking selfies in the pool and being noisy. You could argue that the FS guests can use the quiet pool instead but as stated above the quiet pool was constantly closed from 3 pm for other events so where else do you expect us to go the service whilst excellent was a little overbearing. Specifically we were asked by every single staff repeatedly what our plans for the day is. it is fine for a day or two but if you are staying there for 6 nights it gets really annoying when every single staff member grill you about what your plans are. it is a beach resort what do you expect us to do. Chill out dude. I think this is the way they were trained which is quite surprising. We stayed at Four Seasons Sayan and was only asked about our plans once during our stay even though there was a lot more to do there. The constant grilling at this resort is so unnecessary and I suggest you should retrain your staff to ask something else if they want to engage in small talk wish there was more option for bog standard local food. Perhaps have more of such selection at Taman Wantilan. The food served at Sundara is not local food but more Asian fusion food. As a result we had to leave the resort for local food in the evenings which is not good for your business. Sadly the constant closing for your facilities with short notice was the main deal breaker. I do not wish to return to this resort there are other resorts in Bali which make their guests feel more welcome without such ridiculous interruptions to accommodate external events.", "offset": [1127, 1212], "date": "2016-09-29", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "a42aaf8c-1bc3-4022-ac74-79f96fd48f96", "sentence": "Nice service property needs a facelift. We stayed at this resort for three nights in September and overall we enjoyed our time there. The service was pretty good we were surprised how quickly the staff remembered and addressed us by our names. The staff was generally helpful attentive and friendly. The part of the beach in front of the hotel was quiet and good for a lazy break. The restaurant bar Sundara was a standout not only because of its food but particularly its creative cocktails. We were told that a mixologist from Barcelona visited once a few months to mix up some new cocktails. What makes it short a little short of a top score for us is the property which is showing its age especially in the common areas except for Sundara and its clubAlso the club pool which is open to external guests. could get a tad busy at times. Renovation is ongoing at some villas so hopefully next time we could try them out. All told this time we like it slightly better than the nearby same level InterContinental which is also suffered from the aging property.", "offset": [595, 807], "date": "2016-11-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "504063a9-dedf-4caf-ae25-ad2f4a9e4bd5", "sentence": "Beautiful Property Sundara Excels Note to Parents. The most disappointing thing about our stay was the weather. 4 days of gloom gray and rain to begin our Bali 3 week tour. That said the staff of the resort more than made up with their graciousness and attentiveness. We ventured off the property to eat at other resorts several times and never found anything that compared to Sundara. so it quickly became our favorite restaurant to visit. and the menu never got old. My wife and I were there to kick off a birthday anniversary celebration. and while the villas are beautiful they are close together. That would not be an issue except that not all parents are considerate of their neighbors. 6 AM start with the yelling splashing kids on one side of us. up until 11 PM on the other including drone flights during the day interrupting our relaxation by our pool. Four Seasons staff did not seem able to impact the behavior on either side. So be ready that this may not be the quiet romantic get away you envisioned. Also many young children at the beach pool during the day but that is why you pay the for a private villa with pool.", "offset": [1016, 1132], "date": "2017-07-27", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "31a2158d-88f6-43b8-aa7f-0012ea1e5149", "sentence": "Great place for vacation.

We stayed here for 4 nights in Jan Feb in a Deluxe Villa Villa 242 to be precise after 3 nights at the Chedi in Ubud which was also fantastic. Now I am used to staying in the FS properties across the world and know they come at a considerable expense my only qualm here is this was one of the highest I have paid per night and was expecting something a little bit more for this price point nevertheless I still loved my stay here. I was surprised too the hotel was so empty from the communal pools to the restaurants you virtually had the place to yourself which I liked too perhaps if they worked on their dynamic pricing a little better they might have some more business. Things I lovedThe villa design and locations are stunning they only got renovated about a year ago so you can tell they are fully up to date beautifully appointed and design is exceptional. Everything is modern and elegantly done with lots of airy living space. My favourite was the outdoor area you have seperate sections to catch the sun or shade depending on your preference and the pools were warm and inviting. The bathroom is also a showstopper had many baths in there with the incense on and outdoor and indoor showers it really was quite a treat on the rainy days. Service was exceptional and the staff super friendly I really liked the Russian lady I forgot her name and the intern buggy drivers. It was nice seeing the GM around a couple of times Uday he gave some useful dinner tips and you felt he genuinely cared about his hotel and experience his guests were having. The room for sure was the best part of the hotel and you can happily never leave it just order room service. Actually when it comes to food I thouhgt it was sublime everything we ordered tasted so good and I was surprised I thought the pricing for food was actually quite reasonable. I loved the fact that they knew I was gluten free as it must have come up on their system everytime I ordered and halal too it is always the little things that make the biggest difference. The main pool where the Sundara restaurant i is amazing. The pool is so big I have not seen a pool that long before and right on the beach. My favourite was the beach cabana beds they were so comfortable and had retractable roofs. Service here was exceptional no waiting around for service plenty of attentive staff around and the food again is perfection even have happy hour at 5 7PM. We also visitoing Coconut grove their private beach section which had hammocks loungers and beds. it is really quite chic and great that you have privacy as most of the beach is actually public. I had breakfast to the room a few times and I highly recommend it they set it up so beautifully you feel like a kingConcierge was great and restaurant recommendations were superb loved Cuca def visit if you want to get out of the resort exceptional food along with Kayaputi at the St Regis for a very fine dining experience. Things I think could have been beterYoga sessions should be free not charged for in house guests they were free in the Chedi every morning and for the price I am paying per night surely FS can make them complimentary. Some sessions were but most in the morning were not that said the location is stuningI felt the lobby and main restaurant. where breakfast is served and Sundara inside were already tired and dated I believe it was already renovated but for me it just did not wow me as an entrance like the Bulgari hotel or even St Regis does in Bali just seemed bland and old fashioned. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was a bit inconsistent I had to wait both times for my beef bacon even after telling them the first time. My gluten free dishes took longer. Some of the juices offered were not fresh so considering how quiet it was and the amount of staff around they really did not need to be any mishaps. In summary I highly recommend staying here but it does have some stiff competition with both the St Regis and Bulgari but I am an FS fan and like to always choose them first as you know you will always get the highest quality in terms of service and grounds.", "offset": [964, 1117], "date": "2018-02-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "49652f38-a457-4244-81c4-1b8f82923b8c", "sentence": "Mixed emotions. Great villa great views a four seasons classic. Asked to change from first villa allocated even though it was front line because the resort faces north. Most of the terrace was taken up by a big pool but hardly any room for the sun loungers which were in the shade from about mid day. Nothing was too much trouble and we relocated to a villa with a side garden as well as the large pool terrace. Next gripe was the second restaurant is closed for refurb until April so a choice if one. The villa terrace et al is so nice we have had room service in the garden quite a bit. To recommend the outlook is lovely the staff are attentive and very friendly there is a great gym yoga and ca n\u2019t recommend highly enough the cookery school. Chef Chris early morning takes you on a tour of the local fish and vegetable markets back to the hotel to learn how to make Balinese dishes 5 or 6 courses interactive and great fun. Then you eat what you make. Perfect. And Chef Chris is the perfect host enthusiastic knowledgeable and funny. One of the best mornings for a long time.

Four Seasons Bali at Jimbaran Bay. The Four Seasons is a personal favorite of mine. Though not as consistent as Fairmont or St Regis in terms of quality the Four Seasons Bali at Jimbaran Bay definitely got it right. Four Seasons Jimbaran made headlines when it first opened in 194 as the first ever large scale all villa property and first to incorporate a plunge pool in every villa. Not to mention this hillside property boast an unparalleled views of the beautiful Jimbaran Bay. Now to the five areas I came up with for reviewing hotels 1 Price 2 Location 3 Resort and Amenities 4 Villa and 5 Service. Let me go ahead and discuss the individual aspects of my hotel experience. PRICE Peak season would be December 24 January 5 High season would be July 1 September 30 1. The Jimbaran Bay Villa \u2019s regular rate ranges from 90120Night depending on the seasonGarden Villas No bay view ranges from 7010Night depending on the seasonThere are a few additional discounts you can take advantage of. There are Advance Purchase with 20 discount and Stay Longer with Fourth Night Free. 10 Room Service Charge and 10 VATLOCATIONFour Seasons also has two properties in Bali. Like the Ritz Carlton Four Seasons Jimbaran \u2019s sister property the Four Seasons Sayan is also located in Ubud with views of the lush Ayung River Valley. Four Seasons Jimbaran is conveniently located close to the airport which is about 20 minutes drive through typical Balinese traffic. In fact you can see the airport \u2019s runway from the resort. A perfect place to plane spot for AV geeks like me. If you find the food to be too expensive at the two in house restaurants you can instead dine at the local seafood beachfront restaurants just a few minutes walk from the resort. In addition just a few minutes drive out of the resort you \u2019l find yourself in the bustling district of Denpasar filled with shops caf\u00e9 restaurants and fun nightlife. RESORT and AMENITIESFour Seasons Jimbaran offers a total of 147 villas and 9 residences in a private compound just a few steps from the beach. Each of these luxurious villas has its own private plunge pool perfect for those warm and humid Balinese weather. When it comes to dining options the resort offers two in house restaurants the Taman Wantilan and Sundara. The Taman Wantilan restaurant is an open air dining room just above the infinity pool offering a nice view of the Jimbaran Bay. The restaurant specializes in Asian and Western cuisines. Next is Sundara a beachfront restaurant which offers a more up scale dining and lounging experience and specializes in modern Asian cuisines. The resort also features 3 separate pool areas for you and your family to enjoy. The first is the main infinity edged pool located on a hillside just below the Taman Wantilan restaurant. Then one level down is a shallow pool with waterfall and a hot and cold plunge pools. Last but not the least the instagram worthy 57 meter long lap pool at the Sundara restaurant. When it comes to things to do the resort provides guest with a weekly calendar of scheduled complimentary and paid activities including yoga water sports tours and wellness offerings. One highlight is the Balinese Dance presentation at one of the resort temples offered twice a week. VILADuring check in we received an upgrade to a lovely villa overlooking partial the gorgeous blue waters of Jimbaran Bay. This private one bedroom pool villa features 250 Sqm of indoor and outdoor living space with a 13 Sqm infinity edge pool. Inspired by a typical Balinese courtyard house the thatch roof sleeping bathing and living dining pavilions are secluded within a private walled tropical garden. The spacious bedroom and bathroom are air conditioned while the living area bale is open air. The bathroom includes a spa like soaking tub and has both indoor and outdoor showers. We very much love and enjoyed the Villa \u2019s overall aesthetic and ambience for it brings out an authentic Balinese experience. SERVICEWe received great service during our stay at the Four Seasons Jimbaran. Bagus and Martini from the front desk were very accommodating and detailed about what the resort has to offer. I am also personally grateful for the housekeeping team for the flowery birthday surprise they \u2019ve arranged on the bed after we got back from a busy day. We did n\u2019t even want to sleep on it on fear of ruining the nicely decorated bed. On our last day Ms Mary Bowens the Director of Rooms surprised us with a delicious fruit plate paired with a good wine delivered straight to our villa. Overall the warm hospitality and great costumer service were very much apreciatedBOTOM LINEWith concerns of inconsistency in terms of quality across the Four Seasons brand I am happy to say that the Four Seasons Jimbaran did not fail to deliver and certainly exceeded our expectations. Nestled on a hillside property overlooking the calm blue waters of the beautiful Jimbaran Bay Four Seasons Jimbaran provided us with an oasis of serenity amidst the bustling Balinese city. Despite being a 20year old resort the property is very much well maintained and still adheres to the high standards you expect from the brand. From the authentic Balinese inspired villas \u2014 with a modern twist \u2014 to the daily activities the resort offers the Four Seasons Jimbaran was definitely a perfect place to end our 2wek vacation here in Bali.", "offset": [2848, 2933], "date": "2019-03-27", "cpt": "2", "category": "pool"}]}
