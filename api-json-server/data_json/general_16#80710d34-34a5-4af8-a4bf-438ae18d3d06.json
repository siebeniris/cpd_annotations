We had such high expectations for this hotel. My husband and I decided to splurge for the weekend while we were in Chicago to stay at the Ritz. We were disappointed overall. One good thing is that the hotel is in a great location connected to Water tower plaza mall. The elevator even stops on the second floor which is steps away from Macys. The hotel lobby is located on the 12th floor when you walk in the hotel. You have to take an elevator to the hotel desk. When we checked in there were employees everywhere so it was confusing why we had to wait in line to check in. The lady that checked us in was very nice and even walked us to the elevator. Others were given a bottle of water however we were not offered anything. The room was decent size for a downtown hotel. It was not anything impressive. We did have a nice view of the lake. The bed was very comfortable. The toilet was very low to the ground which was odd. The hotels towels were disappointing for such a luxury hotel large just not soft. I called the front desk to order a bucket of ice for a bottle of wine. After 30 minutes of waiting and no ice I called again. Still no ice. I finally had to go to the front desk and ask again why it would take so long to get ice. When we got back from dinner finally the ice had been delivered. We did enjoy the nightly music in the lobby area. The band was excellent. We had problems with our TV it did not have sound for most of the channels. We ended up renting a redbox movie since there is a DVD player in the room. Finally on our last day we asked for a 10 check out which they approved. The issue is that when we got back from breakfast our keys no longer worked. Nothing more frustrating than getting all the way to your room to find this inconvenience. The housekeeper was not able to unlock our door. We had to wait for security to come unlock it. We usually stay at the Mariot Magnificent Mile hotel on Michigan avenue. We will stay there next time and mark this hotel off of our list.

The suite we were assigned was perfect and it included two bathrooms with one of them being recently remodeled so it was pleasant. We had two breakfasts and a lunch in the dining room and the breakfasts were excellent because the food was very enjoyable and the service was top notch with Bernardo and Michael helping us. The lunch was not so good because it took over 35 minutes for the food to be served and this was after we asked Michael a bus staff member to check on it for us. The problem seemed to be the primary waiter Robert because he was aloof and actually made it sound like it was our problem that the lunch was taking a long time to prepare because it was a hot sandwich. Robert told us the chicken and the egg had to be cooked so that is what was causing the delay. When the food came to the table the piece of chicken was about 14 inch thick so I am guessing it actually took 3 4 minutes to cook it on the grill. While this was annoying enough given the restaurant was about empty the situation became more irritating after I completed a survey distributed by the hotel and mentioned my experience with the lunch. Jake the Assistant Beverage Manager called me the next day but we were never actually able to talk about the problems because he never returned my phone calls as he initially promised. I am almost positive I called him three times to discuss the situation.

We stayed at the Ritz in Chicago for 3 nights in a club level room through New Years. As virtuoso stars members we were upgraded from a city view room to a lakeview room. We were hoping that we would be able to view some of the fireworks on NYE but we were told all those rooms were unavailable but the ballroom would be open for fireworks viewing and a toast. Unfortunately with young children that was n\u2019t an option so we ended up watching fireworks on the TV while the kids were asleep. But of course this is not what earned the Ritz 2 stars1. There was a mixup with my reservation confirmation. The day of check in I printed my confirmation from the Ritz website that showed that I was upgraded to a Lakeview Suite room. This would have been perfect because these rooms face the pier so we can view the fireworks even if the kids fell asleep. When checking in we were given a regular lakeview room not the suite. I asked what happened but no one bothered to look into it and just blamed me. my travel agent that we \u201c misunderstood \u201d that the lakeview room was facing north not south. There was no misunderstanding we knew the room we booked would n\u2019t have a pier view but their own system showed an upgrade to the suite that morning. No one cared enough to look into it and just kept telling me I \u2019m mistaken. despite that I have the printout with the suite upgrade printed on it from their own website2. Three calls and 2 hours. That \u2019s how long it took to get a rolaway that I requested at the time of my reservation that was assured to be \u201c already in the room \u201d when we checked in3. We went to the club lounge our first night and it was overrun by twens in pajamas while the parents chaperones let them do whatever they wanted. They were grabbing the food as it came out not using tongs or utensils and running around. One of them had a severe cold flu and was coughing and sneezing all over the food. They ran out of certain items and not refreshed. We stopped eating and went back up to the room. Unfortunately not before my youngest was exposed to the sick kid that was coughing and sneezing every where. After we returned home my child had a 102 fever and started coughing4. Breakfast at the lounge the next morning was really bad. Ran out of coffee in carafes the espresso machine was down ran out of juices and bottled water there was no bread. it was exactly what I wanted to avoid. There was literally no difference between the Ritz club lounge for 200 more a night than the free lounge I get at Hiltons or Sheratons as an elite status member5. Elevators were horrendous. You had to wait through 2 3 packed elevators before you can squeeze into one. Some people went up just to go down. It was ridiculous. The Portland Trailblazers were staying at this hotel so it was kinda neat to be stuck waiting for elevators with these guys. But we would have rather not been stuck waiting at al6. We were never able to make a reservation at the spa. We tried calling a few times and either no one answers or we were out on 10 min holds. We did get a callback they were understaffed in the spa and had long lines but that should n\u2019t be the guests \u2019 problem7. The second night at the club lounge consisted of super dry sliders and hot dogs. Taking another playbook from Hilton and Sheraton8. The pool has limited hours for children. And it was frigid cold definitely not the 82degre water they promised. There \u2019s also a lack of chairs and tables. They also ran out of towels and we had to wait for more9. My kids wanted regular ice cream not the froyo at the mall. so I asked the lounge. Nope. No one has ice cream. Was told I can pay the full 5 service charge gratuity and have room service deliver 8 scoop of ice cream to the lounge yes that would have been a 15 scoop of ice cream or we can walk across the street to Ghiradeli. We chose to go across the street but probably did n\u2019t help the cold that was incubating in my youngest child from exposure in the lounge. Sigh. They also ran out of chocolate chip cookies as the lounge. Bah humbug. The twens group must have checked out on our second night because we never saw them again after breakfast. The lounge on the 3rd night NYE was finally something I would have expected from a 5star hotel lounge. Dim sum sushi and seafood shrimp cocktail and crab claws. This was also the first time they seemed adequately staffed in the 3 nights of my stay. The staff actually helped me for the first time. And like someone else said the bed is amazingly comfortable. The location also can not be beat. Having the ability to go to the mall without stepping foot outside was great. And the candy cart was a fun addition for the kids even though there was no chocolate and the gummy bears were stale. But none of these make up for the shortcomings in service. Throughout my stay it was clear that the hotel was understaffed and not prepared for the NYE weekend crowd. Instead of anticipating my needs as a guest I was left waiting and waiting during my precious vacation time and often having to forgo what I wanted in the interest of time. I have never been so frustrated during a 5star hotel stay in my life. There \u2019s few opportunities to spend quality time with family and it felt like this was wasted.

I have to agree with the poster below the service at this Ritz left a lot to be desired. We checked into the Ritz this past Friday for our 16th wedding anniversary. We are Mariot Gold Members and we had booked the room using loyalty points. We have received far better customer service at the Westin just down the street and redeeming our points for the Westin instead of the Ritz would have been a much better value. To say that we received poor customer service is an understatement. Not a single thing went well from check in until check out. Here were the isues1. Poor Communication Our room was understandably not ready upon early check in at 2 pm. We happily stored our bags and were told we would get a text when the room was ready. Though check in was officially at 4 we were told it would likely be earlier but not guaranteed. By 345 we had not heard anything so we went back to see if the room was ready only to be told that it had been ready for a while. We did not complain about not being notified as promised. There was no acknowledgement or apology that we had not been contacted. 2 Inability to use mobile key and no explanation At check in I asked if we had been assigned a mobile key. The person who checked us in told us no you had to request this in advance. to which I replied I did through the ap earlier today. We did not receive a response as to why we could not be assigned a mobile key. No acknowledgment as to why no explanation no apology. 3. No explanation of Gold Member benefits. No recognition at all. When I asked what the benefits at this hotel were I was simply handed a card that described the benefits. Also I realized after checking out that we were not provided with the 500 point welcome gift we were entitled to. Again no acknowledgment of member status no apology for not explaining the benefits. 4. Poor information. Next we asked if there was a house car as many Ritz Carlton \u2019s have. She said yes and I asked how far does it travel we have a 515pm reservation at Alinea. She said \u201c oh that should be fine since we routinely recommend that restaurant \u201d. I said \u201c great I assume it \u2019s first come first served \u201d. She replied \u201c yes but call down 15 minutes before and I \u2019m sure the concierge will accommodate you \u201d. See more below. 5. Poor Follow Through. When our room was ready we were given our keys and were told that our bags were already in the room. By now it was 4 pm so we went upstairs to our room to get ready for our 515pm dinner reservation but our bags were not actually present. We called down and were told that they would be sent up. No acknowledgment of the mistaken information. 20 minutes later still no bags. We were getting anxious because we had no bags and no ability to get ready for our dinner reservation. So I called back again. The woman who answered was very rude did not attempt to pronounce my name correctly and simply said the bag was \u201c in queue \u201d. I mentioned that we were going to be late for dinner if we did not have the bags soon and asked if I could simply come down to get the bag. I was told she could not reach the bellman. Then she interrupted me while I was speaking and said \u201c hold on hold on hold on the bell man told me it would be up shortly \u201d. I thanked her and it arrived shortly thereafter but not once did we receive an apology for the miscomunications or delays6. Further poor service When we were finally ready we called down to the Concierge to see about getting the house car as it was suggested that we do. But no answer. So we went downstairs around 450pm and asked the concierge if the house car was available. She then stated that the car was not available until 530pm. When we mentioned what we were told at check in instead of simply apologizing for the misinformation we were provided the Concierge simply said \u201c the car is first come first served calling down would not have mattered \u201d. So we easily took an Uber instead7 Unfulfilled requests. The next day we used the ap to request some services we requested them in the morning before we left for the day. By 6 pm upon our return the services had not been fulfilled. We called the front desk to have the services fulfilled. We did not receive any kind of acknowledgement that the requests had gone unnoticed. 8 The safe was not working so we called down to the front desk. The safe was fixed while we were out but we were left an odd note that said essentially the safe has been fixed next time do not call us call X8. Poor last impression. On the day we checked out I went to the front desk to drop off the keys. We were never even asked how our stay was 9. No follow up. I find it best to communicate during our stay. So we emailed the general manager and guest relations on day one and still to this day have not heard anything back. 10. Prior indicator Prior to our arrival my husband had been communicating with the Concierge in advance of our stay to have a special surprise waiting for me in the room for our anniversary. There was some initial communication saying that XYZ could be accomplished and my husband sent an email back saying exactly what he wanted. Luckily the surprise was waiting but he had never actually received a response back indicating that the plan was confirmed and would be executed. While none of the instances I describe above seem like a huge deal in and of itself lumping all of these things together within the first two hours of our arrival and into the stay for the weekend provided for a poor first impression and is not indicative of the level of service we would hope to receive at the Ritz. In retrospect I would have saved our loyalty points and redeemed them at a different hotel. Next time we will stay at the Westin down the street.", "offset": [3265, 3388], "date": "2018-10-03", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}, {"id": 27, "uid": "f33970c3-a3a6-49aa-b24c-33c83dacb74b", "sentence": "I stayed at the hotel for an event and was not disappointed in the quality of everything. First and foremost it is absolutely beautiful and every lobby restaurant and ballroom in the place is stunning. Beyond that the food I had at said event was very good. The potatoes were just cooked enough the tomato soup was especially good with the bread and the desert appetizers were filling and delicious.

The five star rating is for the room. Super comfortable bed gorgeous views from a high floor room and quiet quiet space. There were a few things that other reviewers mentioned that I would agree with. Oddities outlets on one side of bed only no full length mirror in room or bathroom and the use of single use bottle water seems super wasteful. We enjoyed happy hour one afternoon good menu and prices. The hotel location is terrific. Lobby check in was understated. Wished for more details such as knowing about coffee available in am or offered fitness classes. When we arrived to check in our room was n\u2019t ready. Front desk said they would call. We ended up meandering around local sights but never got a call. Arrived back at hotel at 4 and our bags were already in the room. Clearly at some point the room was ready. Overall we \u2019d stay again because of the generous sized room and ideal location.", "offset": [588, 639], "date": "2019-07-20", "cpt": "2", "category": "general"}]}
