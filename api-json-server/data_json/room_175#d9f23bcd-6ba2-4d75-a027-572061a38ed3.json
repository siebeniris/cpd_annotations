I and my traveling companion had an ok experience here great location nice sized room the usual comfortable Westin bed. And I was very impressed with the womens locker room at the small but functional fitness center it includes a real working sauna the refrigerated towels are a nice touch and is spotlessly clean. The same however could not be said for the rooms. I had read a couple of previous reviews complaining about this so I checked out the first room I was given pretty carefully in this regard before settling in. The marble counter in the bathroom was covered with easily spotted crud that I could remove with a slight rub of my finger and it was so disgusting that I asked to be moved to another room. The second room was bigger a corner ask for this and had a better and far more open view I was told the first room I was given had the best view available and it was boxed in by higher buildings and was completely claustrophobia inducing in short the woman who checked me in simply lied to me when I asked her about this. But the second room was. also revolting when it came to the cleanliness of surfaces or rather the lack of cleanliness. so much so that even Anthony of the front desk who helped me get the second room and was very nice about it had to agree with me when I pointed it out to him. The bathroom counter was cleaner than the first room but the desk under its glass top was covered with old crumbs dust and stains. The stand by the bed also had some easily removable crud and the coffee stand was very dusty. These are all things that some actual elbow grease would take care of in a few minutes. I decided not to move again and simply bought some baby wipes at the Rite Aid across the street and did some of my own cleaning in order to not be grossed out. I do not think I have ever had to do that at a Westin hotel before the floor and beds seemed very clean in both rooms so it appears to be a lack of care with wiping dusting only. Additionally the cleaning schedule was pretty erratic. On the first morning of my stay after the first night around 9 am the maid approaching my room to clean it told me since I told her I needed the room for an hour or so longer in the morning after my workout that I should let the front desk know when I was out so that she would not have to keep checking to see if I was gone. I get the inconvenience but is not checking on such things part of her job. also not being grudging about it. On the second day the person sharing the room with me returned at 3 pm to find that the room had not yet been cleaned. Other things there was only one trash can in the room in the bathroom nothing by the desk or coffee maker which is inconvenient and for all the hotels supposed green ness no bin is provided for recycling. Also I decided not to deal with it but the shower bath thing was starting to come unscrewed from the wall I could still use the shower but it did not feel as solid as it could have. Finally the hotel service dept engages in a strange practice which is to call you on the phone after you have asked for any item an extra glass sugar etc to check that you received it. This is pretty disruptive especially in the early morning and also unnecessary since if I do not get what I have asked for. I will be calling you back. Last but not least previous reviews make reference to bowls of free fruit in the hallways. I saw no such thing over the entirety of my stay 4 nights. Overall insist on a non claustrophic making room and check all the counter tops before you accept the room you are given. As much as I usually like Westins I am not sure I had stay here again given other options in Phily.", "offset": [31, 150], "date": "2017-01-10", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "58b1a050-5b8d-4050-8a4e-db66ace4e58b", "sentence": "The hotel is very conveniently located within walking distance of many Philadelphia attractions and good restaurants.
