We stayed for second time at this property using a suite night upgrade. The upgrade again did NOT clear. Really have a hard time understand how this would ever clear if it does nt clear on a one night stay. I understand there are a lot of platinum members these days and it can get full there but what is the point of the benefit with SPG if platinum members should be upgraded already. I would expect this to put a bit more weight on the upgrade. We were given a deluxe ocean view room again in building 6. I love the location as it has excellent views and is right on the water. The rooms have gone thru a bit of a refresh and were very clean. The beds are as comfortable as ever. Large rooms with large bathrooms and a large balcony looking toward Lania. Only bad thing about this build can be the parking. Gets full over there early. Got to make one comment about those that feel they can park right in front of a sign that clearly says for service vehicles only. Every day there were cars parked there and it made it difficult for those working there to do what they need to do. It could not be more clear that is NOT a parking area. This just screams to me that the self centered JERKS from the mainland are staying with you. Its a harsh reminder every morning that the the beautiful attitude of Hawaiian lifestyle is getting tainted each time they visit. Leave that at home would you. I realize parking fills up but is it really that difficult to walk once and a while. I wish the hotel would start ticketing these people. It wo nt make them stop doing it as people like that do nt change but they could put that money to good use elsewhereThis is our favorite property on the island and we have stayed at all the best ones other than the four seasons. Is you are looking for real hawaiian feel then this is the place to be. The grounds are beautiful and the pool is excellent. The location is perfect right next to black rock and has a excellent beach right there. I suggest you rent a Gazebo for the day. Only like75 and really worth it if you plan on staying out all day. We were again given a full breakfast buffet as platinum members. The restaurant is a wonderful way to start the day. Nice and quite when we were there and beautiful views. Just not right on the beach. They have a great selection and the wait staff are friendly. This is really what Hawaii is all about. It is one of the oldest hotels on the island but they do a great job of keeping it looking great. Do nt go there expecting the Ritz that s down the road a way. But Hawaii to me is nt about staying at a Ritz. It is about feeling the real Hawaiian culture and friendliness. The Ritz is nice but again just an over prices resort that happens to be on Maui. The Sheraton has not lost sight of what Hawaii is all about. Please is you are one of those snotty guest that expects everyone to weight on your hand and foot go down the road and enjoy the RitzWe did also enjoy another visit to the spa here. The couples message is a great way to start the day. Very reasonable and you can get a discount voucher at the Costco. I really feel this is the best hotel on the island. Hyat would be a close second but they do nt have much of a beach. If you are trying to decide where stay and want a laid back Hawaiian feel this is the place to stay. If you turned off by something a little rough around the edges then this probably is nt the place for you. I thank you again for making this such a great stay and hope to be back soon.", "offset": [2388, 2448], "date": "2015-05-31", "cpt": "0", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "628ed997-2f94-4d98-8e80-b2def834d56d", "sentence": "Beautiful resort with great staff.

Our overall experience was fantastic and we will certainly stay here again if we venture back to Maui. The restaurants were good but a little pricey too be expected. The pool area was great as well. The beach in front of the hotel has eroded out of the hotels control but that was a little disappointing. The snorkeling at Black Rock is really great. We saw a ton of fish an eel and a sea turtle. I highly recommend bringing your own snorkel gear or renting some from the resort 8 hr. The only thing I did not care for was the added resort fee 25 day and parking fee 1st night fee and then 20 day after that.

If you \u2019re looking for a less noisy kids pool use the one closest to Black Rock. Be advised that if you want front row pool people start placing towels on chairs before 60am so you need to be an early riser. Also if you leave your belongings abandoned for more than an hour or so the hotel may remove them so other guests can use those chairs. Otherwise the beach is just meters away and you can always stake a spot there. Whalers Village is just a short 7 min walk away. There are numerous shops and restaurants there. There is also an ABC store there where you can pick up water snacks and alcohol to put in the room fridge. The hotel also offers a shuttle into Lahaina there is a a stop at a mall and grocery store should you want more than the ABC offers. Definitely a good way for families to save some We booked Roberts of Hawaii to shuttle us to and from the the airport hotel.

I was so excited to stay at the Sheraton Maui for my Honeymoon. I picked it so that we could enjoy the resort feel and my husband and I could just relax knowing everything was taken care of. We paid more than we would normally pay because we were interested in the amenities a resort provides. I really wanted it to be a special trip for my husband. Our first two days were relatively uneventful but not without hiccups. When we arrived the staff was pleasant but there was no lei or little special treat to make you get into the resort mood that I have experienced at less expensive Hawaiian resorts in the past. I let them know it was our honeymoon and we were n\u2019t even congratulated. We found our room and it was fine except that the AC is either on full blast or not at all. We went down to the pool and enjoyed one of the pool bar restaurants where the waitress was very nice and gave us some great recommendations for places to visit. We did notice as everyone else has mentioned that there were not enough pool chairs at the pool. The next day we noticed a steep decline in service at the restaurants. Our waiter in the morning seemed distracted and missed my husbands order. Finally we would n\u2019t care but we were in a hurry to get to the ferry and could n\u2019t wait for them to cook it for him. The waiter was very nice and offered for him to get whatever he wanted from the buffet but my husband was feeling grumpy and we had to go. The next day we tried to eat at the buffet again and my husband enjoyed his food but they ran out of a lot and had long wait times to replenish it 10 minutes for more oatmeal and no one came to refill our coffee or water which was frustrating because again we were in a relative hurry and the buffet was rather expensive. The next day we skipped breakfast at the hotel and ate off property but we came back to the bar restaurant we had previously enjoyed. This time the staff seemed again distracted no one came to greet us once we did flag someone down and ordered it took a while to get our food and no one came to refill our water or our drinks. The man who was working was covering too many tables which I think was the same issue at the buffet. The entire experience up to this point was not living up to what we expected service was lacking it did n\u2019t feel special and every little thing was an upcharge or a hassle. But we were still ignoring the bad and just enjoying the vacation and Maui in general. The next morning things got much worse. We were up early to take a day tour and noticed a paper posted in the elevator that said there was a work stoppage and that housekeeping service would be effected as well as the restaurants. It was worded in a way that made it seem like services would be slightly impacted and did n\u2019t spell out what was actually about to happen. When we got back from our trip there no more information slipped under our door or left in a message. There was trash left down our hallway and a pile of towels and toiletries on a table near the elevator. What the strike actually meant is that there is no housekeeping service to the rooms you can pick up your own towels though. All the bars and restaurants are closed. They do have a bunch of what appear to be teenagers serving a limited menu of maybe 7 items in one of the buildings and running the buffet. No one from the hotel thought that maybe they should consider people with dietary restrictions when making up their menu. The kids working the room seem nice but burgers in take out containers being served with plastic cutlery is n\u2019t what I signed up for when I paid more to stay at a nice resort. When you come back from a tour you do n\u2019t want to arrange for transportation to other hotels so you can eat somewhere else. The closing of the pool bar saddens us the most because we came here for the pool and planned to spend the last few days of our honeymoon out there enjoying the amenities and relaxing before heading back to work. Tonight they left trash bags by our door without any explanation. Judging from the debris in the hallway I think we are supposed to bundle up dirty towels or maybe the trash and throw it out there. It would be nice if they told us or updated us at all. I went to the desk last night to ask what they were going to do to make this better for the guests and all they offered was to waive the 26 daily resort fee. I feel like this is a good beginning but they act like not having these amenities is n\u2019t really a big deal and that they \u2019re doing us a favor by offering anything. I think that \u2019s BS. People paid more to stay here precisely for the things that are no longer available and the price difference when I was booking between hotels with fewer amenities and this resort was much more than 26 a day. I plan to approach the front desk again tomorrow and will amend this review if they do anything to rectify the situation. I bear no ill will to those on the picket lines. If this is how corporate for this hotel sees fit to treat paying guests I can only imagine how they treat their staff.", "offset": [4999, 5117], "date": "2018-10-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 11, "uid": "5942b46f-2c07-476c-8586-15259597bc64", "sentence": "Poor experience.

As a business traveler I am a Mariot loyalist and when we had the opportunity to stay at this property run by Mariot we snapped it up due to location amenities etc. Somehow it slipped by me that there is a strike going on so we found out when we hit the front desk late after a full day of travel to get here. The front desk staff immediately educated us on the current situation and informed us that due to the strike the amenities would be limited at best. 1. No housekeeping during our stay. No refreshed sheets towels replenished water bottles. 2. Limited food hours. If you snooze you \u2019re leaving the property to eat. Imagine laying by the pool time slipping and ops its 215 and your starving. Get your car keys and leave the beach because you have to drive to get something to eat. Oh and breakfast is 22 per person and it \u2019s pretty awful. 3. The staff is pretty disgruntled and talk pretty openly about how bad the situation is. 4. I \u2019m pregnant and they placed us in building 6 which is the farthest building from the lobby pool restaurants. We asked them to switch us to a room closer to accommodate.

This was honestly the worst customer service experience I have ever had. The staff was on strike during our stay which was for our wedding week and they did an excellent job of making sure that no one could enjoy their vacation anywhere near the property. In addition to almost all of the restaurants and room service being closed there were protesters screaming into megaphones on the beach every single day of our ten day trip multiple times a day. Try relaxing while listening to people chant for an hour it is great. We were initially disappointed to learn about the restaurants being closed but could have gotten over that. The protesting made it absolutely impossible to enjoy your time at the resort. I ended up talking to the protesters at some point and was told that they announced that they would be striking this month to the hotel 6 months ago if negotiations were not held and the company did absolutely nothing to negotiate with them until they started striking. So the hotel knew for 6 months that all of their guests experiences would be ruined this month they did nothing to work with their staff to resolve things did nothing to replace their staff and did nothing to notify their guests that their stay would be impacted by these activities. In addition they were not even extra accommodating to make up for it. We got breakfast at the one restaurant that was open on our wedding day asked if we could take it up to our room because we wanted to start getting ready and were told no this is not room service. Yeah thanks we had planned to order room service on our wedding day if only it was actually available. I am just glad my actual wedding was at a restaurant and not on the property. Some other poor bride did have her wedding at the resort while we were there and had protesters shouting at her wedding. She was sobbing. How absolutely unacceptable is it to know that this will be occurring and not give your guests a heads up. I have traveled quite a bit and have stayed at a lot of hotels ranging from quaint bargain places to nice resorts and I have never in my life been even remotely this dissatisfied.

The staff works hard and is very polite with the exception of one staff member we meet by the pool at 4 pm today. His name was jamson and I guess he works in the towel area. We went and got towels at the pool cabana sales hit for Maui Jims. I did n\u2019t see him there but the Maui Jim sales Guys continue to sell Maui Jim sun glasses. Nice glasses and just 200 bucks and they add to your room. Jamson approaches us out of nowhere with a cocky attitude. Asked my room number very loudly. He stands in front of my wife in her chair and blocks the sun. Ask my room again and I give it to him. I said please speak softer so you do t give tbat everyone. He says we do t have a room of your number. I say funny I \u2019ve been here 7 nights and have three rooms. He says you need to go talk to towel shack I said no he says we do n\u2019t have a 540 room number. Hm he gets rude I gave him my last name and my room again. After confronting me with a smirk and his bs cocky smile he says I \u2019m just doing my job. He then starts to walk off and chuckles.

My son was coming to town and I also got him a great room for a nominal upchaThe third room was my sisters from Honolulu and she got an upgrade on her owni think she paid the most lol.

Our bery first time Maui we decided on the Sheraton for our vacation with our four year old. We chose it because of the location which is excellent. However it feels like the resort is coasting on its location laurels without really trying in any other regard. In fact I am still here and inspired to write this so that other young families can learn from our experiences1. They nickel and dime you for everything. The breakfast is costly at 32 a person and measly at that so we avoided it. A kids meal at the pool a defrosted UNCRUSTABLE at that \u2014 omg comes to a whopping 102. There is no cafe where you can grab ice cream sweets fruits or coffee. There is no waiter service by the pool. You have to go to one of the restaurants and pick it up yourself. 3. There is no security or rules RE pool use. Any visitor to the black rock beach wanders easily to the pool area for a swim. Wristbands are given out at random sometimes they ask \u201c what s ur room number \u201d. but mostly you can grab towels as you please4. The food is horrid. 5. The water in the shower has such low pressure we had a hard time rinsing the soap or sand off of our bodies. It basically drips6. Whatever equipment available is old and gross including the pool chairs and floating bean bags. Again location is excellent but our walks through the Hyat Westin and Mariot left a lot to be desired at the Sheraton.", "offset": [663, 702], "date": "2019-07-22", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 25, "uid": "3df49b54-3b3d-4e3c-9ad4-131a1969e309", "sentence": "do not give this property even a dollar of your money. For as beautiful and competitive as the hotels are in Maui you had think a brand name like the Westin would treat guests with respect and value the business. Sadly I have found the exact opposite over the last month dealing with the Westin in Maui. We booked 4 nights with the Westin 6 months ago for a trip over the 4th of July and we were so excited to stay on the Lahaina side of the island before moving over to Wailea. I was surprised to hear 2 weeks before our trip that 2 of 5 pools were closed for renovations including the water slides. We specifically booked this hotel based on the water slides as we were traveling with a 7 year old and were staying over the 4th of July wek where everything is crowded and hot. The property DID NOT disclose the pool closures and I had called to inquire as a co worker of mine had been shocked by the closures when they went to stay a few weeks earlier. Based on the renovations and the hotel being at max occupancy that week with limited amenities I canceled my reservations within the cancelation window and booked a stay at the Sheraton. To be my surprise the day I checked in to the Sheraton I was charged a 2 night penalty by the Westin. Mind you I canceled within the reservation window and only due to the property not being what was promised when booked. I have now spent almost 5 hours trying to find resolution and still do not have my money refunded. I have been met with animosity while trying to explain and find resolution. There was even a manager Ryan who approved the refund which never came and now weeks later will not transfer to to another manager will not pass the call to Ryan and have been sent to voicemails. As a frequent traveler Mariot member and a passion for hospitality I can confidently say that this is the WORST service I have ever seen for a hotel. I would not spend 1 dollar at this property and HIGHLY recommend staying at another amazing property on the island my personal favorite is the Four Seasons in Wailea.", "offset": [1735, 1884], "date": "2019-07-26", "cpt": "2", "category": "reception"}, {"id": 26, "uid": "7e7e9c3b-e341-43f1-9663-0c72d764dcce", "sentence": "The stay was nice the rooms are okay some staff was very helpful but others were not helpful.

Toilet and shower at pool beach only two toilets and too close to lilos and people queueing for one beach shower to rinse themselves therefore pool full was full of sand and there was no regular cleaning. Li los old and need maintance or replacement torn cabana tops having to pay for beach li los and umbrellas and snorkel gear not acceptable for 5 star prices. Grass not mowed under cabanas and lilos too close together not enough tables. Gardens v disappointing and dying except for palms.

First time to Hawaii and the trip was amazing. Stayed at the Sheraton Maui the first 2 nights service was poor we got no information about the resort or what is included with the 30 a day resort fee. Our second day I went to the vacation desk to ask a few questions since we were given no information and the lady was completely rude and would not look at me and when she would she would space off and completely ignore what I was saying until I told her I worked for Mariot. We ended up staying at the Westin down the beach for the next 5 days and the stay was amazing. The service was awesome and the atmosphere at the Westin Maui was way more fun. The Westin gave us way more information about their resort shuttle restaurants and everything a guest should know about a resort.
