A good size fridge freezer and cooking equipment should you be that way inclined. The bathroom is clean and functional however the bathroom fan runs constantly. Breakfast is also pretty good for the hotel and the rates paid. There is a continental selection pastries fruit bagels yoghurt etc and two different hot items every morning. The evening happy hour type service where wine and beer are given away is great although it would be nicer if they left the breakfast seating area open after they stopped serving those drinks so we were not turfed out into the other foyer area.

They do have free snacks and alcoholic beverages in the evening however we do not drink. However my biggest issue with the hotel was the HORRIBLE elevator situation. There are 40 floors and when we stayed it was quite full with only 3 sometimes working elevators. One was in service the first three days of our stay. At one point all three malfunctioned and multiple times they were over loaded. We were on the 6th floor so by the time the elevators got to us from the top floors they were almost always full or we had to squeeze in which is clearly what other people were doing since they were so often overloaded. By the third day of our stay we just took the stairs. Even when we checked out. with all of our luggage. Because we were tired of waiting 15 minutes or more for the elevators. Being on the 6th floor made the stairs not such a big deal but we overheard people talking that they were coming down the stairs from the 15th floor and such.

We booked eight nights Sept 28 Oct 6 at Elements based on location price in room kitchenette and free breakfasts. Unfortunately the stay was very disappointing because of the ridiculous elevator situation. Note. I had read all the other reviews that mentioned frustration with the elevators and I incorrectly just assumed that people were being picky. Not the case the elevators are in need of a serious system upgrade. there is only three elevators for a 40 story building. The elevators are also used by the staff as they have no other way to get to the various floors. Example 1 there is a digital display in front of the elevators on every floor. that shows you which floor the various elevators are at. We were on the 33rd floor. The display would show that an elevator was on the 34th or 38th floor and then the elevator would skip our floor and proceed to go to a lower level. This was the norm very very frustrating. Example 2 If you were fortunate enough to actually get in an elevator either going up or down. it would randomly stop at almost every floor even though there was no one at that floor requesting a ride. A simple ride could take 15 minutes just to get to your floor. In my opinion the issue is that the elevator system upgrade maintenance is something that will cost the hotel owner. Since the hotel runs at near capacity all the time I think the owners just do not care. In our case we were frustrated trying to go to breakfast back from breakfast down to start our day exploring New York and then later in the day when we returned to the hotel another long wait for a ride to our floor. Based on our frustration with the elevators we would not recommend this hotel. There is some good new though. The staff were great especially the Assistant General Manager Lyn Woods. We were lucky to have her in one of these crazy stop at every floor elevator rides. She apologized for the situation went out of her way to try and make up for our frustration. The front desk staff were also very apologetic. Unfortunately the issues resides with the hotel owner not the hotel staff.

First of all the hotel was under construction and nowhere on their site in my discussions with hotel staff before booking or via communication after did they tell us that. The lobby as a result was tiny loud and messy and always full of people. Bigger than that though the dining room was not accessible so despite the fact that we booked because they advertised a free hot breakfast no hot breakfast. To their credit they provided boxed breakfasts. Unfortunately they told us they would be put in our room and only once in our five night stay did anyone do that and they only ever provided two options of mostly bread and oatmeal packets neither of which was good so we mostly skipped breakfast. Our room was n\u2019t fully clean when we got there. We just ignored that though. The elevators took forever we had people telling us they waited 20 mins. The maintenance man walked in on us one morning he knocked one second before he opened the door. unfortunately it was right when I was getting dressed my husband stood in the door but he kept trying to come in as I stood against a wall but still pretty much in plain site. Awkward. Both my husband and I woke up sore and achy in the morning from the mattresses. I emailed the hotel manager twice but no response. I \u2019m also in the hospitality business and I understand construction is often a must honestly this hotel needs it it \u2019s a bit run down. I appreciated they tried to still provide breakfast but when we asked for our breakfast boxes hotel staff always challenged us and said they should be in our rooms. Even when I said they had never been delivered she just said okay and got my boxes no apology or follow up. Hospitality is all about meeting or exceeding guest expectations even when bad things happen people can try to make it right. Servive and someone that cares I have found in my decade of helping guests is the biggest thing that makes the difference. Now in favor of this hotel if it \u2019s cheaper than your other options and you wo n\u2019t be there much it is a great location just a 15 minute walk to our plays and Times Square. It also did n\u2019t have a resort fee which so many others did. If you \u2019re going economy and do n\u2019t need nice mattresses this was a good choice.
