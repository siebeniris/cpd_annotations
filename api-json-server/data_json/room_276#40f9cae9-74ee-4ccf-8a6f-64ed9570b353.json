Location is central to all race activities. Self park your car across the street at the City Garage do not approach the sea of cars at the front of the hotel complete chaos. You do not need your car for race weekend as there is plenty within walking distance or trolley distance station directly in front of HotelJust as before in 2013 Hotel still charges some pretty steep food and beverage fees as is expected from City type properties but this visit the room internet was complimentary for Rewards members. The beds were PERFECT. Needed a rolaway for a 3rd person in our room and it was delievered after check in and was a very nice roll away regular mattress. Refrigerator in the room not ice cold capable but still does the job. Would like a microwave in the room. but space is somewhat limited staff will gladly microwave items for you at the front desk. HVAC was somewhat of a challenge as the thermostat does not permit the user to switch between AC and Heat just adjust temp and fan speed and the room temp never did chill to the set point set it at 65 and the room remained very warm. The only true complaint was that the housekeeper for the 16th floor on Sat 221 was very rude as was the janitorial male on the 1st floor at the bathrooms and the bar I just simply said hi. hope you are having a good day and I was met with a grumpy gruff response in both instances for the male it was at the restroom by Starbucks and at the bar for the female housekeeper it was at my room for cleaning and in the hallway. Just did not seem to enjoy their jobs and took it out on someone just trying to be friendly. Would think it was just a bad day but happened on Friday and SaturdayFront end staff were VERY professional and expeditious with check in. Monique in the reservations office should be commended for her efforts with customers esp my situation with my reservation she was very patient and detailed with her handling of the situation and I am very appreciative as our other guests I am sureOh and the elevators were completely overwhelmed on 221 and 22. 221 had 2 of 6 elevators INOP and 22 had 3 not working in the AM hours and the Hotel was packed with guests conventions and the race and the waits for the elevators were hi larious. But on Sunday the Mariot staff was at the Lobby level greeting the guests exiting the working elevators only a couple of working elevators to meet and apologizing for the lengthy delays. Even with the two minor complaints the hotel is still a 5star stay due to room comfort balcony pool and fire pits on the patio. And the location is just to perfect for the race events so that also makes it a 5star choice.

If you are attending a conference at the Tampa Convention Center or a meeting here at the Tampa Mariot Waterside it is an obviously ideal location. Very beautiful property overall beautiful setting and overall very clean and well appointed. For the price and size of this hotel however I did expect a little more. From a meeting attendee perspective the conference services were fine rubber chicken lunch was above average seats were comfortable and break food beverages were good. My guest room was clean and well appointed but could have been much better. Biggest problem was lack of water pressure and the periodic smell of sewage that seeped through the room. The room service food options were very limited just a small number of items available from their quick bites menu. With 3 restaurants in this hotel I would have expected a lot more.

We chose to stay at this hotel for a few reasons. One was based on a recommendation. The second reason was because of it is location to Amalie Arena and third because of the Romance Package. The package offered champagne and chocolate covered strawberries upon arrival complimentary valet waterview room breakfast for two and late checkout. We arrive at 350 and check in. We failed to mention our Romance package but thought that maybe it was in the reservation notes. Regardless we go up to our room and I decided to call down to see if we needed to request the champagne. They said they would send someone up. nobody came. At this time I also confirmed our package deal with the front desk. She confirmed the valet parking and breakfast for two stating that with our room number everything would be adjusted. We then decided to go downstairs to grab a drink before the hockey game. We found two seats at the lobby bar that had just been vacated. We sit down at the dirty seats understanding that they were a little busy and patiently waited to be greeted and for our spots to be cleaned. After waiting for at least 5 7 minutes of no acknowledgement we decided to go to Champions the restaurant located in the hotel. There we were greeted promptly and served however we were given a drink in a dirty glass an easy fix but another turn off. After getting back from the hockey game we decided to call again for the Champagne and strawberries. The operator told us it would be 45 min to an hour. We waited patiently and after at least two hours it finally came. At least the strawberries were godI woke up the next morning and found the bill under the door. I was perplexed by the total. We were charged for parking not only 1 time but 3 times 28x3. I had to call the operator to clarify the package again and she adjusted the bill. Breakfast time. We asked the hostess what the breakfast for two in the package was about and she informed us that it was for the buffet. The food was decent but the service could not have felt more diner ish. We were served coffee in a dirty carafe and the silverware set up did not include a spoon for stirring my coffee. The server dropped our check off right after I sat down with my food. One of the servers was walking around to each table saying Are you ok. Which is a half ased way of offering any kind of service if you ask me. We head back up to our room after eating and decide to forego the late checkout. After dealing with the issues mentioned above we decided to be sure we checked out at the front desk to get a copy of our receipt. The bill once again was wrong. We had been charged for breakfast. The gentleman at the front desk kindly changed our bill but was not apologetic in any way for our hassle. This hotel lacks attention to detail and service. it is one of the more expensive hotels to choose from while staying in downtown Tampa. We did not experience any exceptional service at this location. Maybe the hotel is used to overcharging guests because they have a lot of people that stay for business who do not look at their bill. We will not be heading back to Tampa any time soon even though we live right over the bridge nor will we recommend anyone to this hotel.

We were mostly satisfied with our room and have always been a fan of the Than toiletries. We were perplexed by the cooler that would keep items at 50 degrees but not lower what is the point why not just put in a refrigerator. We required a refrigerator for medication which was provided upon request but wondered why they just did not provide one instead of the large cooler. Pool was beautiful but the pool bar was closed for renovations which seemed a strange time of year to do this as the pool was crowded with thirsty patrons. A group was stuck in an elevator one evening and the hotel to me at least did not seem to regard this as an emergency waiting almost half an hour before calling the fire department. I checked with some of the folks on the elevator later and was advised Mariot had not offered them so much as a free drink for their uncomfortable and frightening experience. Desk staff was helpful and friendly check out was painless. Overall was mostly pleased with the hotel. Will check other options if I am in Tampa again but as long as the Than products are offered will lean towards the Mariot again.", "offset": [113, 248], "date": "2017-06-13", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 7, "uid": "f71891b8-61fe-4cc5-aabf-8e1690b36b7c", "sentence": "Tampa Waterside Fabulous Stay. This place has robust reviews and I \u2019l just add my two cents as I had such a wonderful visit I would love to go back again and just to chill for a week. Check in process \u2013 very easy and did n\u2019t get names \u2026. were so helpful. The lobby \u2019s appearance was so beautiful that I wound up extending my stay a few nights which they were very accommodating about. I was able to score a waterside balcony room and it was SO worth it. As an out of towner I found all the views interesting. Parking \u2013. As many folks say valet parking is annoyingly expensive. So do n\u2019t do it. You can park just about across the street at a big public lot I think it runs 6 or 9 a day. It \u2019s not far it \u2019s not hard to find so save yourself around 20 a day. I did n\u2019t move my car till I checked out. Room \u2013 Room was the typical comfortable Mariot room with a great bed that is so kind to my back they almost never let me down. I was on a very high floor standing request and I thoroughly loved it. Pool \u2013 What a great set up. The pool is huge. You can view the waterfront from all edges of the pool deck. On the weekend they seemed to have a live musician I \u2019m not sure if that \u2019s every day. They also had someone grilling food over in the corner near the bar. I \u2019m not positive if that \u2019s every day or not but you could make a day of it just hanging out there. There is a hot tub off to the corner too. Spa I treated myself to the spa. They had posted a two service special so I had a relaxing facial and massage minis. The spa itself was very lovely and the technicians both friendly and capable. I tried to squeeze in a second service on my check out day but we could n\u2019t make it work. Suggest trying them if you are there \u2013 weekdays it should be easier to book an appointment. Concierge Lounge \u2013 I had lounge access which Carl Fuller and Joyce Williams manage very capably in the morning and evening respectively. Both are very attentive to guests. Not sure how they make I work with just one person my hat it off to each of them. The lounge was great with an outdoor patio balcony up there on the 24th floor so you can take in the views or enjoy the heat from there as well. The lounge offers a good breakfast set up including scrambled eggs breakfast breads and terrific fruit. They should actually use some of that fruit at dessert its great and would be better for us too. The midday snack set is included whole fruit snack bags and cookies when I was there. Evening snacks are good too. Waters and sodas were always plentiful. I only wish what I wish for every Mariot executive lounge which I that they would be open on weekends. Restaurants \u2013. I wound up eating a lunch in the lobby my first day. We thought it was so beautiful we hated to move. The bar food from Champions was great. Service comes via a call button on your table do not ask me how they find you but it works. Also had a good steak dinner outside at Waterside Grill. Server and hostess were very accommodating in taking me outside even though no one else was out there. Had another inside Champions too and they have a fun happy hour that \u2019s available from maybe 4 7 that I was able to sample. Good service. Finally the breakfast buffet in Waterside was extensive with anything and more you could eat. I think some reviewers comment on things being pricey I found things very reasonably priced. There were choices where you could get a sandwich or a nice meal at a higher price so I thought it was comfortable. I think the restaurants menus can be found online.", "offset": [454, 508], "date": "2017-07-24", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 8, "uid": "c0554319-c06c-4e40-bb55-ad606436d1e6", "sentence": "Noise was a bit of a problem while in the room.", "offset": [0, 47], "date": "2017-09-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "6475aab5-24dc-4e1a-a022-7399213d51ca", "sentence": "Although I love the location I will NOT spend another 300 per night to stay there.
