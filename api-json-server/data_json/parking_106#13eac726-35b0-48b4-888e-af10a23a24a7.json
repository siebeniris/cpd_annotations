I am telling this from a non golfers perspective. My husband was in the Golf Channels tournament last week. This was our second trip to Inisbrok and I will be honest. I was not exactly excited about the place the first time. I remember it years back as dated and tired. Guess what. nothing has changed and now it is stained on top of that. We requested a King bed. This evidently means that we must be in a condominium instead of a hotel room. Well you know that old saying about first impressions. Here is our first impression and I realize that hotels resorts are helpless to a point as to the clientele that checks in. Imagine driving to your building at about 8 or so at night. we could still see and out in the parking lot a large conglomeration of children young adults some of whom were in a filthy white vehicle and the rest coming and going through the entrance to the building. These two groups rather threatening looking in my mind were shouting back and forth to each other at the tops of their voices hanging out of the windows of the car etc. They were not mad but yelling some sort of instructions whatever the case it was very loud and I thought inconsiderate. I hesitate to write this but it was a rather rough looking bunch. We proceded to get our two suitcases out of our vehicle and started toward the door. They gave us no trouble basically since some of them had gone inside by now. Those in the vehicle had driven away I think. I did notice that when we got inside the first door this group went in the second door down a hall to the right and our room unit turned out to be through a door to the left. I do not mind telling you I breathed a sigh of reliefNow inside our unit I realized it was not a hotel room but a condo. The decor was decent but dated. The bed was indeed a King bed but since we do go on a few little trips a year now I suggested we quickly lie down and make sure we do not roll to the middle make sure the mattress is decent. It was. But when I pulled back the comforter if you can believe this I saw that the bottom sheet was just barely over the mattress on the upper right corner. It was over it about half way really. Oh boy well we have seen that before countless times. These new deep mattresses are not suited to conventional bottom sheets. I pulled it loose with the intention of pulling on it to hopefully get it farther up onto the corner when I noticed that the mattress pad underneath was way down from the top of the bed. that is annoying. let us deal with that first. Around the bed I went undoing the sheet from the upper left corner and it was then that I noticed that the stretchy part of the mattress pad was very torn. Back to the right side I inspected that side and lo and behold it had a big hole in it too. I tried pulling up on the mattress pad to bring it up to the top of the mattress but it would not budge. What else could I do but pull back the entire comforter wrapped within two sheets that it was and undo the bottom sheet all the way. Then I noticed that the mattress pad was hanging off the bottom a great deal. I put my brain in gear. let us see if I take the mattress pad all the way off and turn it all the way around. the bottom stretchy two corner areas are fine. then it will stay fixed at the top. The parts with the holes will now be at the bottom. This I did when my husband walked back in the room wondering what on earth I was doing. By now I am getting a little sweaty since the thermostat out in the living room said 75 degrees when we walked in. The bedroom was a lot warmer. We set it at 71 and you could hear it run but it was far from 71 degrees while I was doing this work. I explained to my husband what I was doing. We just get tired of hotel beds where you wake up all night long with the bottom sheet coming loose and pretty soon it is a ball at your waist by morning. We got the mattress pad placed and it was during this that I noticed a small round stain in the middle. Well we will ignore that. Next we address the bottom sheet. Yes once you get the two top corners all the way down there is absolutely no way the bottom two will go down. But I am prepared for this we now take with us safety pins. We pinned the sheet in places along the binding and at one bottom corner it went down well enough but for the final corner I got creative and just let it lie on top of the mattress pad and I pinned it in two places with the pins. The downside of the pins is that you have to remove them every morning. So now we have had two first impressions. the people in the parking lot and the bed. Night number one in that bed typical for every comforter except the Heavenly Bed at a Westin. our legs get hot after about an hour and we spend the rest of the night throwing off the cover and then pulling it back. We always want a regular blanket instead. Some hotels have them some do not. And those that do. sometimes they do not come in a King size. Anyway another annoyance. I was on the side where the a c vent blew right on me. That added to the hot cold all night. The next morning we were still in the room when Housekeeping knocked on the door. A nice lady named Sefana Safana was there. She wanted to know if she could do the room or should she come back. I was so irritated by that skimpy bottom sheet that I asked her to come and see what we had rigged up the night before plus the mattress pad that had holes in the corners of the boxing and so on. We got in the bedroom and the pins were still in place. I showed her what we had had to do to keep the sheet in place. She said she knew exactly what the problem was. she said the bottom sheet starts out plenty big but in about two weeks or so in the laundry. it shrinks. And I suppose I would understand that I imagine at a hotel or resort there are certain temperatures they must use by law to kill germs etc. But if the guests are so inconvenienced as to have to take a bed apart completely and re do it. I showed her how we rotated the mattress pad and also the stain. When she saw that she said she would call immediately for a new one and she did. Since we were just sitting and reading out in the living room when the mattress pad was brought to her she came back and put the whole thing together. All new. she said proudly. She was quite cheerful and friendly. I did not have the heart to tell her about the hot comforter. at least yet. Night two and three still hot off and on. We do know a thing or two about HVAC vents. we could see that this was one of those that had adjustable louvers. Our man had shown us at home how to move them with needle nosed pliers and a cloth so you do not mar the paint. We did not have needle nosed pliers on this trip but the kitchen had a skinny knife. My husband after night 3 got up on a chair and with a steak knife and a cloth adjusted the louvers to point more up than down. Cold air drops anyway. Finally I slept all the way through on night 4. The cold air drifted down gently instead of blasting me directly. My next heat related thing was to ask for a second blanket. I had opened a closet door to find a blanket but it was small. just the size of the top of the bed. At the Grand Wailea in Maui we had the same situation. We ended up taking two small blankets and pinning them together down the middle. I asked Safana for a second blanket. We could tell English was her second language. I certainly could not expect her to comprehend the pinning part or do it either. So when we got back that evening she had gotten rid of the inside of the usual covers and put the one blanket in. On the bench at the foot of the bed was a second blanket. I got the whole thing apart pinned the two together and this was perfect. Light and breathable. Why there is all this heavy cover in Florida is beyond me. And another thing when we pulled the drapes across in the bedroom. both sets were entirely loose on the outer side on the right side. Since I have made curtains myself and understand the pins and tabs I got up on a chair and hooked back both curtains into the little tabs. Now when the rods are pulled the curtains stay fixed. Now to the stains. The couch. one of the loose back cushions has a big black stain up on the top of it. The armchair next to the couch the loose seat cushion has a stain on the seat. I took the cushions out and turned them over to see if they were firmer. unfortunately they were not. It was then that I saw the stain. We flipped and rotated the two outer seat cushions of the couch hoping for more firmness to no avail. I saw that it was Century furniture. that is a good line but I would say it is long overdue for new cushions. The couch the two armchairs all are so soft it is hard to get up and out. The bench at the foot of the bed also had a stain. Outside right when you step from the asphalt to the surface to walk toward the building door the surface looks dirty. I would say it needs to be steam cleaned. There is also one step that has yellow paint on the edge of it and the yellow has faded out to the point that it is almost gone. that is a safety issue. It needs to be re done. A railing alongside this walkway. the first morning we walked out toward the car a small animal had used the bathroom on the railing right at a 90 degree corner. A little pile of what looked like black pearls. Maybe a squirrel. Whatever the case this sat her for three days. Our room unit was on the ground level and my husband wanted to walk out onto the patio but it was gritty and covered with pine straw. You would not want to go out there barefooted. And when I read the reviews about how everybody is friendly and eager to help. yes they are. But does that make up for what I have just described. I do not think so. You get in a place and the furniture is so worn out it is hard to get up and out of it. And stained. You have to totally re make the bed on the first night. Yes Sefana stood listened and was eager to understand what was wrong and she made it right. Why not do it right the first timeThe first morning we went to the coffee place off the lobby to get coffee. It was late so nobody was in there. Got the styrofoam cups poured the coffee out of those container things then saw that there was no half and half. Only CofeMate fake cream and some flavored creams. My husband asked the lady if there was any half and half. She produced a jug from under the counter that she essentially used to make coffee drinks. it had a date written in huge Sharpie on it. At this price point should not Inisbrok have containers of real half and half. I think so. The rest of the mornings we drove to Starbucks. We never had any trouble with those scary people. My husband is a good judge of people he is out in the business world. He studied the older ones in the group. it seemed to be a big group several cars. He said This is a golf resort and they have no interest in the golf it is odd. They looked very out of place and the older ones looked a bit intimidating yet on the other hand a young boy held the door open for us as we were leaving one night. Who knows. I thanked him and he said he was welcome back. Very welcome in fact. Poorly dressed dirty vehicles just plain strange all the way around. Oh and the second night we were there about 1030. while sitting in the living room we heard a dog barking up close. Several times. I do not think it was outside. I do not know if this is a resort that allows that or not but that is an indication of how thin the walls are. I would hear people golfers making noise every morning too. About 6 am. All in all rather unpleasant all the way around. The quick way to sum up Inisbrok is that everybody is friendly and eager to please and I understand the golf courses are nice. Everything else is tired dated and stained. I was not entirely at ease the whole time we were there and was glad to get home. And yes I am picky.", "offset": [1262, 1346], "date": "2016-09-23", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 12, "uid": "3b58c272-4289-4f27-b7d2-408ca40af8c1", "sentence": "Tired and stained.

Some members of our party received two bedroom 2nd floor units while others received small hotel rooms on ground level facing the parking lot that were last decorated in 1978. We will avoid all salamander properties going forward and would advise you to be very cautious when booking a room at Inisbrok.", "offset": [353, 528], "date": "2016-11-16", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "85c82ba0-b458-4a9c-97a6-7b25e90ad979", "sentence": "nice stay. we were here a year ago were not sure we had return. but we are glad that we did. some of the same issues we had are still here. parking is a bit of an issue. it is a walk downhill with stairs. we have some mobility problems. we were on the ground floor so the lack of elavotor was not a problem. a fridge in room would still be a pluswe did have dinner breakfast in the salamander grill super tasty.", "offset": [140, 169], "date": "2017-06-03", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "47795f2c-f72e-47de-a2e0-020bf15768a4", "sentence": "Inisbrok Resort. Inisbrok is a large property. We paid around 680 for two nights and two days on the pool deck with lunch on the deck both days. There are about six pools on the property and a couple of fine golf courses. This place hosts a PGA tour event so the golf facilities are excellent. There are shuttles provided free of charge to take you to the various places you may want to go to on the property so you do not have to drive your car all over. They make it very simple to get around with a simple call for a pick up to the pools restaurants or golf courses. There are grocery stores restaurants Dunkin Donuts ect just off the property and very convenient but the resort does have dinning and bar options on property. Very nice. I want to start out by saying you may never find a better staff anywhere on the planet. From check in to walking across the property everyone working for this company was cheerful and helpful. Early morning gate guard was a little gruff but hey working the late shift is not always fun. Staff is excelentI am sure back in the 70s 80s this place was the cats meow. I booked the room from Hotelscom and told the person on the phone we wanted one of the two bedroom suites we had been in before about ten years ago. Check in was very pleasant at the central check in building but when I arrived to my EXECUTIVE SUITE I was less than impressed. The building smelled stale damp and musty. The room looked clean but dated and I could have lived with that. The problem was there was a divider door between our suite and the suite next door. I could absolutely see the people in the suite next door through the cracks in the door and could hear every word of their conversation. I called the central check in and explained the noise situation. I asked if they may have another two BEDROOM suite available as this suite had two queen beds BUT they were in the same room. I also explained that we had my 83 yr old mother with us and she could barley walk. I asked if we might find something without steps as it was very difficult to get her in and out of the last building. The desk person was very polite and helpful and found us another suite on the property. This suite was again dated and a little musty. The beds were still in the same room but we are family so we could handle that. The steps were still at the entrance and it was difficult and time consuming getting nanny into the building BUT she is a trooper and did not mind too much. There was ONE handicapped parking place in the entire parking lot for this building and it was RESERVED for room 3182 legal. If you have a wheel chair bound person or a person that has difficulty walking you should address this issue when booking for sure. The room had a small kitchen and a large room with a sleeper sofa breakfast table TV and two queen beds in it and one bathroom with a tub shower. Not terrible but you better be family or not shy in that type of room. Be specific and do not assume anything when booking if you need privacy at this resort. There were some roaches. I saw six in two days. The room was clean. It did not look dirty and was well kept but there were roaches in the kitchen and bathroom. Just a heads up. The only other issue was there is very little or low lighting at night on the property. it is very difficult to read signs to buildings ect. I do not know if this is part of the motif or just an out dated expense but it was hard to see. can not get too lost though. Over all The kids 71 had a great time at the pool areas and the food was good polside. Service at the pool was also good as every where else. Shuttles are very nice and the drivers were always helpful. do not let the size of the property scare you. They do a great job with this aspect of the visit. do not have to worry about drinking and driving. Shuttles run late at night to and from on site restaurants and barsHandicap accessibility was an issue for us. The trip was a lot more difficult than it had to be with SAVED handicapped parking places lack of handicapped parking lack of building accessibility ect. Rooms are dated and musty BUT clean. Roaches were an issue but roaches do not always mean dirty. More than likely I would be hesitant to bring the family back here because of the issues with the room and it is out dated venue and handicapped issues BUT I would come back with some of the guys for a golf Vacation if the price was right.", "offset": [3941, 4094], "date": "2017-06-19", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "09fd7cae-9d0f-4955-8192-c0d58ccd6692", "sentence": "I have high hopes for this place. This resort grew on me by the end of three days however it has a long way to go to become anywhere near a 4 or 5star property. There is no main resort hotel it is made up of private owner condos spread throughout the property that the hotel holds in a rental program. The condos are in building pods right out of the 1970s and our rooms were last renovated in 203 lacking any modernization the bathrooms were tiny and all but one of our rooms overlooked the parking lot nothing tragic. While the bedding and linens were nice and the facilities clean this is definately back in time luxury non existent. Because the property is so large they offer a shuttle service which always came within minutes of calling the front desk. Nice feature. The first night as a group of 12 we went to Salmon Grille and the food was medicore at best. The service was poor at both dinner and then breakfast the next morning and I feel the staff needs training as they are not pro active at all and slow as molasses. The next day the main pool was closed so we used the Island Cafe pool which was fine although lunch took forever to get as I think they had to go to the main restaurant. The second night as a large group went to Packards Steakhouse which was amazing food great menu and large portions but sadly the service was only slightly better than Friday night. The spa was fantasticThe absolute highlight was the tennis facility and Copperhead golf course so for obvious reasons people come here for these two amenities. The Tennis Pro Joe created a private cardio clinic for our group which could not have been more fun. He helped set up our courts and really made our trip worth it. If you are a tennis player call ahead andor meet him he is great at what he does. Overall I recommend this resort just be prepared that it is not yet up to Salamander standards as I booked this resort because I thought it would be more on the luxury side and was obviously disappointed with the acomodations and restaurant service. If nothing else it is worth the tennis golf and spa.", "offset": [161, 301], "date": "2017-10-31", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "4c5c42bd-f617-4dca-a668-e3830527b466", "sentence": "Great golf.

The salamander grille at the osprey had good lunches and dinners casual with outdoor fire pitsThe copperhead restaurant Packard was overpriced and not very good.

We spent two nights at the Inisbrok Resort. Check in was good. Upon arriving at the building our room was in we were greeted with a large dumpster at the main entrance and a port a potty to the side. many of the parking spots around the entrance were taken up with cones and yellow caution tape. Once maneuvering our luggage into the entrance and finding our room on the second floor without elevators. we found our room to be clean freshly painted small and with one small window. We unpacked our suitcases and decided to open the bottle of wine that was graciously given to us by the family hosting the wedding we were attending at Inisbrok. We tried to open the blinds in the window all the way up but the heavy Venetian blinds were broken and would not go up. The blinds would open but would not go up and the right side of the blinds were coming out of the window casing. We called the front desk to ask if someone could look at our blinds and if we could have two wine glasses delivered to our room. At first we were told they could deliver wine glasses then told they could not but they would send an engineer to fix the blinds. The engineer arrived and concluded they could not fix and would need to replace the following week. Disappointed I called the front desk again and explained. They said they could move us to another building not the same building if we wanted to pack up our things they would send staff.", "offset": [236, 331], "date": "2020-02-05", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}]}
