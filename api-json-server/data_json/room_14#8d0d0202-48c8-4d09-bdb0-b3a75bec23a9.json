We have stayed at the this resort a couple of times as a family 1 week more recently. it is a great hotel as there is lots for the kids to do and the hotel is very child friendly. This hotel classes it self as 5 star but we have have stayed at 5 star hotels that are far more luxurious then this. There are way too many people in the lobby for staff to deal with. Generally there s no personal welcome at the resort it is a bit like a convayer belt as taxis pull up with guests and visitors to see it as an attraction. This is followed by a long wait at the lobby with rooms not readyWe found the room to be very dusty. Our 1st room smelt heavyly of smoke we asked to change as I did not want my children inhaling that smell and the hotel changed us over to another room. Drinks are way over priced aprox 2 pounds for a can of pop. Head to the malls and stock up on some water and cans if needed ice bucket and glasses provided in room. Restaurants as all quite good and on a half board package we were able to sample most of them. Staff are great dealing with the children and providing seating high chairs. Great pool facilities for children and with Aquaventure access it is a dream fro the kids. and dads. The spa is brilliant. Overall it is great it kids as they enjoyed the water parks and pools.

We spent a lot of money upgrading to an Imperial Club room and one of the key attractions was the high speed broadband throughout the resort. This is simply not true. Getting a connection is difficult and the signal is frequently dropped. There is no access on the beach near the hotel. Even once you have a connection the speed is often not fast enough to view websites. We have not been trying to game steam video or download movies. Just check work emails and view the odd website.

We were a group of 30 Adults. We stayed in Atlantis from 0612016 to 0712016. We had a Booking for 15 Rooms. To initially just take the confirmation number it took us 3 Hours. Even after sending the Passport Scanned Copy at the time of Booking at the check in ball room they took each passport and scanned it and entered every detail while we were standing in the queue. It took us 3 hours for the process by 2 pm we got our access cards to the water park and were informed that we will be given rooms after 3 PM. We had to come back again in the same ball room to get the room numbers. This was frustrating. Our luggage kept lying in the lobby. We left for lunch and came back by 4 PM. Got our room numbers which again took a long 30 mins. When we got our luggage tagged with room numbers they told that luggage will be sent to our rooms. By 7 PM we did not receive our luggage on asking to the concierge they simply said sir we got 80 check ins and check outs how can we get every luggage out and in from rooms. Finally we had to carry our luggage inside the room by self. So by this time we had already spent our whole day doing the check in process and our precious one day in Dubai was lost. We then decided to take Dinner and checked for some Indian Restaurant in the Hotel. While the Indian food was available in Kaleidoscope Restaurant we went for it only to see long queue outside the restaurant. Finally we had to choose a restaurant which had less queue irrespective of the cuisine served. While we reached the edge the manager informed us to take whatever we want in one go as they were gon na close the restaurant in 10 mins as it was 10 PM. So in a hurry we took everything and sat for dinner soon we asked for water and were told that it is not free it is chargeable. We already had gone through a lot of pain and terrible experience here. Next morning we had to wake up early so that we could enjoy the water park we got only 2 hours for same. In a hurry to check out we ran towards out room at 12 pm and to our surprise we were stranded outside our room because out keys were deactivated automatically. We had to run to the reception again and get the keys RE activated which they told were given only under conditions that we vacate the room in 30 mins. We quickly collected our luggage and passport and did not expect anyone to carry our luggage out of the room. Then we saw like us many guests were carrying there own luggage to lobby. Thanks to so called 5 star standards of the hotel they did not have enough bell boys to assist it is guests. Finally out of 15 rooms the bell boys got us luggage of only 2 rooms rest 13 rooms had their luggage on their own. Finally I would rate the hotel as a terrible experience. Would never recommend anyone to stay here with groups or at the time of peak season to avoid inconvenience. Also the food was Terrible at the time of Dinner. Worst Experience out of any of the bigger hotels I have stayed so far. Have stayed in past in Venetian Hotel Macau and First World Hotel Genting but this was the worst experience we had with a Big 5 Star Brand Like Atlantis.", "offset": [2608, 2722], "date": "2016-11-12", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 6, "uid": "2b76339b-b194-4bdc-b566-6dc8716d5751", "sentence": "Massive.

I booked this hotel again after 5 years. I had made a decision after my last stay in 2014 to not book this again as I had felt back then that the quality of service had dropped. To be honest my view has not changed. We had booked 2 rooms for this visit. My friends had arrived one day earlier. They had booked a Palm room in the west Tower on a half board basis for 3 adults a child and an infant. It was a late night check in. They had got to sleep around 3 4am. They were awoken by an extremely loud noise very early in the morning. This noise was due to construction at the hotel. This was something they had not been made aware of at check in or prior to the stay. They were tired all day due to this. After complaining they were moved to another room in the East Tower much later that day. Me and my son arrived at the hotel on this day at 1 pm. Upon arrival We were not greeted like staff used to greet guests when the hotel first opened. However we had a smooth check in. We were attended to by Mohammed Ali who was very friendly and very helpful. We had an Ocean queen room with half board booked he tried to find a room which had a view of the pool area as my son had requested. We were advised our room will be ready by 3 pm and in the meantime we can use all the facilities and have lunch. We went for lunch our room was ready by 3 pm. The room was nice and had a nice view. It was a newly renovated room. I do feel the lighting in the room is limited and it is a little dark. The hotel had sent a lovely birthday cake for my son \u2019s birthday as I had informed them of his birthday. This was a lovely gesture and the cake was enjoyed by us both. On the 2nd or 3rd day me and my son were fast asleep at around 1 2am when we heard someone trying to push open the interconnecting door in the room which connects to the room next door. My son was extremely frightened as was I. I calmed myself down and called guest services. I was advised security will be sent up to our room to ensure we are ok and to check what has happened. However after 5 minutes I received a call from guest services and they advised they had contacted the guests next door and they had said they were just checking what was behind the door and will not attempt this again. I was not satisfied with this as my son was still quite shaken and asked if they can still send security to our room to ensure this door can not be opened. I was told there was no need now as the guests in the rooms will not repeat this again. I was not happy with the response. We attempted to sleep but my son struggled to sleep out of fear. I complained to guest services in the morning as I felt security should have come to the room to ensure we are safe and to check the door was also safe. I was advised they will look into this and come back to me. They never came back to me throughout the stay. Quite disappointing the safety of their guests is not important. Going onto half board we visited saffron for breakfast. I strongly feel the selection of food and the service is not what it used to be. I had praised saffron for their breakfast before arrival to my friends. They felt a little let down by the selection and felt there are better selections at other hotels in Dubai which I did agree with. We visited kaleidoscope for lunch they had a good selection of good quality food. The let down at this hotel is guests have to pay 25 dirhams for water when they are on half board basis. Other hotels in Dubai do not charge for water. I strongly feel that the price guests pay for their stay at this hotel water should be included with meals. We visited kaleidoscope again for dinner and found the selection of food was exactly the same as lunch. We were not impressed. We had dinner at the Lebanese restaurant Amamya. The staff were very attentive and the service and decor of this hotel were of a very high standard. The food was amazing. We all enjoyed the food and the portions were very good too. Including the kids meals. Please be careful when ordering kids meals as I feel it \u2019s not clear on their menu that drinks for kids are chargeable. We ordered apple juices as it looked like this was included. We were charged for these. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Another issue my friends faced after they moved to the East Tower was around 1230am they were informed the water supply on their floor had been cut this meant their toilet was not working and they had no running water in the room. They were informed this may last for 4 5 hours. They were offered another room but the children were already asleep so they could not move. Upon complaining they were told the hotel can send them 20 bottles of water to keep them going until the morning. How inappropriate. They declined this and used our bathroom and 1 friend had to go down to the lobby late in the night. She felt very uncomfortable and a little scared as no one was around at this time. Nothing was offered to my friends as a gesture for the inconvenience caused by this considering it was the second time they had faced issues. This is another reason why I would not be staying at this hotel again. I have stayed at other hotels where a guest \u2019s complaint is always taken very seriously and they aim to resolve the issues and provide kind gestures to compensate. I visited the hotel \u2019s spa area and was shocked when I was asked to pay 60 dirhams to use the steam room sauna jacuzi and relaxation room. My understanding is this charge is payable every time you visit I may be wrong. I visit Dubai twice a year and stay at various 5 star and 4 star hotels I have never been asked to pay to use these facilities. I had never used these facilities when I stayed here in the past so was not aware these services are chargeable. To be honest the spa area was the same as any other hotel nothing special. To me this hotel wants to make money by charging for services wherever possible and are not interested in the comfort of their guests or providing facilities which should be included as standard for a hotel of this class. The hotels gym was well equipped and had a good variety of equipment. My son lost his phone on our journey back from The Dubai Mall. When I informed security at the hotel they were extremely helpful and supportive and did their upmost best to assist me with locating it by checking ctv coverage to locate the taxi calling the taxi company on my behalf. Unfortunately we did not find it but the security team are highly commendable on this occasion. The positives at the hotel are the unlimited use of Aquaventure which has a vast variety of pool areas and slides for all ages andThe Lost Chambers. The pool areas are nice and clean. Good choice of restaurants. In my opinion this hotel is not good value for money as there are many hidden charges. Location is also further from livelier areas. I think hotels on JBR are better value for money and also in a better location and you can plan a day to visit Aquaventure. I ca n\u2019t see myself or my friends staying at this hotel again in the near future. It is costly to stay here in the first instance but the extra charges for their facilities makes it even more expensive. They have no consideration for the comfort or safety of their guests.", "offset": [726, 814], "date": "2019-06-22", "cpt": "0", "category": "room"}, {"id": 9, "uid": "804ac13d-732b-4a2e-9314-e3a49176f697", "sentence": "Good hotel on the whole but disappointing roomy.

Just realised I did n\u2019t review this last summer. Travelled august 2019 as a family of 4. Previously stayed at the Sofitel on the palm. Equally amazing rooms and hotel pool areas but this place is just like wow for the kids. My 10 year old spent the whole time at the water park on all the thrill slides and I got to bond with my 1 year old around the hotel pool areas and on a few occasions we did use the water park as there \u2019s a lovely water play area he loved with water sprinklers which really kept him entertained. Also some much needed shaded areas. The rooms are well equipped. We would head back to the room for nap time so I did end up spending lots of time there. If you ask the cleaners for extra free waters coffees milks etc it \u2019s not a problem. You can also dial reception for baby milk which was delivered free of charge to the room. The aquarium is beautiful. You see something different each time you go by. Lovely to watch on your way to breakfast dinner. We were half board. The evening restaurant selection was ok but compared to Sofitel you did have to pay upgrades for many of the restaurants. For this reason as an adult the Sofitel really won for me. Obviously you have the holiday for your kids so if you asked mine they \u2019d say they preferred Atlantis.
