Booked this room for a girls trip with three other women in their 30s. The room was small but sufficient and very clean. Extremely comfortable beds. We received a free upgrade to beachside view and it was fantastic. The balcony was big enough for us to sit out in the morning with coffee and enjoy the view. Decent entertainment in the evenings. Loved the pavilion where you could get drinks for the beach. Beautiful clean pool. Grounds are pretty and well kept. The hallways and carpet in the hallways looked old but I did not mind it. The place was clean even if a little outdated. A lot of wet people walk those hallways so there is not much point in upgrading the carpet.

Nothing to complain aboutWe actually prefer exploring and eating at local restaurants so we discovered some excellent places across the bridge in Fort Walton Blue Collar Cafe has the best bagels and sandwiches.

The beach was amazing too it was also super quiet and the sand the whitest I have ever seen I am used to a pebbly beach at best in the UK. would recommend this hotel to everyone has it is suitable for all ages.

I contacted my Expedia CruiseShips Representative and she moved us to another hotel. The Ramada refused to Give my money back for the stay and stated they gave me breakfast.

Not Realizing our room would look out into this construction mess. We drive around the side of the building where the lady says we should park and our mouths drop. The front of the hotel is a facade to a mound of nasty looking MOTEL rooms. Everyone in the car praying that is not our building. We proceed to the next building thankfully we think. after circling about 8 times and finally finding a parking space. There are pipes in the parking lot gushing water everywhere so we have to jump over these puddles to get our bags out of the car and get to the back door of the major MOTEL. We walk in the building and all we can hope is that the room looks better than this low ceilinged horror movie hallway. Not much. Walk in the room and the furniture is old the smell is musty and the bathroom is atrocious. There is not even a little dish to place the hand soap on. But what can we do. We have already paid 230 night for the room. No one wants to touch the beds or put their items down. I am sickened and embarrassed that I brought my family here. The WIFI signal is spotty at best the experience has been undesirable at most. Thank God it \u2019s on the beach. We left the room as soon as we got here and only came back to lay our heads on the not so clean sheets. I am not looking forward to taking a shower in morning. I will be telling people not to come to this hotel and again Hotwire should be ashamed to send families here. I am saddened by this experience. Pictures of the view from our window.
