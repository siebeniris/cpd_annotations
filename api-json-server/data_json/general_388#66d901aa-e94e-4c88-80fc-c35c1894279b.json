A hotel from the 60s so well designed as a timeless classic. The rooms were probably renovated in the 90s judging from the hardware. Everything in the room worked flawlessly. The best part was the A C still worked despite being winter unlike most hotels in the US China or Europe which meant I was could keep the room nice and cool at 19C Unfortunately the windows does not open. Service was perfect. It only took 3 minutes for someone to get my bags when I was checking out. The restaurant served excellent food. Breakfast buffet is served daily at the terrace outlet thin crispy bacon wet scrambled eggs the way its supposed to be Vodka beside the orange juice fruit gratin perfection. On the 11th floor is the tepanyaki restaurant Sazanka where they observe a strict ritual. First presenting the food raw then cooking it and waiting for you to finish your food halfway before repeating the sequence for the next course. For desert and coffee someone will come and get you to take you to another room. All this comes at a price quite high in fact for Japanese standards. The Garden view with the water fall makes for a slow pleasant bfast. The Orchid bar also serves good bar chow and a decent selection of spirits and cocktails. unfortunately my stay was not long enough for me to try the other outlets as they all looked equally inviting. Unfortunately the hotel will be undergoing a massive renovation this year I only hope they somehow retain the overall 60s look of the lobby and keep the hanging lights that you see when enter the hotel.", "offset": [595, 768], "date": "2015-03-04 00:00:00", "cpt": "0", "category": "general"}, {"id": 1, "uid": "b11a9fd5-d23e-414f-8a92-754329ee8d48", "sentence": "Poor.

This hotel is far outside of our normal range of places we stay so we were a bit overwhelmed at first with the high quality of simply everything.

If there was ever a time they did not know the answer to your question they would quickly find the answer. The room was huge by Japan standards even by American standards I would imagine. There were comfortable yukata available to slip into as well as a charming explanation for the origami left on our bed. The food and service at all of the hotels cafes bars and restaurants we went to were excellent. We also really appreciated the TV having multiple channels in several different languages available for free. The only thing I wish was a bit clearer on their website was that the gardens they have are only accessible or view able. from either the Terrace Restaurant or the Japanese Tea Room.

The Hotel Okura Tokyo has a glittering history of being the choice of world leaders dating back to1962 when it first opened its main building and the south building was opened in 1973. It is located just outside central Ropongi with three underground stations nearby all within 5 10 minutes walk. so it is very convenient. Being outside the district centre and in the Embassy district of Tokyo it is very quiet and safe. Excellent location. When booking a hotel in Japan one of the first thing one would look at is the size of the room since Japanese hotels are well known for their small rooms. The Okura did not disappoint \uff5e I took an entry level Superior room and it was over 400 sqft which in Japanese especially Tokyo standard is big. Elaborate courtesy exists in nearly everywhere one goes in Japan but it was at its epitome at the Okura. We did not arrive at the hotel till after midnight but were still greeted by a crew of five with an additional two helping with our luggage. Check in was fast efficient and ever so politely done. The decoration of my room was dated with all knobs and controls being manual rather than the modern all digital affair one finds in newer hotels but it was expected. The important thing was everything was spotlessly clean and tidy. The usual over the top heating found in Japanese cities in the Winter was of course found here. With the windows fixed shut and no cold air conditioning switch off the heat for a cooler room a card on the table proclaimed. I had to open the sliding shutters to create a draft to cool the room. Bathroom was basic but a decent sized bathtub was found which is rare in Japan. The Shiseido toiletries were plentiful and premium. Being on a lightning business trip I did not try out the facilities there is an indoor swimming pool nor the restaurants in the hotel but the supremacy of the Okura stood out when I asked the Concierge to book rebok and change my bookings at a couple of restaurants a few times and they were all done with efficiency and patience. ExcelentThe Main original building of the Okura is being rebuilt ATM and will reopen in 2019. This is one of the very few hotels that I actually would look forward to revisiting when the rebuilding is completed.
