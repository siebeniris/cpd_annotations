The ceilings in the parking garage were so low that our antenna drug across it the main driving lane was narrow and the corners were difficult to navigate in our truck.

We booked this hotel to begin our honeymoon and Route 66 adventure. On arrival we were told that they had overboked and we did not have a room. This was the case for at least 6 couples that arrived whilst I was checking in. It took them 90 mins to decide to tell me this all whilst my partner was driving around in circles waiting for info on where to park having been awake for over24 hours already so not exactly a safe thing to be doing. Then they eventually admitted the error and told us we had have to go to another hotel that they had sorted for us which was a 90 min drive away. They were to pay for taxi and the room which we accepted as we just needed a bed. In return to the uk we have discovered that we have been charged for the room and on emailing the Hilton they do not respond.

First let me start off by saying we are Hilton Grand Vacation Owners. That being said we booked this room at the last minute and could not get the Hilton Floor as there were only 3 rooms left so no big deal. Our room was nice and spacious view overlooking the swimming pool. The bathroom shelves were dusty and there was a dirty glass that had obviously been used gross and a new top was just put on it without cleaning. Parking cost is outrageous Hilton should offer a reduced prices for guests maybe that is not up the Hilton though. Staff were very pleasant as well with the exception of the housekeeping staff. Even with the privacy sign on our door we had two people knock on our door to clean it.

Our bathroom Bath shower was slow drain but I did not asked them to clean it since it was that important to me. I wish I had small fridge in the room for some food and drinks. Looks like there was one at one time since there is room in the cabinet next to TV. One hint if you are staying a few days want save on food and drinks there is grocery store named Bockwinkel next to hotel on Ohio St. The beds were very comfortable swimming pool was very clean and attractive.

Me and my wife stayed here during the 4th of July. The location was perfect and walking distance to the Navy Pier Millennium Park Buckingham Fountain and many restaurants. That is one of the primary reasons we booked here. As a Hilton Honors member when we check in at a Doubletree hotel we are offered cookies and bottled water. We did not get that initially when my wife checked in while I parked the car. The person who checked us in did not even worked at the front desk and probably explains why we did not get the usual cookies and bottled water. That person also did not give us the room I selected on the Hilton Honors ap and instead gave us a handicap room that did not have a bath tub. We had to go back downstairs and talk to someone who actually worked at the front desk to get this problem resolved. After speaking with someone regarding this matter the front desk person apologized and gave us an actual room similar to the one I had initially booked. We were also offered cookies and bottled water. We were also given breakfast vouchers for the incovenience and made things rightThe room was clean spacious room for a downtown Hilton hotel. The bed was very comfortable and slept well. The bathroom was clean but the shower lever was loose but worked. The parking was convenient and cheaper than the parking garage and open parking lot across the street. They also put a 75 hold on your credit card which was the first time that happened even as a Hilton Honors member staying at Hilton brand hotels in other major cities like Los Angeles San Diego Miami Pittsburgh and Washington DC. The pool area on the 5th floor was very nice and relaxing. It was nice that they had a bar serving drinks and chairs to relax. The one thing I did not like was the very slow elevators. During the busy 4th of July there were crowds of hotel guests waiting for the elevators and there were many in which some did not appear to be working. I would have rated this 45 but the process of checking in was not up to par as the other Hilton brand hotels we stayed at in the past. If you are looking for a good location within walking distance to tourist spots this would be the place to stay. I hope this Doubletree location work on training other staff members who do not work at the front desk and if that person that does not work at the front desk checks you in that person should not tell you that you need to talk to someone else that works at the front desk to resolve any issues.", "offset": [1299, 1401], "date": "2019-07-10", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "d5637336-44df-42c6-8d86-36e45f9e01df", "sentence": "Bachelor Party Weekend. Start with the location it \u2019s very good for Chicago standards you can pretty much walk to everything you need to get to downtown wise Gold coast Navy pier millennium Park and so on that \u2019s really not an issue it \u2019s also a very short Uber Lyft ride for most destinations as well. Check in was very simple go and give them your name and drivers license credit card the room was available as soon as we got there which was early considering check in was n\u2019t till 4 or 5 PM we arrived and were able to right to the room nice bonus. Room was set up reasonably well two queen beds decent looking view of downtown we requested an upper level room which was a 16 add on and we \u2019re on the 16th floor. I \u2019m not sure that \u2019s a justifiable thing I feel like people who did n\u2019t request a room higher up got the same room floor no matter what actually people in our party did and did not pay for the surcharge so I \u2019m not sure what the 16 is for. I would n\u2019t pay it since it \u2019s not worth it. You can probably complain At check in I get a higher floor not pay the fee. The bathroom was the Chicago bathroom sink toilet bathtub shower I will say the towels were not comfortable whatsoever they almost feel like sandpaper I know we \u2019re not paying for a five star hotel but the total should be better than that. The hotel itself is very nice Starbucks if you drink coffee small restaurant bar area did n\u2019t spend any time there since the weather was so nice in Chicago you were outside most of the time overall the lobby elevators all that was pretty much fine. I was a big fan of the rooftop pool until we were told we were not allowed to bring in outside food or drinks the fees to buy beer at the rooftop pool are quite ridiculous we were stopped from bringing a small yeti cooler and even though they were already 15 or 20 people and they \u2019re having picnics drinking champagne yeti coolers. Styrofoam coolers backpacks it was pretty ridiculous to be told we were in allowed to bring in some Miller lights when there was so many people doing it already for this I \u2019m not gon na point off the if the hotels have policy and follow it or do n\u2019t have the policy do n\u2019t enforce it 25 of the time. This was a huge disappointment for me. There was one family they had chips hummus pita chips I mean it was unbelievable the spread they had and we were told we were not allowed to bring in six Miller lights when they had three bottles of champagne that they pulled out of their cooler. Lastly in relation to the pool there were several young men personably not from the us wearing just white underwear in the pool again to each their own but I think there should be a proper attire is required sign and if they do n\u2019t follow it they \u2019re told to go put bathing suits on there had to be 25 kids around the pool at the same time it just was n\u2019t appropriate. I mention something to Security on the way out as well as one of the pool guys neither one of them did a single thing again another point off. Sorry but that \u2019s your JOB notMine. Finally I \u2019m not sure if I would stay here again for those reasons I think their policies need to be enforced or not enforced universally I also think the pool needs to be monitored more closely towels are also a situation where they kept running out and they started bringing in what would appear to be hand towels it was just ridiculous nothing was put together very well if they \u2019re busy or not again it \u2019s your hotel not mine.", "offset": [24, 302], "date": "2019-07-29", "cpt": "1", "category": "parking"}, {"id": 15, "uid": "f1f78b37-903c-415b-b648-effb1858f991", "sentence": "Stayed in this hotel for a four day visit to Chicago.
