First it is very expensive well over twice most high end non Disney hotels in the area and quite a bit more than Disneys other hotels. However. It is by far the most convenient hotel to any of the parks and since that is where the action is what you traveled hours to get to Downtown Disney. I did not think so. that ticks a lot of boxes. Walk back to your hotel room from either park in like 15 minutes. Check. Early entry. Check. Extra quick morning entrance to DCA. Check. Keeps you in that DIsney state of mind from check in to check out. Check. The rooms are pretty uniformly comfortable. Our last name is not Gates or Rockefeller and we do not travel with a large party so we stick to the regular sized not suite non concierge rooms. I think they really should separate out the park view from the pool view rooms as the pool view is not nearly as nice. They could probably charge more for the park views but not nearly as much for the pool views so this probably gives them an inventory management advantage. Anyway we usually wind up with two queen beds all very nice Craftsman looking furniture that really does have a higher end look and feel put up against most other hotels. The mattresses have always been comfortable and aside from not having XL sizes the robes are great. The two sinks outside the bathroom are a real plus. However. The bathrooms while ok are small and I do not want to spend long in the bathtub area as one might for a long soak after a long day in the parks. Also we have had reportable plumbing problems twice recently black water backing up into a sink and dripping noises from the sinks. The dripping noises are apparently notorious here and a tub can get stopped up anywhere but backing up into a sink is Bad News and the dripping when it happens is sleep depriving. Will we keep going back. Probably. Will we feel a ltle ok big twinge of guilt for spending so much. Probably.

We were told you can watch it from the courtyard between the two parks. We had about 2 hours to kill so we went into the hotel. OMG it is just gorgeous. They have it themed like a beautiful lodge in Northern California. The atrium is beautiful and open. You can walk through and visit the gift shop or the restrooms so nice. We sat by the fire and then visited the gift shop. Lots of nice Disney Merchandise without the parks crowds. We really wish were were staying there instead of the crap motel we chose.

I wanted to do a final family trip before the kids returned to school and for my youngests 5th birthday. I have three young daughters and the room was very spacious for a family of five. Initially was not planning to stay at the resort because I had free nights at another location. but my husband watched an episode of the Disney resorts available and he wanted to try this place. It was way out of my price range but we had gift cards to use. The main feature was the location close to Disneyland and California Adventures. There is an entrance from the hotel directly to California adventures which helped. And a few mornings we got to be inside the park before the general public and it was not the magic hour. So thankful we had the park hopper tickets. can not beat the location since it is next to the park. The hotel is older but very clean throughout the entire hotel. It almost gave the antique feeling. The lobby is beautiful espeicaly with the wood work. There is an evening turn down service but the timing was inconsistent. We did not get it done at times because we were taking a break in our room. We had the bunk bed trundle for the kids and they loved it. The beds were comfortable. The only nuisance was our wifi kept cutting out in our room. We had the downtown disney room and it was great. We could see the fireworks from our room. The marathon took place during the long weekend and I did wake up at 6 am to hear the crowd chearing on the runners. Night time action is busy and noisey but it did not bother us at all. There was someone performing music every evening and it was enjoyable to listen. The staff at lobby are extremely helpful and friendly. Check in was easy. Check out took a while because I had gift cards in canadian dollars and Tony attempted to get every dollar out of each gift card. The pools are great and I thought it would be less crowded because people would be at the parks. but no lol. The lounge chairs are amazingly comfortable that anyone can sleep easily. Lifeguards are on duty at all times. Even a toddler pool is available for the little ones. We only ate the storytellers cafe a couple times during our stay. For dinner we just ordered off the menu and saved money that way. We did the buffet breakfast and that cost more than our dinner. The main disappointment of their breakfast was the lack of options for the breakfast buffet considering what we paid but the characters present for the breakfast was quite fun for the kids. There is a snack shop by the pool for quick food items but still pricey. We did get a taxi on our first day to get some drinks alcohol and snacks. Wish we had bought more.

While you check in you may park in 20 minute parking then you have to park across the street at Downtown Disney about a 3 block walk. For this privilege you pay 20 a night.

Staff were generally polite but not really cheerful or happy. The guy who checked us in was great and gave a really personal service explaining all sorts of details about the park but the next day blanked us twice.

The room was very dark and did not feel special or luxurious which I was expecting for the amount it costAlso be careful when booking and paying substantially more for a room with a view of the park we got a view of the pool with the park in the distance behind trees. This is still classed as a premium view but really is not anything special. I love a room with a view and am happy to pay more for this but I genuinely would not bother paying the extra at the Grand Californian unles you are guaranteed one of the rooms literally overlooking the park it just is not worth it.

We have been to DL many times but this was our first stay at the Grand Californian. We selected this hotel as our twins are toddlers and proximity to the parks was worth the expense we thought. I travel for business and we have travelled internationally exetensively for pleasure so when I say this is a very average hotel I have good benchmarks. let us start with the decor. it is like a woodsy cottage with no Disney references at all. The material in room states it harkens back to early California. I suppose. I am not a California resident but I can assure you it does not remind me of California in any way. It also has no Disney characters or decor at all. King Arthurs log cabin. The rooms themselves are small and standard layout. For reference the Sheraton Park hotel a block away is larger. The recent renovations have removed the bathtubs. So if you are travelling with children they need to like showers. The beds in our room were very high to accommodate placing luggage underneath as there is no other place to put luggage. so you will have to be careful with children falling out of bed it is a big fall. Our room had flies. I do not mean a couple of flies. We arrived in room and went straight to bed and my wife said she felt a fly in the darkness. When we awoke the next morning and turned on the lights the entire ceiling was covered with mosquito sized insects. Hundreds if not thousands. I have never seen this many insects in a hotel room anywhere. I told the staff the next morning and they asked me if I had slept with the windows open. A it was 100 F so um NO. and B what if I did. Was there some sort of insect invitation hanging on the window. For the record the hotel did not apologize change our room or offer any compensation whatsoever. They sent a horticulturist who I assume vacuumed the insects off the ceiling. Pools in the hotel are nice. But the pools in most of the local hotels are nice and honestly if you are staying here you want the parks. Unles you are not interested in Disney you will not be spending much time in the pools there are pools everywhere in southern California. Service was ok but inconsistent. For example we got turndown service knocking on our door at 905 one night. Not bad if you stay up late but we have toddlers. They are in bed before 90Proximity to the parks is why we chose this hotel and it is great for the California Adventure side as the hotel has it is own entrance to the park. Please note that Magic Hour alternates between DL and DCA so the hotel access is advantageous every second day. The DL Magic Hour is the same as the other two DL Hotels line up at the regular entrance. As we went to both parks but really wanted to go to DL the whole proximity thing did not really work out for us. A footnote on the TV. Our kids wanted to watch the Disney channel like we do at home. The in room TV does have Disney and Disney Jr in standard definition. Seriously I have better TV at home. I paid well what I paid and the Disney channel was worse than my phone. Honestly. So price. No. Just no. In no way is this property worth what you will pay. It is a very average hotel in every aspect. If you want the Disney experience and the Disney access stay at the Disneyland Hotel Goofys Kitchen is great and Mickeys Surf breakfast is at the Paradise Pier anyway.

We recently attended a 2 day event at Disneyland and I FINALLY got to stay on property. Since we live in San Diego it never made sense to stay overnight. This trip we spent two nights at Disneys Grand Californian Hotel Spa while we were visiting Disneyland and California Adventure. Driving onto the property we were greeted by a guard and a barrier. We were asked our names and welcomed. Valet was prompt and courteous and also welcomed us. We glided through the stained glass doors to a very smooth check in process. A cast member immediately greeted us welcomed and asked our names. We were whisked to another cast member who greeted us by name and directed us to an awaiting cast member for check in. Because of the ongoing construction renovations we were upgraded to a newly renovated Full View Room 5346 on the fifth floor. Thanks to TripAdvisor and an email from the Grand Californian we knew the hotel was undergoing renovations. After checking out the newly renovated GORGEOUS lobby we followed the directions from the front desk to our room. You have to exit the lobby and walk past the restaurants to get to the elevators which were definitely under renovation. Exiting the elevator we met a security guard who informed us he was always present anytime construction workers are on the guest floors We never heard any construction noiseWe could smell the fresh paint and the carpet was definitely brand new. The hallways are creepy \u2013 straight out of The Shining. Immediately off the elevator lobby is a sitting area with chairs and a sofa. Upon entering our room we found a connecting door to the neighboring room. I called the service hotline and talked to a nice cast member who did a search for a non adjoining room. Since the property was sold out he did find a non adjoining room but on the second floor. We decided to stay on the fifth floor and W never heard any noise from our neighbors. I also asked for a box fan and again was told they may have loaned them all out but he would see what he could do. Later that evening I was surprised to find a box fan in our room. Got ta have that white noiseRom 5346 was recently renovated compare the pics I added with the Disneyland Grand Californian \u2019s web site \u2019s room pics. There are USB outlets all over the room and the lights can be dimmed or turned off from several locations in the room. The two queen sized beds were super comfortable and the new raised beds gave ample room for luggage storage underneath. WARNING. the raised wooden bed frames have sharp corners and WILL DEFINITELY FIND YOUR SHINS. Disney needs to rethink these sharp cornered bed frames. There is a large 70 inch TV which we never turned on. Our balcony had two chairs and a small table with a view over the pools and looking left over the trees we could see parts of World of Color in the evenings. There is little to no privacy between balconies. You can literally see into your neighbor \u2019s room. There was nightly turn down service room refresh and we always found the room freshly attended when we dragged our tired bodies back to our room to pass out. We were barely in our room and when we were we passed out from exhaustion. Room 5346 has new marble counters a Keurig coffee tea maker wine mini fridge and assorted Starbucks Keurig cups. The bathroom was gorgeously designed with high end Kohler sinks a dimable LED lit mirror and walk in shower with rain shower head hand held shower attachment. The bathroom foyer has a double vanity sink with lots of room but a smallish shelf and top notch toiletries. The best benefit of staying at the Disneys Grand Californian Hotel Spa is you can go through security at the hotel exits which speeds up the process of entering California Adventure and Downtown Disney. We were able to ride Grizzly River Run get soaking wet go back to our room quickly change and return to the park. With Downtown Disney now inside the security zone guests should feel a bit safer. Off the lobby there is a large veranda with comfortable chairs rocking chairs and sofas with bar service from the Hearthstone Lounge. Jodin and John were our very super attentive servers. We enjoyed some great adult beverages especially the Poisoned Apple Martini. Later in the evening we had dinner in the Storyteller Cafe. Ray was a great host and quite funny. Leaving us laughing he turned us over to our great server Richard. Here is a recommendation. DON\u2019T EAT THE BUFFET AND RIDE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. WHEW I \u2019m just saying. Sadly we had to leave and return home to San Diego. We found our room invoice on the door as we were leaving. Walking down the creepy hallway towards the elevator the sitting area off the elevator lobby was host to about a dozen loudly chatting kids aged \u201c between \u201d 10 15. Refer back to my hallway noise comment above. At the Valet we noticed a security guard with a dog. We had seen these two several times during our stay in the lobby and walking the hallways. I feel security at the Grand Californian Hotel Spa is a big deal. Bottom Line What you are really paying for is location location location. Grand Californian Hotel Spa is the closest hotel to the Disneyland entrance. Being this close to the both parks makes a huge difference. In the past to save money we have stayed at hotels off property versus staying on property. This trip we learned while on site we did more at the parks and did n\u2019t have to deal with leaving early to beat the traffic home. Having our hotel so close by meant short breaks in the room before returning for the evening the ability to return to our room for a change if wet etc \u2014 was very handy. Pros. The Grand Californian Hotel Spa is a gorgeous property. The rooms were super clean and comfortable although very cookie cutter. Also the direct access to California AdventureCons. You can hear EVERYTHING from the hallways directly through your room \u2019s door. Not to mention the room \u2019s foyer is engineered wood flooring that helps to reflect transmit all that hallway noise into your room. Additionally there is no privacy between balconies. There is no divider and you can literally see the entire balcony and into your neighbor \u2019s romI would definitely stay at the Grand Californian Hotel Spa again.", "offset": [1493, 1569], "date": "2017-10-13", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 14, "uid": "4772b439-e886-4c27-97e4-6c8356a0bc8c", "sentence": "Disney Magic at work for the most part. They are just completing all remodeling but we did not have any interruption to our vacation rooms lobby and pools are complete we were told. We received a remodeled room 5246 that looked out over California adventure right at the Feris Wheel and could see the World of Color from our deck. It is right behind Goofys Sky School but that was closed for refurbishment so I do not know if that would make a difference in noise level. For our stay with the sliding glass door shut you could not hear a thing. Comfortable beds but they are tall a small step that could slide under the bed would have been helpful. Showers are nice and accessible. Fitness Center is fine treadmills weights but not an concern for us since we were at the parks walking all day everyday. Gift shop on site has a variety of memorabilia and can be a quick stop for a water. Pools are nice crowded for us as the weather was in the mid 90s during our stay. I was a little confused by the security as they say access is only for guests at the Grand Californian hotel but I found that not to be accurate. Everyday there was a large volume of people coming through the lobby and lines from other hotels you were never asked to show that you were staying at the Grand Californian with room key etc. so the lines were long coming going. That was a little frustrating as we paid the extra money for this hotel for that accessibility. Napa Rose was a nice dinner staff is attentive and knowledgeable would have liked some additional entr\u00e9e choices. The parks are wonderful as always if you bring you patience with the heat and the crowds for the Halloween decorations and events. Maxpas is helpful on the busy weekend days in Disneyland. The Frozen show was great and a nice air conditioned break. We had some travelers with accessibility and size issues and all were really accommodated well and there were no issues.

Prior to going on our 7th Disney cruise leaving San Diego for a week along the Mexican Riviera my wife and I decided to spend a few days at Disneyland. We honeymooned at Disneyland 35 years ago and since we were going to be in the neighborhood my wife wanted to visit to see if anything had changed in that time. did not seem like an unreasonable request and since it was her birthday why not splurge a bit. We booked three nights at the Disney Grand Californian. we are frequent visitors to Walt Disney World and very familiar with the numerous Disney resorts in Florida so we were comfortable in knowing that GC would certainly offer the same quality of service Disney is well known for. The hotel is quite beautiful. Upon arrival you can see why it is the jewel in the crown of the Disneyland resort hotels. As you enter the gates the building is very impressive designed in what is called the Californian craftsman style that incorporates a bit of that Northern California outdoorsy look into the buildings facade. The bell staff upon arrival is immaculately dressed Disney friendly and extremely helpful as they guide you to the hotels main entrance which at first looks like a solid red wooden wall which slowly opens upon your approach to reveal a beautiful high ceiling entrance hall bathed in a subdued light to enhance to outdoorsy theme I suspect. it is quite similar to Animal Kingdom Lodge in Orlando. The GC lobby like AKL simply takes your breath away. It has ample sitting area a small gift shop and bar off to the side as well as a stone fire place with a roaring natural gas fire off a side alcove complete with leather comfy chairs. Its the perfect place to unwind with a cocktail before retiring for the night. The check in process is absolutely flawless with that wonderful Disney be our guest flair. The hotel is very large and after check in it seemed like we had to take about a 5 minute walk through a beautiful brezeway that ran parallel to the pool area as we made our way to our room. Our room overlooked Disneys California Adventure Park and with such close proximity to the park some may worry that the noise level may not be to their liking. We found this not to be the case as strategic landscaping and other elements made certain that noise would not be a negative factor. There are numerous activities throughout the hotel to take advantage of if you decide to take a few hours rest from the parks. The pool area is exceptional numerous restaurants from the very tony Napa Rose to the more relaxed Storytellers Cafe or the polside Whitewater Cafe contain a wide variety of menu offerings. The Hearthstone Lounge is a very relaxing bar just off the main lobby that has minimal draft beer choices only 3 but a wide variety of bottled craft beers and craft cocktails. Its a great place to relax after a long day in the parks. Access to the parks is just a short walk away. there is direct access to California Adventure Park which takes you to the Grizzly Peak area of the park or one can walk through the lobby to access Downtown Disney to get to the main entrances of both Disneyland and California Adventure Parks. While the monorail runs through the hotel complex there is no monorail stop. There are only two monorail stops one at Downtown Disney or Tomorowland at the Magic Kingdom. Both stops require riders to have a park ticket. The aesthetics exceptional Disney customer service location to the parks and Downtown Disney and superior services make the Grand Californian an exceptional hotel. But While I found this hotel to be five star in every way after about the second day I began to ask the question beyond the aesthetics and service what was so great about shelling out 500 per night for this hotel. it is easy to be seduced by the Disney magic and forget that you are paying top dollar for what boils down to be a place to sleep and shower. nothing more. Our room while comfortable and nicely decorated was not overly luxurious. I was simply a room with two queen beds and a small couch. The bathroom was very nice split into two sections with a dual sink next to the toilet shower room that was divided by a very attractive wooden sliding door stocked with Disney H20 bath products. There are few amenities a single cup Keurig coffee maker a small refrigerator bathrobes and no microwave. I would expect for 500 per night that a modest continental breakfast would be offered or at least complimentary coffee water refreshment station would be available to guest in the lobby but no. Guests can get access to special events in the park that may have sold out to the public such as Mickeys Not So Scary Halloween Party or extra magic park hours but little more. I realize that Disney markets its resorts primarily to Disney Vacation Club members and being very familiar with this and its perks I noticed that there were very little extra incentives even for them. Now in all fairness one could get some of the above mentioned amenities for a price. If you were willing to pay if memory serves me well about 300 extra for the duration of your stay you had be granted access to a concierge type lounge which incidentally was undergoing renovation at the time of our stay and was relocated in a small corner alcove just off the main lobby which served coffee infused water and some light snacks. Considering that I just dropped about 150 for a 3 night stay I thought this was a bit over the top. If I were a DVC member who pay a significant amount of money annually for resort maintenance I had be a bit put off by this. When we left Grand Californian for our cruise in San Diego we stayed in a Springhil Suites which was downtown on the waterfront directly across the street from where we would meet the ship. The room was nicer larger offered a very generous and high quality continental breakfast with coffee and infused water in the lobby all for a little more than half the price of the Grand Californian. Makes me wonder if Disney is just asking these prices because they can. The restaurants at the Grand Californian are top notch they are also top dollar. Dinner at the Napa Rose which included a few glasses of wine an appetizer and two entrees. with no dessert cost about 180 for two. The Storytellers Cafe which is described as per adult and Whitewater Cafes which are described as per adult were more accurately and respectively. There are discounts for annual pass holders but I would assume that is most likely a typical 10 reduction which is okay but not a significant discount based on overall price and value. There are actually better food values similar in quality to the hotel in the parks. The Hearthstone Lounge is a really great bar cafe where drink prices are reasonable and comparable in price to other 5 star type hotels restaurants. Having completed 7 cruises with Disney Cruise Line and comparing them with our stay at Grand Californian the cruise line which many veteran cruisers of other cruise lines criticize for being more expensive than most large carrier lines is a far better value for the cost. While prices vary based upon time of year and itineraries our 7 night Disney cruise cost us about 473 per day for two adults. With that you get a room that was a similar layout to our room at the Grand Californian though about half the size that includes a veranda. There are numerous activities included from first run movies kids clubs Broadway style shows and entertainment to seemingly unlimited opportunities to interact with Disney characters. Meals are also part of the package offering everything from large buffets quick snacks and a bit more structured dinner service where you will rotate each evening to one of the three onboard dining rooms where your wait staff who serves you each night of the cruise will accompany you. Room service is free with the exception of providing the server with a gratuity. And you get to travel a bit as well as taking advantage of Disneys private island Castaway Cay in the Bahamas if you happen to be sailing most Caribbean itineraries. I know it is not completely fair to compare DCL to a Disney Resort as they both offer a different service combined with the realization that the So. Cal area cost of living is a bit above the national average might be adequate explanation for the cost. I do not mind paying a fair price for quality good work is not cheap and cheap work is not good. The entertainment business is like any other doing its best to compete for those finite amount of consumer dollars Disney is no exception. They offer a superior product and one of their business philosophies is to keep the guest on property so they do not spend those dollars with the competition. I have no problem with that. But as a value conscious consumer I have to once again ask the question what is the benefit to staying at Grand Californian. I sum it up in three words LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. Nothing more. You can literally walk out the front door into the Disney parks. You can go to the parks for a few hours walk back to your hotel to relax by the pool or catch a nap before venturing out again. Tired of the parks. Go to Downtown Disney for change of pace all within walking distance. You can park your car and forget about it until its time to go home. Everything you need is practically at your fingertips but be forewarned this convenience comes with a hefty price tag. Our dinner companions on the cruise four of whom were Californians who made very comfortable livings were talking one evening about Disneyland. They enjoyed going with their families once or twice a year one couple were actually DVC members but when one brought up the subject of staying at a Disneyland resort they all concluded that a stay at Grand Californian was not an option. They liked the location convenience but each concluded that Grand Californian was out of their price range that better value could be had at other Disneyland hotels or even better off property lodging. So bottom line if money is no object and you want to splurge do it. Its a once in a lifetime memory. Just keep in mind that for all its glamor and hype you re going to need a very full wallet for what amounts to simply a convenient location.", "offset": [1466, 1518], "date": "2017-10-24", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 16, "uid": "e13cf16f-758a-445d-83a2-64ead44ef8e4", "sentence": "Disney Has You Captured. My husband and I stayed here to attend a gala being held in the hotel. We have stayed here before and have enjoyed the amenities even though it is very expensive. Because we booked the hotel so late the only rooms available were premium rooms which of course were even more outrageously costly than the already expensive standard rooms. I requested to have a room with a King bed but when we checked in we were told they only had a room with two queen beds. This happened to us on our last visit here too. Very disappointing. This was our first time staying in a premium room and was very disappointed in that it was no different than the standard rooms we had stayed in before. The only difference was that we overlooked the California Adventure park. Big deal. So we paid and extra 250 a night for that. I must admit that the queen beds were comfortable which actually is very important since we have stayed at hotels with beds that literally gave us backaches because they were so horrible but to be charged for a Premium room which does not give you a bigger room but only a view of the theme park is pretty bogus in my opinionI was reading the review of someone who posted two days ago and I had to agree with everything they said as we experienced basically the same things. They posted that they were disappointed that the only breakfast option was the Storytellers Cafe which is basically true if you want to eat in the hotel but we went to Downtown Disney and had breakfast at La Brea Bakery which was very good so it is too bad they did not know about that and actually many of the restaurants in Downtown Disney serve breakfast. And another little secret is that at the White Waters Snacks located in the hotel you can get some hot casual food for a more inexpensive option. Our shower did not drain well so you had to stand in the soapy water while you showered. We were fine with our air conditioning. We did not need to change it. It was set at 65 degrees and that was good for us we did not even try to change itWe went to the pool. Yes they asked to see our room keys and they put a green band on our arm. I was impressed when going to the pool restroom in how clean and comfortable it was. it is nice to have a restroom that clean and orderly by the polOveral staying at the Grand Californian Hotel is in the best location if you are going to stay at Disneyland in my opinion. I love that they have a pianist playing in the lobby and I will sit and listen while they play for 30 minutes. They do seem to have the air conditioning going full blast and it is quite chilly while sitting in the lobby. Sitting by the fire even if not right in front of the fire but just by that room is helpful to take off the chill. I also liked that when they turned down the bed we were given milk chocolate. Last time we stayed we got dark chocolate which was not nearly as tastyThey are doing remodeling right now of the hotel so that made for some inconveniences but it was not too bad but when you are paying top dollar you look at everything more closely since you are paying to have the best of everything offered to you. Bottom line is that you are captive when staying at Disney as you do not have many options if you want to stay on Disney property. Next time we may try the Disneyland Hotel or other hotel but truthfully we love the location of the Grand Californian. That is how they get you. Just be prepared to spend lots of. I hope they do improve the staff and hotel to make it a better experience such as having room requests honored make more rooms with King beds vs the two queen beds making Premium rooms really Premium and not just charge because you can see into the Theme park and keep the showers and other amenities in proper working order. Disney has the reputation of keeping their customers happy let us hope they work to do that with the customers who stay at the Grand Californian.", "offset": [96, 187], "date": "2017-10-30", "cpt": "1", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 17, "uid": "5ddeac3f-cbec-4993-b719-dd93be1696bd", "sentence": "Actually stayed at the Disneyland Hotel this time but always use the Grand Californian for the park entrance the lobby for relaxing and just generally taking in the architecture and ambiance.", "offset": [0, 191], "date": "2017-11-28", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 18, "uid": "1333914f-6217-4be3-99ab-c0b5c5e07dd6", "sentence": "Newly Renovated Beautiful property. The Grand Californian just finished being renovated and the rooms are beautiful. I had say this hotel is great for twens adults. While the room does provide a stool for little ones to reach the sinks and now two sinks the beds are rather tall to get into and there is no bathtub at least not in our room. They made the rooms great for the convenience of plugging in multiple devices I think we counted 12 usb plugs and at least 6 regular so you can charge anything with a ton of counter space. A small refrigerator is also available and a pod coffee tea machine. There are multiple pols our girls used 2 of them often they are heated but one was warmer than the other but they still loved the slide in the cooler pool. Chairs etc are plush and comfy. The Hotel itself is beautiful lots of front lobby staff so do not let the long check in line worry you it is relatively quick. There is a very large lobby and a nice bar. Ask the bellhop where the easiest entrances and elevators are to get to the parks our bellhop gave us great tips on how to get to where we needed to goit is a rather large hotel and has an entrance to Downtown Disney and a direct entry to California Adventure. We used the CA entry often the line was usually shorter and sometimes it was easier to walk through CA and out to go to Magic Kingdom. The lines during magic hour do get very long. Be prepared to wait and go early they do move you quickly through but word of advice pack everything you need in clear plastic bags in your bag. They have to look through everything and are not allowed to unzip it takes time to unzip everything so clear bags work like a charm. You get searched every time you enter Disney property not each time you enter the parks through the normal main entrance so you can parkhop with out being searched. We used the Disneyland express bus to get there from the airport and it was very easy Once again the bellhops gave us tips on where to wait and which bus just to make sure we got on the correct one. The reason for 4 stars is if you do have a little one a tub would be nice and the beds being very tall. They had bunkbeds before and now they are gone so now kids share a bed. Also there was a kids club and I believe that is gone too. Our room was really nice and on a corner but directly across from the service entrance so every morning at 7 am and night at 10 pm we heard them open close up. Also directly above us was the club level and one night they rearranged something so needless to say we heard a lot of noise past 11 pm. We did have a beautiful view of the pools and on the 5th floor we could see part of the parks. Overall the hotel is beautiful and the direct access to the parks is a great point for us.", "offset": [2277, 2436], "date": "2018-01-05", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 19, "uid": "9180c492-6764-4a91-8009-9ab8491ec9fd", "sentence": "The Cost of the Convenience of Walking Directly Into the Park Is Worth It. We stayed at the Grand Californian for our honeymoon in March 2018 during California Adventures Food and Wine Festival. Hotel Indigo is our go to spot but we wanted to make this trip special so we decided to splurge for the Grand Californian. We only stayed two nights Saturday and Sunday and our room each night was in excess of 600. Just writing that gives me chills. We could have stayed at Hotel Indigo during the off season for 4 days for the price of 2 days at the Grand Californian. Granted we could have stayed at Paradise Pier or the Disneyland Hotel but the purpose of staying at the Grand Californian was to have easy access to the parks. We arrived at the hotel from the airport via Lyft. The Lyft ride from John Wayne Airport was relatively quick. We debated with renting a car however we were glad we did not as it cost aprox. 100 to valet your car. WOWWalking into the lobby of this hotel is an experience in itself. If you have ever stayed at a national park lodge the lobby of this hotel is reminiscent of that experience but on a grander scale. We arrived at the hotel on a Saturday around noon and were surprised that our room was ready. We booked the hotel through Dreams Unlimited Travel as their rate was a bit cheaper than we could get on our own direct through Disney. Because we went through a travel agent we got some freebies like a lanyard with starter pins and a discount to ESPN zone. Ultimately we did not take advantage of those discounts as we are not into the pins and prefer to spend our time in the parks as opposed to Downtown Disney. At reception we received a specialized honeymoon pin and congratulations on getting married pin. We thought the specialized honeymoon pin was a nice touch. We also were upgraded to a courtyard view. Our room was on the third floor and quite a hike from the main lobby. When I say quite a hike it took at least 3 long hallways to get to our room. In the end we liked staying so far away from the hustle and bustle of the parks but for the price of the room we felt like the walk to the room should not have taken so long. The room itself was one of the nicer rooms we have stayed in. We were surprised with the lack of Disney logos in the room. In the bathroom the wallpaper appeared to have hidden Mickey ears and Chip and Dale in the banner. My wife also noticed that the shower curtain appeared to be a scene from Bambi. Frankly I only noticed Chip and Dale. Nevertheless we were a bit disappointed with the lack of theming considering we were staying on property. We had a view of the monorail from our room and it was so quiet that you would not even know it is there if you did not open your patio door. We have never been back to our room until the end of the night when staying at Hotel Indigo. At this hotel we went back to our room 3 times just in one day. If you have kids this hotel is a game changer. Imagine a short trot to your room instead of a marathon. It was too cold for us to take advantage of the pool but it is a nice size and has a waterslide. The entrance to the park from the hotel is near Grizzly River Rapids and we ran into some teenagers who were brave enough to ride the rapids 5 times consecutively then run into the hotel and change. In the summer the prospect of not having to walking around California Adventure soaking wet sounds amazing. Security was much lighter than coming in through the main gates and the line was never long into California Adventure. That being said my wife found the security to be much more thorough in checking her purse than normal. it is not clear if that is because of the smaller entrance or because Disney has stepped up their security throughout the resort. I would be remiss to fail to mention a magical moment we experienced with a member of the housekeeping staff. On Sunday afternoon we came back to the room and my wife noticed that a housekeeper was providing turndown service to another room. Within earshot of the housekeeper my wife mentioned that she hoped we would still get turndown service and that she really liked the Ghirardeli chocolates they provided. When we returned to our room later in the evening not only did we get turndown service but we were provided 2 Ghirardeli chocolates each. it is the little things like this that make this hotel special. At the end of our stay we were going to Universal Studios Hollywood for the day and then on to Europe to continue our honeymoon. Because of the duration of our trip we were unable to take any gifts with us. Nevertheless the hotel provides a UPS service which allows you to ship things home or wherever you had like. This was a nice touch and allowed us to get gifts for friends and relatives without having to lug them around Europe. Is it really worth it for over 10 for 2 days. My checkbook currently says No. However after not having visited Disneyland in over a year we found this trip to be so much more relaxing because of the proximity of our hotel to the parks. With a price point over 60 a night this hotel is essentially limited to special occasions and will limit most peoples ability to regularly visit Disneyland. For us it is worth it to go to the parks less and enjoy the convenience the Grand Californian provides. That being said we did feel like being a guest of the Grand Californian should come with some more perks. Essentially all you get is the right to enter the park early. For those of us looking to relax that means nothing. Maxpas does not work from the hotel and that was frustrating considering that we are staying on property right next to the park.", "offset": [1916, 1992], "date": "2018-04-08", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}, {"id": 20, "uid": "d1234ec3-d365-4dd7-96ad-812261b8a68b", "sentence": "Wonderful location. We actually travelled December 2016 but TripAdvisor does not have that as an option. We have stayed at this hotel twice now and absolutely love it. I agree that the rooms are seriously in need of an update and I believe that has now happened but there is almost no price that you can put on the convenience offered to you by this resort. Although we did not use the private entrance for early morning access to the park as we found it quicker to go around to the main entry we used this throughout the day to come and go from the parks. It was actually quicker to go from Disneyland through into California Adventure and then into our hotel rather than walking through Downtown Disney. The staff were wonderful service was terrific and the lobby is breathtaking. Yes you can stay at cheaper hotels I know. But Disneyland is a huge place and it takes no small effort to get there from Australia. You walk miles at both parks and it was just fantastic to take a break in the hotel room have a coffee a snack and then back into the action of Disney. We booked rooms with a park view.

Not Worth 350 a Night Look for Deals. I stayed at the Disney Grand Californian Hotel Spa for 5 days and let me tell you that this is a decent hotel beautiful lobby decent customer service and nice amenities. Would I pay 4060 a night. Absolutely not. Given it is location is an amenity I would probably tap out at 350 night. I get that it is Disney and there is a mark up for this but this is an extreme. Given this said I will go through Pros and Cons for families wishing to stay here as this may be helpful to folks considering the splurge. PROS. Close to park has park access easy to get to Downtown Disney. nice customer service with daily turn down services they stop by each night and plenty of space to have kids running around adult areas to sit as well as decent restaurants. There is plenty of kid areas little lounge chairs movies and of course Disney employees available to help wherever you turn. For moms families with little kids this is great if you do not want the hassle of driving to another hotel ofsite especially with finicky little ones sometimes that makes all the difference. Make sure you attend the 1hour Disney Vacations timeshare tour as you get 50 to use in Disney stores might as well get some of your money back no real pressure like typical timeshare presentations. If you still want to go despite the prices go in the off seasons such as January as there is less people there and much much shorter lines. trust me you will remember this if you go otherwise. CONS. E X P E N S I V E. You are really just paying for the location and convenience to enter the Grand Californian park and Downtown Disney. that is it. I have traveled all over the world and this hotel is the equivalent to a 3 35 star hotel. The fanciest items inside my room were the Disney soap and step stool everything else is what you would find at a typical 3 star hotel. Sure it was clean with daily housekeeping but you would get that anywhere. The beds were also a little hard on my back which is not usually the case with me other places. there is nothing really special other than the location and nicer lobby customer areas. Would I pay 4060 night. No way. I would instead book a hotel across the street and save the cash to buy my kids an actual experience with Disney characters as I am sure they would much more appreciate that with memories to last. For Folks Without Kids because those people go to Disneyland too. This hotel is just for convenience location and proximity to park. Great high end restaurants such as Napa Rose with an eccentric menu to say the least still worth a try. The restaurants in downtown Disney are nice such as Steak 55 make reservations or else.", "offset": [2057, 2144], "date": "2020-02-06", "cpt": "2", "category": "facility"}]}
